       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During a Labor Day picnic at Malibu Creek State Park in California, an American family experienced a terrifying ordeal when a mountain lion attacked their 5-year-old son. The father's courageous actions brought the situation under control, preventing a potentially fatal disaster. He valiantly fought off the vicious predator, saving his young child.</p>

<p>According to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/mountain-lion-attacks-5-year-old-boy-at-malibu-creek-state-park/"><em>KTLA5, </em></a>The heart-pounding encounter took place just before 4:30 p.m. Sunday, as the boy's family was relaxing at the Tapia Day Use Area of the Malibu State Creek Park in Calabasas, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office said. At least six adults and several children were at the picnic when a mountain lion grabbed the 5-year-old boy by the head and started to run.</p>

<p>The victim's aunt, who did not want to be identified, spoke to <em>KTLA's</em> correspondent about the incident by phone. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"Somebody screamed the baby's name, and his dad started running," she explained. "The father grabbed the mountain lion with his hands, and he just fought. Then the mountain lion let go." &nbsp;</p>

<p>About 40 people in the immediate vicinity witnessed the dangerous incident, some even telling<em> KTLA</em> that the large mountain lion appeared brazen and unafraid during the attack. &nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/visit/know-before-you-go/mountain-lions#:~:text=Mountain%20lion%20facts,level%20to%2010%2C000%2Dfoot%20elevations.">US Department of Agriculture</a>, the mountain lion is also known as cougar, panther, or puma. May be more than 8 feet long (from the tip of the nose to the tip of the tail) and can weigh between 130 and 150 pounds. Mountain lions can be found in deserts as well as coastal forests, and from sea level to 10,000-foot elevations. An adult male's home range is typically more than 100 square miles, and females generally use smaller areas, approximately 20 to 60 square miles.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A systematic review into the potential health effects from radio wave exposure has shown mobile phones are not linked to brain cancer. The review was commissioned by the World Health Organization and is published today.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">A systematic review into the potential health effects from radio wave exposure has shown mobile phones are not linked to brain cancer. The review was commissioned by the World Health Organization and is published today in the journal Environment International.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>Mobile phones are often held against the head during use. And they emit radio waves, a type of <a href="https://www.arpansa.gov.au/understanding-radiation/what-radiation/what-non-ionising-radiation">non-ionising radiation</a>. These two factors are largely why the idea mobile phones might cause brain cancer emerged in the first place.</p>

<p>The possibility that mobile phones might cause cancer has been a long-standing concern. Mobile phones – and wireless tech more broadly – are a major part of our daily lives. So it's been vital for science to address the safety of radio wave exposure from these devices.</p>

<p>Over the years, the scientific consensus has remained strong – there's no association between mobile phone radio waves and brain cancer, or health more generally.</p>

<h3><strong>Radiation as a possible carcinogen</strong></h3>

<p>Despite the consensus, occasional research studies have been published that suggest the possibility of harm.</p>

<p>In 2011, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified <a href="https://www.iarc.who.int/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pr208_E.pdf">radio wave exposure as a possible carcinogen to humans</a>. The meaning of this classification was largely misunderstood and led to some increase in concern.</p>

<p>IARC is part of the World Health Organization. Its classification of radio waves as a possible carcinogen was largely based on limited evidence from human observational studies. Also known as epidemiological studies, they observe the rate of disease and how it may be caused in human populations.</p>

<p>Observational studies are the best tool researchers have to investigate long-term health effects in humans, but the results can often be biased.</p>

<p>The IARC classification relied on previous observational studies where people with brain cancer reported they used a mobile phone more than they actually did. One example of this is known as <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/39/3/675/631387?login=false">the INTERPHONE study</a>.</p>

<p>This new systematic review of human observational studies is based on a much larger data set compared to what the IARC examined in 2011.</p>

<p>It includes more recent and more comprehensive studies. This means we can now be more confident that exposure to radio waves from mobile phones or wireless technologies is not associated with an increased risk of brain cancer.</p>

<h3><strong>No association</strong></h3>

<p>The new review forms part of a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/special-issue/109J1SL7CXT">series of systematic reviews</a> commissioned by the World Health Organization to look more closely at possible health effects associated with exposure to radio waves.</p>

<p>This systematic review provides the strongest evidence to date that radio waves from wireless technologies are not a hazard to human health.</p>

<p>It is the most comprehensive review on this topic – it considered more than 5,000 studies, of which 63, published between 1994 and 2022, were included in the final analysis. The main reason studies were excluded was that they were not actually relevant; this is very normal with search results from systematic reviews.</p>

<p>No association between mobile phone use and brain cancer, or any other head or neck cancer, was found.</p>

<p>There was also no association with cancer if a person used a mobile phone for ten or more years (prolonged use). How often they used it – either based on the number of calls or the time spent on the phone – also didn't make a difference.</p>

<p>Importantly, these findings align with <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/12/e024489.full">previous research</a>. It shows that, although the use of wireless technologies has massively increased in the past few decades, there has been no rise in the incidence of brain cancers.</p>

<h3><strong>A good thing</strong></h3>

<p>Overall, the results are very reassuring. They mean that our <a href="https://www.arpansa.gov.au/regulation-and-licensing/regulatory-publications/radiation-protection-series/codes-and-standards/rpss-1">national</a> and <a href="https://www.icnirp.org/en/publications/article/rf-guidelines-2020.html">international</a> safety limits are protective. Mobile phones emit low-level radio waves below these safety limits, and there is no evidence exposure to these has an impact on human health.</p>

<p>Despite this, it is important that research continues. Technology is developing at a rapid pace. With this development comes the use of radio waves in different ways using different frequencies. It is therefore essential that science continues to ensure radio wave exposure from these technologies remains safe.</p>

<p>The challenge we now face is making sure this new research counteracts the persistent misconceptions and misinformation out there regarding mobile phones and brain cancer.</p>

<p>There remains no evidence of any established health effects from exposures related to mobile phones, and that is a good thing.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/qqvetf6g_brunei_625x300_04_September_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Brunei, a tiny yet relatively new nation, holds a wealth of records and a lengthy list of&nbsp;landmarks. From the ruler's long and elaborate official name—Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzaddin Waddaulah ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Haji Omar ‘Ali Saifuddien Sa'adul Khairi Waddien—to his claim as one of the wealthiest rulers and the world's longest-reigning monarch, Brunei consistently makes its mark in the record books. However, this former British protectorate, which gained full independence in 1984, is more than its oil riches and opulence.</p>

<h2><strong>Bonded Through Language and History</strong></h2>

<p>The country is officially known as Negara Brunei Darussalam in its official language, Malay, or Bahasa Melayu. The Malay term “Bahasa” originates from the Sanskrit word “bhasha”, meaning language, while “Negara” is derived from the Sanskrit word “Nagara/Nagari”, meaning city. Brunei's capital, Bandar Seri Begawan, was renamed in 1970 from its previous name, Bandar Brunei, to honour the country's former ruler, Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III, whose name draws from the Sanskrit term “Shri Bhagwan”, meaning Lord Almighty or ‘the Blessed One'.</p>

<p>Over a century ago, a historical connection to India emerged when British soldier and sojourner James Brooke, born in Bandel, West Bengal, was granted a significant portion of Brunei's territory in 1841 by Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin II for quelling a rebellion. Brooke later received the title of Rajah—derived from the Sanskrit word for King—of Sarawak, now a state in Malaysia, and became known as the White Rajah.</p>

<h2><strong>Not-So-Proactive Engagement</strong></h2>

<p>During my recent visit to Bandar Seri Begawan, particularly at the Royal Regalia Museum in the heart of the capital, I spotted a photograph of an Indian teacher dressed in a saree. The image featured the current ruler from his student days at Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien College in 1964. Surprisingly, amidst the museum's glittering collection of royal regalia—showcasing exquisite state gifts from several heads of state and top ministers from countries like China, Singapore, Thailand, Pakistan, Ukraine, and the USA—the Indian gift was attributed to a former Indian High Commissioner and not a minister.</p>

<h2><strong>PM's Historic Visit</strong></h2>

<p>Linguistically and historically, Brunei and India share a long-standing connection. However, their geopolitical relations require a boost, particularly as India aims to enhance its role in the Indo-Pacific region. Notably, no Indian Prime Minister had visited Brunei for a bilateral discussion before Narendra Modi embarked on a trip as part of his proactive Act East policy. Although Brunei's Sandhurst-educated Sultan has made four visits to India since the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1984, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was the only Indian leader to visit Brunei for two back-to-back multilateral events—the 11th ASEAN-India Summit and the 8th East Asia Summit—held in Bandar Seri Begawan in October 2013. The transition from the earlier Look East policy to a more active Act East policy began after Modi took office in 2014, leading to the first-ever high-level bilateral visit to Brunei by President Hamid Ansari in 2016.</p>

<h2><strong>Oil-Driven Economic Partnerships</strong></h2>

<p>Brunei boasts a high-income, oil-rich economy. Despite the pandemic's temporary stagnation of its oil-driven sector, Brunei maintains a currency valued at par with Singapore's dollar, which is also widely used in the country. India's primary exports to Brunei include automobiles, transport equipment, rice, and spices. Conversely, India is one of Brunei's largest importers of crude oil, with annual imports valued at approximately $500-600 million. At the recently opened Brunei Energy Hub, an interactive oil and gas museum in Bandar Seri Begawan, the country's oil and gas development timeline highlights India as one of the “key customers” of Brunei Shell Petroleum (BSP), a joint venture between the Government of Brunei and Shell, noting the first delivery of oil cargo to India in 2003, with approximately 25,000 barrels supplied each year thereafter. A significant portion of Brunei's Indian diaspora, nearly 15,000, primarily works in the oil and gas sector, with an increasing number of unskilled Indian workers entering the construction and other unorganised sectors in recent years.</p>

<h2><strong>Eye On China</strong></h2>

<p>With 161 kilometres of coastline along the South China Sea, Brunei, home to nearly 4,50,000 people, holds both geographical and geopolitical significance in the Indo-Pacific region. The nation is a silent claimant to this contested maritime area, maintaining a delicate balance in its relations with China and other ASEAN neighbours, despite China's growing assertiveness in the region. In May of this year, Brunei signed a maritime cooperation agreement with the Philippines, which has recently taken a stand against China's aggression in the South China Sea, officially referring to the area near its coastline as the West Philippine Sea. Simultaneously, the Islamic nation has strengthened its defence ties with India over the years. Prime Minister Modi's visit is anticipated to solidify this relationship, especially in light of China's expanding influence in the region.</p>

<h2><strong>Culinary Connection</strong></h2>

<p>Interestingly, Brunei's population comprises more than 10% Chinese immigrants, with nearly 70% of their ancestors hailing from the Taiwanese islands of Kinmen. This group fled heavy shelling by China during the First and Second Taiwan Strait crises in the 1950s. While enjoying traditional ‘roti kacang kahwin' and ‘roti kuning kahwin' (the word "roti" means bread in Malay, like in Hindi) at Chop Jing Chew, a historic bakery and eatery in Bandar Seri Begawan, I was surprised to find that the Chinese-immigrant-owned establishment is run entirely by Indian staff. My culinary exploration also revealed that one of Brunei's most popular and top-rated (by Tripadvisor) restaurants, Riyaz, located in a prominent hotel, is managed by a team of Indian chefs and hospitality staff.</p>

<h2><strong>Bollywood's Soft Power</strong></h2>

<p>A visit to another well-regarded restaurant, Soto Pabo, along the Brunei riverfront, highlighted Brunei's deep-rooted cross-cultural connection with India. I encountered two elderly Bruneians jamming with a guitar, who greeted me with a warm "Namaste" in fluent Hindi. After introducing myself and joining their gathering, one of them, Hajiali, told me that he had studied in Lucknow for a year in the 1970s. The septuagenarian, together with his friend and the eatery's owner's octogenarian father-in-law, entertained us with a medley of classic Bollywood songs. I was captivated by the nostalgic tunes of Mukesh's “Sawan Ka Mahina,” Kishore Kumar's “Zindagi Ek Safar,” and Mohammad Rafi's “Jo Wada Kiya.” A little later, after savouring their signature Ambuyat set—a traditional Bruneian meal—I took a ferry to Kampung Ayer, a traditional water village near the capital. As we sailed through the mangroves populated with long-nosed proboscis monkeys&nbsp;(featured in the&nbsp;<i>Tintin&nbsp;</i>adventure, Flight 714), the boatman began singing “Kuch Kuch Hota Hai” upon learning my nationality. This experience reminded me of my travels to Timor-Leste and Indonesia, where locals also fondly recalled the Bollywood classic. It was a profound demonstration of India's enduring soft power through Bollywood.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While it's heartening to see the influence of Indian culture in Brunei even before Prime Minister Modi's visit, India must further engage with this small yet affluent nation to enhance its strategic position in the region.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has arrived in Singapore for his official two-day visit to further strengthen bilateral ties between the two nations. The prime minister's visit to Singapore comes after a historic visit to Brunei as part of New Delhi's 'Act East' policy.</p>

<p>India and Singapore already share a strategic alliance in the region and PM Modi's visit today aims to "deepen the strategic partnership". Prime Minister Modi is visiting Singapore at the invitation of his counterpart Lawrence Wong.</p>

<p>The prime minister's visit comes after six years. PM Modi's previous visit was in 2018. "His first visit to Singapore was in his first term as the Prime Minister. This visit is of great significance as it's his visit early in his term, and also as the new Prime Minister Lawrence Wong has taken oath recently and Singaporeans are excited to welcome PM Modi," Secretary East, Ministry of External Affairs, Jaideep Mazumdar said.</p>

<p>PM Modi's visit comes within days of Lawrence Wong becoming the new prime minister of Singapore and within weeks of Narendra Modi taking charge as Prime Minister for his third consecutive term.</p>

<p>Ahead of his arrival in Singapore, PM Modi shared a post on X, which reads, "I look forward to my discussions to deepen our Strategic Partnership with Singapore, particularly in new and emerging areas of advanced manufacturing, digitalisation, and sustainable development."</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi, who last visited Singapore in 2018, is accompanied by Minister of External Affairs S Jaishankar, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and other top government officials.</p>

<p>"The leaders will review the progress of India-Singapore Strategic Partnership and exchange views on regional and global issues of mutual interest," a Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) statement said ahead of his departure for Brunei and Singapore.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister S Jaishankar said "India and Singapore's bilateral ties "have been extremely strong in the last two decades."</p>

<p>"Given the transformation underway in India and the changes in the world, they need to become more contemporary. In many ways, that is why Prime Minister Narendra Modi has chosen to visit Singapore so early in his third term," The Straits Times quoted Mr Jaishankar as saying in an interview.</p>

<p>"Just like Singapore had an opportunity in 1992 and then again in 2006, it should seize the moment and fully utilise the new landscape," the minister said.</p>

<p><strong>PM MODI'S MEETINGS</strong></p>

<p>During his visit, PM Modi will receive an official welcome at the Parliament House tomorrow and will also meet President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, apart from his meeting with Prime Minister L:awrence Wong.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi is also scheduled to meet three generations of Singapore's leadership and will meet top CEO's as well.</p>

<p>PM Modi will meet senior minister Lee Hsien Loong and Emeritus senior minister Goh Chok Tong. Mr Wong and Mr Lee will host Prime Minister Modi for separate meals.</p>

<p>PM Modi will also meet business leaders and interact with those in the country's semiconductor ecosystem. This visit will build synergies in semiconductor ecosystems of Singapore and India. Both PMs will visit a semiconductor manufacturing facility, officials said.</p>

<p><strong>AGREEMENTS TO BE SIGNED</strong></p>

<p>Memorandums of Understanding or MoUs will be signed for cooperation in manpower skilling in the semiconductor sector. From skilling centres to training and recruitment by Singapore firms, this will help India's youth with better skills and opportunities, officials added.</p>

<p>Agreements are also likely in the areas of maritime cooperation, maritime security, trade, investment, digitisation, skill, sustainability, health, advanced manufacturing and connectivity.</p>

<p><strong>INDIA-SINGAPORE TIES</strong></p>

<p>Singapore is India's largest trade partner in ASEAN. It is also a leading source of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the last financial year with an investment of $11.77 billion in 2023 alone. Singapore has been a long-term investor in India. Since 2000 till now, we have an accumulative FDI of USD 160 billion dollars.</p>

<p>"This is an opportune time to set the stage for India-Singapore's vibrant bilateral relations for the next stage of India-Singapore bilateral relations. Our ties have evolved and we have a dynamic strategic partnership encompassing diverse areas from our shared history and people-to-people ties, which form an important link between us," the Ministry of External Affairs said ahead of the PM's visit.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">Parents of children and teenagers have long been warned about the dangers of screen time and digital devices before bed – the worry being that screens could harm the sleep patterns of young people.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>But do screens really hurt the length and quality of sleep?</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2822859">new research</a> found that using screens in bed was worse for sleep than using screens for hours before going to bed.</p>

<p>Sleep guidelines recommend no screen use in an hour or two before bed. However, we found screen time in the two hours before bed had little impact on young people's sleep. Instead, it was screen time once in bed that caused problems.</p>

<p>Using cameras to track device usage and sleep, we found using a device in bed could cause more harm than screen time right up to bedtime.</p>

<p>These findings challenge long-held assumptions about screen time at night and could help parents improve the quality of their children's sleep.</p>

<h3><strong>Connecting sleep and screens</strong></h3>

<p>A number of global organisations <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/teens-and-sleep/screen-time-and-insomnia-for-teens">recommend adolescents stop using devices</a> in the hour or two before bed, and instead <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5839336/">undertake activities</a> like reading a book or quiet time with the family.</p>

<p>However, these recommendations are based on research with a number of limitations. The studies were designed in such a way that researchers could link sleep and screens. But they don't tell us if changes in how young people used screens had an effect on the length or quality of sleep.</p>

<p>Most of the existing research also used questionnaires to assess both screen time and sleep. Questionnaires are unlikely to capture true screen time accurately, particularly if you are interested in knowing more than just how long an adolescent has spent on their device.</p>

<p>To address some of these weaknesses in the previous research, we asked 85 adolescents aged between 11 and 14 to wear a body camera on their chest for three hours before bed, for four nights.</p>

<p>These cameras faced outwards and accurately captured when and how adolescents used their screens. Because we were interested in overnight screen time as well, a second infrared camera was placed on a tripod in the teenagers' bedroom and captured their screen time while in bed. The research participants also wore an actigraph – a watch-sized device that objectively measured screen time.</p>

<h3><strong>Teen nighttime activity</strong></h3>

<p>It quickly became obvious that adolescents spent a lot of their screen time while in bed.</p>

<p>Our analysis looked at two time periods – from the two hours before they got into bed, and from once they were in bed (clearly under the covers) until they put their devices down and were clearly trying to go to sleep.</p>

<p>Our data showed that 99% of the adolescents used screens in two hours before bed, more than half once they were in bed, and a third even after first trying to go to sleep for the night. Just one teenager did not use screens before bed on any of the four nights.</p>

<p>The screen time before they got into bed had little impact on their sleep that night. However, screen time once in bed did impair their sleep. It stopped them from going to sleep for about half an hour, and reduced the amount of sleep they got that night.</p>

<p>This was particularly true for more interactive screen activities like gaming and multitasking – when they use more than one device at the same time (like watching a movie on Netflix on a laptop while playing Xbox on a gaming device).</p>

<p>In fact, every additional ten minutes of this type of screen time reduced the amount of sleep they got that night by almost the same amount – nine minutes.</p>

<h3><strong>Revisiting guidelines</strong></h3>

<p>Our research was an observational study looking at the established screen habits of young people.</p>

<p>The next step to better understand this will be to conduct experiments that can actually prove different types and timings of screen time affect sleep.</p>

<p>That said, what we have already found challenges existing guidelines. Screens at night may not be the bogeyman they have been made out to be. However, allowing young people to have screens in bed can be detrimental to their quality of sleep.</p>

<p>So the simple message might be to keep those devices out of the bedroom.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lieutenant Commander Jonny Kim has a resume that would make Asian parents swell with pride. At 40, he is already a decorated Navy SEAL, a Harvard-trained physician, and now, a NASA astronaut preparing for his next great adventure – space.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The Los Angeles native joined <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-assigns-astronaut-jonny-kim-to-first-space-station-mission/ ">NASA</a> in 2017 and will be launched into space aboard the Roscosmos Soyuz MS-27 spacecraft in March 2025. On his mission, accompanied by two Russian cosmonauts, he will spend nearly eight months aboard the International Space Station (ISS), conducting critical scientific investigations and preparing the station for future missions.<br />
<br />
Mr Kim's journey to the stars is as impressive as his other accomplishments. He earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from the University of San Diego before graduating from Harvard Medical School. He served as an emergency room intern at Massachusetts General Hospital.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But his medical career came after a decade of service as a Navy SEAL. He is also a dual-designated naval aviator and flight surgeon.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In NASA, Mr Kim has played several roles, including that of lead operations officer for Expedition 65 and the T-38 operations liaison, within the organisation. Now, he is set to take on his most challenging role yet – living and working in space.<br />
<br />
Mr Kim's mission comes when NASA is grappling with unforeseen challenges. Two other astronauts, Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, remain stranded on the ISS due to malfunctions in the Boeing Starliner spacecraft.<br />
<br />
The issues, caused by helium leaks that were more extensive than previously believed, have forced NASA to delay their return to Earth until a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule can bring them home in February next year.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of the November 5 US presidential elections, an Indian diaspora group has launched a campaign to increase the policy impact and participation of Indian-American voters in the polls.</p>

<p>Launched by the non-profit institution Foundation for India and Indian Diaspora Studies (FIIDS), the "Indo American Votes Matter" campaign underscores the critical role the community can play in shaping the nation's future, a statement issued on Tuesday said.</p>

<p>"As a vibrant and growing immigrant minority, Indo-Americans-- numbering approximately 4.5 million across the United States -- have a unique opportunity to make a significant impact in the 2024 elections. Concentrated in key swing states such as Florida, Georgia, Arizona, Virginia, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, the Indo-American vote could be decisive in determining the outcome of crucial races," the FIIDS said.</p>

<p>A comprehensive survey of Indian-Americans will gather their views on both domestic and global policy matters of the US important to them, it said.</p>

<p>"With a sizable population in swing states crucial to the presidential elections, Indian-Americans have a unique opportunity to make an impact," said Khanderao Kand, chief of policy and strategy at FIIDS.</p>

<p>"Therefore, their policy issues and preferences should be seriously considered by both the Republican National Committee (RNC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). With the voters registration campaign, we want to have at least a million plus Indian American voters in this election," Kand said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US asylum process is meant to offer a fair shot at safe haven. But new reporting from Bloomberg uncovers how the difference between those who are granted asylum and those who are denied often boils down to chance.</p>

<p>On today's Big Take podcast, Bloomberg investigative reporter Monte Reel joins host David Gura to trace the arc of one man's journey and discuss new data analysis that reveals the flaws at the core of the US asylum system.</p>

<h3><strong>Here is a lightly edited transcript of the conversation:</strong></h3>

<p><strong>David Gura</strong>: In 2018, 29-year-old Yerandy Valdes fled Cuba, where he was born and raised. He'd been targeted by the police, put in prison, and he feared for his life. Monte Reel, a senior investigative reporter at Bloomberg, says Valdes made it, months later, to the US-Mexico border:</p>

<p><strong>Monte Reel</strong>: He crossed a bridge across the Rio Grande to McAllen, Texas. And there's a border patrol station on the US side of that bridge. And he turned himself in to Border Patrol officers, and announced that he wanted to apply for asylum.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: Valdes was one of tens of thousands of people that year, who hoped the US government would agree with them, that life in their home countries had become too dangerous. Monte says that, as soon as Valdes told Border Patrol he wanted to apply for asylum, an agent peppered him with questions. He was given what's known as a "credible fear interview."</p>

<p><strong>Reel:</strong> And so, they ask him the nature of his fears in Cuba, and so he really, you know, started to think about this, and he wasn't sure where to start.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: Because there was so much to say. There was the story of what had happened to his dad. At the time, it had been illegal to operate a private business in Cuba - but Valdes' dad defied those rules. He ran an auto shop, and owned a food cart. He was arrested and found guilty of "enrichment at the expense of the state."</p>

<p><strong>Reel</strong>: And so, when Valdes was a kid, his father was in jail for almost 15 years.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: His dad escaped the country and was legally admitted to the US. But then, Monte says, Valdes became a target.</p>

<p><strong>Reel</strong>: He himself had a churro cart, you know, selling snacks. Those carts were confiscated by the government. He was thrown in jail. He, in fact, became so disenchanted with the Cuban government that he actually got a tattoo on his forearm, and the tattoo said that Cuba is a prison of the living dead.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: And that small act of protest made things worse. He believes someone saw that tattoo, and reported him.</p>

<p><strong>Reel</strong>: The jail authorities threatened to burn it off. And in fact, they singed his arm by the tattoo with a hot spoon.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: Valdes tried to leave Cuba over and over again, but he was caught and arrested. So, in 2018, he felt some relief. He'd made it to US soil, he had an opportunity to make his case, and that border patrol agent found Valdes' fear of persecution credible. But this was just the first step in what became a years-long process, and what happened next shows how capricious - and, Monte says, how broken - the US asylum process is. This is "The Big Take," from Bloomberg News. I'm David Gura, and today on the show, a story about one person who applied for asylum in the US in the last decade - one of hundreds of thousands, and what his experience tells us about how arbitrary and unjust that system is.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: After Yerandy Valdes made it through that first interview at the border, the agent had to decide whether to let Valdes live with his dad, before a court hearing or if he should be detained. And Bloomberg's Monte Reels says he chose the latter.</p>

<p><strong>Reel</strong>: If you talk to immigration lawyers, they will say that these decisions to detain or to parole often feel arbitrary. That there's no real reason behind them. Technically, the reason given for Valdes becoming a detainee was that he was a flight risk.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: In the US, more than 80% of asylum seekers get parole. But Valdes was not one of them. And according to Monte, that denial made it less likely Valdes' application for asylum would be approved. The next question then, was where he would be detained? And Monte says the answer was, as it often is with asylum cases: "Wherever there's space."</p>

<p><strong>Reel</strong>: So, he is transferred to a detention facility in rural Louisiana.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: Back then, around 2018, ICE opened up several new detention centers in the American South. Valdes was sent to one of them. It's in the small town of Pine Prairie. And getting sent there Monte says made his odds of getting asylum even tougher:</p>

<p><strong>Reel</strong>: It just so happens that, when you get assigned to a detention center, your case travels to that location. So, if he had been, for example, sent to New York City, about 29% of asylum cases in New York City are denied, and those people are ordered deported. In Louisiana, where he was sent, more than 80% are denied. So that was, you know, a pretty fateful circumstance.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: Valdes, like many others, would learn that, in the asylum process, geography matters. And something else that can make a huge difference, Monte says, is which immigration judge gets your case. His was assigned to Agnelis Reese.</p>

<p><strong>Reel</strong>: He got a judge who, in the past 11 years before his case, had heard hundreds of asylum cases and hadn't granted asylum to a single one of them.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: About six months later, Valdes got his day in court.</p>

<p><strong>Reel</strong>: He was there, his father was there as a supporting witness. And the proceeding is held essentially like a trial. There's a government attorney who's acting sort of as a prosecutor. And this is an attorney with the Department of Homeland Security who essentially is arguing for deportation. The judge is overseeing all of this and throwing in questions of her own, and so it becomes a hearing that will serve as sort of a one-day trial. This is his chance to present his case.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: Now, one of the key differences between immigration courts and civil courts, or criminal courts, is that immigration courts fall under the executive branch, not the judicial branch.</p>

<p><strong>Reel</strong>: So the person who's overseeing the immigration courts is actually the attorney general, which is a political appointee. So one of the reasons a lot of people want reform in this system is they say that these immigration courts are more susceptible to political meddling, political influence, because of that structure.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: Four months before Valdes' hearing, Jeff Sessions, who was the US attorney general at the time, put in place a quota system that required every immigration court judge to make at least 700 rulings every year. All of a sudden, everyone had a busy docket, and Monte says that's reflected in the court records:</p>

<p><strong>Reel</strong>: There was pressure on judges to move cases through their courtrooms quickly. And in the transcripts, you can definitely see that come through with the judge in Valdes' case. She's- the judge was definitely in a hurry. Valdes was presenting his evidence through a translator, and there were several times in the hearing where the translation was imprecise.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: At one point, the immigration judge asked Valdes about what happened when Cuban police gave him trouble for having that snack cart:</p>

<p><strong>Reel</strong>: He used the verb decomisar, which in Spanish means confiscated. They were confiscated. The translator, she said, "de-commiserated." And the judge had a problem understanding what she meant, and really kind of, took out that misunderstanding on Valdes. She ruled that he was being unresponsive.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: But that wasn't the only thing that stood out to Monte, when he read the transcript of Valdes' court hearing. The judge believed there were inconsistencies in Valdes' story.</p>

<p><strong>Reel</strong>: He had told her in the courtroom that, during one of the periods where he was jailed, that the officers had beaten him with a club, hit him in the head and had fractured his skull. And she went back and looked at the credible fear interview, and the credible fear interview, keep in mind, it's not a verbatim transcript. These are just notes that are taken- summary notes by the interviewing officer. And in that interview, he said that he had been hit in the head with a police stick, and that it had broken open his head and created a wound.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: The judge seized on that difference - how Valdes described something as a "fracture" in her courtroom, and as a "wound" in that first conversation with border patrol. "In his interview with asylum officers," she wrote, "he did not mention his head being fractured." This was something at "the heart of the claim," she said, and rendered his testimony "non-credible." Judge Reese denied Valdes' request for asylum. She retired in 2022. And she did not respond to Bloomberg's requests for comment.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: How common is it to have a proceeding go this way? As you just kind of look at, look at others, for there to be difficulties with translation or cultural misunderstanding?</p>

<p><strong>Reel</strong>: Yeah, if you talk to immigration lawyers who've had a lot of experience in these courts, they are full of stories about mistranslations, about misinterpretations of testimony, of judges who are hurried and who, in some cases, display a sort of callousness towards the people who are testifying. And you know, in some cases, sure, there are people who are entering the asylum system with claims that are invalid - that just don't hold up. But there are people who have gone through trauma, and who enter these courtrooms, and who face judges that oftentimes are hurried and don't give their cases the hearing that they might deserve.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: Under the current system, judges are routinely required to deliver an oral decision at the conclusion of a hearing immediately after the testimony is given without adjourning. One former immigration judge told Monte that means two similar cases can have very different outcomes, depending on the judge. In an Ohio case, for example, a 22-year old woman testified she had been raped by military officers. They were looking for her relatives, who were activists. That asylum applicant said they'd found her alone, at home, early one morning. The immigration judge in Ohio, overseeing that case, denied her request, saying the assault could not be considered "state-sanctioned violence," because, in Cameroon, quote, "police officers are not allowed to enter a private home at night in search of a criminal suspect" end quote. Valdes pressed on. He took the decision in his case to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which is the appellate body of US immigration courts. But Monte says Valdes recognized his odds were getting even worse.</p>

<p><strong>Reel</strong>: That body sustains the vast majority of cases that they hear. So, whenever it came time for his appeal, it was a last-ditch effort, and one he knew he probably wasn't going to win.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: Valdes was sent back to Pine Prairie, Louisiana, to that ICE detention center. Six months later after Valdes submitted his appeal, the board denied his request.</p>

<p><strong>Reel</strong>: He was put on a deportation flight to Havana and the plane lands in Havana at the airport and even before he gets off the plane, the police are waiting for him.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: After the break, another turn in the story of Yerandy Valdes, and what his story says about who is - and who isn't - being granted asylum in the US today.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: Yerandy Valdes spent more than a year in an ICE detention facility in Pine Prairie, Louisiana, after an immigration judge rejected his application for asylum, and before a board denied his appeal. I asked Bloomberg's Monte Reel how the asylum system in the US is supposed to work - if it's supposed to take this long.</p>

<p><strong>Reel</strong>: Someone who is being persecuted by their home government, they apply for asylum, and then their case goes before a judge and the person is supposed to present their case to the judge. The judge hears it and makes a ruling quickly and that person either then is on the path for citizenship in the United States or they're deported. And it's supposed to be a pretty quick process. But the reality is that these cases now drag on for years.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: And that's partly because of how many cases there are - how many migrants are asking for asylum.</p>

<p><strong>Reel</strong>: Well, the court system has just become increasingly overwhelmed with cases and a backlog of cases. So since 2016, that backlog of immigration court cases has grown from about 500,000 to about 3.7 million. And asylum cases alone, they're a part of that backlog. They account for about 1.3 million of those cases.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: Monte says asylum seekers and lawyers alike - and even some immigration judges themselves - argue the system is in sore need of reform.</p>

<p><strong>Reel</strong>: One of the things that the judges themselves say is that there's too much political influence in the system. There are also a lot of judges in especially rural immigration courts, places like rural Louisiana, where there, there's not a huge pool of people who qualify, who are living near those courtrooms. 62% of the people who end up being appointed judges there had previously served as staff attorneys for the Department of Homeland Security. In other words, they were prosecutors. And if you look at the judges overall, you know, there are those judges who deny almost all cases. You can find other judges in other jurisdictions, for example, in San Francisco, who deny only, say, 20% of the cases. Critics of the immigration court system say that the variances between judges are so extreme that that ends up becoming the most important part of a case. It's not the merits of the case. It's actually the luck of the draw.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: And Yerandy Valdes? He got a series of bad draws - when he was detained, when he was sent to Louisiana to await trial and when he was sent back to Cuba, where he was put in prison.</p>

<p><strong>Reel</strong>: When he was released in 2022, at this time, he began sort of documenting abuses that he would see by the Cuban government.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: He made videos about his own experiences</p>

<p>Yerandy Valdes (in Spanish): Hello, my name is Yerandy Valdes Ruiz.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: In one, he introduces himself as a human rights activist.</p>

<p>Valdes (in Spanish): I am an activist for human rights.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: He also recorded protests and videos of what he saw as examples of government failures. Like this one, after Hurricane Ian decimated western Cuba in late September 2022. You see him walking through the wreckage, pointing out damage, and asking residents if they're getting the help they need.</p>

<p><strong>Reel</strong>: And he sent those videos to video bloggers in the United States anti-Cuban bloggers who had programs on YouTube and that sort of thing out of Miami. And he became something of, like, a citizen journalist correspondent, trying to detail abuses in the Cuban regime.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: And Valdes decided he would try again - to leave Cuba. In 2023, he boarded a raft made out of a car frame, and kept afloat by plastic containers, and floated for two days across the Caribbean, before he came ashore on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. He worked odd jobs there for eight months before he once again made his way through Mexico, to its border with the US.</p>

<p><strong>Reel</strong>: And, you know, the way it works is you generally pay coyotes to help you across the border. He did that, and this time, they didn't cross at a bridge like he did the last time. This time they crossed in ranchland in Arizona. He was picked up by the border patrol, and now for a second time, he entered the asylum system.</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: Valdes was in a different state. The US had a different president. And the process had changed. Border Patrol gave him a new form to fill out, one called an I-220A.</p>

<p><strong>Reel</strong>: What it meant for Valdes at the time was that he was allowed to go and live with his father. So he joined his father in Missouri. In 2023, and he's there now, and he's awaiting his first court hearing in the immigration courts, which will happen in Missouri, not in Louisiana this time</p>

<p><strong>Gura</strong>: That hearing is scheduled for January 2026. And Monte says Valdes is more optimistic. This time, he's going to go before another judge, and he has a cell phone full of videos to support his case. But the odds are not in his favor. In the Missouri court where his hearing will take place the denial rate for asylum seekers is 76%</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cairo, Egypt's capital, boasts a history spanning over 1,000 years, earning its reputation as one of the world's most iconic cities. However, the country has decided to relocate its capital, and recent images from NASA have captured the rapid development of the brand-new capital city being built in the desert 45 kilometres (28 miles) east of Cairo. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newsweek.com/egypt-new-capital-cairo-nasa-satellite-images-1946656#:~:text=Egypt's%20historic%20capital%2C%20Cairo%2C%20is,28%20miles%20to%20its%20east." rel="nofollow, noindex">Newsweek,</a></em> the plan to move the new capital was first announced back in 2015, driven by the need to address Cairo's swelling population, traffic congestion and pollution.</p>

<p>Images of the new capital were acquired by the OLI (Operational Land Imager) on Landsat 8 and the OLI-2 on Landsat 9 in August 2017 and August 2024 respectively. In the earlier image, traces of the city are visible as the work on the megaproject had begun by this time. The second image&nbsp;shows the progress of the construction of the new city in 2024.</p>

<p>"Egypt is relocating its capital to a brand new city in the desert outside of Cario. #Landsat captured these images of the new capital in August 2017 and 2024, showing the expansion of the city and several prominent landmarks," NASA Earth wrote on X.</p>

<p>Notably, the city dubbed as The New Administrative Capital (NAC) will be a sprawling metropolis, comparable in size to Singapore, and designed to accommodate over six million residents. This futuristic city will feature sleek skyscrapers, including a 77-storey tower, as well as Egyptian government offices, major financial hubs, and other impressive infrastructure. It is estimated to cost over $58 billion.</p>

<p>The images by NASA reveal the impressive landmarks of Egypt's new capital city, including a&nbsp;10-kilometre-long Green River Park, offering walking and biking paths.&nbsp;Many government ministry offices also comprise the dense development to the east of the park, while the Ministry of Defense occupies a sizeable facility called The Octagon. The images also feature a massive sports complex featuring Africa's second-largest stadium aimed at catching the attention of the Olympic committee.</p>

<p>More than 1,500 families have moved to the new capital, with the population expected to reach 10,000 by the end of the year.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's state security agency on Wednesday warned students with access to sensitive information against falling for "handsome men" or "beautiful women" that might entice them to spy for foreign powers.</p>

<p>Beijing's Ministry of State Security (MSS) has promoted claims that foreign spies are working to lure loyal Chinese to betray their country -- often in lurid and unusual ways -- since opening a WeChat account last year.</p>

<p>It has warned that foreign spies "have countless disguises, and can even change their gender" and called on citizens to "build 1.4 billion lines of defence" against threats to the country.</p>

<p>And it accused on Wednesday foreign intelligence agencies of deploying "romance traps" to lure Chinese students.</p>

<p>It said foreign spies were using job ads and even online dating to "lure and coerce" young students, especially those with access to "sensitive scientific research data", to hand over confidential information.</p>

<p>"They may even disguise themselves as 'handsome men' or 'beautiful women'... and drag young students into 'romance trap'," it warned.</p>

<p>The MSS did not name which countries were behind the alleged scheme.</p>

<p>But it warned that spies might be disguising themselves as university scholars, scientific researchers or consultants, luring students short of cash in what it called "targeted infiltration".</p>

<p>In another lurid tale this month, the MSS warned the public to beware "wolves in sheep's clothing" -- foreign agents pretending to be "good Samaritans".</p>

<p>In June, it accused Britain's MI6 intelligence agency of recruiting a couple who worked for the central government to spy for the UK.</p>

<p>Under Xi Jinping, China's most powerful and authoritarian leader in decades, Beijing has stepped up dark warnings that foreign powers are seeking to clip the country's rise.</p>

<p>China and Western powers have long traded accusations of spying but only recently started to disclose details of alleged individual cases.</p>

<p>In May, investigators searched the Brussels office of a German MEP suspected of spying for China.</p>

<p>And on Tuesday, a former official who worked as an aide to the governor of New York state was arrested and charged with working as an agent of China in return for millions of dollars.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A 70-year-old man in the United States died on an operating table after the doctor mistakenly removed the wrong organ during surgery.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 70-year-old man in the United States died on an operating table after the doctor mistakenly removed the wrong organ during surgery, the <em>New York Post</em> reported. William Bryan and his wife Beverly were visiting their rental property in Florida last month when he suddenly began experiencing lower left abdominal pain. They immediately went to Ascension Sacred Heart Emerald Coast Hospital, where the 70-year-old was admitted for further tests over concerns about an abnormality of the spleen. The doctors then convinced the man to undergo surgery at the hospital. However, the operation led to the death of the man after the doctor mistakenly removed the man's liver during surgery before the surgeon attempted to pass off the organ as an "enlarged spleen," according to a lawyer representing the man's widow.</p>

<p>In a Facebook post, the law firm claimed that General Surgeon Dr Thomas Shaknovsky and the hospital's Chief Medical Officer Dr Christopher Bacani persuaded the reluctant family for the 70-year-old to undergo surgery at the hospital or he "could experience serious complications if he left the hospital". Mr Bryan agreed with the doctors and underwent a hand-assisted laparoscopic splenectomy procedure in August. "From the records it appears, both physicians were involved in the discussion as to the appropriateness of the planned procedure and the capabilities of the facility to accommodate such," the law firm wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="476" scrolling="no" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?height=476&amp;href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fzarzaurlaw%2Fvideos%2F382732311330894%2F&amp;show_text=false&amp;width=267&amp;t=0" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" width="267"></iframe></p>

<p>In the middle of the surgery, Mr Shaknovsky removed Mr Bryan's liver by transecting the major vasculature supplying the liver. The surgical cut resulted in "immediate and catastrophic blood loss resulting in death," the Facebook post read.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The law firm claimed that after the doctors mistakenly removed Mr Bryan's liver, the general surgeon labelled the organ as a "spleen," which was only identified as a liver after the man's death. The surgeons meanwhile explained to Mr Bryan's wife that her husband's "spleen" was so diseased that it was four times bigger than usual and had migrated to the other side of his body. "The family was informed that Mr. Bryan's spleen, the root of his original symptom profile upon presentation to the hospital, was still in his body and appeared with a small cyst on its surface," the law firm said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, inside the human body, the liver is located on the upper right side of the abdominal cavity, just below the diaphragm, and above the stomach, right kidney, and intestines. The spleen, on the other hand, is located on the upper left side of the abdomen next to the stomach and is significantly smaller and lighter than the liver.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Facebook post, Zarzaur Law claimed that Dr Shaknovsky had a previous "wrong-site surgery" back in 2023 where he supposedly removed a portion of a patient's pancreas instead of performing the intended adrenal gland resection.</p>

<p>Beverly Brayns retained the law firm to get "justice" for her husband and is hoping the general surgeon no longer treats other patients. "My husband died while helpless on the operating room table by Dr. Shaknovsky. I don't want anyone else to die due to his incompetence at a hospital that should have known or knew he had previously made drastic, life-altering surgical mistakes," the widow said in a statement through the law firm. She also added that she is pushing for both civil and criminal proceedings related to her husband's death.&nbsp;</p>

<p>North Walton Doctor's Hospital "disassociated" itself from Shaknovsky and has removed all photos and references to the doctor from its website, according to the law firm. Ascension Sacred Heart Emerald Coast Hospital said it was investigating the man's death.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/04/us-news/alabama-husband-william-bryan-dies-on-florida-hospital-operating-table-after-dr-thomas-shaknovsky-removes-liver/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Post</em></a>, an apparent small cyst was discovered later on Mr Bryan's spleen which is believed to be the cause of the pain he was hospitalized for.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[When Elon Musk acquired X (then Twitter) in 2022 for $44 billion, he did so with the backing of a formidable group of investors, including Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and leading Silicon Valley venture capital firm]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Elon Musk acquired X (then Twitter) in 2022 for $44 billion, he did so with the backing of a formidable group of investors, including Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and leading Silicon Valley venture capital firms. However, under Mr Musk's leadership, Twitter's valuation has nosedived, leaving these investors with substantial financial losses.</p>

<p>Mr Musk and his group of investors have reportedly lost over $24 billion in paper value on their investment, the Washington Post reported. The value of the company has plummeted by 72 per cent since October 2022.</p>

<p>According to a Washington Post analysis,&nbsp; the eight largest initial investments have collectively lost approximately $5 billion in value since Mr Musk's takeover. The overall stake has shed $24 billion in value, with investors like Jack Dorsey, Larry Ellison and Sequoia Capital facing significant losses.</p>

<p>Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the second-largest investor in X after Mr Musk, insists on valuing his stake at $1.9 billion despite external assessments pointing to significant devaluation. The Prince attributes this confidence to X's investments in Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, and stresses prioritising revenue growth in the platform's future.</p>

<p>The deal has faced scrutiny, with the SEC investigating Mr Musk's purchase for potential fraud. Advertisers have fled the platform due to controversies, and some investors have received subpoenas as part of the probe.</p>

<p>Here's a breakdown of the largest initial investors and their losses:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Elon Musk: -$24.12 billion</li>
	<li>Prince Alwaleed bin Talal (and Kingdom Holding Co.): -$1.36 billion</li>
	<li>Jack Dorsey: -$720 million</li>
	<li>Larry Ellison: -$720 million</li>
	<li>Sequoia Capital: -$576 million</li>
	<li>Vy Capital: -$504 million</li>
	<li>Binance: -$360 million</li>
	<li>Andreessen Horowitz: -$288 million</li>
	<li>Qatar Investment Authority: -$270 million</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the major factors contributing to X's financial troubles is the exodus of advertisers. Many companies have grown wary of Elon Musk's approach to content moderation, which prioritises a more relaxed stance on free speech. However, this approach has put X at odds with regulatory bodies, leading to a suspension in Brazil over the platform's refusal to censor certain political content.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four Indians were charred to death in a massive car crash in Texas, US, on Friday. The victims, who were carpooling to Arkansas, were identified as Aryan Raghunath Orampati, Farooq Shaik, Lokesh Palacharla and Dharshini Vasudevan.</p>

<p>A speeding truck rear-ended the SUV they were travelling in, causing it to explode and burst into flames. The authorities are relying on DNA testing to confirm their identities.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Aryan Raghunath Orampati</strong></h3>

<p>Aryan Raghunath Orampati, a resident of Hyderabad, loved music, travelling, and sports, and had an "unbending fascination" for Finance. He had a degree in Electrical, Electronics, and Communications Engineering from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Tamil Nadu and a Master's in Finance from the University of Texas at Dallas. His father Subhash Chandra Reddy owns a Hyderabad-based firm named Max Agri Genetics Private Limited.</p>

<p>Mr Orampati worked as an Accounting Intern at Max Agri-Genetics Pvt Ltd. in India before he earned a full-time position at the company for over a year. He was returning from visiting his cousin in Dallas when the tragedy struck.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Farooq Shaik</strong></h3>

<p>Farooq Shaik, also a Hyderabad resident, was travelling to Bentonville to meet his friend when he met with the fatal car accident. He had gone to the US three years ago to pursue his MS degree, which he completed recently, revealed his father. His father, Masthan Vali is a retired private employee.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Lokesh Palacharla</strong></h3>

<p>Lokesh Palacharla, from Andhra Pradesh, was a banker in the Bank of America in Allen, Texas. He was travelling to Bentonville to meet his wife.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Palacharla held a Master's degree in Informatics from Northeastern University. He worked at Tech Mahindra in Hyderabad. Before that, he worked at BrainVita Pvt Ltd in Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh.</p>

<h3><strong>Dharshini Vasudevan</strong></h3>

<p>Dharshini Vasudevan completed her Master's degree from the University of Texas and was working in the US. She was on her way to visit her uncle in Bentonville, Arkansas, when the car she was travelling in got rear-ended. Ms Vasudevan's father sought help locating her through an X post, tagging External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, after she became unreachable following the accident.</p>

<p>In his emotional post, he shared details about his daughter's stay in the US, mentioning her Indian passport number, address in Frisco, Texas, and her activities on the day of the accident. He explained that Ms Vasudevan had taken a carpool ride with three others around 3 pm and was actively messaging until 4 pm, after which all contact was lost with her.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The DOJ, which had previously delivered questionnaires to companies, is now sending legally binding requests that oblige recipients to provide information]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Justice Department sent subpoenas to Nvidia Corp. and other companies as it seeks evidence that the chipmaker violated antitrust laws, an escalation of its investigation into the dominant provider of AI processors.</p>

<p>The DOJ, which had previously delivered questionnaires to companies, is now sending legally binding requests that oblige recipients to provide information, according to people familiar with the investigation. That takes the government a step closer to launching a formal complaint.</p>

<p>Antitrust officials are concerned that Nvidia is making it harder to switch to other suppliers and penalizes buyers that don't exclusively use its artificial intelligence chips, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.</p>

<p>Nvidia shares, which suffered a record-setting $279 billion rout on Tuesday, fell further in late trading after Bloomberg reported on the subpoenas. Still, the stock has more than doubled this year - fueled by explosive sales growth at the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker.</p>

<p>As part of the probe, which Bloomberg previously reported in June, investigators have been contacting other technology companies to gather information. The DOJ's San Francisco office is taking the lead running the inquiry, the people said. A representative for the DOJ declined to comment.</p>

<p>In response to questions about the probe, Nvidia said that its market dominance stems from the quality of its products, which deliver faster performance.</p>

<p>"Nvidia wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, who can choose whatever solution is best for them," the company said in an emailed statement.</p>

<p>Nvidia has drawn regulatory scrutiny since becoming the world's most valuable chipmaker and a key beneficiary of the AI spending boom. Sales have been more than doubling each quarter, and it's eclipsed onetime chip leaders such as Intel Corp.</p>

<p>In the DOJ probe, regulators have been investigating Nvidia's acquisition of RunAI, a deal announced in April. That company makes software for managing AI computing, and there are concerns that the tie-up will make it more difficult for customers to switch away from Nvidia chips. Regulators also are inquiring whether Nvidia gives preferential supply and pricing to customers who use its technology exclusively or buy its complete systems, according to the people.</p>

<p>Nvidia, founded in 1993, made its name by selling graphics cards to computer gamers. But its approach to chipmaking ultimately proved useful for building AI models, a process that involves bombarding the software with data. The company also has rapidly expanded its lineup with a range of software, servers, networking and services - all aimed, Nvidia argues, at speeding up the deployment of AI.</p>

<p>Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said he prioritizes customers who can make use of his products in ready-to-go data centers as soon as he provides them, a policy designed to prevent stockpiling and speed up the broader adoption of AI.</p>

<p>The success of its products - along with struggles by rivals to field alternative chips - has made Nvidia a crucial part of the supply chain for some of the biggest companies in the world. Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc., for example, spend more than 40% of their budget for hardware on the chipmaker's gear. During the peak of shortages of Nvidia's H100 accelerator, individual components were retailing for as much as $90,000 each.</p>

<p>Analysts project that Nvidia will chalk up $120.8 billion of revenue in calendar 2024, up from $16 billion in 2020, with most of that money coming from its data center unit. In fact, Nvidia is set to bring in more profit this year than the total sales of its nearest rival, Advanced Micro Devices Inc.</p>

<p>There also are broader regulatory questions about Nvidia's practices. Access to AI capabilities has become a key focus for governments around the world, with the technology becoming increasingly vital to economic strength and national security.</p>

<p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is expected to visit India in October for Nvidia AI Summit at the Jio World Convention Centre in Mumbai.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Sultan Of Brunei's car collection boasts more than 7,000 vehicles and is worth an estimated $5 billion.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi is currently on a diplomatic visit to Brunei and Singapore, aiming to strengthen India's relationships with the Southeast Asian countries. His first stop was Brunei, where he held a meeting with the country's monarch, Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah, at his lavish palace.</p>

<p>The Sultan of Brunei, the second-longest reigning monarch in history, is known for his extravagant lifestyle. One of his most notable possessions is the world's largest private car collection. Valued at $5 billion, his collection features over 7,000 luxury cars, reported Fox News.</p>

<p>The collection was put together with the help of Hassanal's brother, Jefri Bolkiah (also known as Prince Jefri), and other members of the royal family. Since it's impossible to talk about every car he owns, we'll focus on a select few luxury vehicles.</p>

<h3><strong>The Bentleys</strong></h3>

<p>Sultan's car collection includes approximately $80 million worth of classic Bentleys from the 1980s and 1990s, mostly Azure and Continental models. The Bentley Dominator SUV is among the most unique among the selection.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US lenders to Byju's were removed from an influential creditors committee by a court-appointed arbitrator in India, a potential boon for the struggling online-education company seeking to avert bankruptcy.</p>

<p>The decision by the official, who is overseeing an insolvency case against Byju's, means that the lenders won't get a say on who should run the startup and steer a restructuring plan.</p>

<p>The removal is a setback for the lenders, represented by investment firm Glas Trust, and their effort to collect more than $1.2 billion from the troubled startup. Glas Trust has been the most vocal opponent of a settlement agreement Byju's struck with an Indian creditor - the country's cricket governing body - to escape insolvency. The investment firm has filed a petition to void the agreement with the cricket body, arguing that it deserves to be paid first - the arbitrator's decision means technically that the court may allow the settlement to proceed.</p>

<p>The lenders said they didn't get a chance to vote on who should run Byju's while a plan to repay creditors is put together. The lenders accused the official - Byju's Interim Resolution Professional Pankaj Srivastava - of "secretly plotting to reject" their claims and of manipulating the creditor's vote by excluding them.</p>

<p>Before the US lenders even learned that they had been removed, Srivastava held a meeting of the creditors committee and was selected as a "permanent resolution professional," the lenders alleged in an emailed statement. Srivastava didn't respond to an email sent after business hours in India.</p>

<p>"Pankaj Srivastava's actions are unprecedented and entirely illegitimate as no interim resolution professional in the history of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code of India has ever attempted to unlawfully strip financial creditors of claims of this magnitude," the lenders said.</p>

<p>Lenders have been trying to force Byju's into an insolvency proceeding in a court in India for months but with limited success. One part of that court fight is now before India's Supreme Court.</p>

<p>In the US, the lenders have been trying to track down $533 million that Byju's founder, Byju Raveendran, allegedly said was so well hidden, that no one would ever find it, according to court documents.</p>

<p>Byju's faces a fraudulent transfer lawsuit in a US bankruptcy court. That case involves Byju's Alpha, a shell company created by Byju's in order to tap US capital markets. After Byju's defaulted, lenders seized control of the shell company, put it under court protection and sued to get $533 million they claim should go to them.</p>

<p>In India, Byju's had a deal to end the main insolvency case against it, filed by the cricket governing body. The lenders have asked the Supreme Court of India to block that deal, arguing money that should go to them was wrongly being used to pay off the cricket board instead. The court hasn't yet ruled on that appeal.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A year after the man who designed the Nigerian flag died at 87, his family has decided to bury his body. The family had been waiting for the government to fulfill its promise to arranging a state burial for him, but the promise never materialised.</p>

<p>Pa Taiwo Michael Akinkunmi, who died on August 29, 2023, designed the green and white flag while studying in London in the late 1950s. In his design, he evoked Nigeria's agricultural wealth and the peace and unity among its diverse ethnic groups.</p>

<p>The design won a national competition and the new flag unveiled on Nigeria's Independence Day on October 1. Despite his significant contribution, very few people knew about his work and Mr Akinkunmi lived a relatively quiet life, working for the Ministry of Agriculture.</p>

<p>Recognition came later in life, when he was given the Officer of the Order of the Federal Republic (OFR) award in 2014, one of the highest civilian awards in Nigeria.</p>

<p>After his death, a motion was proposed to give him a state burial, but no plans were made, leaving his family to pay for his body to be kept in a mortuary for over a year.</p>

<p>Despite public outcry and a directive from the Ministry of Art, Culture, and the Creative Economy for the National Institute for Cultural Orientation (NICO) to ensure he received a state funeral, there was little follow-through.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately, the Oyo state government stepped in to support the family to give him a befitting burial in early September, just after the one-year anniversary of his passing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In July, severe rainfall triggered landslides and flooding in North Korea, affecting over 4,000 homes and leaving 15,000 residents displaced.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several South Korean media reports suggest that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered the execution of up to 30 officials, allegedly due to their failure to prevent devastating flooding and landslides.&nbsp;The disasters reportedly resulted in approximately 1,000 deaths. According to a report by South Korea's <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://news.tvchosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2024/09/03/2024090390229.html" rel="nofollow, noindex">Chosun TV</a></em>, citing a North Korean official, Kim Jong Un called for ''strict punishment'' to be meted out to those deemed responsible for the ''unacceptable loss'' of life caused by the recent flooding.&nbsp;Officials were also charged with corruption and dereliction of duty.&nbsp;The executions reportedly took place late last month.</p>

<p>''It has been determined that 20 to 30 cadres in the flood-stricken area were executed at the same time late last month,'' the official was quoted as saying.</p>

<p>Although the identities of the executed officials remain undisclosed, the North Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported that Kang Bong-hoon, the secretary of the Chagang Province Provincial Party Committee since 2019, was among the leaders removed from their positions by Kim Jong-un.</p>

<p>In July, severe rainfall triggered landslides and flooding in North Korea, affecting over 4,000 homes and leaving 15,000 residents displaced. Kim Jong Un himself visited the affected areas and stated that it would take several months to rebuild and restore the neighbourhoods that were completely inundated by the floods. The government also provided shelter in Pyongyang facilities for 15,400 people, including vulnerable groups such as mothers, children, the elderly, and disabled soldiers.</p>

<p>However, the North Korean leader denied reports of a high death toll from the flooding, dismissing the claims as "false rumours." He accused South Korea of spreading these rumours as part of a deliberate "smear campaign" designed to damage North Korea's international reputation.</p>

<p>Lee Il-gyu, a former North Korean diplomat at the International Korean Peninsula Forum remarked, "Even though there was recent flood damage, they were dismissed for social security reasons, and the executives themselves are so anxious that they don't know when their necks will fall off."</p>

<p>According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2024/09/103_361356.html" rel="nofollow, noindex">Korea Times</a></em>, North Korea's public executions have surged dramatically since the COVID-19 pandemic. Before the pandemic, the country typically saw around 10 public executions per year. However, that number has skyrocketed to approximately 100 annual public executions, representing a tenfold increase.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Turkish authorities have arrested Liridon Rexhepi, the head of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency's financial network in Turkey, according to a report by state media.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkish authorities have arrested Liridon Rexhepi, the head of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency's financial network in Turkey, according to a report by state media.</p>

<p>On August 30, Istanbul police detained Rexhepi in connection with the allegations of transferring money on behalf of Mossad during an operation, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Rexhepi was formally arrested after a court hearing, during which he admitted to the charges, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported.</p>

<p>The Turkish intelligence agency, MIT, had been monitoring Rexhepi since his entry into the country on August 25.</p>

<p>MIT's investigation revealed that Rexhepi managed financial operations for Mossad and transferred significant amounts of money repeatedly via Western Union to field agents in Turkey.</p>

<p>Rexhepi was also found to have conducted drone surveillance and psychological operations targeting Palestinian politicians.</p>

<p>MIT discovered that Mossad was transferring funds to its field agents in Turkey, primarily from Kosovo and other Eastern European countries, according to Anadolu.</p>

<p>The financial tracking revealed that the funds from Kosovo were being transferred by Mossad's field agents in Turkey to sources in Syria via Western Union and cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Since January, Turkish authorities have detained dozens of people, among them private investigators, on charges of collecting data on individuals, for Israeli intelligence.</p>

<p>Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, sparked by the terror group's slaughter of 1,200 people and kidnapping of 251 in southern Israel on October 7, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been one of the strongest critics of the Jewish state. He has also praised the Hamas terror group as a liberation group.</p>

<p>Turkish police arrested a suspect last week believed to have been transferring money to operatives of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, Turkish security sources said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>In December, the head of Israel's Shin Bet security agency said that his organisation was prepared to target Hamas anywhere, including in Lebanon, Turkey and Qatar.</p>

<p>Turkey warned Israel of "serious consequences" if it tries to hunt down members of the terror group living outside Palestinian territories, including in Turkey.</p>

<p>Since then, Turkish authorities have detained dozens of people, among them private investigators, on charges of collecting data on individuals, mostly Palestinians residing in Turkey, for Israeli intelligence.</p>

<p>In January, Turkey arrested 33 individuals suspected of spying for Israel, according to the country's Interior Minister. The suspects were arrested in eight provinces across the country in what Ankara called Operation Mole.</p>

<p>In February, Turkish police arrested seven suspects on suspicion of selling information to Mossad through private detectives, the state-run Anadolu news agency said. Seven more people, including a private detective, were arrested in March - also for selling information to Mossad. Another two were arrested in April.</p>

<p>Israel has not commented on the arrests.</p>

<p>In May, Turkey halted all trade with Israel, and in August, it filed a request with a UN court to join South Africa's lawsuit accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza.</p>

<p>Erdogan has accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, called for it to be punished in international courts and criticised Western nations for backing Israel. He has compared Israel to Nazi Germany, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.</p>

<p>Turkey and Israel normalised ties in 2022 by reappointing ambassadors following years of tensions. But those links quickly deteriorated after Hamas's October 7 invasion.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia says it has become necessary for Moscow to revise its nuclear doctrine because of Washington's escalation of the war in Ukraine. The Kremlin has blamed the "collective actions of the West" in Ukraine for such a move, spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has reportedly said.</p>

<p>Without revealing what the changes will be to Russia's nuclear doctrine, Moscow has said that certain changes are required to be made on the policy over the circumstances for the use of its nukes.</p>

<p>President Vladimir Putin had set the current nuclear doctrine in place four years ago. According to that, Russia may use nuclear weapons in the scenario where it comes under a nuclear attack or if a conventional attack threatens the existence of the state.</p>

<p>An update to the Russian nuclear doctrine is now necessary "against the backdrop of the challenges and threats provoked by the countries of the so-called collective West", Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has said.</p>

<p>Moscow foresees the likelihood of Ukraine using long-range missiles and other weapons supplied by the United States to attack deep inside Russian territory, Mr Peskov said.</p>

<p>Ukraine has reportedly been negotiating with its allies for Kyiv to use weapons supplied by the West to target deep inside Russian territory. Ukraine's appeals have grown louder and more frequent as Russia has increased its airstrikes to target Ukraine's energy and other infrastructure.</p>

<p>"Ukraine will obviously do this, and we are taking that into account," Mr Peskov reportedly said, according to a Reuters report.</p>

<p>Russia has stepped up its airstrikes on Ukraine. At least 50 people were killed and more than 270 wounded when Russia hit a military institute in Ukraine's central town of Poltava with two ballistic missiles on Tuesday, in the year's single-deadliest attack of the war.</p>

<p>Writing on social media website X, Ukraine's President Zelenskyy vowed that Russia will "surely pay for this strike".</p>

<p>Calling it a "terror attack", Me Zelenskyy wrote, "We continue to urge everyone in the world who has the power to stop this terror: Ukraine needs air defense systems and missiles now, not sitting in storage. Long-range strikes that can protect us from Russian terror are needed now, not later. Every day of delay, unfortunately, means more lost lives."<br />

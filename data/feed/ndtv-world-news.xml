       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A golden eagle attacked a toddler in Norway on Sunday, with her mother and a neighbour fighting the bird off repeatedly until a game warden killed it, Norwegian media reported.</p>

<p>The 20-month-old girl, who was playing on her family's farm in Trondelag in central Norway when the eagle swooped down on her, required stitches to the back of her head and had scratches from the eagle's talons on her face, her father told public broadcaster NRK.</p>

<p>"The eagle came out of nowhere and grabbed our youngest daughter," said the father, whose name was not disclosed.</p>

<p>"Her mother jumped up and grabbed hold of the eagle, but had to fight to get it to let go. A neighbour also had to help her and our little girl," he said.</p>

<p>Gamekeeper Per Kare Vinterdal, who killed the eagle, told NRK the bird saw the little girl as "prey".</p>

<p>He said the mother and neighbour managed to get the eagle off the girl "but it kept coming back" even though "the neighbour chased it away with a stick".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of members of the Indian community were protesting in more than 130 cities across 25 countries on Sunday, organisers said, to demand justice after last month's rape and murder of a trainee doctor at a hospital in the city of Kolkata.</p>

<p>The protests started in large and small groups across Japan, Australia, Taiwan and Singapore, before spreading to cities in several European countries. Sixty were planned in the U.S.</p>

<p>They added to ongoing protests around India after the August 9 killing of the 31-year-old postgraduate student of chest medicine.</p>

<p>A suspect has been arrested along with the former principal of R.G. Kar Medical College where the victim was studying.</p>

<p>At one of the protests in the Swedish capital Stockholm, scores of mainly black-clad women gathered in Sergels Torg square to sing songs in Bengali and hold signs, demanding accountability for the crime and safety for Indian women.</p>

<p>"The news of this heinous crime committed on a young trainee doctor while on duty numbed and shocked each of us at the sheer ruthlessness, brutality and disregard of human life," said Dipti Jain, an organiser of the global protests.</p>

<p>Ms Jain, now a British citizen and alumni of the Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital, had last month organised a female doctors protest in the UK.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court has listed the next hearing of the trainee's case for Monday.</p>

<p>Although tougher laws were introduced after the 2012 gruesome gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a moving bus in New Delhi, activists say the Kolkata case shows how women continue to suffer from sexual violence.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The US presidential race remains neck-and-neck according to polls released Sunday, two days before Kamala Harris and Donald Trump hold their first -- and potentially only -- televised debate.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US presidential race remains neck-and-neck according to polls released Sunday, two days before Kamala Harris and Donald Trump hold their first -- and potentially only -- televised debate.</p>

<p>The latest polling confirms that Trump retains locked-in support from about half of voters, despite the Republican's historic status as a convicted felon and his role in instigating the unprecedented attempt to overturn his 2020 loss to Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Harris, who only jumped into the race after President Biden abruptly quit in July, has rapidly transformed herself from a little-noticed vice president into a serious contender. However, the polls show she has not made a major breakthrough, leaving the race a toss-up.</p>

<p>A New York Times/Siena poll found that 78-year-old Trump is leading Harris nationally by 48 to 47 percent, well within the margin of error.</p>

<p>US presidential elections are decided by tallying the results of state-by-state contests, rather than an overall national popular vote, meaning that a tiny handful of swing states typically decide the balance.</p>

<p>The poll found Harris, 59, narrowly ahead in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania and tied in four other swing states -- Nevada, Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona.</p>

<p>A CBS News/YouGov poll put Harris ahead by one percentage point in Michigan and Wisconsin and tied in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The election is already chaotic, with 81-year-old Biden dropping out amid concerns over his age, Trump narrowly surviving an assassin's bullet at a rally, and fears mounting that Trump will again refuse to concede if he loses in November.</p>

<p>However, the latest numbers confirm that each candidate retains a remarkably stable base of loyalists, almost evenly splitting the country.</p>

<p>One game changer could be Tuesday's ABC News debate, the only one scheduled between the two.</p>

<p>Trump will be under pressure to rein in his characteristic use of insults and intimidation as he stands next to a mixed-race candidate vying to become the first female president in US history.</p>

<p>Harris will need to use the huge viewership to connect with Americans in a way that she was unable to as vice president and has had little time to accomplish in her super-condensed campaign run.</p>

<p>With Trump now the oldest presidential nominee in US history, she is pitching an optimistic, forward-looking message in contrast to Trump's apocalyptic claims that the country faces terminal decline without him in the White House.</p>

<p><strong>Sexist taunts</strong></p>

<p>At the same time, Harris will have to solve the conundrum of how to debate Trump, who habitually makes false statements on nearly every topic and loves to get under his opponents' skin. Biden, in his only debate against Trump before dropping his candidacy, found himself entirely unable to cope.</p>

<p>Already, Trump has been subjecting Harris in his speeches to racist and sexist taunts, deliberately mispronouncing her name and calling her "crazy" and a "Marxist."</p>

<p>"It will take almost superhuman focus and discipline to deal with Donald Trump in a debate," Harris supporter and current transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg told CNN.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign announced it would "barnstorm battleground states" after the debate, beginning in North Carolina, then Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Trump held a rally in Wisconsin on Saturday where he appealed to his mostly white, working class base with a dark speech claiming that he is struggling against a "rogue regime" where Democrats "imported murderers, child predators and serial rapists from all over the planet."</p>

<p>On his Truth Social platform, he warned that once back in the White House he would impose "long prison sentences" on all those he said were planning "cheating" in November.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Israeli airstrike on a house in Jabalia on Sunday killed Mohammad Morsi, deputy director of the Gaza Civil Emergency Service in the northern areas of the Gaza Strip, and four of his family, health officials said.</p>

<p>The Civil Emergency Service said in a statement that Morsi's death raised to 83 the number of its members killed by Israeli fire since Oct. 7.</p>

<p>There was no immediate Israeli comment on Morsi's death.</p>

<p>Residents said Israeli forces had also blown up several houses in the Zeitoun suburb of Gaza City 5 km from Jabalia. Medical teams said they were unable to answer desperate calls by some of the residents who had reported being trapped inside their houses, some wounded.</p>

<p>"We hear constant bombing in Zeitoun, we know they are blowing up houses there, we don't sleep because of the sounds of explosions, the roaring of tanks sound close and the drones don't stop circling," said one resident of Gaza City, who lives around 1 km away.</p>

<p>"The occupation is wiping out Zeitoun, we are afraid about the people trapped in there," he told Reuters via a chat app, refusing to be named.</p>

<p>Later on Sunday, the Gaza health ministry said Israeli military strikes across the enclave killed at least 15 people.</p>

<p>Residents of central and southern Gaza areas reported interruption in internet and communication services, which the Palestinian Telecommunication Company said was because of "the ongoing (Israeli) aggression."</p>

<p>Palestinians say internet and communication outages, the first in months, impact the ability of medical staffers to dispatch ambulances to bombed areas and make it difficult for people to check on their relatives or report attacks.</p>

<p>Israel and Hamas continued to blame one another for the failure of mediators, including Qatar, Egypt and the U.S., to broker a ceasefire. The U.S. is preparing to present a new proposal, but the prospects of a breakthrough appear dim as gaps between the sides' positions remain large.</p>

<p>Meanwhile on Sunday the United Nations, in collaboration with local health authorities, extended by a day a campaign to vaccinate children in the southern Gaza Strip against polio before it moves on Monday to the north.</p>

<p>The campaign aims to vaccinate 640,000 children in Gaza after its first polio case in around 25 years. Limited pauses in the fighting have allowed the campaign to proceed.</p>

<p>U.N. officials said they were making progress, having reached more than half of the children needing the drops in the first two stages in the southern and central Gaza Strip. A second round of vaccination will be required four weeks after the first.</p>

<p>The latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on Oct. 7 when the Hamas group attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent assault on Gaza has killed more than 40,900 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry, while also displacing nearly the entire population of 2.3 million, causing a hunger crisis and leading to genocide allegations at the World Court, which Israel denies.</p>

<p>The Palestinian health ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants in its casualty reports, but health officials say that most of the fatalities have been civilians.</p>

<p>Israel, which has lost 340 soldiers in Gaza, says at least a third of the Palestinian dead are fighters.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 48 people were killed on Sunday in a fuel tanker truck explosion following a collision with another vehicle in north-central Nigeria, the state's disaster management agency said.</p>

<p>The State Emergency Management Agency in north-central Niger state said the fuel truck collided with a truck carrying travellers and cattle. Several other vehicles were also caught up in the accident, it said.</p>

<p>The agency's spokesperson Hussaini Ibrahim put the death count at 48 and officials were still trying to clear the scene of the incident.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moroccan authorities on Sunday said four people died and 14 were missing in flooding caused by an "exceptional" climate phenomenon in southern areas.</p>

<p>"Four people have died and 14 have gone missing" since heavy rains began on Friday in the province of Tata, some 740 kilometres south of Rabat, a local official told AFP, saying the death count could potentially rise.</p>

<p>"Eight houses were washed away by floods in some valleys" near Tamanart, a rural area in the Tata region, said the official, who did not wish to be named.</p>

<p>Usually arid areas in southern Morocco and Algeria have been drenched in floods caused by massive rainfall since Friday, officials told AFP Sunday.</p>

<p>Areas in southern Morocco have been affected "by an extremely unstable tropical air mass", the spokesman for the Moroccan General Directorate of Meteorology, Lhoussaine Youabd, told AFP.</p>

<p>This "led to the formation of unstable and violent clouds" that caused massive rainfall, he said.</p>

<p>Youabd described the phenomenon as "exceptional" and said the areas saw "heavy thunderstorms and significant rainfall, leading to river flooding" as "humid tropical air masses moved northward".</p>

<p>As a result, the Ouarzazate region received 47 millimetres of water in three hours, and Tagounite, near the Algerian border, some 170 millimetres, according to the Moroccan weather service.</p>

<p>The heavy rains hit regions of Morocco that have been suffering from drought for at least six years.</p>

<p>In neighbouring Algeria, authorities meanwhile confirmed one person dead and one missing in flooding in the south.</p>

<p>Algerian civil defence said an unnamed young girl was swept away by the waters in Illizi, in the far south, and another person who was trapped in a vehicle was still missing.</p>

<p>It also said it had rescued several families trapped by flooded rivers, mostly in Illizi and Bechar, also in the south.</p>

<p>Videos posted on social media showed that some areas in the Sahara desert were drenched.</p>

<p>In Morocco's Ouarzazate, entire streets were flooded.</p>

<p>"We haven't seen such rain for about 10 years," Omar Gana, a local, told AFP.</p>

<p>Morocco has been experiencing severe water stress after six consecutive years of drought, shrinking dam levels to less than 28 percent of capacity by the end of August.</p>

<p>The rains were accompanied by strong winds, reaching up to 100 kilometres per hour in Ouarzazate and 76 km/h in Marrakesh, where they caused "an optical phenomenon, giving the sky an orange tint", according to the General Directorate of Meteorology.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Latvia's president on Sunday said a Russian military drone had crashed on its territory, adding that airspace breaches had increased along NATO's eastern borders.</p>

<p>The Baltic state, which was once ruled by the Soviet Union but is now an EU and NATO member, has had tense relations with Moscow following independence, and ties have further deteriorated since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.</p>

<p>A "Russian military drone... crashed in the eastern part of Latvia yesterday. There is an ongoing investigation," Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics said on X.</p>

<p>"We are in close contact with our allies. The number of such incidents is increasing along the eastern flank of NATO and we must address them collectively," he added.</p>

<p>Latvia's defence ministry said in a statement that the drone had flown into the country's airspace from Belarus and crashed in the municipality of Rezekne.</p>

<p>"This situation is a confirmation that we need to continue the work we have started to strengthen Latvia's eastern border, including the development of air defence capabilities and electronic warfare capabilities to limit the activities of UAVs of different applications," said Defence Minister Andris Spruds.</p>

<p>Fellow NATO member Romania also on Sunday said a Russian attack drone targeting civilian infrastructure in neighbouring Ukraine overnight had entered its airspace.</p>

<p>Bucharest strongly condemned the "renewed violation" brought on by Moscow's "illegal attacks".</p>

<p>Since launching its invasion, Russia has repeatedly carried out night attacks on cities across Ukraine, frequently targeting ports in the southern Odesa region after exiting a grain export deal.</p>

<p>Poland has also recorded at least two cases of its airspace being violated by Russian missiles or drones attacking Ukraine, most recently in December.</p>

<p>Warsaw late last month declared that a flying object had intruded into its airspace but later backtracked on the claim.</p>

<p>In an interview with the Financial Times published last week, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said Warsaw should have the right to shoot down Russian missiles targeting Ukraine before they enter Polish airspace, despite NATO opposition.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mother of the teenager charged with fatally shooting two students and two teachers at a Georgia high school on Wednesday called the school that morning and warned a counselor about an "extreme emergency," the Washington Post reported.</p>

<p>Marcee Gray, the mother of the suspected shooter, 14-year-old Colt Gray, said she told the counselor to find her son immediately, the newspaper reported. Phone records provided by a relative to the Post show a 10-minute call to Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia, at 9:50 a.m., about 30 minutes before the attack began.</p>

<p>Gray declined to detail what prompted her call but told the Post on Saturday she had shared that with law enforcement. She expressed remorse for the "pain and suffering" that the victims and their families are going through.</p>

<p>A school administrator went to her son's math class that morning, according to another student, the Post reported, but he was not in the room.</p>

<p>The Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the lead investigative agency, referred questions to the Piedmont Judicial Circuit District Attorney's Office, which is prosecuting the case. The office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday.</p>

<p>Colt Gray has been charged as an adult with four counts of murder. His father, Colin Gray, is also charged with murder, involuntary manslaughter and cruelty to children, in an emerging legal strategy to hold parents responsible for allowing access to firearms to minors who carry out attacks.</p>

<p>Prosecutors say Colin Gray provided the weapon used in the shooting.</p>

<p>In May 2023, investigators from a neighboring county interviewed both Colin and Colt Gray about online threats to carry out a school shooting. Colt Gray said he had not made the threats, and his father said his son did not have free access to his hunting rifles.</p>

<p>The case was closed after investigators could not substantiate that either Gray was connected to the threats.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[He died from multiple organ failure due to a pneumococcal infection, often linked to a weakened immune system.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a tragic incident that highlights the devastating effects of overwork, a 30-year-old Chinese man died from organ failure after a gruelling 104-day work stretch with only one day of rest. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3277316/china-man-30-worked-104-days-1-day-dies-organ-failure-court-orders-compensation" rel="nofollow, noindex">South China Morning Post</a></em>,&nbsp;the man identified as A'bao, who worked as a painter, contracted a pneumococcal infection leading to his death in June 2023. Notably,&nbsp;A'bao had entered into a contractual agreement with a company&nbsp;in February last year, committing to work on a project until January of this year.</p>

<p>Following the signing of the contract, A'bao was assigned to a work project located in Zhoushan, a city in the eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang. He then&nbsp;embarked on an exhausting work schedule, working every day for 104 consecutive days from February to May last year, with only one day of rest on April 6. On May 25, he finally took a sick day, feeling unwell and spending the day resting in his dormitory. However, his condition rapidly deteriorated, and by May 28, he had to be rushed to the hospital by his colleagues. Doctors diagnosed him with a lung infection and respiratory failure. He died on June 1.</p>

<p>After his death, his family filed a lawsuit against his employer, alleging gross negligence. The legal action came after social security officials controversially ruled that A'bao's death could not be classified as a work-related injury, citing the timing of his death as the reason. However, his family argued that the prolonged period of excessive work and lack of rest contributed directly to A'bao's death.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the company also claimed that A'bao's workload was reasonable and that any additional hours worked were voluntary. Further, the company shifted the blame to A'bao's pre-existing health conditions and alleged that his failure to seek timely medical attention aggravated his situation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, a Chinese court ruled in favour of the painter's family, holding A'bao's employer 20% liable for his death.&nbsp;The court found that A'bao died from multiple organ failure due to a pneumococcal infection, often linked to a weakened immune system. The court also determined&nbsp;that A'bao's prolonged work period of 104 consecutive days was a blatant violation of Chinese Labour Law, which explicitly stipulates a maximum of 8 working hours per day and an average of 44 hours per week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The court awarded A'bao's family a total of 400,000 yuan (approximately Rs 47,46,000) in compensation, comprising financial reparation and a separate sum of 10,000 yuan for emotional distress. Though the company appealed, the original verdict was upheld in August.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Greece plans to impose a 20-euro levy on cruise ship visitors to the islands of Santorini and Mykonos during the peak summer season, in a bid to avert overtourism, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Sunday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greece plans to impose a 20-euro levy on cruise ship visitors to the islands of Santorini and Mykonos during the peak summer season, in a bid to avert overtourism, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Sunday.</p>

<p>Greece relies heavily on tourism, the main driver of the country's economy which is still recovering from a decade-long crisis that wiped out a fourth of its output.</p>

<p>But some of its most popular destinations, including Santorini, an idyllic island of quaint villages and pristine beaches with 20,000 permanent residents, risk being ruined by mass tourism.</p>

<p>Speaking at a press conference a day after outlining his main economic policies for 2025, Mitsotakis clarified that excessive tourism was only a problem in a few destinations.</p>

<p>"Greece does not have a structural overtourism problem... Some of its destinations have a significant issue during certain weeks or months of the year, which we need to deal with," he said.</p>

<p>"Cruise shipping has burdened Santorini and Mykonos and this is why we are proceeding with interventions," he added, announcing the levy.</p>

<p>Greek tourism revenues stood at about 20 billion euros in 2023 on the back of nearly 31 million tourist arrivals.</p>

<p>In Santorini, protesters have called for curbs on tourism, as in other popular holiday destinations in Europe, including Venice and Barcelona.</p>

<p>Part of the revenues from the cruise shipping tax will be returned to local communities to be invested in infrastructure, Mitsotakis said.</p>

<p>The government also plans to regulate the number of cruise ships that arrive simultaneously at certain destinations, while rules to protect the environment and tackle water shortages must also be imposed on islands, he said.</p>

<p>Greece also wants to increase a tax on short-term rentals and ban new licenses for such rentals in central Athens to increase the housing stock for permanent residents, Mitsotakis said on Saturday.</p>

<p>The government will detail some of the measures on Monday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prominent Egyptian archaeologist and former antiquities minister Zahi Hawass has launched a petition for the return to Egypt of the pharaonic bust of Queen Nefertiti from the Neues Museum in Berlin.</p>

<p>Nefertiti's famous painted limestone bust was uncovered at Tell el-Amarna, around 300 km (185 miles) south of Cairo, in 1912 by a German archaeological mission, which shipped it to Berlin the following year.</p>

<p>Amarna was the short-lived capital of Nefertiti's husband, the 18th dynasty Pharaoh Akhenaten, who reigned until about 1335 BC.</p>

<p>Akhenaten, called the heretic king, was notorious for promoting the worship of the god Aten to the exclusion of Egypt's other gods. His reign also introduced a radical change in Egyptian art.</p>

<p>In his petition launched on Saturday, Hawass asked for the return of the bust, saying it was removed from Egypt illegally after its discovery.</p>

<p>"We announce today that Egypt - this is the national committee, it is not a government committee - asks for the return of the bust of Nefertiti," Hawass said.</p>

<p>"What I need from everyone here is to go to my website... hawasszahi.com, and you will sign, one signature, to show that you would love for this bust to come back."</p>

<p>Hawass said he is not calling for the repatriation of artefacts taken out of Egypt legally. His campaign is focused on repatriating "three main beautiful objects" including the bust of Nefertiti, the Rosetta Stone and the Dendera Zodiac.</p>

<p>Officials at Berlin's Neues Museum were not immediately available for comment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Michael Brodkorb, former deputy chair of Minnesota Republican Party, is part of a growing wave that could affect the outcome of the November election: lifelong Republicans who have broken with Donald Trump to support Vice President Kamala Harris.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michael Brodkorb, former deputy chair of the Minnesota Republican Party, finds himself part of an unlikely yet growing wave that could affect the outcome of the November election: lifelong Republicans who have broken with Donald Trump to support Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>The movement is without precedent in American presidential politics. Its ranks now include hundreds of staffers of former Republican presidents and nominees, retired senior military officers, White House lawyers going back to Ronald Reagan's administration and many others.</p>

<p>I've known Brodkorb for years. He was a hardcore party guy who delighted in finding dirt on the opposition, including launching an early blog he called "Minnesota Democrats Exposed."</p>

<p>But he and others in this breakaway group no longer recognize their party under Trump - a party without principles, without history, and built entirely around a cult of personality.</p>

<p>These are not people who have abandoned their conservative principles. Certainly not former Minnesota Governor Arne Carlson, who last month said in an opinion piece that "the Republican Party will continue its obedience to Trump and destroy our democracy." Nor Mesa, Arizona Mayor John Giles, who co-chairs Republicans for Harris. Nor Jim McCain, son of late Arizona Senator John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee. Nor former Wyoming Representative Liz Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and vocal Trump critic, who on Wednesday announced that she will vote for Harris. Cheney, whose criticism of the former president's efforts to overturn the 2020 election and vote to impeach him cost her her seat, said it wasn't enough to not vote for Trump.</p>

<p>"It is crucially important for people to recognize - not only is what I've just said about the danger that Trump poses something that should prevent people from voting for him, but I don't believe we have the luxury of writing in candidates' names, particularly in swing states," Cheney said during an appearance at Duke University.</p>

<p>Her father, who served two terms under President George W. Bush, said Friday that he also plans to vote for Harris.</p>

<p>"In our nation's 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump," former Vice President Cheney said in a statement. "He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. He can never be trusted with power again.</p>

<p>"As citizens, we each have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution. That is why I will be casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris," he said.</p>

<p>These "normie" Republicans, as they often call themselves, have a daunting task. To succeed, they must build a structure that allows Republicans to adhere to their conservative beliefs yet gives them permission to act decisively to block the threat of a second Trump term.</p>

<p>The key won't be in forcing them to move left. They don't want to abandon a lifetime of GOP principles, including believing in small government, free trade, and a strong defense. Neither will it come from Harris lunging right. Doing so would risk too much of her progressive base.</p>

<p>Instead, it will take a skillful reframing of what's at stake in this election and the GOP's role. It centers around a simple message: Country before party, together with a recognition that the old Republican party is gone and that, in Giles' words, "We don't owe a damn thing to what's been left behind."</p>

<p>This will be a temporary truce, but one that could yield extraordinary benefits for the country and, ultimately, a new Republican Party finally free of Trump's toxic, decade-long hold.</p>

<p>The spirit of compromise needed to vote for the opposition's nominee could become the building block for a new, more principled and ultimately more successful Republican Party. In aligning with Harris, these Republicans display a level of discipline and maturity that will bode well for rebuilding their party.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Such an approach could have yielded the strong border policy crafted by a bipartisan group of senators and maliciously torpedoed by Trump. It could have tempered Democratic spending without resorting to gridlock. It could have shifted focus from the culture war nonsense to the harder but gratifying work of building a stronger economy.</p>

<p>A CBS opinion poll in August showed that 9% of likely voters who support Trump are prepared to at least consider voting for Harris. Tapping into that discontent, Republican Voters Against Trump launched an $11.5 million ad campaign in critical battleground states, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The ads feature former Trump voters talking calmly about why they are voting for Harris.</p>

<p>One of those voters, Lars Svahoe, 66, calls himself a strong-on-defense fiscal conservative. Trump, he says in a YouTube video explaining his choice, "turned out to be a disappointment. A clown." Deporting 10 to 12 million undocumented immigrants "quite literally frightens me. That's not what we want in a Republican party."</p>

<p>That type of relatable persuasion, which meets voters where they are, can be remarkably effective. It was just such a campaign that made Minnesota the first state to defeat a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage in 2012. Similar bans had already passed in each of the 30 states where they had been introduced.</p>

<p>Harris is wisely seizing on this new movement and making it easy for these disillusioned Republicans to join her. She is openly courting the disaffected, offering a sign-up to "reach out to other Republican, Independent and Trump-skeptical voters" about supporting her campaign. Republicans, including Giles, were given prominent speaking roles at the Democratic National Convention last month. Former Illinois Representative Adam Kinzinger, who along with Cheney served on the committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack and was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, was taken aback by the warm and thunderous reception he received from Democratic delegates.</p>

<p>Harris also has begun offering sensible, middle-of-the-road policies, such as her proposal on small business startups, that belie Trump's attempts to categorize her as "Komrade Kamala." She has promised to sign the bipartisan border bill, showing that compromise does not have to be a dirty word.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have held together as a nation this long because the ties that bind Americans together are far greater than what divides us: the rule of law, the enduring principles in the Constitution, freedom that does not forsake responsibility, and an acknowledgment that the world still looks to this country as a leader.</p>

<p>If there is a new Silent Majority today, it's the Republicans who yearn to break free of Trump's dystopian vision of America on the brink of ruin but have done nothing.</p>

<p>The Republicans who can look past tribal divisions and cross party lines to vote for Harris can also provide something else this country desperately needs: a win decisive enough to shatter Trump's fallback for challenging the election results.</p>

<p>Giles is actively stumping for Harris. Brodkorb says he is doing persuasion talks with Republicans, holding Zooms and creating lists. "I put my door-knocking shoes back on for the first time in a long time," he told me.</p>

<p>Giles and Brodkorb are right. It's not enough to stay home. It's not even enough to vote for Harris. Republicans who want to defeat Trump and reclaim their party will need to reach out to others and build that breakaway group until MAGA fades into obscurity.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, arrived in New Delhi on his first official visit to India at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Sunday.</p>

<p>Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal received the visiting dignitary at the airport and accorded a ceremonial welcome.</p>

<p>This is Zayed Al Nahyan's first visit to India as the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and he is accompanied by several Ministers from the UAE government and a business delegation.</p>

<p>The Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on September 9 and hold discussions on a wide range of areas of bilateral cooperation.</p>

<p>He is also scheduled to call on President Droupadi Murmu and will visit Rajghat to pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi.</p>

<p>On September 10, the visiting Crown Prince will visit Mumbai to participate in a business forum, in which business leaders from both countries will participate.</p>

<p>"India and UAE share historically close and friendly ties. In recent years, the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between India and UAE has deepened in a wide range of areas including political, trade, investment, connectivity, energy, technology, education, and culture. The Crown Prince's visit will further reinforce strong India-UAE bilateral relations and open avenues for partnership in new and emerging areas," the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) stated, earlier this week.</p>

<p>In January, UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan visited India and explored ways to further build upon the strategic partnership between the two countries during his discussions with PM Modi. He also attended the 10th edition of the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit.</p>

<p>In July 2023, PM Modi visited the UAE - his fifth visit to the country since 2015 when he became the first Prime Minister of India to visit the UAE in 34 years.</p>

<p>The India-UAE relationship was formally elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership during the visit of Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to India in 2017.</p>

<p>According to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), India-UAE trade rose to USD 85 billion in 2022, making the UAE India's third-largest trading partner for the year 2022-23 and India's second-largest export destination. India is the UAE's second largest trading partner.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[What exactly causes vitiligo is not clear, but experts say that environmental stress factors can contribute to its onset.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman in China has claimed that her 11-year-old son, Liu, developed Vitiligo, a condition causing white patches on the skin, after being slapped by his teacher. The teacher's harsh punishment was for not completing his mathematics homework, the<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3277077/china-mother-claims-son-suffers-loss-skin-pigmentation-after-being-slapped-teacher"> South China Morning Post</a></em> reported. Liu, a student at Yifu Primary School, told his mother that his teacher humiliated him by bringing him to the front of the classroom, and then slapped him three times on the right side of his face and once on the left.</p>

<p>Following the incident, Liu's mother surnamed Huang, noticed severe swelling on her son's face and took him to the hospital for medical attention.&nbsp;Three months after the incident, Liu began to exhibit a distressing physical symptom: the loss of pigmentation in certain areas of his skin. Although the exact causes of vitiligo are still not fully understood, research suggests that environmental stress factors, such as physical or emotional trauma, may play a role in triggering the onset of the condition.</p>

<p>The school is currently awaiting the outcome of a police investigation and a forensic injury assessment, which will inform their decision on disciplinary actions against the teacher responsible for the incident. The teacher's identity, including their gender, has not been disclosed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Liu's mother has expressed frustration at being unable to contact the teacher or receive reimbursement for her son's medical expenses, despite the hospital having sent the bill to the teacher.&nbsp;Research from the National Institutes of Health reveals that individuals with vitiligo are more likely to experience anxiety or depression.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On social media, the incident has sparked outrage and many users demanded strict punishment against the teacher.&nbsp;One user wrote, ''How could a teacher hurt a student so badly without receiving any punishment for three months?'' Another said, ''Slapping a boy in the face is a step too far.''</p>

<p>Notably, China's law bans teachers from inflicting corporal punishments on students. However,&nbsp;incidents of teachers abusing students continue to be a massive problem.&nbsp;Last year, a nine-year-old girl underwent emergency surgery for a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/chinese-student-hospitalised-with-shattered-skull-after-teacher-beats-her-4400141" rel="nofollow, noindex">severely damaged skull,</a> after a teacher allegedly used a metal ruler to hit her on the head. The teacher, identified as Song Mouming, was employed at Bocai Meixihu Primary School in Hunan province, central China. He was arrested by the local police after the incident.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh will take necessary steps to extradite deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina from India to try her on charges of mass killings during the student-led mass movement against her government, the newly-appointed chief prosecutor of the country's International Crimes Tribunal said on Sunday.</p>

<p>Following unprecedented anti-government protests that peaked on August 5, Hasina resigned as prime minister and fled to India.</p>

<p>Necessary steps will be taken to bring former prime minister Hasina back under the extradition treaty with India to try her on charges of mass killings during the student-led protests in July and August, International Crimes Tribunal Chief Prosecutor Md Tajul Islam was quoted as saying by The Daily Star newspaper.</p>

<p>"We will file an application with the International Crimes Tribunal, when it resumes functions, to issue arrest warrants against all the accused including Sheikh Hasina in connection with the cases filed for mass killing and crimes against humanity," he said at a press briefing on the ICT premises in Dhaka.</p>

<p>Replying to a question, he said a decision would be taken after consulting with the government about amendments to the existing International Crimes Tribunal Act for holding trial of the new cases filed with IT.</p>

<p>"Information, documents and evidence against the accused persons will have to be collected from across the country and those will have to be compiled, examined and placed properly before the tribunal, which is very much challenging and huge task," Islam added.</p>

<p>According to the interim government's Health Adviser Nurjahan Begum, more than 1,000 people have been killed and hundreds injured during the protests against the Hasina-led government.</p>

<p>Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) last month launched an investigation against Hasina and nine others on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity that took place from July 15 to August 5 during the students' mass movement.</p>

<p>Islam said the International Crimes Tribunal and its investigation team will have to be reconstituted by appointing new judges and investigators as previous judges, prosecution team and investigation agency appointed by the previous government have stepped down after the interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus was formed in the country following the fall of the Hasina-led government.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, who is currently in Saudi Arabia for a key Gulf summit, will travel to Germany and Switzerland later this week on an official visit.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar will reach Berlin, Germany, on Tuesday for a two-day official visit - his third visit as Foreign Minister to Berlin.</p>

<p>The minister will meet the German Federal Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock as well as the leadership and other ministers from the German government with an aim to review the entire gamut of bilateral relations between India and Germany, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said.</p>

<p>"Both India and Germany share a robust Strategic Partnership and Germany is one of India's prominent trading partners and among the largest Foreign Direct Investors," the MEA said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar is currently in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to attend the First India-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Foreign Ministers' Meeting. His visit comes as India looks to bolster its ties in West Asia, popularly called the Middle East.</p>

<p>The Gulf Cooperation Council is a political and economic union of six countries in the Gulf region- Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and Oman.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After his Germany visit, Mr Jaishankar will travel to Geneva, Switzerland, from September 12 to 13. Mr Jaishankar will meet the Swiss Foreign Minister to review the close partnership between the two countries and explore avenues to enhance the bilateral relationship further, according to the MEA.</p>

<p>Geneva is home to some of the most important international organisations and UN agencies, including the World Health Organisation, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, and the International Labour Organisation.</p>

<p>The minister is expected to meet the heads and representatives of international organisations with whom India is actively engaged.</p>

<p>As the most populous country in the world and among the top 5 global economies, India has been vying for permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council for years. Countries like Russia, France, the US, and the UK have endorsed India's bid, with China being the only hindrance.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ahead of the iPhone 16 series launch, a throwback video of Apple CEO Tim Cook has gone viral on social media where he addresses the common misconceptions about why the US-based company invested in China for manufacturing of its products.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple, the Cupertino tech giant, relies on the vast manufacturing network in China for the mass production of its iPhone and other devices. In recent times, the company has also shifted focus to other key markets, including India, to diversify its manufacturing base.<br />
<br />
Now, days ahead of the highly-anticipated launch of the iPhone 16 series, an old video of Apple CEO Tim Cook has gained significant attention on social media. In the viral video, Cook is seen addressing the common misconception about why the US-based company has invested heavily in China for its product manufacturing.<br />
<br />
Debunking the common belief that companies flock to China for cheap labour, Mr Cook said, "There is a confusion about China. And let me at least give you my opinion. The popular conception is that companies come to China because of low labour costs. I am not sure what part of China they go to, but the truth is China stopped being a low labour cost country many years ago."<br />
<br />
The Apple CEO elaborated on the advanced tooling and precision required to produce the products and highlighted China's vocational expertise in these areas.<br />
<br />
"The reason is because of the skill, the quantity of skill in one location, and the type of skill it is," he said.<br />
<br />
Mr Cook noted that the product it makes requires "really advanced tooling and the precision that you have to have in tooling and working with the materials that we do are state of the art."&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"And the tooling skill is very deep here. You know, in the US, you could have a meeting of tooling engineers, and I am not sure we could fill the room. In China, you could fill multiple football fields. It's that vocational expertise is very, very deep here," he added.<br />
<br />
The throwback clip of Tim Cook was shared on social media site X and has garnered six million views so far. It also caught the attention of Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who agreed with his views.<br />
<br />
In the comments section, Mr Musk wrote, "True".</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">True</p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1831928290132816139?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 6, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p><br />
Mr Musk's comment on the Chinese manufacturing sector came just months after his surprise visit to the Asian country where he plans to introduce Tesla's self-driving technology to a market with ferocious competition.<br />
<br />
On his trip, he met with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, who praised Tesla as a “successful model” for US-China collaboration.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Apple is currently gearing up for its mega event, 'It's Glowtime'. The tech giant will roll out its all-new iPhone 16 series, besides setting the stage for a new artificial intelligence platform.<br />
<br />
The event will take place at 10:30 PM on September 9 in India.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A truck driver shot dead three Israeli guards at a border crossing between the occupied West Bank and Jordan Sunday before being "eliminated", Israel's military said, as it pounded Gaza with new strikes.</p>

<p>Jordan's interior ministry identified the shooter as Jordanian national Maher Diab Hussein al-Jazi, citing "preliminary investigations".</p>

<p>The rare attack at the Allenby Bridge crossing comes amid soaring violence in the West Bank with major Israeli raids and attacks by Palestinians, and against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas Gaza war, now in its 12th month.</p>

<p>The military said "a terrorist" reached the crossing area, also known as the King Hussein Bridge, in a truck "from Jordan".</p>

<p>The driver "exited the truck and opened fire at Israeli security forces operating at the bridge", a military statement said.</p>

<p>"Three Israeli civilians were pronounced dead as a result of the attack," it said, clarifying to AFP that they were "security guards" and not in the army or police.</p>

<p>The attacker was shot dead, the military added.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced the assailant as a "despicable terrorist" inspired by "a murderous ideology" which he said was fuelled by Iran.</p>

<p>Hamas praised the attack but did not claim responsibility for it, adding it "affirms the Arab peoples' rejection of the (Israeli) occupation, its crimes, and its ambitions in Palestine and Jordan".</p>

<p>The crossing, in the Jordan Valley, is the only international gateway for Palestinians from the West Bank that does not require entering Israel, which has occupied the territory since 1967.</p>

<p><strong>Bloodshed rises in West Bank</strong></p>

<p>Violence in the West Bank has surged alongside the war in Gaza which began after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7.</p>

<p>Israel's military on August 28 launched simultaneous raids across several cities and refugee camps in the northern West Bank, killing at least 36 Palestinians, according to the Ramallah-based Palestinian health ministry.</p>

<p>The military said it killed 35 operatives. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad claimed at least 14 of the fatalities as members.</p>

<p>Since October 7, Israeli troops or settlers have killed at least 662 Palestinians in the West Bank, according to the Palestinian health ministry.</p>

<p>At least 23 Israelis, including members of the security forces, have been killed in Palestinian attacks during the same period, Israeli officials say.</p>

<p>The Hamas attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians including some hostages killed in captivity, official Israeli figures show.</p>

<p>Operatives seized 251 hostages during the attack, 97 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has so far killed at least 40,972 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.</p>

<p>The UN human rights office says most of the dead are women and children.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Israel pounded Gaza with air strikes and shelling as prospects remained dim for a ceasefire.</p>

<p>Gaza's civil defence agency said nearly a dozen people were killed in Israeli air strikes on Sunday, including five in Jabalia refugee camp.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it had struck around "25 Hamas targets" across Gaza over the past day.</p>

<p><strong>No respite for Gazans</strong></p>

<p>There has been no respite for the 2.4 million Palestinians living in Gaza, almost all of whom have been displaced at least once.</p>

<p>"Moving from one area to another is distressing because there is no safe place in Gaza," said Raeed Hamad, 51, a cancer patient from the southern city of Khan Yunis.</p>

<p>"We are displaced under heavy bombardments... I have lost weight and I'm exhausted."</p>

<p>Defence Minister Yoav Gallant toured the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza on Sunday, where he vowed again to eliminate Hamas.</p>

<p>But he said the military was focusing on the northern front also, where Lebanese group Hezbollah and Israeli forces traded fire on Sunday.</p>

<p>"While you are fighting here in Gaza, we are preparing for anything that may happen in the north," Gallant told soldiers, according to a statement issued by his office.</p>

<p>"The shift of the centre of gravity can happen quickly and can also involve you in a short period of time."</p>

<p>Hamas is demanding a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza as part of a ceasefire deal, but Israel insists troops must remain along the Gaza-Egypt border.</p>

<p>The United States, Qatar and Egypt have all been mediating in efforts to forge a ceasefire.</p>

<p>Israeli protesters numbering in the tens of thousands have mounted pressure on the government, demanding a deal that would mean the release of hostages.</p>

<p>Late Saturday, mass protests were again held in Tel Aviv and some other cities. Organisers said more than 500,000 people took part.</p>

<p>"We must demand that no one forgets the hostages, no one ignores them, no one leaves them to die," said Andrey Kozlov, one of the scores of hostages freed during the one-week truce in November.</p>

<p>"Their time is running out. We see it, we feel it. Bring them back home now."</p>

<p>A smaller crowd of several hundred people gathered in Tel Aviv on Sunday night holding Israeli flags and signs demanding the government "stop the war" and free the hostages.</p>

<p>"We will not leave them in Gaza," they chanted, some pounding on drums. "We will not leave them down there... We don't want more deaths, it's time for agreements."</p>

<p>International pressure to end the war has also intensified after Friday's fatal shooting in the West Bank of Turkish-American activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, who was demonstrating against Israeli settlements in the territory.</p>

<p>Her family, Turkey and the UN rights office all said Israeli forces killed her. Israel's military said the incident is under review.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

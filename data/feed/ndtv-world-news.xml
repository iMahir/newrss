       <description><![CDATA[Mars, Earth's closest neighbor, has long captivated human imagination with the possibility of extraterrestrial life just a short rocket journey away.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mars is one of Earth's nearest space neighbours, and the idea of finding extraterrestrial life there, only a short rocket journey away, has long attracted human curiosity. Such life has not been discovered. However, since NASA and other space agencies have started employing robotic technology to examine the Red Planet's surface and skies, pictures of odd formations and features have continued to excite scientists and space enthusiasts curiosity and inspire both fear and optimism.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/bear-face-spotted-on-mars-as-nasa-observes-rock-formation-3728042"><strong>Also Read | "Bear Face" Spotted On Mars As NASA Observes Rock Formation</strong></a></p>

<p>From an open travel book to the face of a teddy bear, frozen mineral flowers, a mysterious doorway, and fossilised animal tracks, there are numerous intriguing objects on Mars that seem out of place on a barren, dusty planet, igniting human curiosity.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eerie-discovery-on-mars-looks-exactly-like-a-human-face"><em>Science Alert</em></a>, an image captured by the Perseverance rover in the course of its duties is one of the grisliest yet: it looks, for all the world, like a desiccated, decaying human head, severed from any body, just withering away under the harsh light of the Sun.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/raw-images/ZR0_1282_0780746892_644EBY_N0600390ZCAM09338_1100LMJ">NASA's Mars Perseverance rover</a> acquired this image using its Right Mastcam-Z camera. Mastcam-Z is a pair of cameras located high on the rover's mast. This image was acquired on September 27, 2024 (Sol 1282) at the local mean solar time of 11:50:05.</p>

<p>It looks like a chunk of sedimentary sandstone, not unlike other rocks around it. Which isn't unusual for Mars, especially where water is once thought to have flowed, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eerie-discovery-on-mars-looks-exactly-like-a-human-face"><em>Science Alert.</em></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>“The mass murderer Yahya Sinwar, responsible for the massacre and atrocities of October 7, was eliminated... by IDF (Israeli military) soldiers,” Foreign Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.</p>

<p>Later IDF released a video message of his Spokesperson RAdm. Daniel Hagari, talking about the killing of Sinwar and Israel's operational goals in Gaza. “Sinwar was responsible for the most brutal attack against Israel in our history. When terrorists from Gaza invaded Israel, massacred Israelis in their homes, raped our women, burned entire families alive, and took over 250 men, women, children, and babies hostage into Gaza. 101 hostages still remain in captivity in brutal conditions for the past year,” he said. Mr Hagari said that Sinwar tried to escape justice but he failed but the Israeli military did it.</p>

<p>Blaming Yahya Sinwar for waging war with Israel, while hiding behind civilians in Gaza, Mr Hagari reiterated, “Our war is with Hamas, not with the people of Gaza and we mean it.”</p>

<p>“We are working to increase the amount of humanitarian aid including food, water and medicine that goes into Gaza, to the people of Gaza who are suffering because of Yahya Sinwar,” he said and expressed condolences to the families of those murdered or kidnapped because of Sinwar.</p>

<p>“We bow our heads and remember how brave soldiers who paid their ultimate sacrifice to defend the people of Israel,” he added.</p>

<p>IDF is committed to “not rest” until they bring home all hostages “by any means”.</p>

<p>“We will continue to operate until we complete all our missions in defense of the people of Israel,” he signed off.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Chilean gymnast and social media influencer Maria del Mar 'Marimar' Perez Banus has sparked outrage in Japan after using a sacred Shinto Torii gate for a workout video.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In order to create new content and gain more views from their followers, social media influencers are going way too far in their daily activities, and this is occasionally hurting people's religious sentiments.</p>

<p>Recently, a Chilean gymnast and social media influencer, Maria del Mar 'Marimar' Perez Banus, has caused massive outrage in Japan for using a sacred symbol to create physical workout video. She recorded the video and also uploaded it to her accounts on the different social media platforms.</p>

<p>In the video, which she initially uploaded to her Instagram account and then deleted following the controversy-although it went viral on other social networks-the young woman can be seen using a Torii as a bar to do pull-ups.</p>

<p><strong>Watch video here:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Torii, although at first glance they appear to be simple structures, are a sacred gate or traditional arch that is usually placed at the entrance of Shinto shrines to mark the border between profane and sacred ground. The presence of a torii at the entrance is usually the simplest way to identify Shinto shrines.</p>

<p>Perez held onto the symbol and performed leg movements to the beat of DJ Casper's song 'Cha Cha Slide.'</p>

<p>The video has now been deleted from the couple's combined Instagram account; however, it has had over 40 million views after being shared on X/Twitter.</p>

<p>More than 3,000 comments slammed the tourists, calling them "vulgar and uneducated," "disrespectful," and "attention seekers." The former gymnasts apologised in a video posted on Tuesday (15 October) to their followers.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China will prefer Kamala Harris to Donald Trump as the next US presidential considering that bilateral ties deteriorated sharply during the latter's presidency leading to serious confrontation, a senior member of the Chinese national advisory body said on Thursday.</p>

<p>The Chinese government prefers not to comment on the US presidential election because it doesn't want to be accused of interfering in American domestic politics, Jia Qingguo, member of the Standing Committee of the national advisory body CPPCC said.</p>

<p>The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is a key component of the state governance system and a distinctively Chinese political institution.</p>

<p>The views of the Chinese general public are divided over Harris and Trump, but "I would prefer Harris because of the bad experience with Trump. We don't want to have that experience again," he told BBC in a rare comment voicing Beijing's preferred choice in the US presidential election.</p>

<p>During Trump's presidency, the relations declined sharply and the two countries ended up in serious confrontation. "From China's point of view, US Vice President Kamala Harris, who has worked under President Biden, represents the continuity," he said.</p>

<p>Trump, during his Presidency, was quite emotional and spread a lot of bad information about China, said Jia, who is also the Director of the Institute of Global Cooperation and Understanding of the Peking University.</p>

<p>"We have problems with the Biden admiration too," but Biden inherited a lot of tough measures initiated by Trump against China for the reasons of domestic politics and perhaps out of his ideological conviction, he said, adding, "Under Biden, the US policy towards China is more stable, predictable." "We are re-engaging with each other. Officials are meeting with each other, talking about issues," which he said is stabilising the relations.</p>

<p>While following a tough policy towards China, including firming up US policy to challenge Beijing's claims over the disputed South China Sea and Taiwan, and restricting China's ambitious move to export its electric vehicles, Biden, however, has maintained regular dialogue with President Xi Jinping to keep the tensions under control.</p>

<p>The relations between the top two economies nosedived under Trump, especially after COVID-19 broke out in the Chinese city of Wuhan in 2019 and led to a pandemic which had a devastating impact all over the world.</p>

<p>Trump has alleged that the virus responsible for the pandemic was leaked from a bio lab in Wuhan, prompting China to mount a massive propaganda offensive to counter Trump's allegations.</p>

<p>The former president had levied tariffs on the flourishing Chinese exports to the US to force Beijing to provide more access to the American goods.</p>

<p>The Biden administration is continuing with the tariffs on Chinese exports to the US, which last year amounted to over USD 500 billion compared to around USD 148 billion American exports to China.</p>

<p>Trump's threat to impose 60 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods, if he gets elected, is worrying Beijing as it may have a severe impact on China's economy which is bogged down with a slowdown.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indian American Democratic fundraiser on Thursday released a new digital video titled "I WILL VOTE FOR KAMALA HARRIS-TIM WALZ" to rally the South Asian voters in key battleground states.</p>

<p>The Bollywood-inspired video, set to the instrumental version from the movie Animal based on one of AR Rahman's iconic song "Dil Hai Chhota Sa, Chhoti Si Asha" from the movie Roja, is aimed at connecting with the South Asian communities across Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, and North Carolina.</p>

<p>"This is the moment for us to unite and show our support for Kamala Harris," said Ajay Bhutoria, National Finance Committee member for the Kamala Harris presidential campaign.</p>

<p>He also announced plans to release additional Bollywood-inspired videos as part of ongoing efforts to boost voter turnout for Harris and her running mate Tim Walz.</p>

<p>"The choice is clear between Kamala Harris' vision for a better future and Trump's divisiveness. Thousands of South Asian volunteers are organizing, knocking on doors, and making calls to help win this race," he said.</p>

<p>In the video, Bhutoria highlights how these themes resonate with Vice President Harris' message of hope and unity.</p>

<p>"Vice President Harris embodies joy and hope for our community. She's running to build a future that moves beyond the divisiveness of Donald Trump. She represents hope for over 5 million Indian Americans. We are using Bollywood music to engage our community and ensure their voices are heard," he said.</p>

<p>The video, conceptualized by Ajay and Vinita Bhutoria and produced by Ritesh Parikh of Awesome TV, features messages in multiple languages, including Telugu, Gujarati, Punjabi, Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Malayalam and Urdu.</p>

<p>Parikh stated, "Bollywood has always connected people through stories, and Kamala Harris reflects that spirit by bringing people together. She brings joy and hope for all of us."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The United States has charged a former Indian intelligence officer, Vikash Yadav, for allegedly orchestrating a failed plot to kill Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun residing in New York City.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States has charged a former Indian intelligence officer, Vikash Yadav, for allegedly orchestrating a failed plot to kill Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun residing in New York City.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Yadav, previously associated with the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), is accused of coordinating an assassination attempt on Pannun, a dual US-Canadian citizen. The US Justice Department has charged him with murder-for-hire and money laundering.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The FBI will not tolerate acts of violence or other efforts to retaliate against those residing in the U.S. for exercising their constitutionally protected rights," FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement.</p>

<p>The plot allegedly began in May 2023, with Mr Yadav, then reportedly an employee of the Indian government, allegedly collaborating with individuals in India and overseas to execute the assassination. Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, the intended target, is a designated terrorist in India and an advocate for Khalistan, a proposed independent Sikh homeland to be carved out of India.</p>

<p>According to Reuters, Mr Yadav, 39, remains in India, but American officials are expected to pursue his extradition to face charges in the US.</p>

<p><strong>Plot Details</strong></p>

<p>Mr Yadav is accused of recruiting an Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, to execute the assassination. Mr Gupta was arrested in Prague last June, after travelling from India, and subsequently extradited to the US, where he pleaded not guilty to the charges. The indictment describes how Mr Yadav hired Mr Gupta to "orchestrate the assassination of the victim in the United States."</p>

<p>US authorities argue that Mr Gupta felt there was urgency in killing Pannun, particularly after the murder of another Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, in Canada in 2023. According to the indictment, Mr Gupta believed that after Nijjar's killing, there was "now no need to wait" for Pannun's assassination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the indictment, Mr Yadav and Mr Gupta allegedly contracted an individual to carry out the killing for $100,000. The FBI later discovered that the hired assassin was, in fact, an FBI informant working undercover. In June 2023, just days before Prime Minister Narendra Modi's state visit to the US, the informant received a $15,000 advance for the murder from Mr Yadav and Mr Gupta. The transaction reportedly took place in a car in New York, and a photograph of the exchange has been included in the indictment.</p>

<p>The indictment also includes a photograph of Mr Yadav in military attire. The prosecutors allege that Mr Yadav instructed Mr Gupta and the hired assassin to delay the killing until after PM Modi's visit to avoid diplomatic fallout during the high-profile event.</p>

<p>"A few minutes later, Yadav messaged Gupta, instructing: 'Let them also verify by their own... if they are able to get some proof that he is inside... it will be a go ahead from us,'" the indictment reads.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>'Completely Unwarranted'</strong></h3>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) yesterday confirmed that the "individual" named in the US Justice Department's indictment is no longer associated with the Indian government.</p>

<p>"The US State Department informed us that the individual in the Justice Department indictment is no longer employed by India. I confirm that he is no longer an employee of the Government of India," MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>US State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller yesterday confirmed that the Indian delegation had met with an inter-agency team from the FBI, Department of Justice, and the State Department. "We are satisfied with the cooperation," Mr Miller told reporters. "It continues to be an ongoing process. We continue to work with them on that, but we do appreciate the cooperation, and we appreciate them updating us on their investigation as we update them on ours."</p>

<p>In September this year, a US court issued a summons to the Indian government over Pannun's civil suit, alleging a plot to murder him. The Indian government labelled the summons "completely unwarranted".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The summons had named Government of India, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, former R&amp;AW chief Samant Goel, along with Mr Yadav and Mr Gupta and sought a reply within 21 days.</p>

<p>Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had said, "When these issues were first brought to our attention, we took action. There's a high-level committee engaged (in this matter). I invite your attention to the person who filed this."&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hamas-leader-sinwar-unrepentant-amid-ongoing-israeli-assault-on-gaza-6812183">Sinwar, a mastermind of the Oct. 7, 2023</a>, attack that triggered the Gaza war, was killed during an operation by Israeli soldiers in the Palestinian enclave on Wednesday, a pivotal event in the year-long conflict.</p>

<p>Western leaders said his death offered an opportunity for the conflict to end, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war would go on until the hostages seized by Hamas militants were returned.</p>

<p>"Today we have settled the score. Today evil has been dealt a blow but our task has still not been completed," Netanyahu said in a recorded video statement after the death was confirmed on Thursday.</p>

<p>"To the dear hostage families, I say: This is an important moment in the war. We will continue full force until all your loved ones, our loved ones, are home."</p>

<p>Sinwar, who was named as Hamas' overall leader following the assassination of political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, was believed to have been hiding in the warren of tunnels Hamas has built under Gaza over the past two decades.</p>

<p>He was killed during a gun battle in southern Gaza on Wednesday by Israeli troops who were initially unaware that they had caught their country's number one enemy, Israeli officials said.</p>

<p>The military released drone video of what it said was Sinwar, sitting on an armchair and covered in dust inside a destroyed building.</p>

<p>Hamas has not made any comment itself, but sources within the group have said the indications they have seen suggest Sinwar was indeed killed by Israeli troops.</p>

<p><strong>'Chief Obstacle'</strong></p>

<p>Despite Western hopes of a ceasefire, Sinwar's death could dial up hostilities in the Middle East where the prospect of an even wider conflict has grown.</p>

<p>Israel has launched a ground campaign in Lebanon over the past month and is now planning a response to an Oct. 1 missile attack carried out by Iran, ally of Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah.</p>

<p>But the demise of the man who planned the attack last year in which fighters killed 1,200 people in Israel and captured more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies, could also help push forward stalled efforts to end the war in which Israel has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities.</p>

<p>U.S. President Joe Biden, who spoke to Netanyahu by phone to congratulate him, said Sinwar's death provided a chance for the conflict in Gaza to finally end and for Israeli hostages to be brought home.</p>

<p>The U.S. wants to kick-start talks on a proposal to achieve a ceasefire and secure the release of hostages, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, calling Sinwar the "chief obstacle" to ending the war.</p>

<p>"That obstacle has obviously been removed. Can't predict that that means whoever replaces (Sinwar) will agree to a ceasefire, but it does remove what has been in recent months the chief obstacle to getting one," he said. In recent weeks, Sinwar had refused to negotiate at all, Miller said.</p>

<p>Iran indicated no sign the killing would shift its support. "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/spirit-of-resistance-will-be-strengthened-iran-after-yahya-sinwars-killing-6814884">The spirit of resistance will be strengthened</a>" following the death of Sinwar, its mission to the United Nations said.</p>

<p>Hezbollah was also defiant, announcing "the transition to a new and escalating phase in the confrontation with Israel".</p>

<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken held separate phone calls on Thursday with leaders in Saudi Arabia and Qatar aimed at ending the conflict in the Middle East, the State Department said.</p>

<p><strong>No Comfort, No Compromise</strong></p>

<p>Families of Israeli hostages said that while the killing of Sinwar was a significant achievement, it would not be complete while hostages are still in Gaza.</p>

<p>Avi Marciano, the father of Noa Marciano, who was killed in captivity by Hamas, told Israeli broadcaster KAN that "the monster, the one who took her from me, who had the blood of all our daughters on his hands, finally met the gates of hell."</p>

<p>"A little justice, but no comfort," he said. "There will be comfort only when Naama, Liri, Agam, Daniela and Karina, our girls' friends, return home."</p>

<p>In Khan Younis in the south of the Gaza Strip, a displaced Palestinian named Thabet Amour told Reuters the Palestinian fight would continue.</p>

<p>"This is resistance that does not disappear when men disappear," he said. "The assassination of Sinwar will not lead to the end of the resistance or to a compromise or surrender and raising the white flag."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military on Thursday told how Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in a firefight after being tracked "going from home to home" desperately seeking to avoid detection in southern Gaza.</p>

<p>Israel has hailed the death of the 61-year-old Sinwar as one of the most important blows it has dealt Hamas since the Gaza war started with the group's October 7, 2023 attacks.</p>

<p>The Israeli military "confirms that after a year-long pursuit, yesterday (Wednesday), October 16, 2024, IDF (military) soldiers from the Southern Command eliminated Yahya Sinwar, the leader of the Hamas terrorist organisation, in an operation in the southern Gaza Strip," it said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The dozens of operations carried out by the IDF and the ISA (Shin Bet internal security agency) over the last year, and in recent weeks in the area where he was eliminated, restricted Yahya Sinwar's operational movement as he was pursued by the forces and led to his elimination," it added.</p>

<p>"IDF soldiers of the 828th Brigade (Bislach) operating in the area identified and eliminated three terrorists. After completing the process of identifying the body, it can be confirmed that Yahya Sinwar was eliminated."</p>

<p>In a later statement, military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Sinwar was killed after being spotted with two other fighters in the territory's Rafah district.</p>

<p>"The forces idenfitied three terrorists who were going from home to home on the run," Hagari told a briefing.</p>

<p>Troops engaged the group, forcing Sinwar to flee as the group dispersed after being shot. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"Sinwar ran away alone into one of the buildings and our forces scanned the area with a drone – which you can see in this film -- Yahya Sinwar injured his hand in the shooting, who can be seen here covered with his face, he threw a branch at the drone," said Hagari.</p>

<p><strong>- No hostages with Sinwar -</strong></p>

<p>Drone footage released by the military showed Sinwar alone in a blown-up apartment, with one hand severly injured and head covered in a traditional scarf, throwing a stick at the approaching drone during his final moments.</p>

<p>"We identified him as a terrorist inside a building and we shot into the building and we entered to scan the area. We found him with a gun and 40 thousand shekels. He was on the run and our forces eliminated him," said Hagari. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"Near the terrorists we eliminated were no hostages and our forces are now screening the area," he added.</p>

<p>Israel accuses Sinwar of being the mastermind of the October 7 attacks along with Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said Deif was killed in a strike earlier this year though the Palestinian group has not confirmed it.</p>

<p>Sinwar in August replaced Hamas's former chief Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Iran on July 31. Israel has not commented on Haniyeh's death.</p>

<p>The Hamas attack last year resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people on Israeli soil, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures that include hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive in Gaza has killed 42,438 people, a majority of them civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The UN acknowledges the figures to be reliable.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One Direction pop star Liam Payne died of multiple traumas and internal bleeding after plunging from a hotel balcony in Buenos Aires, prosecutors said on Thursday, adding an initial search suggested the fall came after substance abuse.</p>

<p>Payne, 31, who shot to global fame with the boy band, was found dead after he fell from a third-floor hotel room balcony in Buenos Aires on Wednesday, triggering an outpouring of fan tributes.</p>

<p>In the first official details of the autopsy, the prosecutors office said coroners had found 25 injuries compatible with those caused by a fall from height, including fatal head injuries, with internal and external bleeding.</p>

<p>It added that there were no signs of a third party being involved, though the incident was being investigated as a "suspicious death" out of protocol.</p>

<p>"Everything indicates that the musician was alone when the fall occurred, and was going through some kind of episode due to substance abuse," the prosecutors office said.</p>

<p>"City police who surveyed the scene found substances inside the room that at first glance - and pending confirmation from the experts - would be narcotics and alcoholic beverages, as well as several destroyed objects and furniture," it added.</p>

<p>Police earlier said in a statement they had found the room in "total disorder" in a search after his death, with various things smashed and medications scattered around.</p>

<p>While details surrounding his death remain unclear, Payne had spoken publicly about his struggles with mental health and using alcohol to cope with the pressures of fame.</p>

<p><strong>WHISKEY, ANXIETY MEDICATION</strong></p>

<p>The city police said that in the atrium of the hotel where Payne had fallen they had found a bottle of whiskey, a lighter and a cellphone. They said they had collected fingerprints from those.</p>

<p>In the room of the luxury hotel in the city's trendy Palermo district, police said they found over-the-counter medications, energy packs and anxiety drug Clonazepam.</p>

<p>"Upon entering, total disorder was observed, with various elements broken," the police said in a statement, adding they had taken more fingerprints and other evidence to be analyzed in labs, as well as a notebook and passport.</p>

<p>"The balcony area was inspected in order to establish access to it," the police force added.</p>

<p>Before Payne's fall, a hotel employee had called emergency services, asking for help with a guest who was trashing his room and appeared to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, audio obtained from the Buenos Aires security ministry showed.</p>

<p>"We have a guest who is intoxicated by drugs and alcohol. And, well, he's ... When he's conscious, he breaks, he's breaking the whole room. And, well, we need you to send someone, please," the hotel worker told police in the 911 call.</p>

<p>"We need you to send someone urgently because, well, I don't know if the guest's life is at risk. He is in a room with a balcony. And, well, we are a little afraid that he will do something that will put his life at risk."</p>

<p>One Direction found global success after Simon Cowell brought together Payne, Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson on Britain's X Factor talent show in 2010.</p>

<p>They went on to sell 70 million records, with six top-10 hits on Billboard's Hot 100, including "What Makes You Beautiful", "Story of My Life" and "Live While We're Young". Payne's co-writing credits included "Story of My Life" and "Night Changes".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late Thursday that the killing of Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar was the "beginning of the end" of the war in Gaza.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that the killing of Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar in the Gaza Strip was the "beginning of the end" of the year-long war in the Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said that after a lengthy hunt, troops had on Wednesday "eliminated Yahya Sinwar, the leader of the Hamas terrorist organisation, in an operation in the southern Gaza Strip".</p>

<p>Hamas has not confirmed his death.</p>

<p>Netanyahu, who vowed to crush Hamas at the start of the war, hailed Sinwar's killing, saying: "While this is not the end of the war in Gaza, it's the beginning of the end."</p>

<p>He had earlier called Sinwar's death an "important landmark in the decline of the evil rule of Hamas".</p>

<p>The chief of Hamas in Gaza at the time of the October 7 attack that sparked the war, Sinwar became the militant group's overall leader after the killing in July of its political chief, Ismail Haniyeh.</p>

<p>He is said to have masterminded the October 7 attack, the deadliest in Israeli history, which resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures that includes hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Israel's announcement of Sinwar's death comes weeks after it assassinated Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in a strike in Lebanon, where the Israeli military has been at war since late September.</p>

<p>With Hamas already weakened more than a year into the Gaza war, Sinwar's death deals an immense blow to the organisation.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden, whose government is Israel's top arms provider, said: "This is a good day for Israel, for the United States, and for the world."</p>

<p>"There is now the opportunity for a 'day after' in Gaza without Hamas in power, and for a political settlement that provides a better future for Israelis and Palestinians alike."</p>

<p><strong>- 'Settling the score' -</strong></p>

<p>Militants also seized 251 hostages during the October 7 attack and took them into Gaza. Ninety-seven remain there, including 34 who Israeli officials say are dead.</p>

<p>Following the attack, Netanyahu vowed to defeat Hamas and bring home all the hostages.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed 42,438 people in Gaza, the majority civilians, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, figures which the UN considers reliable.</p>

<p>Israeli military chief Herzi Halevi said: "We are settling the score with Sinwar, who is responsible for that very difficult day a year ago."</p>

<p>He vowed the military would keep fighting "until we capture all the terrorists involved in the October 7 massacre and bring all the hostages home".</p>

<p>Some Israelis hailed the news of Sinwar's death as a sign of better things to come.</p>

<p>"I am celebrating the death of Sinwar, who has brought us nothing but harm, who has taken people hostage," said one Israeli woman, Hemda, who only gave her first name.</p>

<p>Attending a Tel Aviv rally demanding the hostages' release, 60-year-old Sisil, who also gave only her first name, said his killing presented a "once in a lifetime opportunity" for "a hostage deal to end the war".</p>

<p>But whether the Hamas chief's death will bring the end of the war any closer is unclear.</p>

<p>Warning that the hostages were in "grave danger", Israeli military historian Guy Aviad said Sinwar's killing was "a significant event... but it's not the end of the war".</p>

<p>Campaign group the Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged the Israeli government and international mediators to leverage "this major achievement to secure hostages' return".</p>

<p>According to a statement from Netanyahu's office, Biden called him to congratulate him on Sinwar's killing, with the two leaders vowing to seize "an opportunity to promote the release of the hostages".</p>

<p>Netanyahu said Palestinian militants should free the hostages if they want to live.</p>

<p><strong>- Final moments -</strong></p>

<p>The Israeli military said Sinwar was killed in a firefight in southern Gaza's Rafah, near the Egyptian border, while being tracked by a drone.</p>

<p>It released drone footage of what it said was Sinwar's final moments, with the video showing a wounded militant throwing an object at the drone.</p>

<p>With the civilian toll in Gaza mounting, Israel has faced criticism over its conduct of the war, including from the United States.</p>

<p>In northern Gaza's Jabalia, two hospitals said Israeli air strikes on a school sheltering displaced people killed at least 14 people, though the military reported that it had hit militants.</p>

<p>According to a UN-backed assessment, some 345,000 Gazans face "catastrophic" levels of hunger this winter.</p>

<p>Nearly 100 percent of Gaza's population now lives in poverty, the UN's International Labour Organization said, warning that the war's impact on Gaza "will be felt for generations to come".</p>

<p><strong>- War in Lebanon -</strong></p>

<p>Israel is also fighting a war in Lebanon, where Hamas ally Hezbollah opened a front by launching cross-border strikes that forced tens of thousands of Israelis to flee their homes.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said Thursday it was launching a new phase in its war against Israel, saying it had used precision-guided missiles against troops for the first time.</p>

<p>On the same day, Israel conducted strikes on the south Lebanese city of Tyre, where the militant group and its allies hold sway.</p>

<p>The Lebanese National News Agency reported strikes on the Bekaa Valley, after Israel had issued an evacuation warning for civilians there.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said five soldiers were killed in combat in southern Lebanon, taking to 19 the number of troop deaths announced since Israel began raids into Lebanon last month.</p>

<p>In Lebanon, the war since late September has left at least 1,418 people dead, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures, though the real toll is likely higher.</p>

<p>The war has also drawn in other Iran-aligned armed groups, including in Yemen, Iraq and Syria.</p>

<p>Iran on October 1 conducted a missile strike on Israel, for which Israel has vowed to retaliate.</p>

<p>Tehran's mission to the United Nations said Thursday that Sinwar's killing would lead to the strengthening of "resistance" in the region.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump has said "only stupid people put old people" in positions on the Supreme Court - ironically letting slip that he himself is a 78-year-old running for the highest office in the US government.</p>

<p>It has not always been Joe Biden at the receiving end of age-related backlash, but also Trump, who will be 82 years old by the time he completes his term, if elected.</p>

<p>He is also, currently, the oldest nominee for president in United States history and has time and again been the target for the Democrats who have thrown doubts down his way regarding his ability to serve office.</p>

<p>"It's amazing, because I got three in four years," Trump said about his appointments to the US Supreme Court during an interview to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://youtu.be/HlWT6nYZ4OU?si=0oOMlQYMf3jPUIOa&amp;t=2140" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>. "Most people get none. Because, you know, you put them in, they're young. You tend to put them in young." He continued on to say, "Only stupid people put old. You know, you don't put old in, because they're there for two years or three years, right?"</p>

<p>Trump's Supreme Court appointments, including Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett, skewed younger than typical, with an average age of 50, compared to the historical average of 60.</p>

<p>The three Supreme Court appointees of President Trump have significantly contributed to the conservative majority in the court, leading to notable changes in federal precedents. One of the most significant outcomes of this shift is the overturning of Roe vs Wade, a landmark ruling that previously protected the right to abortion care.</p>

<p>When the interviewer called attention to his age being 78, Trump brushed off the question and continued to talk about his Supreme Court appointees, "So, I got three," he responded. "A lot of presidents get none, I got three. And, uh, I think they've been three great choices too, by the way."</p>

<p>There have been questions raised about Trump's mental fitness for the office since he has gone on long frequent rambles at rallies, ignored or missed questions and recently, spent time swaying at a town hall instead of answering questions.</p>

<p>Dr. Ben Michaelis, a clinical psychologist, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-mental-health-fears-cognitive-decline-b2625124.html" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">The Independent</a> that Trump is "really not in a strong cognitive place."</p>

<p>"There's a term when you're talking about people with dementia called sundowning, it's a lot harder for them as the day goes on," he said, "It's very difficult for them to maintain focus on a topic. The idea of being able to maintain that level of focus for that amount of time, that late in the day...you wouldn't think twice about it if that was your grandfather.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has never been one to abide by rules. Four years ago he cried fraud and did not accept the presidential election result and there could be a possibility of him doing the same this time around after the November 5 election.</p>

<p>This time the only difference will be that Trump will not have his presidential levers of power which he had in the 2020 elections. Moreover, new laws have been implemented in the US to make it more difficult to influence election results.</p>

<h2><strong>THE DENIAL</strong></h2>

<p>"If I lose - I'll tell you what, it's possible. Because they cheat. That's the only way we're gonna lose, because they cheat," Trump said at a Michigan rally in September. Trump's team filed over 60 lawsuits, but none of them succeeded in altering or delaying the vote count.</p>

<p>After losing the 2020 presidential election, Donald Trump and his supporters launched an unprecedented effort to overturn the results. This endeavor involved spreading baseless claims of election fraud and rigging through the "big lie" propaganda technique.</p>

<h3><strong>CIVIL UNREST?</strong></h3>

<p>In 2021, Republican supporters charged the US Capitol in an effort to stop Mike Pence from confirming Joe Biden's victory.</p>

<p>Any effort by Trump to suggest the election was rigged could potentially lead to civil unrest, as it did on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>

<p>According to Reuters, experts who monitor violent groups and militia, such as Peter Montgomery of the People For the American Way, a liberal think tank, say they are less concerned about a violent response from these groups than they are about threats against election workers counting votes. There also could be violent demonstrations in the capitals of battleground states, Montgomery said.</p>

<p>Still, Trump and his allies have been crafting a blueprint for months to cry if he loses on November 5th.</p>

<p>Following the November 5 election, Republicans and Democrats anticipate a potentially lengthy vote-counting process that may extend well beyond Election Day, as mail-in ballots are processed and other votes are carefully verified and tallied.</p>

<p>In case it seems like Trump is losing, the delay in counting will give him a window to claim fraud while sowing seeds of doubt about election officials and although he has been threatening to put election workers and public workers behind bars, he would need to win the election first in order for that to be materialised.</p>

<h3><strong>BUILD-UP IN KEY BATTLEGROUNDS</strong></h3>

<p>In anticipation of potential election controversies, Republicans have preemptively filed more than 100 lawsuits in crucial battleground states. These lawsuits seek to establish a basis for post-election challenges, including claims - thus far unsupported by evidence - of widespread voting by non-citizens.</p>

<p>Both major parties are gearing up to deploy thousands of trained volunteers, known as poll watchers, to keep a close eye on voting and vote counting during the upcoming election. These volunteers will be tasked with reporting any irregularities they spot. However, some voting rights advocates are sounding the alarm, worried that Republican poll watchers might disrupt the process, even though the Republican Party noted that the volunteers have been instructed to abide by the law.</p>

<p>States must submit their election results by December, ahead of the Electoral College meeting. Electors will then cast their votes, which are subsequently sent to Congress for formal verification in January, marking the final step in confirming the presidential election outcome.</p>

<h3><strong>DELAYS AND MISSED DEADLINES</strong></h3>

<p>Efforts to contest election results, fueled by Trump's influence, may cause certification delays and missed deadlines. This could provide grounds for Republican lawmakers to dispute the outcome, with uncertain legal consequences due to potentially biased judicial decisions.</p>

<p>In response to Trump's 2020 election challenges, Congress enacted reforms to prevent similar disruptions. The new law clarifies the vice president's limited role, prohibiting them from delaying certification or discarding state results, as Trump had urged Pence to do.</p>

<p>The measure also requires that an objection to a state's electoral count cannot be brought unless one-fifth of the members of each house of Congress agrees. After that, it takes a majority vote in each house for an objection to be found valid.</p>

<p>In the unexpected outcome that enough electoral votes are tossed so that neither candidate reaches the majority, the newly elected US House of Representatives would choose the next president.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[A day after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke of 'One India' policy, India on Thursday said "no action" taken against anti-India elements there suggests there is a "gap" between action and words.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A day after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke of 'One India' policy, India on Thursday said "no action" taken against anti-India elements there suggests there is a "gap" between action and words.</p>

<p>Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal also told reporters that over the last several years, New Delhi has been reminding Ottawa to take actions against anti-India activities in that country.</p>

<p>He was responding to a query on the comments made by Trudeau while he was testifying before the public inquiry into foreign interference in federal electoral processes and democratic institutions.</p>

<p>"We have seen those comments of Prime Minister Trudeau that he believes in the 'One India' policy, but so far the actions that we have requested against anti-India elements who actually go against 'One India', who call for dismemberment and disunity of the country, who espouse separatist ideology...no action has been taken," Mr Jaiswal said.</p>

<p>"In a sense, there is a difference, there is a gap between action and words here," he added.</p>

<p>As the Canadian Prime Minister testified before the Commission of Inquiry, the MEA early on Thursday said what it has heard only "confirms" New Delhi's consistent stand that Canada has "presented us no evidence" in support of the serious allegations Ottawa chose to level against India and Indian diplomats.</p>

<p>Trudeau on Wednesday acknowledged that he had only intelligence and no "hard evidentiary proof" when he alleged the involvement of Indian government agents in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year.</p>

<p>The MEA issued a statement in the early hours on Thursday in response to media queries related to Trudeau's deposition, some of whose details came out in media reports.</p>

<p>"What we have heard today only confirms what we have been saying consistently all along -- Canada has presented us no evidence whatsoever in support of the serious allegations that it has chosen to level against India and Indian diplomats," the MEA spokesperson said in the statement.</p>

<p>The ministry further said, "The responsibility for the damage that this cavalier behaviour has caused to India-Canada relations lies with Prime Minister Trudeau alone." During the press briefing on Thursday evening, Mr Jaiswal was also asked about the future direction of India-Canada ties.</p>

<p>"This is an evolving situation, so we will see," he said.</p>

<p>The escalation in diplomatic row between India and Canada is a major downturn in already frosty ties between the two nations.</p>

<p>The relations between the two countries came under severe strain following Trudeau's allegations in September last year of a "potential" involvement of Indian agents in Nijjar's killing. New Delhi rejected Trudeau's charges as "absurd".</p>

<p>India has been maintaining that the main issue between the two countries is that of Canada giving space to pro-Khalistan elements operating from Canadian soil with impunity.</p>

<p>Nijjar, who was declared a terrorist by India, was shot dead outside a gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, on June 18 last year.</p>

<p>On a query on the safety of Indian or Indian-origin nationals in Canada, Mr Jaiswal said that about 17-18 lakh Indian origin, and Indian citizens also, live in Canada, and "their safety is important".</p>

<p>It is in hands of the Canadian government and "we hope they will keep them safe", he added.</p>

<p>Asked about the visa situation, he said, the "visa situation not very good".</p>

<p>Asked about the reports of alleged intimidation of some Indian-origin journalists in Canada, the MEA spokesperson said, "These are clear examples of intimidation and violence by those who openly espouse extremist and separatist ideologies." "These are also examples of what afflicts Canada today and which reveal the sources of violence. Shifting the blame to India doesn't work, in any manner," he said.</p>

<p>On a query about former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, he said, "As we said earlier, she had come here at a short notice for safety reasons, and she continues to be here." On a query related to a report on possible resumption of cricket ties between India and Pakistan, and if it was discussed on the sidelines of the SCO conclave in Islamabad, Mr Jaiswal said, "It was not discussed."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump on Thursday blamed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for helping start that nation's war with Russia, a comment that further suggests Trump is likely to radically shift U.S. policy toward Ukraine if he wins the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>The Republican former president has frequently criticized Zelenskiy on the campaign trail, repeatedly calling him "the greatest salesman on Earth" for having solicited and received billions of dollars of U.S. military aid since the war broke out in 2022.</p>

<p>Trump has also slammed the Ukrainian leader for failing to seek peace with Moscow, and he has suggested Ukraine may have to cede some of its land to Russia to make a peace deal, a concession Kyiv considers unacceptable.</p>

<p>Trump's comments on the PBD Podcast on Thursday with Patrick Bet-David went a step further than his previous criticism. He said Zelenskiy was to blame not just for failing to end the war, but for helping start it, even though the conflict broke out when Russia invaded Ukrainian sovereign territory.</p>

<p>"That doesn't mean I don't want to help him because I feel very badly for those people. But he should never have let that war start. The war's a loser," Trump said.</p>

<p>Zelenskiy presented his "victory plan" to end the war to Trump during a meeting in New York in September, an encounter both leaders described as cordial.</p>

<p>Trump's public comments, however, suggest he could seek to wind down aid for Ukraine if he defeats Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, on Nov. 5. He has repeatedly said he could end the conflict before he takes office in January, but he has not said how.</p>

<p>Harris has pledged to continue supporting Ukraine, and she has portrayed a victory for the eastern European nation as a vital U.S. national security interest. She has frequently rebuked Trump for being unwilling to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden on Thursday hailed Israel's killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar as a "good day" for the world, saying it also removed a key obstacle to a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden on Thursday hailed Israel's killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar as a "good day" for the world, saying it also removed a key obstacle to a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal.</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee in November's US election, added that Israel's killing of the mastermind of the October 7, 2023 attacks was a chance to "finally end the war in Gaza."</p>

<p>The comments reflect growing calls in Washington for a ceasefire even as it backs key ally Israel, amid tensions between Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over Israel's conduct in the conflict sparked by Hamas's attacks.</p>

<p>"This is a good day for Israel, for the United States, and for the world," Biden, who was traveling to Germany on Air Force One as the news broke, said in a written statement.</p>

<p>Biden said he would soon be speaking with Netanyahu to "congratulate" him but also to "discuss the pathway" for securing the release of hostages and "ending this war once and for all."</p>

<p>"There is now the opportunity for a 'day after' in Gaza without Hamas in power, and for a political settlement that provides a better future for Israelis and Palestinians alike," added Biden.</p>

<p>"Yahya Sinwar was an insurmountable obstacle to achieving all of those goals. That obstacle no longer exists. But much work remains before us."</p>

<p>Harris has hinted at a tougher approach towards Israel if elected president and called for an end to Palestinian deaths, even as she supports Israel's right to defend itself.</p>

<p>"This moment gives us an opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza," she told reporters after a campaign event in Milwaukee.</p>

<p>"And it must end such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination," she said.</p>

<p>The vice president also hailed US special operations and intelligence personnel who "worked closely with their Israeli counterparts to locate and track Sinwar and other Hamas leaders."</p>

<p>Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan stressed however that US personnel were not involved in the specific operation that killed Sinwar.</p>

<p>"This operation was an IDF operation," Sullivan told reporters traveling with Biden on Air Force One.</p>

<p>Tensions have grown in recent months between Biden and Netanyahu as the Israeli leader seemed to ignore multiple US calls for de-escalation in the Middle East.</p>

<p>The United States warned Israel on Tuesday that it could withhold some of its billions of dollars in military assistance unless it improves aid delivery to the war-battered Gaza Strip within 30 days.</p>

<p>Washington also said it opposed the way Israel was carrying out mass air strikes on Beirut as it targets Hezbollah -- which like Hamas is backed by Iran -- in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Israel has meanwhile said it will strike back against Iran after a recent ballistic missile attack. Biden has called on it not to strike Iranian nuclear or oil facilities.</p>

<p>But Republican US House Speaker Mike Johnson on Thursday called on Biden to "now work in tandem with Israel to apply a maximum pressure campaign against the head of the snake: Iran."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Liam Payne, who rose to fame as a member of the boy band One Direction has died at the age of 31. The British singer fell to his death from the third-floor balcony of Hotel CasaSur Palermo in Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p>

<p>Payne was pronounced dead by the medics on the spot. He is survived by his son Bear Grey Payne with his ex-girlfriend Cheryl, his parents and two older sisters. Liam Payne's death is shrouded in suspicions and conspiracies given the circumstances of his death. Drugs, alcohol and an aggressive intruder have been mentioned by Argentine officials and various media agencies.</p>

<p>An investigation is being carried out and nothing can be said for sure at the moment, but what's certain is that the music world has lost a star, and One Direction's loyal fans, who fashion themselves as Directioners, a part of their teenage years.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Add image caption here" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/a3us9mac_liam-payne-death-people-gather-outside-hotel-afp_625x300_18_October_24.jpg" title="Add image caption here" /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"></p>
</div>

<p>A fresh-faced Liam Payne first appeared on the British reality show X Factor in 2008. He was all of 14 when he impressed the judges with his cover of 'Fly Me To The Moon'. However, the judges told him he wasn't ready yet and to try again later.</p>

<p>That's exactly what Payne did. He auditioned two years hence with another classic, 'Cry Me A River'. This time around, the judges saw the X factor in him. They decided to keep five boys in the show, who had failed to make it through individually, by forming a band. And that is how the iconic One Direction was born.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/ia0g94b8_one-direction-members-reuters_625x300_17_October_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Liam Payne, Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan, and Louis Tomlinson came together to form one of the most successful bands. They didn't win X Factor but were signed by judge Simon Cowell's label. When their debut single "What Makes You Beautiful" came out, the band's rivals knew they needed to watch out.</p>

<p>The song was an instant hit and became number one on the British charts. This was only the first of their four UK chart-toppers in as many years. Soon stadiums full of screaming teenage fans and millions of record sales became the norm.</p>

<p>Suddenly Liam was living his childhood dream, but it came at a cost, and a hefty one at that. Pressure mounted on the band and tensions brewed. A lot was going on backstage and as the band members have described - "it wasn't easy being a teenager in the public eye".</p>

<p>As a result, One Direction split-up in 2016. A level-headed Liam, who was otherwise described as "The sensible one" in the group, turned to alcohol to cope. In the post-One Direction era, Liam decided to go solo and started releasing singles.</p>

<p>However, his solo career struggled to maintain momentum. His health suffered too, both physically and mentally. Liam had to be admitted to a hospital twice in 2023 because his kidney needed medical attention. He also spent time in rehab, making efforts to end his alcohol addiction.</p>

<p>The singer's social media posts suggest he was making an effort to get back on track.</p>

<p>As recently as a few hours before he was found dead, Liam Payne had shared a Snapchat video from his hotel room where everything seemed fine.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/n6nn5nag_liam-payne-death-fans-pay-tribute-afp_625x300_18_October_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Fans are left heartbroken and shocked by his untimely death. Thousands of fans, many in tears, gathered outside the hotel with flowers and candles to pay homage to the singer. With his death, the hope of seeing One Direction regroup one last time shall remain a dream unfulfilled.</p>

<p>One cannot help but recall the lyrics to his song Live Forever - "I was always gonna live fast, die young". Farewell, Liam, may you rest in peace.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Liam Payne, a British singer and former member of boy band One Direction, died after falling from a third-floor balcony at a Buenos Aires hotel.</p>

<p>The circumstances of the pop star's death, however, remain unclear.</p>

<p>Here is what we know so far:</p>

<p><strong>Multiple trauma, hemorrhaging</strong></p>

<p>Almost three hours after his death on Wednesday, Liam Payne's body was removed from the hotel at around 8:30 pm (23:30 GMT) and autopsied.</p>

<p>The autopsy established that Payne suffered "multiple traumas" and "internal and external hemorrhaging," the public prosecutor's office said in a statement.</p>

<p>A preliminary report noted "25 injuries consistent with a fall from a great height."</p>

<p>First responders said there was "no possibility of resuscitation" at the scene, according to the head of emergency services in Buenos Aires.</p>

<p><strong>Drugs, alcohol</strong></p>

<p>Hotel staff had called emergency services to respond to a hotel guest shortly after 5:00 pm, according to leaked audio of the call run by several media outlets.</p>

<p>"We have a guest who is overwhelmed by drugs and alcohol, and destroying his room, we need you to send someone!" a voice identified as a hotel employee said on the call.</p>

<p>"I don't know if the guest's life is in danger. But he has a room with a balcony and we're a little afraid that he might do something life-threatening," said an employee who identified himself as the hotel's front desk manager in a second call.</p>

<p>Payne was in a room on the third floor, with a balcony overlooking a rear patio that was about 14 meters (45 feet) high.</p>

<p>He had been in Argentina for several days, after attending a concert by former bandmate Niall Horan in Buenos Aires in early October.</p>

<p><strong>Wrecked room</strong></p>

<p>Local media published photographs purportedly of Payne's room, showing a chaotic scene.</p>

<p>A TV with a broken screen, multiple bottles, cans with burn marks, candles and traces of white powder on a table are visible. There was also a half-full glass of champagne.</p>

<p>The public prosecutor's office corroborated the depiction of drugs and alcohol, saying "substances were seized in the musician's room which would accredit a previous situation of alcohol and drug consumption."</p>

<p>A telephone, a computer and the musician's papers were seized, as well as, according to local media, drugs such as the anti-anxiety medication Clonazepam.</p>

<p>The results of medical and toxicological tests on Payne's body were not immediately available.</p>

<p>Payne had in the past spoken of his difficult relationship with fame and his problems with alcoholism.</p>

<p><strong>Was it an accident?</strong></p>

<p>The courts said they were officially investigating the death but did not suggest criminal violence was suspected.</p>

<p>"Everything seems to indicate that the musician was alone at the time of the fall and that he was going through an episode of substance abuse," authorities said.</p>

<p>The prosecutor's office has taken statements from at least five witnesses, including three hotel employees and two women who had earlier been in Payne's room.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p><p><div class='table-div suicide'><table class='table'><thead><tr><th colspan='2'>Helplines</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vandrevala Foundation for Mental Health</td><td><a href='tel:+919999666555'>9999666555</a> or <a href='mailto:help@vandrevalafoundation.com'>help@vandrevalafoundation.com</a> </td></tr><tr><td>TISS iCall</td><td><a href='tel:+912225521111'>022-25521111</a> (Monday-Saturday: 8 am to 10 pm)</td></tr> <tr><td colspan='2'>(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></p>]]></content:encoded>

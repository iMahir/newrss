       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine fired 11 drones Wednesday at Moscow that Russia said were shot down during one of the largest strikes against the capital, while Ukrainian defences reported stopping 50 Russian drones and missiles.</p>

<p>The strikes on Moscow come amid a Ukrainian offensive in Russia's Kursk region -- which Kyiv has said is aimed at bringing the campaign launched by Russia in February 2022 closer to an end on "fair" terms.</p>

<p>"Eleven drones were destroyed" over Moscow and its surrounding region, the defence ministry said.</p>

<p>"This is one of the largest ever attempts to attack Moscow with drones," Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said.</p>

<p>In total, 45 drones from Ukraine were destroyed by the Russian air defense systems, according to the Russian defense ministry.</p>

<p>Sobyanin said in an earlier post that no damage or casualties had been reported.</p>

<p>Drone attacks on Moscow are rare, with Russia saying in May it had downed a drone outside the capital, forcing restrictions to be imposed at two major airports in the city for under an hour.</p>

<p>In the night from Tuesday to Wednesday, a total of 72 air targets were detected over Ukraine, according to Ukrainian Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk.</p>

<p>Fifty drones and a guided missile were shot down, he said in a post on Telegram.</p>

<p>Kyiv was one of the locations targeted.</p>

<p>"The enemy continues to attack our region with strike drones. The air raid lasted all night and into the morning for more than nine hours," Kyiv's military administration said on Telegram.</p>

<p>A private house was damaged as a result of falling debris from the downed targets, and power lines were cut, it added.</p>

<p>Since August 6, Ukraine has mounted an unprecedented cross-border assault into Russia's Kursk region, where it claims to control more than 80 settlements.</p>

<p>Kyiv has also repeatedly targeted oil and gas facilities in Russia since the conflict began in 2022, some hundreds of kilometres from its borders, in what it has called "fair" retaliation for massive attacks on its energy infrastructure.</p>

<p>Ukrainian drones attacked an oil storage facility in Russia's southern Rostov region on Sunday, sparking a large fire, the local governor said.</p>

<p>The blaze in the city of Proletarsk was still raging on Wednesday, Russian media reported.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised his forces for hitting oil facilities in Russia, saying the attacks would help bring a "just end" to the conflict.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 116-year-old Japanese woman who used to be a mountaineer is set to be named the world's oldest person by Guinness World Records, a research group said on Wednesday, following the death of a 117-year-old Spanish woman earlier this week.</p>

<p>Tomiko Itooka, who was born on May 23, 1908, lives in the western Japanese city of Ashiya, the US-based Gerontology Research Group said.</p>

<p>She is next in line for the title of world's oldest person after Maria Branyas Morera died in a Spanish nursing home on Monday, according to the group.</p>

<p>Ms Itooka, a mother-of-three, was born in the year when a long-distance radio message was sent from the Eiffel Tower for the first time, and when the Wright Brothers made their first public flights in Europe and America.</p>

<p>In her 70s, Ms Itooka often went climbing and twice scaled Japan's 3,067-metre (10,062-ft) Mount Ontake - surprising her guide by climbing the mountain in sneakers instead of hiking boots, the research group said.</p>

<p>At the age of 100, she walked up the lengthy stone steps of Japan's Ashiya Shrine without using a cane, the group added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ahead of his visit to Ukrainian capital Kyiv, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said he was looking forward to sharing perspectives with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two days ahead of his crucial visit to Ukrainian capital Kyiv, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said he was looking forward to sharing perspectives with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict.</p>

<p>The prime minister's comments came shortly before he embarked on a two-nation trip to Poland and Ukraine. In the first leg of the visit, PM Modi is visiting Polish capital city Warsaw on August 21 and 22.</p>

<p>PM Modi will be in Kyiv for around seven hours on August 23 in the first visit by an Indian prime minister to Ukraine since the country became independent in 1991.</p>

<p>In a departure statement, PM Modi, referring to the Ukraine conflict, said that as a "friend and partner", India hopes for an early return of peace and stability in the region.</p>

<p>"From Poland, I will be visiting Ukraine at the invitation of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This is the first-ever visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Ukraine," he said.</p>

<p>"I look forward to the opportunity to build upon earlier conversations with President Zelenskyy on strengthening bilateral cooperation and share perspectives on peaceful resolution of the ongoing Ukraine conflict," he said.</p>

<p>"As a friend and partner, we hope for an early return of peace and stability in the region," he added.</p>

<p>PM Modi said he was confident that his visit to Warsaw and Kyiv "will serve as a natural continuation of extensive contacts with the two countries and help create the foundation for stronger and more vibrant relations in the years ahead".</p>

<p>The prime minister will travel to Kyiv from Poland in a 'Rail Force One' train that will take around 10 hours. The return trip will also be of the same duration.</p>

<p>A number of world leaders including US President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited Kyiv by train after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>PM Modi's visit to Kyiv comes nearly six weeks after his high-profile trip to Moscow which triggered criticism from the US and some of its Western allies.</p>

<p>India has not yet condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and has been calling for resolution of the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy.</p>

<p>In his summit talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last month, PM Modi said that a solution to the Ukraine conflict is not possible on the battlefield and peace talks do not succeed amidst bombs and bullets.</p>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Monday said PM Modi's visit to Ukraine would be a "landmark and historic" one.</p>

<p>"Lasting peace can only be achieved through options that are acceptable to both parties. And it can only be a negotiated settlement," said Tanmaya Lal, Secretary (West) in the MEA.</p>

<p>"On our part, India continues to engage with all stakeholders," he said.</p>

<p>On his visit to Poland, PM Modi said he was looking forward to meeting Prime Minister Donald Tusk and President Andrzej Duda.</p>

<p>"My visit to Poland comes as we mark 70 years of our diplomatic relations. Poland is a key economic partner in Central Europe," he said.</p>

<p>"Our mutual commitment to democracy and pluralism further reinforces our relationship. I look forward to meeting my friend Prime Minister Donald Tusk and President Andrzej Duda to further advance our partnership," he said.</p>

<p>"I will also engage with the members of the vibrant Indian community in Poland," PM Modi said.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[The child gained access to a gun and unintentionally shot the man, leaving him in critical condition.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a shocking incident, a two-year-old child accidentally shot a man Monday morning in a Chesterfield County, Virginia home. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/man-critical-condition-after-shot-2-year/story?id=112995896">ABC News</a></em>, the child&nbsp;gained access to a gun and unintentionally shot the man, leaving him in critical condition.</p>

<p>The incident happened on August 19, when police responded to a reported shooting at a residence in the 4400 block of Butler Lane around 10 a.m. Upon arrival, officers found the victim with a gunshot wound and immediately provided medical attention. The man was subsequently airlifted to the hospital for further treatment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chesterfield Police later confirmed some details to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59vV8TxMaHY">CBS 6 News</a></em>.</p>

<p>''It appears that the following events occurred: The victim was preparing to leave the house and had placed his handgun on a nearby chair when a child, who is nearly 3 years old, retrieved the gun. The child accidentally discharged the firearm, shooting the victim. The child was not injured and no one else in the house was injured. Again, the investigation is ongoing,'' a Chesterfield Police spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Virginia ABC affiliate&nbsp;<em><a data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/chesterfield-county/police-say-2-year-old-accidentally-shoots-man-in-chesterfield-home/" target="_blank">WRIC</a>,</em> the victim is the boyfriend of the child's mother.</p>

<p>Neighbour Lisa Wood said she saw the child shortly after the shooting.</p>

<p>"After I went into the house, he was sitting there like a normal kid. It's not like, you know, he's worried, or, you know, anything like that. He still has a smile," she said.</p>

<p>Other neighbours who spoke with<em> CBS 6</em> expressed their wishes for the victim's full recovery and agreed that the incident serves as a stark reminder of the crucial importance of gun safety measures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''Bad things happen whenever you're not responsible with your stuff. And it, really, really sucks that it had to be a child. And, you know, hopefully, this adult will pull through because, like, this — this sucks. Today was just a day that, you know, that wasn't good,'' Ms Wood said.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[A 40-year-old Indian doctor was held in a US jail on a USD 2 million bond after being charged with multiple sex crimes for allegedly recording hundreds of nude images and videos of children and women over several years, according to media reports.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 40-year-old Indian doctor was held in a US jail on a USD 2 million bond after being charged with multiple sex crimes for allegedly recording hundreds of nude images and videos of children and women over several years, according to media reports.</p>

<p>Oumair Aejaz was arrested earlier on August 8 after he allegedly placed hidden cameras in a variety of settings from bathrooms, changing areas, hospital rooms, and even his own home where he would record children as young as 2 years old in varying states of undress, Fox News reported.</p>

<p>Authorities became aware of his offences after his wife came forward with disturbing materials. Before his arrest, he had no criminal history.</p>

<p>He also allegedly recorded sexual encounters with numerous women who were unconscious or asleep, the Oakland County Sheriff said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The magnitude of Aejaz's offences is not currently known, but Sheriff Mike Bouchard said it will take months to fully investigate. Authorities suspect there could be many more victims as investigators review thousands of videos found at his home in Rochester Hills, a city in Oakland County in the US state of Michigan.</p>

<p>"The victimisation is so broad and the perversion so great, we're just beginning to wrap our arms around it," he said. "Disturbing on so many levels." He equated the scale of criminality to Larry Nasser, the disgraced sports doctor convicted of abusing dozens of young women in his care.</p>

<p>Several search warrants have been served since Aejaz was arrested on August 8 at his home. They include computers, phones, and 15 external devices. Bouchard said a single hard drive had 13,000 videos on it.</p>

<p>He may have uploaded videos into cloud storage as well.</p>

<p>Aejaz was charged on August 13 with one count of child sexually abusive activity, four counts of capturing an image of an unclothed person and five counts of using a computer to commit a crime and is being held in the Oakland County Jail on a USD 2 million bond, Detroit Free Press reported.</p>

<p>Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald said Aejaz's wife produced materials earlier this month that were concerning and the sheriff's office immediately executed a search warrant and confiscated more devices. She said investigators have "sifted through really jarring, alarming images" and continue to do so.</p>

<p>McDonald said Aejaz also preyed on well-respected institutions and hospitals, which she said have been cooperative.</p>

<p>Many of the allegations stem from Aejaz allegedly recording a mother and her kids inside a changing room at the Goldfish Swimming Club in 2023. However, he is also believed to have assaulted patients inside hospital rooms.</p>

<p>"These are children and moms at a swim school," McDonald said. "They're there to teach their kids to swim. Because that brings their kids joy and because they want their kids to be safe around water. They were victimised by a person of trust in the community – a medical doctor." His work history shows he was employed at Henry Ford Macomb Hospital in Clinton Township and Ascension Genesys Hospital in Grand Blanc. His current employment was as a physician contracted with a company that would send him to different hospitals.</p>

<p>Before that, he moved to the US in 2011 on a work visa from India, where he is a citizen. His residency took place at Sinai Grace Hospital before spending time in Alabama. He returned to Michigan in 2018.</p>

<p>Due to the number of victims and the difficulty identifying them, police have provided an email that people can use to contact the authorities.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Romanian authorities on Wednesday searched the home of controversial influencer Andrew Tate, who is awaiting trial over human trafficking and rape charges, as part of a new investigation, officials said.</p>

<p>One of the world's best-known influencers known for misogynist and sometimes violent maxims, Andrew Tate has been accused of having formed an organised criminal network in early 2021 in Romania and Britain, along with his brother Tristan. They have denied the charges.</p>

<p>Prosecutors allege that 37-year-old Tate, his 36-year-old brother and two women set up a criminal organisation and sexually exploited several victims. A trial date has not yet been set.</p>

<p>On Wednesday prosecutors "conducted a raid this morning, on August 21, 2024, at the residence of the Tate brothers as part of a search related to a new investigation", prosecutors said in a statement.</p>

<p>The Office for Organised Crime (DIICOT), said that four search warrants were executed, in connection with "the crimes of forming an organised criminal group, trafficking in minors", "sexual relations with a minor" and "money laundering".</p>

<p>Neither of the statements indicated whether the new charges targeted the brothers.</p>

<p>They were detained in 2022 in Bucharest and spent three months in detention before being released under judicial supervision to await trial.</p>

<p>The brothers also face rape and assault allegations in separate cases in Britain, where they have also been accused of tax evasion.</p>

<p>In 2016, Tate appeared on the "Big Brother" reality television show in Britain but was removed after a video emerged showing him attacking a woman.</p>

<p>He then turned to social media platforms to promote his divisive views.</p>

<p>Giving tips on how to be successful, along with misogynistic and sometimes violent maxims, his videos have made him one of the world's best-known influencers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Though there are only a handful of them among thousands of delegates, the "Uncommitted Movement" delegates at the Democratic National Convention are among the most vocal.</p>

<p>The delegates plan to voice their discontent with the war in Gaza at the party's convention this week in Chicago, during which <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-2024-kamala-harris-arrives-in-chicago-ahead-of-democratic-convention-6367700" target="_blank">Vice President Kamala Harris</a> will formally accept the Democratic Party's nomination in the close race for the White House.</p>

<p>The 30 "Uncommitted Movement" delegates hail from eight different US states and claim to represent some 700,000 voters.</p>

<p>Though they welcomed the news of President Joe Biden dropping out of the race on July 21, they have met Harris's subsequent ascension with caution and skepticism.</p>

<p>"The party needed change," Minnesota delegate Asma Mohammed told AFP. "I don't feel sad about someone who has unapologetically supported a genocidal regime in Israel."</p>

<p>Mohammed came to Chicago hoping to see a renewed perspective within her party, but she said she is disappointed that the convention has no pro-Palestinian voices on the speaker list.</p>

<p>"I know she's (Harris) more empathetic than Joe Biden, I've seen that," Mohammed said. "But those words are not enough. That needs to be followed by policy."</p>

<p>The Uncommitted Movement advocated for adding Tanya Haj-Hassan to the speaker list, wanting the thousands of attendees to hear from a doctor who has treated victims of the conflict between Israel and operatives group Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>However, all that has been permitted at the event so far is a panel at the nearby McCormick Center, outside the main venue. During the panel, the pediatrician described the horrors of war, bringing the audience to tears.</p>

<h3><strong>Both sides</strong></h3>

<p>Among the speakers slated for the DNC are some relatives of the 251 hostages taken by Hamas on Oct. 7 when it sparked the conflict by attacking Israel, which also left 1,199 dead, according to an AFP tally based on official data.</p>

<p>"Why does it have to be one or the other?" asked Mohammed, who emphasized that more than 40,000 people have died in Gaza from Israel's retaliation, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.</p>

<p>For her, there is room to listen to both sides.</p>

<p>Jacob Schonberger, a 17-year-old delegate representing the state of Connecticut, is not part of the "Uncommitted Movement" but shares the sentiment. He arrived at the convention wearing buttons with slogans in support of Israel.</p>

<p>"I think it should be leadership's decision... I have my personal beliefs, but I think that it's important to have both sides," he said.</p>

<p>In addition to the "Uncommitted Movement," protests fomented outside the United Center, the venue for the convention, where hundreds of people chanted "Free Palestine!"</p>

<p>Inside the arena, some delegates covered their mouths as Biden gave his speech Monday night, a gesture made in protest of his response to the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>"We wanted to send the message that we don't agree with what Biden has been doing," said Sabrene Odeh, a delegate from Washington state.</p>

<p>While the DNC is underway, Biden's Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, is on a tour of the Middle East in a new attempt to secure a truce between Israel and Hamas.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Scientific discovery is one of the most sophisticated human activities. Can and should a complex process be automated?]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientific discovery is one of the most sophisticated human activities. First, scientists must understand the existing knowledge and identify a significant gap. Next, they must formulate a research question and design and conduct an experiment in pursuit of an answer. Then, they must analyse and interpret the results of the experiment, which may raise yet another research question.</p>

<p>Can a process this complex be automated? Last week, <a href="https://sakana.ai/ai-scientist/">Sakana AI Labs announced</a> the creation of an “AI scientist” – an artificial intelligence system they claim can make scientific discoveries in the area of machine learning in a fully automated way.</p>

<p>Using generative large language models (LLMs) like those behind ChatGPT and other AI chatbots, the system can brainstorm, select a promising idea, code new algorithms, plot results, and write a paper summarising the experiment and its findings, complete with references. Sakana claims the AI tool can undertake the complete lifecycle of a scientific experiment at a cost of just US$15 per paper – less than the cost of a scientist's lunch.</p>

<p>These are some big claims. Do they stack up? And even if they do, would an army of AI scientists churning out research papers with inhuman speed really be good news for science?</p>

<h2>How a computer can ‘do science'</h2>

<p>A lot of science is done in the open, and almost all scientific knowledge has been written down somewhere (or we wouldn't have a way to “know” it). Millions of scientific papers are freely available online in repositories such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubMed</a>.</p>

<p>LLMs trained with this data capture the language of science and its patterns. It is therefore perhaps not at all surprising that a generative LLM can produce something that looks like a good scientific paper – it has ingested many examples that it can copy.</p>

<p>What is less clear is whether an AI system can produce an <em>interesting</em> scientific paper. Crucially, good science requires novelty.</p>

<h2>But is it interesting?</h2>

<p>Scientists don't want to be told about things that are already known. Rather, they want to learn new things, especially new things that are significantly different from what is already known. This requires judgement about the scope and value of a contribution.</p>

<p>The Sakana system tries to address interestingness in two ways. First, it “scores” new paper ideas for similarity to existing research (indexed in the <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/">Semantic Scholar</a> repository). Anything too similar is discarded.</p>

<p>Second, Sakana's system introduces a “peer review” step – using another LLM to judge the quality and novelty of the generated paper. Here again, there are plenty of examples of peer review online on sites such as <a href="https://openreview.net">openreview.net</a> that can guide how to critique a paper. LLMs have ingested these, too.</p>

<h2>AI may be a poor judge of AI output</h2>

<p>Feedback is mixed on Sakana AI's output. Some have described it as producing “<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/research-ai-model-unexpectedly-modified-its-own-code-to-extend-runtime/">endless scientific slop</a>”.</p>

<p>Even the system's own review of its outputs judges the papers weak at best. This is likely to improve as the technology evolves, but the question of whether automated scientific papers are valuable remains.</p>

<p>The ability of LLMs to judge the quality of research is also an open question. My own work (soon to be published in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/17592887">Research Synthesis Methods</a>) shows LLMs are not great at judging the risk of bias in medical research studies, though this too may improve over time.</p>

<p>Sakana's system automates discoveries in computational research, which is much easier than in other types of science that require physical experiments. Sakana's experiments are done with code, which is also structured text that LLMs can be trained to generate.</p>

<h2>AI tools to support scientists, not replace them</h2>

<p>AI researchers have been developing systems to support science for decades. Given the huge volumes of published research, even finding publications relevant to a specific scientific question can be challenging.</p>

<p>Specialised search tools make use of AI to help scientists find and synthesise existing work. These include the above-mentioned Semantic Scholar, but also newer systems such as <a href="https://elicit.com/">Elicit</a>, <a href="https://www.researchrabbit.ai/">Research Rabbit</a>, <a href="https://scite.ai/">scite</a> and <a href="https://consensus.app/">Consensus</a>.</p>

<p>Text mining tools such as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator3/">PubTator</a> dig deeper into papers to identify key points of focus, such as specific genetic mutations and diseases, and their established relationships. This is especially useful for curating and organising scientific information.</p>

<p>Machine learning has also been used to support the synthesis and analysis of medical evidence, in tools such as <a href="https://www.robotreviewer.net/">Robot Reviewer</a>. Summaries that compare and contrast claims in papers from <a href="https://www.scholarcy.com/">Scholarcy</a> help to perform literature reviews.</p>

<p>All these tools aim to help scientists do their jobs more effectively, not to replace them.</p>

<h2>AI research may exacerbate existing problems</h2>

<p>While Sakana AI <a href="https://sakana.ai/ai-scientist/#limitations-and-challenges">states</a> it doesn't see the role of human scientists diminishing, the company's vision of “a fully AI-driven scientific ecosystem” would have major implications for science.</p>

<p>One concern is that, if AI-generated papers flood the scientific literature, future AI systems may be trained on AI output and undergo <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y">model collapse</a>. This means they may become increasingly ineffectual at innovating.</p>

<p>However, the implications for science go well beyond impacts on AI science systems themselves.</p>

<p>There are already bad actors in science, including “paper mills” churning out <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00159-9">fake papers</a>. This problem will only <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01780-w">get worse</a> when a scientific paper can be produced with US$15 and a vague initial prompt.</p>

<p>The need to check for errors in a mountain of automatically generated research could rapidly overwhelm the capacity of actual scientists. The peer review system is arguably <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-peer-review-system-is-broken-we-asked-academics-how-to-fix-it-187034">already broken</a>, and dumping more research of questionable quality into the system won't fix it.</p>

<p>Science is fundamentally based on trust. Scientists emphasise the integrity of the scientific process so we can be confident our understanding of the world (and now, the world's machines) is valid and improving.</p>

<p>A scientific ecosystem where AI systems are key players raises fundamental questions about the meaning and value of this process, and what level of trust we should have in AI scientists. Is this the kind of scientific ecosystem we want?<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the heart of the Middle East, where power and tradition are deeply intertwined, one man has risen to hold the reins of a nation known for its strict adherence to conservative values and immense wealth derived from oil. Mohammed bin Salman, commonly referred to as MBS, is the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia. As per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gz8934wrro">BBC insiders</a>, his rise to power has been nothing short of dramatic, marked by bold decisions, ruthless tactics and a vision for transforming his kingdom.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Midnight Plans</strong></h2>

<p>In the hushed corridors of power in Riyadh, as Saudi Arabia prepared for a significant transition in 2015, a young prince, then barely known beyond the borders of his kingdom, was already laying the groundwork for a seismic shift. But MBS, then only 29 years old, nurtured immense ambition. After the death of King Abdullah, his father, Salman, was poised to ascend the throne. And that's where MBS saw an opportunity to reshape Saudi Arabia - and his role in it.</p>

<p>Aware of the potential threats from within the family, MBS acted decisively. One night, he called a senior security official, Saad al-Jabri, to the palace for a secret meeting. Both men left their mobile phones outside the room, and MBS even disconnected the landline to ensure complete privacy.</p>

<h2><strong>Vision 2030</strong></h2>

<p>During this tense, late-night meeting, MBS laid out his ambitious vision (known as Vision 2030) for Saudi Arabia. He believed that the kingdom, long known for its conservative values and reliance on oil, needed to wake up from its "deep slumber" and claim its place on the global stage. His plan included selling a stake in Aramco, the world's most profitable company, to kickstart the country's economic transformation.</p>

<p>He also aimed to invest billions in technology startups like Uber and to bring millions of Saudi women into the workforce, creating six million new jobs. This plan also included bold initiatives such as the development of the futuristic city NEOM and investments in tourism. These reforms would later be widely praised as necessary steps to bring Saudi Arabia into the 21st century.</p>

<h2><strong>'Have You Heard Of Alexander The Great?'</strong></h2>

<p>When Jabri, amazed by MBS'&nbsp;grand vision, asked about the scope of his ambitions, the young prince responded simply, "Have you heard of Alexander the Great?" It was clear that MBS saw himself as a leader destined to make history.</p>

<p>What was supposed to be a short meeting lasted three hours, according to insiders. By the time Jabri left, he had missed several calls from concerned colleagues. This midnight conversation marked the beginning of a new era for Saudi Arabia, one that would be shaped by the rise of MBS.</p>

<h2><strong>Plot To Kill The King?</strong></h2>

<p>In 2014, MBS, was eager for his father to become king. He allegedly suggested killing his uncle using a poisoned ring from Russia. Saad al-Jabri, in an interview with the BBC, claims to have seen a secret video of MBS discussing this idea. It is unclear if MBS was serious or just joking. After this, MBS was not allowed to attend royal meetings and shake hands with the king for a while. Eventually, King Abdullah died of natural causes, and his brother Salman became king in 2015 and MBS was appointed Defense Minister and Deputy Crown Prince.</p>

<p>As MBS's father, King Salman, became increasingly frail, the crown prince assumed de facto control of Saudi Arabia. MBS has begun implementing ambitious plans, but his rule has also been marked by allegations of human rights abuses, including suppressing free speech, using the death penalty, and jailing women's rights activists, as per a BBC report.&nbsp;</p>

<p>MBS has a tendency to act impulsively, often ignoring advice from others, Saad-al Jabri revealed in the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gz8934wrro">exclusive BBC interview</a>. The senior official revealed that the ruler has a vision for Saudi Arabia, but his methods are often reckless and disregard traditional decision-making processes.</p>

<h2><strong>The Yemen War</strong></h2>

<p>One such example is the Yemen war. In 2015, MBS led a group of Gulf countries into war against the Houthi movement in Yemen. He saw the Houthis as supported by Iran, a rival of Saudi Arabia. The war caused a huge humanitarian crisis, with millions of people at risk of starvation. A former British ambassador, Sir John Jenkins, said it was not a clever decision. The US military only had 12 hours' notice of the war, which is very unusual.</p>

<h2><strong>MBS Forged His Father's Signature</strong></h2>

<p>Jabri also claims MBS forged his father's signature on a royal decree committing ground troops, despite warnings from the Americans. Saad al-Jabri claims he discussed the Yemen war with the White House before it started. He says Susan Rice, President Obama's advisor, warned him that the US would only support air strikes, not ground troops. But Jabri says MBS ignored the US and forged his father's signature to send ground troops. Jabri's source was someone he trusted, linked to the Ministry of Interior.</p>

<h2><strong>Jamal Khashoggi's Killing</strong></h2>

<p>One of the darkest chapters in MBS's rule is the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Khashoggi, a vocal critic of MBS, was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by a 15-member hit squad. The operatives travelled on diplomatic passports, and many were part of MBS' personal security detail, implicating the crown prince in the murder in ways that are difficult to dismiss. Khashoggi's body was never found and is believed to have been dismembered with a bone saw.</p>

<p>While MBS has always denied direct involvement, he acknowledged in 2019 that, as the country's leader, he bears "responsibility" for the crime. However, a declassified US intelligence report released in February 2021 stated that MBS was likely complicit in the killing. In the aftermath, those close to MBS observed a shift in his demeanour. The crown prince was reportedly shocked at the global reaction following the murder. A former US diplomat who met MBS after the incident noted that the prince described the murder as a "colossal blunder" and insisted he had not authorised it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2017, MBS spent $450m on a famous painting called the Salvator Mundi. The painting is of Jesus Christ and has been missing for almost seven years. Some say it's stored in Geneva, and MBS plans to display it in a future museum in Riyadh.</p>

<p>MBS' plans for sports are also ambitious, with Saudi Arabia bidding to host the FIFA World Cup and investing in tennis and golf tournaments. Some call this "sportswashing," but MBS wants to show his power and make Saudi Arabia great.</p>

<p>MBS' father, King Salman, is now 88 years old. Sooner or later, MBS will rule over Saudi Arabia for decades.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A crocodile killed a woman bathing in a river in eastern Indonesia, police and locals said Wednesday, with villagers later recovering parts of her body from the slaughtered animal.</p>

<p>Indonesia is home to several species of crocodiles that regularly attack and kill humans.</p>

<p>Halima Rahakbauw, 54, was swimming in a river in Wali village on the Maluku islands after spending Tuesday morning looking for clams when the reptile struck.</p>

<p>Rahakbauw's neighbour, Rustam Ilyas, said relatives and friends started a search when she failed to return home.</p>

<p>After spotting a sandal and a body part in the river, villagers reported the incident to police who killed the reptile.</p>

<p>"The villagers had to cut open the crocodile's belly to remove some of the victim's body parts," a local police officer, who requested anonymity as he was not authorised to speak on the matter, told AFP Wednesday.</p>

<p>"The crocodile was quite big, around four metres (12 feet)long," neighbour Ilyas told AFP.</p>

<p>Neither the police nor villagers could identify the species.</p>

<p>On Sunday, a 63-year-old tin miner was killed by a crocodile near a river on Bangka island in Sumatra.</p>

<p>In 2018, a mob in Indonesia's easternmost region of Papua butchered nearly 300 crocodiles in revenge after a local man was killed by one of the reptiles.</p>

<p>In 2019 a scientist was dragged by a huge captive crocodile into its enclosure and killed on the island of Sulawesi.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Defence Minister Rajnath Singh will be on a four-day visit to the US beginning Friday to further boost the comprehensive global strategic partnership between the two countries.</p>

<p>In Washington, Rajnath Singh will hold talks with Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan among others.</p>

<p>India's plan to procure 31 MQ-9B Predator drones, the proposed joint manufacturing of Stryker infantry combat vehicles and co-production of GE F414 engines in India are likely to figure prominently in Singh's talks with Austin, officials said today.</p>

<p>"The visit is expected to further deepen and broaden the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership," the defence ministry said announcing Singh's trip to the US from August 23 to 26.</p>

<p>"The visit comes in the backdrop of the growing momentum in India-US relations and defence engagements at multiple levels," it said.</p>

<p>Rajnath Singh will also chair a high-level round-table meeting with the US defence industry on the ongoing and future defence collaborations. He will also interact with the Indian community during the visit.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Daniela Larreal Chirinos, one of Venezuela's best-known athletes and five-time Olympian, has been found dead at her Las Vegas apartment. The retired cyclist reportedly choked on her food, police said.</p>

<p>When Ms&nbsp;Chirinos did not turn up at the Las Vegas hotel where she worked, she was checked on and her body was found at her apartment, according to FOX Sports. The 50-year-old is believed to have died on August 11.</p>

<h3><strong>Who Was Daniela&nbsp;Larreal Chirinos?</strong></h3>

<p>One of the finest athletes ever to represent Venezuela, Daniela Larreal Chirinos is a two-time gold medalist in the Pan American Games and the Pan American Championships. Ms&nbsp;Chirinos featured in five Olympics editions.</p>

<p>She made her Olympics debut in Barcelona way back in 1992 and participated in four Olympic events -- Atlanta (1996), Sydney (2000), Athens (2004) and London (2012). She also clinched two gold medals at the Central American and Caribbean Games in San Salvador, 2002.</p>

<p>Apart from a storied career in cycling, Ms&nbsp;Chirinos was also active in Venezuelan politics. A vocal critic of former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez, the Olympian accused the late president and his sports minister Hector Rodriguez of funneling money out of the country in the name of sponsoring a "non-existent" racing driver.</p>

<p>In 2013, upon Nicolás Maduro's arrival at the helm in Venezuela, Ms&nbsp;Chirinos called his presidency a dictatorship. She was forced into exile and banned from entering Venezuela. Before moving to Las Vegas where she worked as a food server, Ms&nbsp;Chirinos was an Uber driver in Miami.</p>

<h3><strong>How did she die?</strong></h3>

<p>While the “cause and method” of her death was still under investigation, police suspected she died from asphyxiation after they reportedly found solid food remains in her windpipe, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/20/daniela-larreal-chirinos-olympian-dead">The Guardian</a> reported.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the Clark County Coroner's Office said an official cause of death was still pending.</p>

<p>The Comité Olímpico Venezolano (Venezuelan Olympic Committee) shared on X a heartfelt tribute with a picture of Ms&nbsp;Chirinos holding a medal.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine attacked Moscow on Wednesday with at least 11 drones shot down by air defences in what Russian officials said was one of the biggest drone strikes on the capital since the war in Ukraine began in February 2022.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-were-set-for-ceasefire-talks-in-doha-then-a-shock-assault-6362125" target="_blank">The war</a>, largely a grinding artillery and drone battle across the fields, forests and villages of eastern Ukraine, escalated on Aug. 6 when Ukraine sent thousands of soldiers into Russia's western Kursk region.</p>

<p>For months, Ukraine has also fought an increasingly damaging drone war against the refineries and airfields of the world's second largest oil exporter, though major drone attacks on the Moscow region - with a population of over 21 million - are rarer.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry said it destroyed a total of 45 drones over Russian territory, including 11 over the Moscow region, 23 over the border region of Bryansk, six over the Belgorod region, three over the Kaluga region and two over the Kursk region.</p>

<p>Some of the drones were destroyed over the city of Podolsk, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said. The city in the Moscow region is some 38 kms (24 miles) south of the Kremlin.</p>

<p>"This is one of the largest attempts to attack Moscow using drones ever," Sobyanin said on the Telegram messaging app in the early hours of Wednesday.</p>

<p>"The layered defence of Moscow that was created made it possible to successfully repel all the attacks from the enemy UAVs."</p>

<p>The attack comes as Russia is advancing in eastern Ukraine, where it controls about 18% of the territory, and battling to repel Ukraine's incursion into the Kursk region, the biggest foreign attack on Russian territory since World War Two.</p>

<p>Russian media showed unverified footage of drones whirring over the dawn sky of the Moscow region and then being shot down in a ball of flame by air defences.</p>

<p>Moscow's airports Vnukovo, Domodedovo and Zhukovsky limited flights for four hours but were restarted normal operations from 0330 GMT, Russia's aviation watchdog said.</p>

<p>Sobyanin said that according to preliminary information, there were no injuries or damage reported in the aftermath of the attacks. There were also no casualties or damage reported in the aftermath of the attack on Bryansk in Russia's southwest, the governor of the region Alexander Bogomaz wrote on Telegram.</p>

<p>Russia's RIA state news agency reported that two drones were destroyed over the Tula region, which borders the Moscow region to its north. Vasily Golubev, governor of the Rostov region in Russia's southwest, said air defence forces destroyed a Ukraine-launched missile over the region, with no injuries reported.</p>

<p>The Russia defence ministry did not mention neither Tula nor Rostov in its statement listing destroyed Ukrainian air weapons. Ukraine's military said on Wednesday it overnight struck an S-300 anti-aircraft missile system based in Rostov region.</p>

<p>Reuters could not independently verify the reports.</p>

<p>The drone attack on Moscow is on a par with the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/russia-alleges-ukraine-attempted-to-assassinate-vladimir-putin-4001694" target="_blank">May 2023 attack</a> when at least eight drones were destroyed over the capital in an attack President Vladimir Putin said was Kyiv's attempt to scare and provoke Russia.</p>

<p>In Kursk, Russian war bloggers said that intense battles were ongoing along the front in the region where Ukraine has carved out at least 450 square km (175 square miles) of Russian territory.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov on Tuesday inspected Chechen troops and volunteers readying to fight Ukraine, the Kremlin said, in what was Putin's first trip in 13 years to the North Caucasus republic.</p>

<p>The previously unannounced trip to the mostly Muslim republic that is part of Russia comes as Moscow fights to push Ukrainian forces out of its Kursk region two weeks after they smashed through the border in the largest invasion of Russia since World War Two.</p>

<p>"As long as we have men like you, we are absolutely, absolutely invincible," Putin told troops at the Russian Special Forces University, a training school in Chechnya's Gudermes, according to a transcript on the Kremlin's website.</p>

<p>"It is one thing to shoot at a shooting range here, and another thing to put your life and health at risk. But you have an inner need to defend the Fatherland and the courage to make such a decision."</p>

<p>The foreign occupation of Russian land has been an embarrassment for Putin and his army, even as Russian forces continue their gradual but steady advances on the frontline in eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>Kadyrov, sanctioned by the United States in 2020 and 2022 for alleged human rights abuses and mobilising Chechen troops to fight Ukraine, told Putin at a separate meeting on Tuesday that Chechnya had sent more than 47,000 troops since the start of the war to fight Ukraine, including about 19,000 volunteers.</p>

<p>Kadyrov has often described himself as Putin's "foot soldier."</p>

<p>When asked by a journalist whether "Putin's foot soldiers" like Kadyrov justify his trust, Putin said "If I had more of these foot soldiers, I would be very happy, but even one such foot soldier is worth a lot", reported the RIA agency.</p>

<h3><strong>Beslan and Kursk</strong></h3>

<p>Before heading to Chechnya, Putin visited for the first time in at least 16 years the town Beslan in North Ossetia. The 2004 school siege by Islamic militants there left more than 330 dead in what has been the bloodiest incident of its kind in modern Russian history.</p>

<p>Among those killed were 136 children, Putin said at a meeting in Beslan with the mothers of the children killed in the attack.</p>

<p>"This tragedy will remain an unhealed wound in the historical memory of all of Russia," Putin said, according to the transcript published on the Kremlin's website.</p>

<p>But he also added that Russia continues to face enemies that try to destabilise the country.</p>

<p>"And just as we fought terrorists, today we have to fight those who commit crimes in the Kursk region, in Donbas," Putin said, referring to Ukraine's surprise incursion into the Russian territory and the broader Donbas region in Ukraine's southeast, which Russian forces partially control.</p>

<p>"We will punish the criminals. There can be no doubt about this."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The adult film star was found dead in her New Mexico home on March 1.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Six months after adult film star Sophia Leone's death, the official cause has been revealed. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/04/18/porn-star-sophia-leone-death-mom-suicidal-thoughts-drinking-police-report/">TMZ</a>, the 26-year-old's death was accidental, resulting from a drug overdose. Notably, Ms Leone's body was found in her New Mexico home on March 1, with police initially deeming her death "suspicious" and "unique".</p>

<p>Her mother had previously disclosed to a detective that Ms Leone struggled with alcohol dependency and had suicidal thoughts. The investigation has now concluded that Leone's death was an accidental overdose, bringing closure to the case. However, it's not clear which substances she had ingested.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The news of her death first came to light when Ms Leone's stepfather Mike Romero sought funds for her memorial on <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/sophia-leones-memorial-fund">GoFundMe.</a></p>

<p>''The sudden loss of Sophia has left her family and friends devastated and in shock.&nbsp;Sophia was a beloved daughter, sister, granddaughter, niece and friend. She had a deep love for all animals, specifically her three pets. She enjoyed travelling and always found ways to make everyone around her smile'', Mr Romero wrote on the fundraising page.</p>

<p>Ms Leone was born on June 10, 1997, in Miami in the US. She reportedly entered the adult entertainment industry at the age of 18 and was said to have a net worth north of $1 million. She was associated with the modelling agency 101 and starred in more than 80 films, according to her IMDB page.</p>

<p>&nbsp;In her last post before death, Ms Leone told her fans to "go outside and just appreciate life a little extra".&nbsp;</p>

<p>She sent a heartfelt note to her 300,000 Instagram fans in September. "Go outside and just appreciate life a little extra today," the 26-year-old captioned a picture, where she posed wearing white sunglasses and a white handbag thrown over her shoulder while flashing the peace sign to the camera.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Former United States First Lady Michelle Obama, 60, turned back the clock Tuesday at the Democratic convention in Chicago, delivering a passionate speech in support of Kamala Harris and ripping into Donald Trump, the Republican pick.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former United States First Lady <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/michelle-obama" target="_blank">Michelle Obama</a>, 60, turned back the clock Tuesday at the Democratic convention in Chicago, delivering a passionate speech in support of "my girl"&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/kamala-harris" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a> for November's presidential election and warning <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/donald-trump" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a>&nbsp;"hope is making a comeback".</p>

<p>Ms Obama's speeches helped propel her husband, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/barack-obama" target="_blank">Barack Obama</a>, to two consecutive terms, and who was widely spoken of as a potential presidential candidate herself, particularly early this year as the Democrats struggled to rally behind a single nominee to replace Joe Biden. And in Chicago last night she brought all of that considerable charisma to bear, and the measure of her popularity was underlined by receiving a welcome bigger than that which greeted Mr Obama in his hometown.</p>

<p>Among the highlights of Ms Obama's speech was her leaning into Kamala Harris' background, highlighting her multi-racial origin as "the embodiment of stories we speak about (in) this country. "Her story is your story. It is my story," she said, in response to jibes by Donald Trump.</p>

<h3><strong>Michelle Slams Trump's "Misogynistic Lies"</strong></h3>

<p>The Trump campaign has attempted to weaponise Ms Harris' racial identity; a tactic perhaps best epitomised by Mr Trump's "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://theconversation.com/us-election-2024-how-trump-and-vance-are-trying-to-weaponise-kamala-harriss-multiracial-identity-236521" target="_blank">I didn't know she was Black... till she happened to 'turn Black'</a> and now she wants to be known as 'Black'" swipe at Ms Harris (to a Black reporter) last month.</p>

<p>Michelle Obama's counterattacks last night were brief but packed a punch, and included a sarcastic dig at the twice-impeached former President for running for "one of those Black jobs".</p>

<p>"We know folks are going to do everything to distort her truth."</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">Barack and Michelle Obama led the Democrats' charge in Chicago Tuesday night.</p>
</div>

<p>"For years Trump did everything to make people fear us (referring to Mr Obama and herself). His narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by two highly successful and educated people who happened to be Black... who is going to tell him the job he is seeking is now one of those 'Black jobs'?" she said accusing Mr Trump of "ugly, misogynistic, (and) racist lies".</p>

Biden Blasts Trump In Fiery Speech</a></p>

<p>Switching focus to Ms Harris, Michelle Obama said, "The steel of her spine... the steadiness of her upbringing, and the joy and light of her laughter... Kamala knows that regardless of where you come from, who you worship, or what you look like... you deserve a decent life."</p>

<p>"No one has a monopoly on what it means to be an American."</p>

<p>"America, hope is making a comeback," she said.</p>

<h3><strong>"Kamala Has Proven Her Allegiance"</strong></h3>

<p>Ms Obama also drew similarities between herself and the Vice President.</p>

<p>"Kamala Harris and I built our lives (on) the same values. Our mothers shared the same beliefs in the promise of this country. That's why hers moved here from India... that is why she taught Kamala about justice. She told her daughter, 'don't sit around and complain, do something'."</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">US Vice President Kamala Harris is the Democrats' pick for the 2024 presidential race.</p>

<p>"So, Kamala went out and she worked hard fighting for people, for better wages and cheaper drugs. From a middle-class household Kamala worked her way up to become Vice President. My girl, Kamala Harris, is more than ready for this moment," she declared.</p>

<p>Underlining Ms Harris' credentials in the face of attacks by the Trump campaign, Ms Obama said Ms Harris had "shown her allegiance... not by spewing anger but by living a life of service."</p>

<p>"Let us not forget what we are up against... Kamala and Tim (Walz, Governor of Minnesota and Ms Harris' VP pick) are doing good now but remember... there are still so many people ready to criticise every move Kamala makes..." Ms Obama said. "We must do everything in our power to elect these two bighearted, good people. There is no other choice than Kamala and Tim."</p>

<h3><strong>"Still Only Human"</strong></h3>

<p>Ms Obama also sought to buy the Harris campaign an extended honeymoon and a shield from future attacks by Donald Trump, warning Democrat delegates, supporters, and voters that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz "are still only human... they are not perfect... will make mistakes."</p>

<p>"It is up to us to be the anecdote to the darkness and division. I don't care how you identify politically... this is our time to stand up for basic freedoms and humanity. This is going to be an uphill battle (and) we cannot be our own worst enemies," Ms Obama said to deafening cheers.</p>

<h3><strong>"Yes, She Can", Barack's War Cry</strong></h3>

<p>Meanwhile, Barack Obama tweaked the 'Yes, We Can' war cry from his 2008 campaign and delivered another rousing endorsement of Kamala Harris. Mr Obama formally endorsed Ms Harris as the Democrat nominee last month, telling her "this is going to be historic".</p>

<p>On Tuesday the former president launched a scathing attack on Donald Trump, labelling him "a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden elevator nine years ago", and accusing him of divisive politics.</p>

<p>"Trump wants us to think this country is divided between 'us' and 'them'. Between 'real' Americans who support him and the 'outsiders'. It is the oldest trick in politics. His act has gotten stale. We do not need four more years of chaos as we have seen that movie before and we know the sequel is usually worse," he said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sam Altman-led OpenAI on Tuesday announced a multi-year partnership with Condé Nast to display content from its brands such as the Vogue and the New Yorker within the AI startup's products, including ChatGPT and SearchGPT prototype.</p>

<p>Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>

<p>OpenAI has signed similar deals with the Time magazine, Financial Times, Business Insider-owner Axel Springer, France's Le Monde and Spain's Prisa Media over the past few months.</p>

<p>While these content partnerships are essential for training artificial intelligence models, some media organizations such as the New York Times and the Intercept had sued the Microsoft-backed firm over copyright issues associated with their works.</p>

<p>Brad Lightcap, chief operating officer at OpenAI, said the company is committed to working with Condé Nast and other news publishers to "ensure that as AI plays a larger role in news discovery and delivery, it maintains accuracy, integrity and respect for quality reporting".</p>

<p>News and digital media have faced steep challenges over the last decade as many technology companies eroded publishers' ability to monetize content, Roger Lynch, CEO of Condé Nast, said in a memo to employees.</p>

<p>"Our partnership with OpenAI begins to make up for some of that revenue," Lynch said.</p>

<p>OpenAI launched its AI-powered search engine SearchGPT in July, with real-time access to information from the internet, into a territory long dominated by Google.</p>

<p>The company said on Tuesday it was collaborating with its news partners to collect feedback and insights on the design and performance of SearchGPT.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Politicians in this country could be fined up to 5 per cent of their salary or suspended from the Parliament for bad behaviour under new government workplace laws.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian politicians could be fined up to 5 per cent of their salary or suspended from the Parliament for bad behaviour under new government workplace laws.</p>

<p>The governing Labor Party on Wednesday introduced new legislation to establish an Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission (IPSC) to crack down on politicians and staff who engage in bad behaviour, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>The IPSC will have the power to enforce behaviour codes, conduct workplace investigations, and impose sanctions on elected members of both houses of the Parliament, their staff, and other employees in parliamentary workplaces.</p>

<p>If serious misconduct is found to have been perpetrated by a current or former politician, the commission can recommend that they be fined up to five per cent of their annual base salary or suspended from the Parliament.</p>

<p>The IPSC was first proposed in 2021 in a report from the government's Sex Discrimination Commissioner that found 33 per cent of people working in Commonwealth Parliamentary workplaces (CPWs) had experienced at least one incident of sexual harassment and 37 per cent had been subjected to bullying.</p>

<p>The landmark Set the Standard report was commissioned after former government staffer Brittany Higgins went public in February 2021 with allegations that she was raped by a colleague in Parliament House in March 2019.</p>

<p>A federal court judge ruled in April 2024 that Higgins was raped by fellow political staffer Bruce Lehrmann.</p>

<p>"The 2021 Set the Standard report laid bare the serious issues of bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assault at Parliamentary workplaces," Katy Gallagher, the Minister for Finance, Minister for Women and Minister for the Public Service, said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Democratic organisers are inundated with Indian American youth "coming out of the woodwork" to support <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/kamala-harris-thanks-biden-in-surprise-speech-on-day-1-of-democratic-event-827761">Kamala Harris</a>. Rajeev Bhateja, co-founder of the group They See Blue, which mobilises South Asian American voters, points to a spike in volunteer signups to canvas for the Democratic Presidential nominee. "High school and college students are reaching out. It's way more than even Obama, Biden and Clinton years," he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The leader of They See Blue's youth chapter, Akash Borde, observed that the tide turned when President Joe Biden stepped out of the race. "Kamala's nomination after Biden decided not to rerun raised a lot more excitement among my peers," he says. "With the media narratives around Biden's age and foreign policy issues, we were struggling to bring young people in. Now, my phone is blowing away. The momentum is unprecedented in the South Asian community," says Harini Krishnan, Co-director of the group South Asians for Harris.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-polls-2024-national-democratic-convetion-day-2-live-roll-call-today-to-select-kamala-harris-as-democratic-candidate-6381127">Also Read |&nbsp;"Yes She Can": Barack Obama Tweaks 2008 Campaign Slogan For Kamala Harris</a></strong></p>

<p>Hundreds of volunteers across the country have been knocking on doors, running phone banks, and writing postcards to bring out voters for Harris. It's not only her shared heritage but also her "better speeches" compared to Biden that make her resonate with Indian-American supporters. Young voters find her campaign "uplifting", with "hope and positivity" for a "bright" White House amidst the "doom and gloom" that Donald Trump's rhetoric represents for many.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Biden's Campaign "Lacked Urgency"</strong></h2>

<p>A July 2024 voter survey has shown Asian-American support for Biden has declined since 2020. His 15-point margin this year contrasts with the nearly 30-point edge he held over Trump during the last Presidential election cycle. The campaign, some say, lacked the "urgency" seen in 2020. "A complacency had set in. Kamala jumping into this race has transformed the landscape," says Krishnan.</p>

<p>According to Sangay Mishra, the author of the book <em>Desis Divided: The Political Lives of South Asian Americans</em> and Associate Professor of Political Science at Drew University, there is palpable change among people who were feeling hesitant after Biden's performance in the debate. "They are much more connected now. The broader trend seems that at the minimum, we will see the kind of support for Harris that we saw for Biden in 2020, probably even more," he says. That may not be entirely off the mark given the robust mobilisation for Harris: crowded rallies, young supporters offering free catchy videos on social media, a 9,000-strong 'South Asian Women for Harris' fundraiser followed by the formation of South Asian Men for Harris (the campaign raised $36 million within 24 hours after she picked Governor Tim Walz to be her vice-presidential candidate), merchandise fashioned around the viral meme 'Lotus for POTUS'.</p>

<h2><strong>Wooing Loyal Republicans Won't Be Easy</strong></h2>

<p>Yet, for all the enthusiasm, shared roots haven't been enough to convert many Republican supporters. Sure, Harris's Indian-American identity does strike a chord with the community, but it may not translate to votes beyond her party.</p>

<p>According to a census survey, Indian Americans are the largest population among Asian Americans in the US. Their votes are critical in narrowly fought elections. But they're not a monolithic voter bloc. Except for a small group, 'Haley Supporters for Harris', which staunchly backed Republican Nikki Haley during her Presidential primary and continues to hold an anti-Trump stance (despite Haley having endorsed Donald Trump), other Republican supporters have largely not switched to Harris.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hillary-clinton-praises-kamala-harris-joe-biden-at-2024-democratic-convention-slams-donald-trump-6374851">Also Read |&nbsp;"Kamala Harris Won't Rest, Trump Slept At His Trial": Hillary Clinton</a></strong></p>

<p>"One hundred per cent I support President Trump! I am not voting for Kamala Harris," says Florida-based hotelier Danny Gaekwad, who has raised funds for all Republican presidential candidates since George W. Bush. Issues that matter to him are border security, legal immigration, less government and lower taxes. Gaekwad thinks mere 'home country' affinity shouldn't shape the electoral decisions of immigrant voters. Local issues must define people's choices, he says. "Indians have this habit of finding links in common with prominent Indian Americans, seeking common relatives, uncles, aunties, ancestral villages! What kind of an obsession is that!"</p>

<p>Similarly, Republican fundraiser Pravina Kakodkar hopes that Trump will, as he promised, "drain the swamp in DC". She says, "We need a person who will shake Washington DC. It's become this exclusive class of people who are very disconnected from the rest of the country. I want this smashed, and only Donald Trump has the capacity to do that." Kakodkar's children, on the other hand, are Democrat supporters.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>On Being Indian Enough</strong></h2>

<p>Some Republicans believe that Harris downplays her Indian identity - something Trump has also commented on. "Kamala Harris has always projected herself as a black woman. I have never heard her say once that she's Indian," says Gaekwad. In her autobiography though, Harris has spoken openly about her Indian roots, her Indian grandparents and growing up biracial in California.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then there are others who feel that Harris didn't do enough for the community as Vice-President. California-based independent voter Pushpita Prasad, an advocate for the rights of Hindus, acknowledges that Harris's background does create a "certain strong pull of representation", but issues are a priority, she stresses. "It's ironic that the situation of Indian Americans in terms of the immigration process and visas has become so bad. We've had a South Asian person in the office during which we have seen attacks on Hindu temples in the US, even in her home state of California. I really wish for Vice President Harris to condemn those temple attacks and to condemn the violence happening against Bangladeshi Hindus."&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Israel-Gaza Blot On Democrats</strong></h2>

<p>There are also Indian Americans who find themselves being single-issue voters in this presidential election. They don't support Trump and his far-right 'Project 2025' agenda, but, at the same time, view America's handling of the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-says-israel-has-right-to-defend-itself-against-hezbollah-6227644">Israel-Palestine</a> conflict as a stain on the Biden-Harris administration. Zainab Hakim, who stands strongly for US divestment from Israel, was at a recent Harris rally in Detroit with a group of protesters, seeking accountability and demanding a ceasefire. But Harris responded to Hakim's slogans by saying that they should let her speak unless they wanted "Donald Trump to win".</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/kamala-harris-to-rishi-sunak-indians-must-be-realistic-about-the-rise-of-indian-origin-leaders-6117384">Also Read | Why Indians Must Be Realistic About The Rise Of Indian-Origin Leaders Abroad</a></strong></p>

<p>Referring to the incident, Hakim says, "She's saying, 'I'm absolutely better than this guy', even while continuing to fund a genocide. She has been the Vice-President for three years. We are set on not voting for somebody that will continue to allow the genocide." For Hakim and others like her, Harris's gender and race credentials mean little against such discontents. "I think it doesn't mean anything for somebody to be a woman, or a black woman or an Indian American in power if they're continuing to sanction the murder of people abroad," says Hakim, who has been at the forefront of student protests at the University of Michigan.</p>

<p>Experts note that the Isral-Gaza conflict continues to be a concern among some communities. "There is a lot of pushback among younger people within the Indian American community also. Numerous campuses have South Asian American students who were involved in protests, Muslims particularly," says Mishra.</p>

<h2><strong>Can Kamala Create History?</strong></h2>

<p>Indian Americans do not vote as a bloc; a range of opinions shape their choices. Even so, an AAPI Data survey from July 2024 shows that the majority of them - 55 % - identified as or leaned towards the Democratic Party, while 26% identified or leaned Republican. This is significant because in many of America's battleground states where no single party dominates, the Presidential elections come down to the wire. In the last few election cycles, narrow victory margins in such states have made the Asian-American vote critical, and this is why Indian-Americans are being courted by both parties this time.</p>

<p>Harris will thus have to pull in the undecided and independent voters to come out on top. If she wins this November, she will be the first woman, the first Black woman and the first South Asian American to hold America's highest office. A large section of Indian American voters naturally wish to play a part in creating this history.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 28 Pakistani pilgrims travelling to Iraq for a Shiite Muslim ritual were killed as their bus crashed in central Iran, state media reported early Wednesday.</p>

<p>"A bus carrying 51 Pakistani pilgrims overturned and caught fire in front of Dehshir-Taft checkpoint in the central province of Yazd on Tuesday night," state television reported.</p>

<p>"28 people have been killed and 23 injured so far with the possibility of the death count increasing," it added.</p>

<p>Yazd province crisis management chief Ali Malek-zadeh told the broadcaster that some of the injured were in critical condition.</p>

<p>"Of the 23 injured, six have already been discharged from hospital, while the condition of seven others is critical," Malek-zadeh said.</p>

<p>"The dead consisted of 11 women and 17 men," he added.</p>

<p>The Pakistani pilgrims were headed through Iran to Iraq to attend the Arbaeen commemoration, one of the biggest events of the Shiite calendar which marks the 40th day of mourning for Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed.</p>

<p>Last year, some 22 million pilgrims attended the commemoration in the Iraqi shrine city of Karbala, where Hussein and his brother Abbas are buried, according to official figures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

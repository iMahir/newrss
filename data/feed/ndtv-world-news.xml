       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attending a Taylor Swift concert amid the ongoing violence in Montreal has drawn massive outrage on social media. Trudeau, who represents the Papineau district in Montreal, reportedly attended Taylor Swift's Eras Tour concert in Toronto with his family on Friday.</p>

<p>A viral video posted on X (formerly Twitter) shows the politician dancing and singing in the audience. In another video, he can be seen distributing friendship bracelets among the people.</p>

<p>However, this did not sit well with the internet users as the timing of him attending the concert coincided with the Montreal violence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Trudeau at a Taylor Swift concert while Montreal burns," one user wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some people also drew parallels between Trudeau and Roman Emperor Nero - who was known for his cruelty and debauchery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"According to ancient tradition, the degenerate Emperor Nero got on stage and recited poetry while Rome burned. Here's Trudeau dancing at tonight's Taylor Swift concert after doubling the debt to $1.2 trillion and creating a housing crisis by opening Canada's borders," a user said.</p>

<p>However, the internet also seemed to be divided as some people came in support of Trudeau.</p>

<p>"Ya know, all it looks like, is that he's being a goofy Dad with his daughter, at a concert. Nothing nefarious going on here. And I don't even like the guy, not one bit," one user said.</p>

<p>Montreal's streets were engulfed in violent chaos as anti-Israeli protests escalated on November 22 - at a time when the &nbsp;North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) was holding its parliamentary assembly in the Quebec metropolis. The protesters were denouncing the trans-Atlantic alliance.</p>

<p>The tensions escalated when the demonstrators burned an effigy of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the streets. The protestors, around 800 people, also set ablaze vehicles, smashed windows of nearby shops, and set off smoke bombs, reported news agency AFP. Following this, the police had to use chemical irritants and truncheons to disperse the crowd.</p>

<p>The Montreal police have reportedly arrested three people so far.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Saturday, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-calls-his-officials-criminals-media-wrong-over-leaks-fake-report-on-indian-leadership-7087186">Justin Trudeau</a> condemned the violence in Montreal, saying that there "must be consequences and rioters should be held accountable".</p>

<p>"What we saw on the streets of Montreal last night was appalling. Acts of antisemitism, intimidation, and violence must be condemned wherever we see them. The RCMP are in communication with local police. There must be consequences, and rioters held accountable," he wrote in a post on X.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The 15-year-old suspect was arrested shortly after the incident and charged with second-degree murder]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 13-year-old cheerleader, Savannah Copeland, was allegedly stabbed to death by a 15-year-old boy using a pocket knife and left near a dirt road. Prosecutors are seeking to have the suspect tried as an adult, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/teen-suspect-arrested-after-cheerleader-found-dead-woods" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>Fox News</em></a>.</p>

<p>The incident reportedly occurred around midnight on October 22, when Savannah met the 15-year-old. He allegedly attacked her before fleeing the scene, as detailed in a petition released by Knox County court on October 24. The nature of their relationship or how they knew each other remains unclear.</p>

<p>Michael Copeland, Savannah's father, told <em>8WVLT </em>that his daughter had been missing in Powell for several hours. Using her cellphone information, he tracked her location and discovered her body.</p>

<p>The 15-year-old suspect was arrested shortly after the incident and charged with second-degree murder, according to the Knox County Sheriff's Office. Despite the suspect's age, a judge allowed his name to be released two days later and scheduled a hearing for January 14 to determine if he will face trial as an adult, as reported by 6 News. Fox News Digital has chosen not to identify the suspect until a decision is made.</p>

<p>Savannah's name was not included in the sheriff's office's statement but was confirmed by her family through a GoFundMe page, an online obituary, her cheerleading team, and various news outlets.</p>

<p>"I think it was a lack of compassion and a lack of empathy that drove the hand that took my daughter's life," the victim's father told <em>8 WVLT.</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Copeland, a cheerleader with Powell Mac Cheerleading, was a talented student who also excelled in karate and gymnastics, her family wrote in her obituary. Her father told 8WVLT the teen had "spunkiness, eagerness and ... a go-getter attitude."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an exclusive interview with NDTV, Melissa Alvarado, Regional Programme Manager for Ending Violence Against Women at UN Women, emphasised the importance of a survivor-centric approach when drafting laws and regulations to combat violence against women. Ms Alvarado stressed that the voices of survivors must be central in the formulation of policies aimed at curbing gender-based violence.</p>

<p>"Survivors may not be experts on the broader legalities of violence, but they are experts in their own experiences," Ms Alvarado said. "We must listen carefully to them and shape our laws and practices based on their lived experiences."</p>

<p>She also highlighted the need for a robust feedback loop to evaluate the effectiveness of laws and policies. According to Ms Alvarado, survivor input is crucial to refining and improving legal frameworks that are meant to protect women from violence.</p>

<h2><strong>Identifying At-Risk Women</strong></h2>

<p>Ms Alvarado underscored the importance of identifying women at risk before they become victims of violence. She noted that many victims fail to reach out to existing support systems, such as hotlines and healthcare centres, either due to fear, stigma, or lack of awareness. "Laws and regulations should be designed not only for those who report violence but also for those who don't," she said, stressing the need for preventative measures that reach vulnerable women before situations escalate.</p>

<p>A key focus, Ms Alvarado explained, should be preventing severe forms of violence, including domestic abuse that leads to murder or rape. Early identification of high-risk situations, she argued, is essential for preventing these tragic outcomes.</p>

<p>There are 1,583 legislative measures across 193 countries to address violence against women, UN data says.</p>

<h2><strong>The Impact Of Conflict And Crises On Women</strong></h2>

<p>Ms Alvarado also discussed the heightened vulnerability of women in conflict zones or during crises, noting that they are often disproportionately affected by violence in such circumstances. She emphasized the importance of integrating women's voices into crisis planning and response efforts, as well as building social protection systems that specifically address the risks women face in times of crisis.</p>

<p>"We need to ensure that, as we prepare for the next climate disaster or other emergencies, we are including women, women's rights organizations, disability rights groups, and LGBTQ+ activists in crisis preparedness and planning," Ms Alvarado said.</p>

<p>UN Women data shows that 70% of women in conflict, war, and humanitarian crisis, experience gender-based violence.</p>

<h2><strong>Addressing Workplace Violence</strong></h2>

<p>Ms Alvarado also called on businesses to adopt a "zero-tolerance" policy for workplace violence against women. Companies, she argued, have a crucial role to play in creating safe environments for female employees and customers alike.</p>

<p>In addition to enforcing zero-tolerance policies, Ms Alvarado suggested that companies provide training for employees to recognise signs of violence and extend support to customers who may be experiencing abuse.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[McDonald's global sales at outlets open at least a year fell by 1.5 per cent between July and September -- the biggest decline in four years.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>McDonald's has announced it will be launching a new "McValue" menu, starting next year, to provide more savings to consumers. The fast-food franchise giant is hoping the move would bring more customers as soaring inflation pushes them to cheaper dining alternatives. The McValue platform will be available in restaurants in the US, beginning January 7 and will include McDonald's $5 meal deal, which the company launched in June, in addition to a new 'Buy One, Add One at $1' feature.</p>

<p>"When it comes to value, we know there's no one-size-fits-all. We've worked closely with our franchisees to create a new platform that will let our customers define value on their own terms," said Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald's USA.</p>

<p>"From deals on their personal go-to order to universal favorites like the $5 Meal Deal, we're excited to give fans more ways to save every time they visit one of our restaurants," added Mr Erlinger.</p>

<h3><strong>What does the Buy One, Add One for $1 menu include?</strong></h3>

<p>Customers will be allowed to customise their own deals, mixing and matching their favourite items. On buying a full-priced menu item from the McValue menu, they can add another item of their choice for $1.</p>

<p>The McValue breakfast menu includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sausage McMuffin</li>
	<li>Sausage Biscuit</li>
	<li>Sausage Burrito</li>
	<li>Hash Browns</li>
</ul>

<p>Meanwhile, the McValue lunch/dinner menu includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>6-pc. Chicken McNuggets</li>
	<li>Double Cheeseburger</li>
	<li>McChicken</li>
	<li>Small Fries</li>
</ul>

<p>Cory Watson, McDonald's Owner/Operator and National Value Chair for 2025, said the company knew about the challenges and was willing to listen to its customers.</p>

<p>"No matter the city or the state, they're telling us how important it is for them to find their favourite meals at affordable prices. And we couldn't agree more. That's why we're committed to continuing to serve up great local deals," said Mr Watson.</p>

<p>As for the launch of the McValue menu in the international market, no update has been provided by the company.</p>

<h3><strong>Slowing growth</strong></h3>

<p>In October, McDonald's posted another big drop in sales globally as demand continued to slow. McDonald's global sales at outlets open at least a year fell by 1.5 per cent between July and September -- the biggest decline in four years.</p>

<p>The international markets were down by 2.1 per cent, driven by France and the UK while net profits fell by three per cent to $2.3 billion. Weaker consumer spending in China, and the continued impact of the conflicts in the Middle East, led to a 3.5 per cent drop in sales in its licensed business, in which restaurants are run by local partners.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A gunman was dead and three policemen injured after a shooting near the Israeli embassy in neighbouring Jordan, a security source and state media said on Sunday.</p>

<p>Police shot a gunman who had fired at a police patrol in the Rabiah neighbourhood of Amman, state news agency Petra reported, citing public security, adding investigations were ongoing.</p>

<p>Jordanian police had earlier cordoned off an area near the heavily policed embassy after gunshots were heard, witnesses said. Two witnesses said police and ambulances rushed to the Rabiah neighbourhood, where the embassy is located.</p>

<p>The area is a flashpoint for frequent demonstrations against Israel. The kingdom has witnessed some of the biggest peaceful rallies across the region as anti-Israel sentiment runs high over the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Police had called on residents to stay in their homes as security personnel searched for the culprits, a security source said.</p>

<p>Many of Jordan's 12 million citizens are of Palestinian origin, they or their parents having been expelled or fled to Jordan in the fighting that accompanied the creation of Israel in 1948. Many have family ties on the Israeli side of the Jordan River.</p>

<p>Jordan's peace treaty with Israel is unpopular among many citizens who see normalisation of relations as betraying the rights of their Palestinian compatriots.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The judges determined that Perry had used her name as a trademark for five years before Taylor began her clothing business.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pop star Katy Perry won an appeal on Friday in a trademark case brought by Australian fashion designer Katie Taylor, who markets her clothing under the name Katie Perry,&nbsp;<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2024/11/22/katy-perry-trademark-lawsuit-win/76493815007/" rel="noindex,nofollow">USA Today</a> </em>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A panel of three judges overturned a 2023 ruling that had sided with Taylor, allowing Katy Perry (born Katheryn Hudson) to continue using her stage name to sell merchandise in Australia despite Taylor's trademark claim.</p>

<p>The judges determined that Perry had used her name as a trademark for five years before Taylor began her clothing business and already had an "international reputation in music and entertainment, if not more broadly." As a result, Perry was deemed entitled to use her stage name in Australia.</p>

<p>The court also cancelled Taylor's trademark registration, according to USA Today.</p>

<p>"This case is unfortunate in that two enterprising women in different countries independently adopted their name as a trademark, unaware of each other's existence," the judges wrote in their decision. They also noted that Taylor had, at times, appeared to associate herself with Perry, raising the risk of consumer confusion or deception.</p>

<p>However, little confusion resulted, and the court found. Since Perry offered both women rights to the trademarked name in 2009, which Taylor rejected, the judges ruled that Taylor's own trademark license would need to be cancelled. "In that sense, (Taylor) has brought this result on herself. Unfortunately, it is no longer possible to return to the time of peaceful co-existence," they wrote.</p>

<p>Disappointed with the decision, Taylor told<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/nov/22/katy-perry-appeal-legal-case-sydney-fashion-label-katie-perry" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em> The Guardian</em></a>, "This case proves a trademark isn't worth the paper it's printed on."</p>

<p>She went on to say: "My fashion label has been a dream of mine since I was 11 years old and now that dream that I have worked so hard for, since 2006, has been taken away."</p>

<p>"I have lost everything, including my trademark. As you can imagine I'm devastated," she told <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/21/entertainment/katy-perry-wins-trademark-battle-with-australian-designer-over-name/" rel="noindex,nofollow">The New York Post.</a></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The highest-paid inmate in the UK received a net pay of $46,005 last year, which means their gross salary was about $57,640.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prisoners in British jails are earning more than the officers that guard them as well as secondary teachers, biochemists, psychotherapists and midwives, according to a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/11/23/britain-best-paid-inmates-earn-more-than-prison-officers/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>The Telegraph</em></a>. Inmates in some of the low-security, open prisons are allowed to venture outside for work, as long as they return to the jail confines by the end of the day. The move is part of a concerted effort to rehabilitate the prisoners and prepare them for a life back in society. However, the pay difference between the inmates and those belonging to the civil society has raised questions regarding income disparity in the UK.</p>

<p>The highest-paid inmate in the UK received a net pay of $46,005 (Rs 38,84,491) last year, which means their gross salary was about $57,640 (Rs 48,66,907). The data by the Home Office showed that nine other inmates had net earnings of more than $28,694 (Rs 24,22,814), which means the average working prisoner was being paid just under $25,061 (Rs 21,16,057) per year. Meanwhile, the average salary of a prison guard is $35,085 (Rs 29,62,446), while fresh recruits are paid approximately $30,073 (Rs 25,39,252) per year.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-may-soon-bring-assisted-dying-law-lawmaker-explains-its-safeguards-7004474" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Also read | UK May Soon Bring 'Assisted Dying' Law. Lawmaker Explains Its Safeguards</strong></a></p>

<p>As per the Ministry of Justice, there were two other high-paid prisoners who netted more than $37,591 (Rs 31,74,044) after deductions last year and another seven who put between $28,694 (Rs 24,22,814) and $37,591 (Rs 31,74,044) into private bank accounts. Although the prisoners do a variety of jobs, the high-earning individuals engage in one of the most lucrative jobs -- driving lorries.</p>

<p>“Some offenders, towards the end of their sentence, receive a release on temporary licence. This sees them spend some of their day in the community, often working, before returning to prison," a prison service spokesman was quoted as saying by the publication.</p>

<p>“If they are working, their earnings are subject to tax, court fines and a levy of up to 40 per cent, which funds a charity for victims," they added.</p>

<p>Despite the deductions, the prisoners were ahead of midwives who had an average take-home pay of $45,889 (Rs 38,74,696) while biochemists ($45,844, Rs 38,74,274 ), psychotherapists ($45,864, Rs 38,72,585) and chartered surveyors ($43,908, Rs 37,07,428) also netted less than them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk might be the richest person in history, but he was way behind Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on the 2024 list of top earners. Mr Huang's annual earnings skyrocketed from $21.1 billion in 2023 to $77 billion in 2024, according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/jensen-huang/?listuri=rtb " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">Forbes</a>. This was nearly four-fold of Mr Musk's <a href="http://https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/?list=rtb/ " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">$15 billion increase</a> in annual earnings from $180 billion in 2023 to $195 billion in 2024.</p>

<p>The massive boost took Mr Huang's net worth to $123.8 billion, placing him ninth on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaire List.</p>

<p>Tesla's soaring shares pushed Mr Musk's net worth to $334.3 billion this year.</p>

<h3><strong>Who is&nbsp;Jensen Huang</strong></h3>

<p>Born in Taiwan and raised in the US from the age of nine, Mr Huang's academic journey led him from Oregon State University to Stanford University, where he specialised in electrical engineering. As co-founder and CEO of Nvidia since 1993, Mr Huang has been the visionary behind the company's rise as a leader in AI technology.</p>

<p>Nvidia's shares hit a record high this year, contributing significantly to Huang's fortune. His 3.5 per cent equity stake in the $3.5 trillion company now accounts for nearly all of his wealth, valued at $122.2 billion. Even after selling $713 million worth of Nvidia stock earlier this year, Mr Huang remains the company's largest shareholder.</p>

<p>Nvidia holds an 80 per cent market share in AI accelerators, crucial for cutting-edge AI applications used by tech giants like Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and even Tesla. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs), initially popular in gaming, have become essential for AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Demand for Nvidia's products is so intense that Mr Huang described it as “insane,” with customers reportedly becoming “really emotional” over availability, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/21/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-vaults-into-worlds-10-richest-for-first-time-ever/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">Forbes</a> reported.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump on Saturday announced his pick for agriculture secretary -- the final top post in his incoming cabinet -- as policy advocate Brooke Rollins, a loyalist from his first term.</p>

<p>Ahead of his return to power in January, the Republican has moved swiftly to name the inner circle who will lead key government agencies, with his picks ranging from TV hosts to US senators and governors.</p>

<p>Rollins, 52, is the CEO of the America First Policy Institute, a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting Trump's agenda, often described as his "White House in waiting."</p>

<p>Several other Trump nominees have close ties to the group.</p>

<p>With his agriculture pick Saturday, Trump has now chosen someone for all of the top cabinet posts.</p>

<p>Some lower-level positions have yet to be announced, such as the heads of the Small Business Administration and Office of Science and Technology.</p>

<p>Rollins, if confirmed by the Senate, would command a sprawling agency that has major implications for American citizens and corporations.</p>

<p>It employs some 100,000 people and oversees farm programs, research and trade, food safety, animal and plant health, and the nation's forests.</p>

<p>It also manages the nation's food assistance program, which has over 40 million recipients.</p>

<p>Trump hailed his nominee's "commitment to support the American Farmer, defense of American Food Self-Sufficiency, and the restoration of Agriculture-dependent American Small Towns."</p>

<p>Rollins temporarily led Trump's Domestic Policy Council during his first term.</p>

<p>As a more traditional conservative, there is potential for her to butt heads with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's pick for health secretary who has been a vocal opponent to the corporate agriculture industry.</p>

<p>He has pledged to improve American nutrition by cracking down on ultra-processed foods and toxic chemicals.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, concern has mounted over the Trump team's apparent refusal to sign key transition agreements as required by US law.</p>

<p>Senator Elizabeth Warren wrote a letter Thursday to the General Services Administration seeking information on the status of the agreements.</p>

<p>"President-elect Trump is undermining his administration's ability to manage urgent national security threats, health and safety threats, and serious conflicts of interest starting on day one of his presidency," wrote Warren.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She noted in particular that failure to sign the documents means "the FBI cannot begin critical background checks of candidates for high-level national security roles," including those Trump has picked for his cabinet and other top positions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's massive sinkholes, particularly those in Guangxi province, have gained massive popularity among tourists, drawing visitors eager to explore their ancient ecosystems. But while these natural wonders offer a unique glimpse into Earth's past, experts warn the influx of tourists may threaten the fragile habitats hidden within these sinkholes.</p>

<p>Ranging from 100 to 300 metres in depth, these sinkholes — locally known as “tiankeng” or “heavenly pits” — have long been shrouded in myth. Ancient local beliefs held that the mist rising from the depths was caused by demons and ghosts, adding an air of mystery to the already dangerous terrain. But now, these sites have become increasingly accessible, with guided tours and even extreme sports activities like abseiling attracting tourists from across the country.</p>

<p>Rui, a tourist from Shanghai, expressed her excitement at exploring one such sinkhole. She told <a href="http://https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8697gqwyx6o" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">BBC</a>, “I've never done this kind of thing before. It's very cool. It will be the first time but not the last time.”</p>

<p>Fei Ge, a tour guide in his 50s, who, according to the BBC report, was one of the first explorers of these sinkholes, recalls the legends surrounding the pits. “We thought that if humans went into the sinkholes, demons would bring strong winds and heavy rain. We thought ghosts brought the mist and fog,” he said.</p>

<p>His curiosity led him to become one of the earliest explorers of these sites, eventually introducing scientists to the area. Their discoveries were groundbreaking, having identified rare and previously unknown species of plants and animals, including orchids, white cave fish and several types of spiders and snails.</p>

<p>China is home to around two-thirds of the world's more than 300 sinkholes, and Guangxi alone has over 30. These sinkholes are formed in limestone-rich regions where underground rivers gradually erode the rock, creating vast caverns that eventually collapse, leaving deep holes behind. These pits are isolated from the outside world, allowing ecosystems to thrive, largely untouched by human activity.</p>

<p>Dr Lina Shen, a sinkhole researcher, highlighted the importance of preserving these unique habitats. “We should better protect such habitats. Sinkholes are paradises for many rare and endangered plant species.” Dr Shen suggested that measures such as “hot air balloons, drones for aerial photography, and appropriate pathways for observation from a distance” could help minimise human impact on these delicate sites while allowing people to “closely yet remotely view sinkholes.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after 24-year-old Harshita Brella - an Indian woman from Delhi living with her husband in the UK - was found dead with her body stashed away in the boot of a car, his family has pointed to a dowry angle in the case.</p>

<p>Harshita Brella married Pankaj Lamba - who has been missing since her murder - on March 22 this year. Now, Sonia Brella, the elder sister of Harshita, suspects that she was murdered for dowry even though they had given the Lamba family gold and money during the wedding.</p>

<p>"The family had given a lot of dowry to Pankaj but still he was not happy, he kept demanding dowry from us," she told ANI.</p>

<p>An investigation by the Northamptonshire Police suggests that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/harshita-brella-murder-family-claims-accused-husband-preplanned-killing-7082982">Harshita Brella</a> was murdered on November 10. On the same night, she was seen walking with her husband by a boating lake in Corby where she lived.</p>

<p>As per the police, Harshita Brella's body had been transported from Corby to east London - some 145 kilometers away - by car, which was found parked with her body on Brisbane Road, Ilford on November 14. The car allegedly belonged to her husband.</p>

<p>Earlier, her father, Sabir Brella, also alleged that Lamba and his family used to harass her for dowry. "Pankaj used to beat her and force her to get money. Due to the regular fights, she started living separately and working in a warehouse. Despite living separately, he would handle her bank accounts," he said.</p>

<p>However, she kept giving money to him "with a hope that some day things will become normal", her father said, adding, " She didn't know that this would be the end.</p>

<p>"On August 29, when Pankaj had beaten her she lodged a complaint against him. Subsequently, his family members had come at our house here and again started demanding dowry, due to which my father sold some property to fulfill their demand and by February we were able to fulfill the demand. We were about to fulfil their demands after we got the money in hand," Sonia Brella said.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/family-of-indian-origin-woman-found-dead-in-car-boot-in-uk-call-for-justice-7059224">Harshita Brella</a> was the subject of a 28-day domestic violence order against Lamba, which had not been renewed at the time of her killing.</p>

<p>"She used to give us every moment's information. This case was closed on October 30 when Pankaj paid the fine, but Harshita was not informed about it," her sister claimed.</p>

<p>Recalling her last video call with Harshita, her sister said, "We had the last video call with Harshita on November 10 when she told us that she was preparing food for Pankaj who was coming over for dinner."</p>

<p>"From the next day her phone was not reachable. We had a feeling that Pankaj had killed her by then," she added.</p>

<p>Even as the police are looking for Pankaj Lamba and released a series of CCTV images of him, her family claimed that he fled to India a day after the brutal murder.</p>

<p>"We have proof of him coming back to India, which we have told to London police. Here no one is helping us. We have also approached our local police and filed a complaint of dowry harassment against Pankaj and her parents," Sonia Brella said.</p>

<p>Harshita Brella's body might reach India in a week or two, she added.</p>

<p>Her sister also alleged that Lamba's family knows his whereabouts and is aware of the murder: "When I called Pankaj's mother about the news, she coolly replied that at least my sister was returning back. She said her son's whereabouts are not known. But, on the other hand, they are not even trying to find his whereabouts and are calm. This behaviour raises suspicions."</p>

<p>Earlier this week, an inquest into Harshita Brella's killing was opened in Northampton and adjourned until May 21, 2025, while the murder investigation remains ongoing. The provisional cause of her death was noted as "manual strangulation pending toxicology and histology" at the inquest hearing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>In the name of open economy, we allowed other countries to get an advantageous playing field in the country and this has to stop, said External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday.</p>

<p>S Jaishankar was delivering a virtual keynote address at the 8th India Idea Conclave at Bengaluru. This year, the conclave, organised by India Foundation, is exploring the theme, 'building Brand Bharath'.</p>

<p>"In the name of globalisation, we actually hollowed out the manufacturing. SMEs have been hurting for the last 30 years because they see unfair competition, see subsidised goods coming into the country. If we cannot protect them, they cannot compete," he said.</p>

<p>According to S Jaishankar, under Modi's 'Brand Bharath', this is being done differently as 'Make in India' has moved from aspiration to an assertion.</p>

<p>"Look at semi conductors industry. We understand today semi conductor will be a make or break for a country like India," he said, adding that where India that is Bharath is doing things differently is in taking the hard calls were necessary.</p>

<p>One such call is being prudent on foreign direct investments (FDI), said S Jaishankar.</p>

<p>"I can tell you, in every FDI negotiation, we think very long, very hard. We are very concerned both about the social fabric and employment consequences of an FDI, as well as its national security implications," the Minister said.</p>

<p>He added that the Modi government will never sign an FDI if these are not addressed.</p>

<p>"And I think that is the departure from the past," he said.</p>

<p>The minister also said since PM Modi took over, if he has to pick a region where India has really built a Brand Bharath, it would be the Middle East.</p>

<p>According to him, traditional belief is that if a country does well with Israel, it will lose all other players in the region. But he pointed out that India has proved this conventional wisdom wrong in the last 10 years.</p>

<p>"Today, Brand Bharath is seen as an ambitious brand. We are not just one among many willing to go with the flow. We will take the hard calls, put in resources, and we will stay in touch with the contemporary world... Under PM Modi, that really has been the big change, which is why our brand is different," said S Jaishankar.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Israeli military strikes across the Gaza Strip have killed at least 120 Palestinians over the last 48 hours and hit a hospital on the northern edge of the enclave, wounding medical staff and damaging equipment, Palestinian medics said on Saturday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli military strikes across the Gaza Strip have killed at least 120 Palestinians over the last 48 hours and hit a hospital on the northern edge of the enclave, wounding medical staff and damaging equipment, Palestinian medics said on Saturday.</p>

<p>Among the dead were seven members of one family whose house was hit overnight in the Zeitoun suburb of Gaza City, the health officials said. The rest were killed in separate Israeli strikes in central and southern Gaza.</p>

<p>At the same time, Israeli forces deepened their incursion and bombardment of the northern edge of the enclave, their main offensive since early last month.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the armed wing of Hamas said a female Israeli hostage in the group's custody had been killed in a northern area under attack by Israeli forces.</p>

<p>"The life of another female prisoner who used to be with her remains in imminent danger," spokesperson Abu Ubaida added, accusing the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of being to blame.</p>

<p>An Israeli military spokesperson said it was investigating the Hamas report.</p>

<p>"At this point, we are unable to confirm or deny it," the spokesperson said. "Hamas continues to engage in psychological terrorism and act in a cruel manner."</p>

<p>A group representing hostages' families did not immediately reply to a request for comment.</p>

<p><strong>DAMAGE, INJURIES AT HOSPITAL</strong></p>

<p>Israel's military says its operations in northern Gaza aim to prevent Hamas fighters from carrying out attacks and regrouping. Local residents say they fear the goal is to permanently depopulate a strip of territory as a buffer zone, something Israel denies.</p>

<p>At Kamal Adwan Hospital, one of three medical facilities on the northern edge of Gaza that is barely operational, director Hussam Abu Safiya said the ongoing Israeli bombardment in the area appeared aimed at forcing hospital staff to evacuate - something they have refused to do since the incursion began.</p>

<p>"Yesterday (Friday), from the afternoon until midnight, the bombardment directly targeted the entrance to the emergency and reception area several times," he said in a statement, adding that 12 staff members including doctors and nurses were injured.</p>

<p>The strike also caused significant damage that disrupted the electrical generator, oxygen supply network and water supply, he added.</p>

<p>Asked to comment on Abu Safiya's statement, the Israeli military said that following an initial review it was "not aware of a strike in the area of the Kamal Adwan Hospital", adding that it does everything possible to avoid harming civilians.</p>

<p>Israel says Hamas uses hospitals and civilians as human shields, and has made public videos and photos to support that claim. Hamas rejects the allegations and says it does not use the civilian population or facilities for military purposes.</p>

<p>Israel's 13-month campaign in Gaza has killed more than 44,000 people and displaced nearly all the enclave's population at least once, according to Gaza officials.</p>

<p>The war was launched in response to an attack by Hamas-led fighters who killed 1,200 people and captured more than 250 hostages in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel has said.</p>

<p>Months of attempts to negotiate a ceasefire have yielded scant progress and negotiations are now on hold, with mediator Qatar having suspended its efforts until the sides are prepared to make concessions.</p>

<p>Hamas wants a deal that ends the conflict, and leads to the release of Israeli and foreign hostages held captive in Gaza as well as Palestinians jailed by Israel, while Netanyahu has said the war can end only once Hamas is eradicated.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Media footage showed flooding in the west of Ireland, while floods prompted rail closures in Northern Ireland and snow impacted travel across Britain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The heaviest snow hit Scotland and parts of northern and central England, with dozens of flood alerts in place.</p>

<p>The UK Met Office issued warnings for snow and ice for those regions, warning there was a "good chance some rural communities could be cut off.".</p>

<p>Scottish hills could see up to 40 centimetres (16 inches) of snow, while winds approaching 70 miles (113 kilometres) per hour were recorded in parts of Britain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ferry operator DFDS cancelled services on some routes until Monday, with sailings from Newhaven and Dover in southern England to Dieppe and Calais in France severely affected.</p>

<p>Flights were disrupted at Newcastle airport due to heavy snow, with some flights diverted to Belfast and Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Met Eireann, the Irish National Meteorological Service, had also issued a yellow warning for "very strong winds and heavy rain."</p>

<p>The worst impacted areas for power outages in Ireland were in western and northwestern counties, according to ESB Networks, which runs the country's electricity system.</p>

<p>"Crews and contractors are deployed and restoring power in impacted areas where it is safe to do so," it said.</p>

<p>More than 4,000 properties across Britain were without power by mid-Saturday-the majority in southwest England-with the National Grid operator saying power had been restored to "many homes and businesses."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon said an Israeli air strike in the heart of Beirut that brought down a residential building and jolted residents across the city killed at least 15 people on Saturday.</p>

<p>A Lebanese security source told AFP that the strike had "targeted a leading Hezbollah figure", but a Hezbollah lawmaker denied any official of the Iran-backed group was present.</p>

<p>The attack in the capital was followed by others in the city's southern suburbs after calls by the Israeli military to evacuate.</p>

<p>Israel has not commented on the strike in central Beirut.</p>

<p>Rescue operations were underway in the area on Saturday morning, with an excavator removing the rubble of the eight-storey building.</p>

<p>"The strike was so strong it felt like the building was about to fall on our heads," said Samir, 60, who lives in a building facing the one that was destroyed.</p>

<p>He said he fled his home in the middle of the night with his wife and children.</p>

<p>"We saw two dead people on the ground... The children started crying and their mother cried even more," he told AFP.</p>

<p>The Israeli strike, which hit the working-class Basta neighbourhood, killed at least 15 people and wounded 63, Lebanon's health ministry said.</p>

<p>"The final death toll will be determined after DNA tests are carried out," the ministry said in a statement.</p>

<p>The state-run National News Agency (NNA) said Israeli jets had launched six missiles at the structure, causing "widespread destruction in buildings" nearby.</p>

<p>The predawn attack in Basta was not preceded by an evacuation warning from Israel's military.</p>

<p><strong>'Diplomatic resolution'</strong></p>

<p>Similar strikes carried out without warning outside of Hezbollah's traditional bastions have tended to target senior figures but Hezbollah lawmaker Amin Sherri denied any official was present at the time of the strike.</p>

<p>"There was no party figure in the two targeted buildings," the NNA quoted him as saying as he visited the site.</p>

<p>The health ministry said the Israeli air force also hit eastern Lebanon, killing eight people in the town of Shmostar overlooking the Bekaa Valley, another Hezbollah stronghold.</p>

<p>"The Israeli enemy strike on Shmostar killed eight people, including four children, and nine others were injured, including four in critical condition," a ministry statement said.</p>

<p>Israel stepped up its campaign against the Hezbollah group in late September, targeting its strongholds in Lebanon's east and south as well as south Beirut, and later sending in ground troops after nearly a year of limited cross-border exchanges of fire.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry says more than 3,650 people have been killed since October 2023, when Hezbollah began trading fire with Israel in solidarity with its Palestinian ally Hamas. Most of the deaths have been since September this year.</p>

<p>In a telephone call with Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz on Saturday, Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin "reiterated US commitment to a diplomatic resolution in Lebanon that allows Israeli and Lebanese civilians to return safely to their homes on both sides of the border", a spokesperson said.</p>

<p>US envoy Amos Hochstein has been shuttling between Lebanon and Israel this week in a bid to broker a ceasefire in the Israel-Hezbollah war.</p>

<p>After talks in Beirut earlier this week, he had said that a deal was "within our grasp" but as he headed to Israel both sides put out statements that dented hopes of rapid progress.</p>

<p><strong>Deadly strikes on Gaza</strong></p>

<p>The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>At least 44,176 people have been killed in Gaza during more than 13 months of war, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry which the United Nations considers reliable.</p>

<p>Civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP on Saturday that 19 people were killed and more than 40 wounded by predawn Israeli air strikes and tank fire.</p>

<p>Umm Muhammad Abu Sabla, the sister of one of the victims of Saturday's strikes, told AFP she rushed to the scene to find "people carrying body parts from under the rubble".</p>

<p>"Our entire life is misery. Let them kill us all so we can be relieved from this suffering," the 62-year-old said in the main southern city of Khan Yunis.</p>

<p>The war has created a humanitarian crisis in the besieged territory, where people are experiencing acute shortages of food, fuel and medicines.</p>

<p>In his call with Katz, the Pentagon chief "urged the government of Israel to continue to take steps to improve the dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza".</p>

<p>The United Nations and others have repeatedly decried humanitarian conditions, particularly in northern Gaza.</p>

<p>The UN says more than 100,000 have been displaced from the area since early October, and an official told the Security Council last week that people "are effectively starving".</p>

<p>The trickle of aid entering Gaza was the principal basis cited by the International Criminal Court in the arrest warrants it announced on Thursday for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant.</p>

<p>The court said there were "reasonable grounds" to believe the pair bore "criminal responsibility" for the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare and crimes against humanity, including over "the lack of food, water, electricity and fuel, and specific medical supplies".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ByteDance-owned TikTok Chief Executive Officer Shou Zi Chew has sought input on US matters from Elon Musk, a close adviser to President-elect Donald Trump, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday citing people familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Chew initiated messages with the Tesla CEO in recent weeks and asked for his opinions on topics ranging from the incoming administration to potential tech policy, the report added.</p>

<p>Elon Musk, TikTok, ByteDance and the Trump administration did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comments.</p>

<p>Both executives have not discussed specific measures to keep TikTok running in the United States, the Journal reported, adding that Chew has kept ByteDance's senior leadership informed of the talks, with executives cautiously optimistic about finding a way forward.</p>

<p>ByteDance executives had been hedging their bets before the US election, meeting with people close to Trump and with people close to Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, the report added.</p>

<p>Trump, who unsuccessfully tried to ban TikTok in 2020, has said if elected in November he would not allow TikTok to be barred.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas's armed wing said Saturday an Israeli woman taken hostage during the October 2023 attack had been killed in a combat zone in northern Gaza and the Israeli military said it was investigating.</p>

<p>Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades spokesman Abu Obeida said contact had been restored with the woman's captors after a break of several weeks and it was established that the hostage had been killed in an area of north Gaza where the Israeli army has been operating.</p>

<p>Abu Obeida's statement did not further identify the hostage or say how or when she was killed.</p>

<p>The Israeli army told AFP it was looking into the claim.</p>

<p>Abu Obeida said that the woman had been held with a second female hostage whose life was in danger.</p>

<p>During last year's Hamas attack which triggered the Gaza war, militants took 251 hostages, of whom 97 are still held in Gaza, including 34 the army says are dead.</p>

<p>Ten female hostages, including five soldiers, were believed to remain alive in custody before Abu Obeida's statement, according to an AFP tally.</p>

<p>During a one-week truce in November last year, 105 hostages were freed, including 80 Israelis who were exchanged for 240 Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<p>The Israeli government has come under immense public pressure to agree a new deal to bring the remaining hostages home while they are still alive.</p>

<p>The Hostage and Missing Families Forum campaign group did not wish to comment on Saturday's claim.</p>

<p>"Nothing is known other than what Hamas is saying. Our only reliable source is the Israeli army," the group told AFP.</p>

<p>Hamas's attack on October 7 last year resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed 44,176 people in Gaza, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Unaware that he was being filmed, he competed in challenges for basic survival. His story of loneliness and struggle is now featured in a documentary.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tomoaki Hamatsu, better known as Nasubi, a comedian who appeared on the extreme Japanese game show <em>'A Life In Prizes'</em>, has given very painful details of his 15-month ordeal, which included being videotaped eating dog food, being held in total seclusion, and having to compete in tasks to survive. The show, which debuted in 1998, attracted up to 30 million people at its height and became an international hit.</p>

<p>Nasubi, who stayed naked during the broadcast, was locked in an empty apartment and had to win prizes to meet basic needs like food. He was unaware that his actions were being broadcast to millions across Japan. His story is now featured in a Hulu documentary titled <em>The Contestant.</em></p>

<p>"I came across his story when I was working on a different project and got lost down one of those internet rabbit holes," Clair Titley, director of The Contestant, told<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz99yr6dq41o"><em> BBC.</em></a></p>

<p>"But I found that a lot of what I had come across was almost derogatory. Nothing had really talked about Nasubi's story in depth. [I had] all these questions, such as, Why did he stay in there, and what effect it had on him. So I contacted him with that premise, that I wanted to make a film about his experience."</p>

<p>Nasubi, who is now 48, claimed that he was left feeling nervous and confused by the lack of information provided by the producers. Only a phone for emergencies was provided to him, and he had to write 300 sweepstakes entries every day to win necessities like crackers, which prevented him from going hungry. It took him three weeks to earn his first reward.</p>

<p>Nasubi admitted that, while initially excited, he soon became overwhelmed by the loneliness and isolation. "The hardest part was definitely the loneliness," he said, adding that he struggled to overcome it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire Elon Musk, tasked by President-elect Donald Trump to rein in the excessive US spending, has warned that America could be nearing the verge of bankruptcy. The world's richest man and a close adviser of Mr Trump, Elon Musk has been tasked to spearhead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under the upcoming Republican administration, to find ways of saving taxpayer dollars.</p>

<p>"America is currently headed for bankruptcy super fast," Mr Musk posted to X (formally Twitter), the social media platform he bought in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Musk wrote this in response to a post on the Department of Government Efficiency's X handle that noted "the US Government spent USD 6.16. trillion while only bringing in USD 4.47 trillion" in 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">America is currently headed for bankruptcy super fast <a href="https://t.co/Tm6JFJ6mef">https://t.co/Tm6JFJ6mef</a></p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1860212805439488130?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"This trend must be reversed, and we must balance the budget," the DOGE account added.</p>

<p>During his election campaign, one of the promises made by President-Elect Trump was the formation of DOGE to dismantle the government bureaucracy and cut wasteful spending.&nbsp;Earlier this year, while talking about skyrocketing US debts, Mr Trump had floated the idea of using Bitcoin to “pay off" "USD 35 trillion".</p>

<p>The President-elect is relying on two successful businessmen -- Mr Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy -- to dig into the details and give recommendations to his administration to restrict spending.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a report by Forbes, the national debt of the US crossed the USD 34 trillion mark at the beginning of 2024, largely due to Covid and lockdown stimulus measures that sent inflation spiralling and forced the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at a historical clip.</p>

<p>Mr Trump said, "..hand them a little crypto check, right? We'll hand them a little bitcoin and wipe out our USD 35 trillion,” according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2024/11/20/trumps-department-of-government-efficiency-is-poised-to-cut-waste/" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Forbes </a>report.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the Republicans won 'Trifacta' of victories in the US, Mr Musk in a post on X said, “Excess government spending is driving America into bankruptcy,” adding, “This debt growth is unsustainable.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The name of the DOGE department is a nod to the 2013 famous Shiba Inu dog meme, which is also linked to the dogecoin cryptocurrency. According to Mr Musk, Dogecoin is his "favourite" cryptocurrency and is accepted as payment by his Tesla car company.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency that operates without a financial system or government authorities. According to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/how-bitcoin-works/" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Investopedia</a>, bitcoin can be used as an alternative to fiat currencies through crypto exchanges, utilizing peer-to-peer transfers on a digital network that records all transactions. This network is powered by a blockchain, an open-source program that chains transaction histories to prevent manipulation.</p>

<p>Bitcoin's price today is USD 97,455.70, which represents a change of +4.31% in the last 24 hours.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge in the United States has rejected the request of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to sanction tech billionaire Elon Musk for skipping a meeting with the regulator, to watch one of his rockets launch. Mr Musk was ordered by a court to meet the SEC officials in September to provide testimony for the regulator's probe into his USD 44 billion takeover of X (Twitter at the time).</p>

<p>On Friday, US District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley said there was no need to sanction the billionaire for his absence, as he agreed to reimburse the SEC to cover the airfare of three agency lawyers he stood up in Los Angeles on September 10.</p>

<p>Mr Musk finally complied with the order and met with the SEC lawyers to give testimony on October 3.</p>

<p>"Because the present circumstances forestall any occasion for meaningful relief that the court could grant, the SEC's request is moot," Corley wrote in the order.</p>

<p>The order said that having only to repay travel costs would not deter many other people from ignoring court orders, "much less someone of Mr Musk's extraordinary means."</p>

<p>The SEC urged the federal judge to impose sanctions on Mr Musk to remind him that flouting her order was not a "trivial matte," according to a report by Bloomberg.</p>

<p>However, the report said that Mr Musk's lawyer, Alex Spiro, contested the claim and argued that the billionaire's failure to show up for the deposition was justified because he had an urgent obligation as the head of SpaceX, and had to travel to Florida for the Cape Canaveral launch of a rocket on a commercial spacewalk mission.</p>

<p>Mr Spiro contended that his client's voluntary offer to reimburse the agency for USD 2,923 was sufficient. Mr Musk is worth USD 321.7 billion, according to Forbes magazine.</p>

<p>Any statement from Mr Musk's Lawyers or the SEC was not available at the time of filing this story.</p>

<h2><strong>Market Regulator's Probe</strong></h2>

<p>The SEC is investigating whether Musk -- whose businesses include electric car maker Tesla and rocket company SpaceX and who is the world's richest person-- violated securities laws in early 2022 by waiting at least 10 days too long to disclose he had begun accumulating Twitter stock.</p>

<p>Critics and some investors have said this let him buy shares cheaply before he eventually disclosed a 9.2 per cent Twitter stake, and shortly thereafter offered to buy the whole company.</p>

<p>In July, Mr Musk said he misunderstood SEC disclosure rules and that "all indications" suggested he made a "mistake."</p>

<p>The SEC also sued Mr Musk in 2018 over his Twitter posts about taking Tesla private. He settled that lawsuit by paying a USD 20 million fine, agreeing to let Tesla lawyers review some posts in advance and stepping down as Tesla's chairman.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you tried manifesting? It's hard to escape on social media – the idea that you can <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/edth.12653">will what you desire</a> into reality through the power of belief. This could be financial success, romantic love or sporting glory.</p>

<p>Singer Dua Lipa, who headlined Glastonbury festival in June 2024, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwo9IoXVZ-4">has said that</a> performing on Friday night at the festival was “on her dream board”. “If you're manifesting out there, be specific – because it might happen!”</p>

<p>Manifesting gained popularity quickly during the pandemic. By 2021, <a href="https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/a38802302/how-to-manifest/">the 3-6-9 manifestation method</a> was famous. A TikTok viewed <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@wtffffkenzie/video/7280676541657320746?lang=en">over a million times</a>, for instance, explains this “no fail manifesting technique”. You write down what you want three times in the morning, six times in the afternoon and nine times before you go to bed and repeating until it comes true. Now, content creators are explaining countless methods to speak your dreams into reality.</p>

<p>But the idea that if you wish for something hard enough it will happen isn't new. It grew out of the self-help movement. Some early popular books that peddled this idea include Napoleon Hill's <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/think-and-grow-rich/napoleon-hill/9781785042416">Think and Grow Rich</a> from as long ago as 1937, and Louise Hay's <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/you-can-heal-your-life/louise-hay/9780937611012">You Can Heal Your Life</a> from 1984.</p>

<p>The trend really took off with Rhonda Byrne's <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.co.uk/books/The-Secret/Rhonda-Byrne/The-Secret-Library/9781847370297">The Secret</a>, a book published in 2006 which claims you can bring about whatever you desire through the power of manifestation. It has sold more than 35 million copies and boasts many celebrity fans. Drawing upon the “law of attraction”, Byrne proclaims: “Your whole life is a manifestation of the thoughts that go on in your head.”</p>

<h2>Manifesting as an intellectual vice</h2>

<p>But there is a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/edth.12653">dark side</a> to manifesting. Popular trends such as the 3-6-9 manifestation method promote obsessive and compulsive behavioural patterns, and they also encourage flawed thinking habits and faulty reasoning.</p>

<p>Manifesting is a form of wishful thinking, and wishful thinking leads to false conclusions, often through the inaccurate weighing of evidence. The wishful thinker overinflates their optimism about the likelihood of a preferred outcome. In philosophical terms, this kind of thinking is called an <a href="https://archive.philosophersmag.com/intellectual-vices/">“intellectual vice”</a>: it blocks a rational person's attainment of knowledge.</p>

<p>Manifesting urges people to dream big and imagine in detail everything they desire. This sets people's expectations unnaturally high, setting them up for failure and disappointment. It's arguably a form of <a href="https://theconversation.com/lucky-girl-syndrome-the-potential-dark-side-of-tiktoks-extreme-positive-thinking-trend-198439">toxic positivity</a>.</p>

<p>If you believe your own thoughts have the power to create reality, you may end up downplaying or ignoring practical actions and the efforts of others. You might manifest by saying: “I attract positive things to me”. But in doing so, you may not notice or credit the role of luck, chance, privilege and circumstance in explaining why some things happen and others do not.</p>

<h2>Logical errors</h2>

<p>Manifesting leads to logical errors. Someone who practices manifesting – and who finds that something they manifested comes true – is likely to attribute these desired outcomes to their prior hoping or wishing. But this does not mean hoping was the cause of the outcome. Just because one came before the other does not mean it was the cause: correlation does not imply causation.</p>

<p>If you believe the power of wishing for something results in what you want coming true, you will disproportionately attribute your mental activity with causal efficacy over other causes.</p>

<p>For instance, if you study hard for an exam and achieve a good grade, you might end up attributing this outcome to the daily mantra or repeated affirmations you said leading up to the test, rather than crediting the effort you put into studying. For your next test, you might keep on manifesting, but study less.</p>

<p>And when a hoped-for outcome does not occur, you might find yourself accounting for it in positive or fatalistic terms: the universe has something better planned. The negative outcome becomes additional evidence that you should still think positively, and so you won't change your approach.</p>

<p>While it may seem initially appealing, manifesting may also encourage victim blaming: that if someone had thought more positively, an outcome would have been different. It also fails to encourage people to make backup plans, leaving them vulnerable to luck and circumstance.</p>

<p>Manifesting is very self-involved. The wants of the manifester are central to their focus and the use of their mental energy and time.</p>

<p>If you rely solely on mental power to achieve your desires, you will not succeed. Try to consider the various factors that support and resist your goals. Finally, remember that sometimes the thoughts we think are imaginative, fictive, fanciful or fantastic. It is enriching and positive that in many cases, our thoughts do not come true.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian-origin <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/sunita-williams-butch-wilmore-boeing-starliner-stuck-in-international-space-station-for-a-month-give-update-on-homecoming-6080001" target="_blank">Sunita Williams</a> has said she is looking forward to meeting the Indian astronauts who will fly to the International Space Station (ISS).</p>

<p>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is working on a joint project with the US' National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to send an <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/exclusive-fashion-technologists-explain-indian-astronauts-uniform-design-5205122" target="_blank">Indian astronaut</a> to space. Of the four astronauts that India had chosen, two will be sent to NASA for training, and one of them will be selected for the space mission, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/exclusive-nasa-to-train-2-indian-astronauts-send-one-of-them-to-space-isro-chief-s-somanath-to-ndtv-5997637" target="_blank">ISRO chief Dr S Somanath told NDTV</a> last month.</p>

<p>The two space agencies have also collaborated for NISAR (NASA ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar), a joint Earth-observation mission.</p>

<p>"India and the US have had much success working together to explore the stars. And our future together could not be brighter," Sunita Williams said in her video message to the US embassy in Delhi on America's Independence Day from the ISS, which orbits some 400 kilometers above Earth.</p>

<p>"NASA and the ISRO continue to work toward the launch of NISAR, which will launch from India this year to measure changes in our planet's surface," she said.</p>

<p>"After returning to Earth, we look forward to meeting Indian astronauts training at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Our partnership with India and the countries around the world will help expand humanity's reach for the sky," Williams added.</p>

<p>She was joined by her fellow astronauts Tracy C Dyson and Jeanette J Epps.</p>

<h3><strong>NASA To Train 2 Indians, Send One Of Them To Space</strong></h3>

<p>The ISRO's work to send an astronaut to space in a joint project with NASA is going on as scheduled, the Indian space agency's chief Dr S Somanath told NDTV in an exclusive interview on June 29.</p>

<p>Of the four astronauts that India had chosen, two will be sent to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for training, and one of them will be selected for the space mission, he said.</p>

<p>"Similarly, the other two will also get training of a different kind... So all four of them will go through certain levels of training through this programme. Many engineers will also be trained by NASA to handle other aspects of space flight," Dr Somanath said.</p>

<p>He said the ISRO's eventual goal is human space flight, and the learnings from the whole programme with NASA will feed into the Indian space agency's experience in finally sending humans to space.</p>

<p>"When we get the capability, if a head of state wants to fly to space, for example, it must be on our vehicle, from our land. I will wait for our Gaganyaan to be ready, to be proven, to be qualified to do that," the ISRO chief told NDTV when asked whether key leaders would be eligible to fly to space in the far future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Australian father faced triple murder charges Thursday, accused of setting his home ablaze and locking the door with his seven children and their mother inside.</p>

<p>Three of the children -- two boys aged two and six and a five-month-old baby girl -- died in the weekend blaze in western Sydney's Lalor Park, police said.</p>

<p>The four other young children are in a stable condition in hospital and their 29-year-old mother has been released after treatment, police added.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old father, who is in hospital under police guard after emerging from an induced coma, was refused bail in a Sydney court on three counts of murder and five of attempted murder, court documents showed.</p>

<p>"Police will allege this man is solely responsible for setting fires inside the premises," New South Wales detective superintendent Daniel Doherty told a news conference after the court hearing.</p>

<p>An accelerant had whipped up "a large amount of fire and smoke" in the home and the doors "had been locked" to prevent the family escaping, he said.</p>

<p>A neighbour "very courageously" forced his way inside, rescuing two boys aged four and seven and a nine-year-old girl, as well as the mother, Doherty said.</p>

<p>But the father allegedly prevented the neighbour from saving an 11-year-old boy.</p>

<p>Police then arrived, however, and "had to wrestle with this man and wrestle the boy from his grasp because he was holding on to him, allegedly, and the boy was then rescued", the detective said.</p>

<p>A domestic dispute may have led to the "horrendous murderous act", Doherty said.</p>

<p>Most of the children were the accused man's biological children but in any case "they are his family, they are his kids", he said.</p>

<p>"It's not something that I will forget about very quickly."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden will Thursday give his first press conference since his debate disaster against Donald Trump, in a pressure-cooker moment that could seal the fate of his reelection bid.</p>

<p>The eyes of the world will be on the 81-year-old at a NATO summit as he tries to calm growing calls from his Democratic party to step aside over his age and health.</p>

<p>The White House has dubbed it a "big boy" press conference, and Biden will be under severe pressure to show he can handle what has become a rare unscripted moment in his presidency.</p>

<p>Any missteps by Biden at the 5.30 pm (2130 GMT) event at a Washington DC conference centre could turn the trickle of Democrats who have so far urged him to abandon his 2024 election bid into a flood.</p>

<p>The walls closed in further on Wednesday when Hollywood actor and supporter George Clooney called on Biden not to stand, just weeks after holding a glitzy fundraiser for the president.</p>

<p>Party heavyweight and former House speaker Nancy Pelosi also subtly twisted the knife by stopping short of backing Biden, saying only that he should make a decision after the NATO summit.</p>

<p>The first Democratic senator, Peter Welch of Vermont, meanwhile joined at least eight House Democrats in openly urging the man who beat Trump in 2020 not to stand again.</p>

<p>But many Democrats are believed to be waiting to see if Biden pulls off his first solo press conference since November 2023, or whether it will be a repeat of the debate.</p>

<p>Biden has given fewer news conferences than his predecessors. His recent appearances have been joint appearances with foreign leaders restricted to two questions each.</p>

<p>Coupled with a lack of interviews, it has led critics to accuse the White House of shielding the effects of age on America's oldest president from the public.</p>

<h3><strong>'Devastating'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has repeatedly promised Thursday's "big boy press conference" -- a phrase first used by a journalist that she has since adopted -- will feature multiple questions.</p>

<p>A poor performance will pour fuel on the flames of the concerns about Biden's age and health that were sparked when he appeared listless and often incoherent against Republican Trump, 78.</p>

<p>NATO allies have also been seeking reassurance about Biden's leadership abilities, and over fears that a return of the isolationist Trump could spell trouble for the alliance.</p>

<p>Biden has blamed his debate meltdown on a bad cold and jet lag after two weeks of gruelling foreign travel.</p>

<p>But Clooney said in a coruscating New York Times piece on Wednesday that the signs were already there at a June 15 fundraiser in Los Angeles that he co-hosted with actor Julia Roberts.</p>

<p>"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010," wrote Clooney.</p>

<p>"He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate."</p>

<p>Clooney said that Biden would lose the presidential election, and Democrats would also lose both chambers of Congress.</p>

<p>Biden has insisted that he is committed to running in November, and with the Democratic party primary votes under his belt there is no real way of forcing him out.</p>

<p>But the New York Times reported on Wednesday that some Democratic grandees like Pelosi are trying a different tack -- appealing to his rational side rather than inflaming the stubbornness that has driven his political career.</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris is widely seen to be the frontrunner to replace Biden if he steps aside, but any move would have to be before the Democratic convention in Chicago in August.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China is staging army drills with Belarus this week at NATO's eastern border, in a sign of escalating tensions between Beijing and the US-led defence alliance.</p>

<p>The joint "antiterrorist" exercises on Russian ally Belarus's soil near the Polish border come as NATO leaders gather for a summit in Washington, with the war in nearby Ukraine high on their agenda.</p>

<p>With relations between NATO on the one hand and China and Russia on the other at a low ebb, analysts believe that Beijing wanted to send the alliance a warning message with the timing of the drills.</p>

<p>Sino-Belarusian exercises have taken place before, but this is the first time since Russia invaded neighbouring Ukraine, a NATO ally, in February 2022.</p>

<p>The exercises began July 8 in Brest, a city right on the border with Poland, according to a statement issued on Wednesday by the Chinese defence ministry.</p>

<p>The statement said the manoeuvres will last until mid-July, but did not give the exact number of Chinese soldiers involved.</p>

<p>Both sides are working to "improve combat techniques and deepen cooperation and communication between the two armies", the statement added.</p>

<p>Chinese diplomatic officials insisted that the exercises were "not aimed at any country in particular".</p>

<p>But Poland's defence ministry slammed the timing of the exercises.</p>

<p>It warned of "the risk of the operations in question being used for disinformation and propaganda purposes... to coincide with the NATO summit".</p>

<p>However small in scale, the exercises still involve China deploying troops on NATO's doorstep, and to a country Russia used as a launchpad for its invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>And the exercises come as Beijing, one of Moscow's key partners is also experiencing increasingly tense relations with NATO.</p>

<h3><strong>Strategic signal&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Analysts believe that the date and location of the exercises were not chosen by chance, arguing that China wanted to send NATO a message.</p>

<p>"Multilateral exercises are often used to send political signals," Kelly Grieco of the Stimson Center foreign policy and defence think tank told AFP.</p>

<p>Indeed, she argues that when it comes to military drills, "it's much more about political signal more than for the exercise itself".</p>

<p>She points out that China had already carried out anti-terrorism exercises in Belarus four times between 2011 and 2018, but had not done so since.</p>

<p>That they are taking place "that close to the border is part of the signalling" too, she added.</p>

<p>Countries often organise their joint exercises to coincide with developments abroad -- not least of them China, added Alice Ekman, senior analyst for Asia at the European Union Institute for Security Studies (EUISS).</p>

<p>"In April 2023, the Chinese held exercises with Russia in the East China Sea, close to Japanese islands, on the eve of a trilateral US-Japan-South Korea summit to signal their opposition to such a summit being held," Ekman told AFP.</p>

<p>Similarly, China staged military manoeuvres in the South China Sea in May 2024 as the US-Japan-Philippines-Australia meeting was in full swing, she added.</p>

<p>As well as moving closer to Russia, China is becoming increasingly hostile to NATO.</p>

<p>It accuses NATO of working to contain China at Washington's instigation, with Beijing worried about the alliance's expanding role in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

<p>Moreover, China has never forgiven the bombing of its embassy in Belgrade by a NATO plane in 1999.</p>

<p>It also believes that the alliance has already overstepped its geographical sphere of influence in Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan.</p>

<p>NATO is perceived by China as "clearly hostile for historical reasons", Ekman said.</p>

<p>But those reasons were becoming "increasingly strategic as the threat from China becomes an integral part of the organisation's strategic thinking", she added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The tiny wires of Neuralink's brain chip implant used in the first participant in a trial run by Elon Musk's company have become "more or less very stable", a company executive said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The company had in May said that a number of tiny wires inside the brain of Noland Arbaugh, who is paralyzed from the shoulders down due to a 2016 diving accident, had pulled out of position.</p>

<p>"Once you do the brain surgery it takes some time for the tissues to come in and anchor the threads in place, and once that happens, everything has been stable," said Neuralink executive Dongjin "D.J." Seo.</p>

<p>So far, Arbaugh, based in Arizona, was the only patient to have received the implant, but Musk said he hopes to have participants in the high single digits this year.</p>

<p>The company is now taking risk mitigation measures such as skull sculpting and reducing carbon dioxide concentration in the blood to normal levels in patients, the company's executives said in a live stream on social media platform X.</p>

<p>"In upcoming implants, our plan is to sculpt the surface of the skull very intentionally to minimize the gap under the implant... that will put it closer to the brain and eliminate some of the tension on the threads," Matthew MacDougall, Neuralink's head of neurosurgery, said.</p>

<p>Neuralink is testing its implant to give paralyzed patients the ability to use digital devices by thinking alone. The device works by using tiny wires, which are thinner than a human hair, to capture signals from the brain and translating those into actions such as moving a mouse cursor on a computer screen.</p>

<p>Musk said during the livestream that the device doesn't harm the brain. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in initially considering the device years ago, had raised safety concerns, but ultimately granted the company a green light last year to begin human trials.</p>

<p>So far, the device has allowed Arbaugh to play video games, browse the internet and move a cursor on his laptop by thinking alone, according to the company's blog posts and videos.</p>

<p>Neuralink is also working on a new device that it believes will require half the number of electrodes to be implanted in the brain to make it more efficient and powerful, the executives said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video captured the dramatic scene of an American Airlines plane suffering a tyre blowout during takeoff. Smoke and flames were visible as the aircraft aborted takeoff. Thankfully, emergency vehicles quickly reached the scene on the runway.</p>

<p>American Airlines reported that flight 590 had a "mechanical problem" before leaving the ground. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is investigating after the pilots mentioned experiencing "multiple blown tyres."</p>

<p>Most importantly, all 180 people on board (174 passengers and 6 crew members) disembarked safely and were transported back to the terminal. There were no injuries reported.</p>

<p>The passengers were re-accommodated on a replacement flight from Tampa. "We never want to disrupt our customers' travel plans and apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused," the airline said in a statement.</p>

<p>Sources informed ABC that the fire seen in the video is a controlled occurrence designed to prevent further damage and a major explosion during a high-energy stop.</p>

<p>In a statement, FAA said, "American Airlines Flight 590 aborted its takeoff from Tampa International Airport around 7:50 a.m. local time on Wednesday, July 10, after the crew reported multiple blown tyres. Passengers deplaned on the taxiway and were bused to the terminal. The flight was headed to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. The FAA will investigate. Please contact the airline for additional information."</p>

<p>"American Airlines flight 590 with service from Tampa (TPA) to Phoenix (PHX) experienced a mechanical issue on the runway prior to taking off. Customers safely deplaned and were bussed to the terminal. We never want to disrupt our customers' travel plans and apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused," the airline also issued a statement.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States was "cautiously optimistic" about Gaza ceasefire talks, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told CNN on Wednesday, adding that gaps between the two sides could be narrowed.</p>

<h3><strong>KEY QUOTES</strong></h3>

<p>"We are cautiously optimistic that things are moving in a good direction," Kirby said when asked if a ceasefire deal was close.</p>

<p>"There are still gaps remaining between the two sides. We believe those gaps can be narrowed, and that's what Brett McGurk and CIA Director Bill Burns are trying to do right now," he added.</p>

<h3><strong>WHY IT'S IMPORTANT</strong></h3>

<p>President Joe Biden in late May detailed a proposal of three phases aimed at achieving a ceasefire, the release of hostages in Gaza and Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, Israel's withdrawal from Gaza and the rebuilding of the coastal enclave.</p>

<p>Burns and U.S. Middle East envoy McGurk are in the Middle East meeting with regional counterparts to discuss a ceasefire deal.</p>

<h3><strong>CONTEXT</strong></h3>

<p>Hamas has accepted a key part of a U.S. plan, dropping a demand that Israel first commit to a permanent ceasefire before signing the agreement.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted the deal must not prevent Israel from resuming fighting until its war objectives are met. At the outset of the war, he pledged to annihilate Hamas.</p>

<p>Netanyahu told McGurk on Wednesday he was committed to securing a Gaza ceasefire deal provided Israel's red lines were respected, his office said.</p>

<p>The latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on Oct. 7 when fighters led by Hamas, which controlled Gaza, attacked southern Israel. They killed 1,200 people and took around 250 hostages, according to Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The Gaza health ministry says that since then over 38,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the coastal enclave, which has displaced nearly all of its 2.3 million population, caused a hunger crisis and led to genocide allegations that Israel denies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A pair of US astronauts stuck waiting to leave the International Space Station said Wednesday they were confident that the problem-plagued <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-how-boeings-starliner-can-bring-astronauts-back-to-earth-5969239">Boeing Starliner</a> they rode up on would soon bring them home, even as significant uncertainties remain.</p>

<p>Butch Wilmore and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/exclusive-it-is-about-what-isro-chief-s-somanath-message-for-sunita-williams-said-5997341">Sunita Williams</a> blasted off on June 5 aboard the brand new spaceship that NASA is hoping to certify to ferry crews to-and-from the orbital outpost.</p>

<p>They docked the following day for what was meant to be roughly a week-long stay, but their return was pushed back because of thruster malfunctions and helium leaks that came to light during the journey.</p>

<p>No date has been set for the return, but <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/astronaut-sunita-williams-return-to-earth-delayed-again-what-nasa-said-5979727">NASA</a> officials said Wednesday they were eying "late July."</p>

<p>Asked during a live press call from the station whether they still had faith in the Starliner team and the spaceship, mission commander Wilmore replied: "We're absolutely confident."</p>

<p>"I have a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem," added <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/astronaut-sunita-williams-may-have-to-wait-months-in-space-what-nasa-is-planning-now-5994474">Sunita Williams</a>.</p>

<p>She said they were continuing to enjoy their time aboard the ISS, performing tasks like changing out the pump on a machine that processes urine back into drinking water, and carrying out science experiments such as gene sequencing in the microgravity environment.</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/737zWM5COQ0?si=I6fJCgxoF_L9guzF" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>They have also tested Starliner as a "safe haven" vehicle in case of problems aboard the ISS and checked out how its life support performs when four people are inside.</p>

<h3><strong>Lingering uncertainty</strong></h3>

<p>Before Wilmore and Williams can come home, however, engineering teams need to run more simulations of similar thrusters and helium seals on the ground, to better understand the root causes of some of the technical issues Starliner experienced -- and modify the way it will fly down, if necessary.</p>

<p>It was known there was one helium leak affecting the spaceship before the launch, but more leaks emerged during the flight. Helium, while non-combustible, provides pressure to the propulsion system.</p>

<p>What's more, some of Starliner's thrusters that provide fine maneuvering initially failed to kick in during its approach to the station, delaying docking.</p>

<p>Engineers are not sure why the craft's computer "deselected" these thrusters, though they were able to restart all but one of them.</p>

<p>In a subsequent press call, Boeing executive Mark Nappi told reporters that the "working theory" for the thruster malfunction was overheating due to excessive firing.</p>

<p>Theories on the cause of the helium leaks ranged from debris entering the propulsion system to Boeing possibly installing seals that were undersized for the task.</p>

<p>NASA and Boeing insist Starliner could fly home in case of an emergency, particularly since the problems affected only certain thrusters that control orientation.</p>

<p>They have no concerns over any of the more powerful thrusters responsible for the "deorbit burn" that will bring the spaceship back.</p>

<p>But much remains unclear -- including whether the orientation control thrusters that malfunctioned have become degraded, which would make it necessary to rely on other thrusters during descent, NASA official Steve Stich said.</p>

<p>He insisted that NASA wasn't yet considering bringing Williams and Wilmore back on a SpaceX Crew Dragon, in what would amount to a major humiliation for the aerospace giant Boeing, whose reputation has taken a hit in recent years over the safety crisis affecting its commercial jets.</p>

<p>"The prime option today is to return Butch and Suni on Starliner," said Stich, while conceding that a return flight on a SpaceX spaceship can't be ruled out.</p>

<p>In 2014, both SpaceX and Boeing were awarded multibillion-dollar contracts by NASA to develop crewed spaceships after the retirement of the Space Shuttle program. SpaceX carried out a successful crewed test in 2020 and has flown dozens of people since.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japanese eSports gamer Mashiro is blind and often relies on a companion to get around Tokyo -- but he hopes that artificial intelligence, hailed as a promising tool for people with disabilities, can help him travel alone.</p>

<p>The 26-year-old "Street Fighter" player put the latest version of AI chatbot ChatGPT to the test on his way to a stadium for a recent Para eSports meet-up.</p>

<p>"I can't participate in an event like this without someone to rely on," he told AFP. "Also, sometimes I just want to get around by myself without speaking to other people.</p>

<p>"So if I can use technology like ChatGPT to design my own special needs support, that would be great."</p>

<p>This year, the US firm OpenAI released GPT-4o, which understands voice, text and image commands in several languages.</p>

<p>The generative gadget, along with others such as Google's Gemini, is part of a fast-growing field that experts say could make education, employment and everyday services more accessible.</p>

<p>Following the streets' tactile paving, Masahiro Fujimoto -- who goes by his online handle Mashiro -- used his stick adorned with a small monkey mascot to find his way from the station.</p>

<p>As he went, he spoke to GPT-4o like a friend, receiving its answers through an earpiece in one ear, leaving the other side free to listen out for cars.</p>

<p>Having asked for basic directions, he added: "In fact, I am blind, so could you give me further details for blind people?"</p>

<p>"Of course," the bot replied. "You might notice an increase in crowd noise and the sound of activities as you get closer."</p>

<p>The journey, 20 minutes for sighted people, took Mashiro around four times as long with several U-turns.</p>

<p>When it started to rain heavily, he requested help from his friend, who is partially sighted, to finish the journey.</p>

<p>"Arrival!" finally shouted Mashiro, who has microphthalmos and has been blind since birth, using only sound to demolish his opponents on "Street Fighter 6".</p>

<h3><strong>'Enormous potential'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>AI can cater to specific needs better than "one-size-fits-all" assistive products and technologies, said Youngjun Cho, an associate professor in computer science at University College London (UCL).</p>

<p>"Its potential is enormous," said Cho, who also works at UCL's Global Disability Innovation Hub.</p>

<p>"I envisage that this can empower many individuals and promote independence."</p>

<p>People with hearing loss can, for example, use AI speech-to-text transcription, while chatbots can help format a resume for someone with learning disabilities.</p>

<p>Some tools for visually impaired people, such as Seeing AI, Envision AI and TapTapSee, describe phone camera images.</p>

<p>Danish app Be My Eyes, where real-life volunteers help via live chat, is working with OpenAI to develop a "digital visual assistant".</p>

<p>But Masahide Ishiki, a Japanese expert in disability and digital accessibility, warned it can be "tricky" to catch mistakes from ChatGPT, which "replies so naturally".</p>

<p>"The next objective (for generative AI) is to improve the accuracy of real-time visual recognition, to ultimately reach capabilities close to that of a human eye," said Ishiki, who is blind.</p>

<p>Marc Goblot of the Tech for Disability group also cautioned that AI is trained on "very mainstream datasets" which are "not representative of the full spectrum of people's perceptions and especially the margins".</p>

<p>Mashiro said ChatGPT's limited recognition of Japanese words and locations made his AI-assisted journey more challenging.</p>

<p>Although the experiment was "a lot of fun", it would have been easier if ChatGPT was connected to a map tool, said the gamer, who travelled around Europe last year using Google Maps and help from those around him.</p>

<p>He has already decided on his next travel destination: Yakushima rainforest island in southern Japan.</p>

<p>"I want to experience whatever happens when travelling somewhere like that," he said</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The largest stegosaurus skeleton ever found is expected to fetch millions of dollars at auction in New York next week, likely fueling objections from palaeontologists.</p>

<p>The fossil, estimated to be approximately 150 million years old, was put on display at Sotheby's on Wednesday and will be exhibited there until its sale on July 17.</p>

<p>Named Apex, the giant skeleton -- 11 feet (3.3 meters) tall and nearly 27 feet long -- is billed as "the most complete and best-preserved" stegosaurus specimen of its size, counting 254 fossil bone elements of an approximate total of 319.</p>

<p>Such sales have become more frequent in recent years, drawing criticism from palaeontologists, who say that these finds should be preserved in museums or other public spaces and not sold to private bidders.</p>

<p>"It's a very, very rare animal, and to find one of this size and this completeness is phenomenal," Cassandra Hatton, head of science and popular culture at Sotheby's, told AFP.</p>

<p>The auction house estimates Apex's value at $4-6 million, though still less than Stan, the world's most complete tyrannosaurus rex skeleton sold in 2020 for a record $31.8 million.</p>

<p>Apex was discovered in May 2022 on the private land of&nbsp;palaeontologist Jason Cooper.&nbsp;The auction house says it has collaborated with Cooper to "document the entire process, from discovery and excavation to restoration, preparation and mounting," in order to guarantee the "highest standards and transparency."</p>

<p>In 2022, Christie's auction house had to withdraw a T-rex skeleton a few days before the auction in Hong Kong, due to doubts about its authenticity.</p>

<p>Stegosaurus skeletons are already on display around the world, but according to Sotheby's, Apex is 30 percent larger than Sophie, the most complete stegosaurus on public display to date, which is housed in the Natural History Museum in London.</p>

<p>The debate around auctions of dinosaur fossils is one "I've heard a lot," said Hatton. "When you have a scientifically important specimen, the museums usually show up and find donors to bid on their behalf or they bid themselves."</p>

<p>"Most of the people I work with are donating specimens to museums or loaning them to museums, they understand the significance and importance of these specimens."</p>

<p>According to Sotheby's, Cooper has already donated fossils to museums around the world.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Argentine woman accusing two French international rugby players of rape was savagely beaten by her assailants, her lawyer said Wednesday, during an encounter that the men claim was consensual.</p>

<p>Hugo Auradou, 20, and Oscar Jegou, 21, are waiting to be transferred to the city of Mendoza, where the assault allegedly took place and where they will be questioned by prosecutors. They have not been charged with a crime.</p>

<p>The men were arrested in Buenos Aires on Monday, two days after a Test match against Argentina, when investigators determined the alleged victim's injuries were consistent with her account of rape.</p>

<p>The woman's lawyer, Natacha Romano, told AFP on Wednesday her client had suffered "fierce" violence at the hands of her assailants, with injuries to her face, back, breasts, legs and ribs as well as various bites and scratch marks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She said the woman had gone with one of the men from a nightclub to a hotel room, where she alleges she was held against her will and abused for several hours.</p>

<p>"The violence was fierce," said Romano. "There is more than one crime to investigate."</p>

<p>The woman claims to have been raped "at least six times" by one of the men and once by the other, according to the lawyer.</p>

<p>She allegedly tried to escape several times.</p>

<p>Lawyer Rafael Cuneo Libarona, who represents the players, arrived in Mendoza on Wednesday and said "sexual relations" had been "consensual."</p>

<p>The alleged attack took place Saturday night at the Diplomatic Hotel in Mendoza, where France's players and staff were staying for a Test match as part of a South American tour.</p>

<p>"There are witnesses who saw her leave (the hotel), there are cameras that saw her leave, apparently no injuries are seen in the footage," Libarona -- who is the brother of the country's justice minister Mariano Cuneo Libarona -- told journalists.</p>

<h3><strong>'Blows to the head'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Romano told AFP that "the overwhelming proof that there was no consent is the victim's body" and the wounds it bears.</p>

<p>If the men are charged, the lawyer added, she would ask the court to remand them in pre-trial custody.</p>

<p>The charge, she added, should be "sexual assault with carnal access," the Argentine legal definition for rape, along with the use of violence.</p>

<p>Mendoza prosecutor Daniela Chaler told LV10 radio on Tuesday there were "convincing elements" in the statement the woman made and that her injuries were compatible with her version of events, although they were not "necessarily exclusive" to sexual assault.</p>

<p>The French Rugby Federation (FFR) said the players have denied any coercion or violence, and stressed the importance of giving them an opportunity to make their case.</p>

<p>"If the facts are true, they are incredibly serious," the federation's president Florian Grill told reporters in Argentina.</p>

<p>Grill later told AFP the players have "a quite different version" of events to that of the woman, with "a lot of inconsistencies."</p>

<p>"We are not judges, we are not investigators, but we think that the Argentine justice system should look at the case very quickly," he said.</p>

<h3>'<strong>Trauma'</strong></h3>

<p>After the initial questioning in Mendoza, possibly this week, prosecutor Cecilia Bignert will have 24 hours to decide whether to charge the players. The deadline can be extended once by another 24 hours.</p>

<p>If charged, a hearing will be held 10 days later to determine whether they will have to await trial in custody.</p>

<p>France head coach Fabien Galthie said news of the accusation had been "a trauma" for the squad, which on Wednesday beat Uruguay 43-28 in their second of three games on the South America tour.</p>

<p>"It was a difficult moment to manage emotionally," captain Baptiste Couilloud told reporters after the win.</p>

<p>"We thought only of what was happening on the field today, and it's the only thing that keeps us going with this tour."</p>

<p>Part of an FFR delegation remained in Argentina with the two accused players.</p>

<p>The sentence for sexual assault in Argentina ranges from six to 15 years, according to the penal code. However, this could go up to 20 years in the case of two aggressors.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Colombia's Constitutional Court on Wednesday annulled a controversial carbon credit deal in the Amazon rainforest, which six local tribes said had been signed without their consent.</p>

<p>Indigenous communities living in the remote area of Pira Parana had accused US-based Ruby Canyon Environmental and Colombian company Masbosques, which acted as an intermediary, of illegally foisting the deal on them.</p>

<p>Carbon credits are bought by corporations -- or countries under certain conditions -- from forest preservation or other projects to offset or "compensate" their greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>This money is supposed to go to local communities that protect their home regions from deforestation.</p>

<p>In Pira Parana, the credits -- also known as green bonds -- were sold for about $3.8 million to a Colombian data processing firm called Latin Checkout.</p>

<p>According to EcoRegistry, which keeps tabs on carbon credit trading, Latin Checkout then sold the credits to US airline Delta which faces a lawsuit at home for alleged "greenwashing" by claiming to be carbon-neutral while purchasing questionable carbon offsets.</p>

<p>The deal, signed in March 2021, was for the Indigenous communities to preserve an area of 7,100 square kilometers (2,741 miles) -- close to the size of Puerto Rico.</p>

<p>But the tribes said the deal was signed with false representatives of their communities.</p>

<p>They went to court claiming violations of their rights to territorial autonomy and self-government.</p>

<p>On Monday, the court ordered the tribes' legitimate representatives to meet and decide within six months whether to authorize a new agreement.</p>

<p>If they do not, authorities must "ensure" the carbon credit project "is no longer carried out in the territory," the judges ruled.</p>

<p>The concept behind carbon credits has taken a major hit recently as scientific research has repeatedly shown claims of reduced emissions being hugely overestimated -- or even nonexistent.</p>

<p>In late 2023, AFP walked, motor-boated and overflew part of the Pira Parana territory, an area so remote it is accessible only by million-dollar private flights or a boat trip of at least six days from the nearest city of Mitu.</p>

<p>There, local leaders said they wished they had never heard of the deal.</p>

<p>While it brought an economic "bonanza," it also led to conflict in communities unaccustomed to handling large sums of money and a loss of Indigenous autonomy, they said.</p>

<p>The project "contaminates spiritually, physically, it destroys everything... in this territory, for money," Indigenous leader Fabio Valencia said at the time.</p>

<p>Some experts have said there was no real deforestation threat in the area and therefore no emissions "savings" to be made.</p>

<p>The Constitutional Court case was the first of its kind in Colombia.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Yoda figurines to Lego stormtrooper helmets, Star Wars is everywhere around the Massive Entertainment video game studio that's about to unveil a hotly anticipated title drawn from George Lucas's iconic franchise.</p>

<p>Hundreds of developers spent years making "Star Wars Outlaws", a process the Malmo, Sweden-based studio's executives say took them from mere fans to craftspeople on the beloved epic.</p>

<p>"We had to take a step back," said game developer Mathias Karlson, and "make the journey from fandom to being a craftsperson together with Lucasfilms creating something new, a new perspective."</p>

<p>Anticipation is building ahead of the August 30 release of "Star Wars Outlaws", an open-world game set between the events of the "Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi".</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Get a first glimpse at the new thrilling gameplay and open world of Star Wars Outlaws. Join us on June 10th at 12PM PDT/ 9 PM CEST at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UbiForward?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UbiForward</a> to learn more! <a href="https://t.co/VkRkeAFuXG">pic.twitter.com/VkRkeAFuXG</a></p>

<p>"Many of us grew up with Star Wars," said the studio's operations director Alf Condelius. "I was 11 years old when I saw the first film and when I got home, I asked myself how I'd lived 11 years without Star Wars."</p>

<p>"It's been a fantastic journey almost like reconnecting with childhood", said Karlson.</p>

<p>The Swedish studios, owned by French giant Ubisoft, partnered up with the Star Wars creator's LucasFilm company and began chipping away at the project in 2020.</p>

<p>"We wanted to create a video game in which the player would be the director of their own experience, giving them all the possible options -- which vehicle to choose, where to go, which criminal group to pledge allegiance to, everything that makes a bandit or outlaw adventure really come alive", the studio's creative director Julian Gerighty told AFP. &nbsp;</p>

<p>While a plethora of games based on the Star Wars franchise already exists, and designers can only work in a specific fictional era, the creators of "Outlaw" promised players extra power and agency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We were given a lot of create freedom to come up with new things," Gerighty said.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Playing a thief</strong></h3>

<p>Players will step into the shoes of Kay Vess, who is about to pull off the heist of the century.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wearing a leather jacket, heavily tattooed, a pistol on her belt, and always accompanied by her trusted galactic animal companion Nix, Kay Vess explores planets and navigates between crime bosses in order to gain her freedom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The young woman comes from Cantonica, a fictional desert planet known for its casino city, which saga lovers discovered in 2017 in the eighth film, "The Last Jedi".</p>

<p>"It's easier to make something new than trying to recreate (the planet) Tatooine as accurately as possible," Gerighty said.</p>

<p>The sound and aesthetics echo the trilogies of George Lucas, whose own sources of inspiration influenced the designers.</p>

<p>"We make references to Wild West and samurai films," said Cloe Hammoud, who created the game worlds, adding that creators from 57 countries used "cinematic realism to get closer to the atmosphere (of the films), using for example the same objectives, the same style."</p>

<p>The game, which lasts about 60 hours, is appropriate for all ages and will be available on PC, PS5 and Xbox X/S.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK police said Wednesday a 26-year-old man was in custody after the wife and two daughters of a radio racing commentator were killed with a crossbow in a suspected "targeted" attack.</p>

<p>Kyle Clifford, 26, from Enfield in north London, was wanted in connection with the deaths of the three women in the town of Bushey, north of London, on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>The victims were Carol Hunt, the 61-year-old wife of BBC radio and Sky Sports racing commentator John Hunt, and their two daughters, Louise, 25, and Hannah, 28, the broadcasters said.</p>

<p>In a statement Wednesday, police said Clifford, who was found by officers in Enfield, "was known to the victims" and no additional suspects were being sought.</p>

<p>Clifford was "receiving medical treatment having been found with injuries," police said.</p>

<p>Local police previously said officers were called to a house in the leafy commuter town where the three women were pronounced dead at the scene.</p>

<p>Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson called it "a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used".</p>

<p>A primary school in nearby Enfield kept children indoors during the police search.</p>

<p>There is no licence required to own a crossbow in the UK, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.</p>

<p>Interior minister Yvette Cooper called the deaths "truly shocking" and said she was being kept updated about the inquiry.</p>

<p>A spokeswoman for her department said legislation was "under constant review and a call for evidence was launched earlier this year to look at whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced".</p>

<p>She said the minister would "swiftly consider the findings to see if laws need to be tightened further".</p>

<p><strong>- 'Shocking' -</strong></p>

<p>BBC Radio Five Live sent a note to staff calling the incident "utterly devastating".</p>

<p>Sky Sports Racing said on X that the team was "deeply saddened by the tragic deaths" and "our thoughts are with our colleague John Hunt, his family and friends at this awful time".</p>

<p>One neighbour described hearing "shrill" screams from the home on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The 46-year-old who lives near the scene, said "absolute chaos" then broke out as armed police put the road into lockdown.</p>

<p>"We had armed police running down, screaming 'stay in your house'," she added.</p>

<p>Another neighbour told reporters the victims were a friendly family.</p>

<p>"We would see them every day passing by and they would say good morning," she said. "It's really sad what's happened, very shocking."</p>

<p>In March, a 47-year-old man was arrested after two people were injured in separate crossbow attacks in London's Shoreditch area.</p>

<p>Last October Jaswant Singh Chail, 21, was jailed after being found in the grounds of Windsor Castle, west of London, with a loaded crossbow.</p>

<p>He broke into the royal residence on Christmas Day 2021 and told police he was trying to kill Queen Elizabeth II.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NATO countries at their summit in Washington on Wednesday came up with what alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg called a "substantial package" of support for Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But what exactly is NATO offering the war-torn country two and half years into Russia's invasion?</p>

<p><strong>'Trump-proofing' arms supplies </strong></p>

<p>NATO will take a greater role from the United States in coordinating training and weapons deliveries for Ukraine by setting up a centralized command.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The move is aimed at shielding supplies to Kyiv from a potential return to the White House by Donald Trump after November's presidential election.</p>

<p>The change will see hundreds of personnel from different NATO members stationed at a base in Germany, and key hubs along the alliance's eastern flank.</p>

<p>The switch is quite modest -- and a three-star US General looks likely to take the lead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But its an important step for an alliance that has so far steered clear of having a direct role in arming Ukraine for fears it would drag NATO closer to war with Russia.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>40-billion-euro pledge </strong></p>

<p>NATO countries have pledged to maintain support for Ukraine for a further year at the rate they have been doing since Russia invaded -- a minimum of 40 billion euros ($43 billion).</p>

<p>"Through proportional contributions, allies intend to provide a minimum baseline funding of 40 billion euros within the next year, and to provide sustainable levels of security assistance for Ukraine to prevail," a summit declaration said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The political promise is designed to put aid on a firmer footing -- but it is not legally binding and could be ignored by future leaders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Initially, Stoltenberg had hoped to get allies to make it a multi-year commitment but the US demanded a review next year.</p>

<p><strong>'Irreversible path' to membership </strong></p>

<p>NATO didn't give Ukraine what it really wants: a clear invite to join the alliance in the near future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead leaders reaffirmed the commitment that Kyiv will one day become a member "when allies agree and conditions are met."</p>

<p>To offer Ukraine some encouragement, leaders did agree to say that Kyiv's path to membership is "irreversible."</p>

<p>They also declared that the NATO package "constitutes a bridge" to joining.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Air defenses </strong></p>

<p>More concretely, US President Joe Biden announced a major package of advanced air defenses to help Kyiv repel Russia's attacks.</p>

<p>Much of it was already known -- including Germany and Romania sending a Patriot battery each, Netherlands providing parts for one and Italy giving a similar system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of that the United States will now add one more Patriot system of its own.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The commitments still see NATO falling short of giving Ukraine the seven Patriot systems that it has been desperately pleading for since April.</p>

<p>Biden and other leaders said they would provide Ukraine dozens of shorter-range systems in the coming months.</p>

<p><strong>Fighter jets</strong></p>

<p>The US, Netherlands and Denmark announced that the long-promised transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine was "now underway" and they would be operational in the skies this summer.</p>

<p>Denmark and the Netherlands had already said they were aiming to get the aircraft to Kyiv in the near future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In total, NATO allies have promised to deliver dozens of F-16 jets to Kyiv in the coming years.</p>

<p>That is still well short of the roughly 120 that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says his country needs.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NATO allies on Wednesday announced they had started transferring F-16 jets to Ukraine and stepped up promises to Kyiv on eventual membership in the alliance at a 75th anniversary summit clouded by political uncertainties in the United States.</p>

<p>With the pomp of the three-day gathering in the US capital, President Joe Biden is aiming to rally the West and also reassure US voters amid pre-election scrutiny on whether at 81 -- six years older than the alliance -- he remains fit for the job.</p>

<p>Biden individually welcomed the other 31 leaders of the alliance before urging them to keep pace with Russia's military production, which has stepped up sharply in the two years since President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine.</p>

<p>"We can -- and will -- defend every inch of NATO territory and we'll do it together," Biden told the North Atlantic Council, the formal decision-making body of the alliance, at Washington's convention center as the city sweltered in a heat wave.</p>

<p>Biden announced that Denmark and the Netherlands had begun sending US-made F-16 jets to Ukraine -- making good on a key promise last year to Kyiv, which has struggled to gain parity in the air with Russia.</p>

<p>He earlier announced new air defense systems for Ukraine and said the United States had agreed to place long-range missiles periodically in Germany.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the F-16 transfer "concentrates Vladimir Putin's mind on the fact that he will not outlast Ukraine, he will not outlast us and, if he persists, the damage that will continue to be done to Russia and its interests will only deepen."</p>

<p>But Donald Trump, who is edging out Biden in recent polls, has mused about bringing a quick peace settlement by forcing Ukraine to surrender territory to Russia.</p>

<p>The Republican mogul has repeatedly questioned the utility of NATO -- formed in 1949 as collective defense against Moscow -- which he sees as an unfair burden on the United States.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Terror must fail' -</strong><br />
On the eve of the summit, Russia fired a barrage of missiles on Ukraine, killing dozens, including in Kyiv where a children's hospital was reduced to debris.</p>

<p>Biden invited to the summit Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who voiced gratitude for the F-16s.</p>

<p>The new aircraft will "bring just and lasting peace closer, demonstrating that terror must fail," Zelensky wrote on social media.</p>

<p>The summit aimed in part to "Trump-proof" the alliance including by giving NATO a greater role, rather than the United States, in coordinating arms delivery into Ukraine.</p>

<p>In a joint declaration, NATO leaders promised to give Ukraine 40 billion euros ($43 billion) in military aid "within the next year" -- part of efforts to increase predictability, after Trump's allies in Congress held up US assistance for months.</p>

<p>Stoltenberg insisted that NATO also wanted to end the war but with a Ukrainian victory.</p>

<p>"The quickest way to end a war is to lose a war," Stoltenberg told reporters.</p>

<p>Trump's aides have discussed conditioning aid to Ukraine on forcing Kyiv to the negotiating table and said that China, not Russia, is a larger concern to US interests.</p>

<p>The NATO leaders' statement took aim at China by voicing "profound concern" over its industrial support to Russia.</p>

<p>Biden has also invited four key Pacific partners -- Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand -- as he seeks to increase NATO's role in Asia.</p>

<p>- 'Irreversible' Ukraine path to NATO -<br />
The summit stepped up promises to Ukraine, saying that it was on an "irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership."</p>

<p>Ukraine has for years sought but failed to win membership in NATO, which considers an attack on one an attack on all.</p>

<p>But Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have led concerns that bringing in Ukraine would effectively be entering war with nuclear-armed Russia as it occupies swathes of Ukraine.</p>

<p>President Alexander Stubb of Finland -- which, like Sweden, joined NATO following Russia's invasion of Ukraine -- hailed the language as a message to Putin that he is failing in his goal of pushing back the alliance.</p>

<p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, visiting days after his Labour Party swept to power, promised Zelensky that Britain -- unlike the United States -- was united across partisan lines on supporting Ukraine.</p>

<p>Starmer made clear he had no issue with Ukraine using UK missiles to strike into Russian territory, remarks that drew a rebuke from Moscow.</p>

<p>The summit, Starmer told reporters, is showing Putin that NATO is "bigger now than it's ever been, more united than it's ever been, and absolutely clear-eyed about the threat of Russian aggression."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk on Wednesday said his Neuralink startup is "moving on" to a second test patient as its tech for linking brains and computers improves.</p>

<p>Musk and members of the Neuralink team fielded questions during an update streamed on X, formerly Twitter, discussing where it is on the path to making its brain implants commonplace.</p>

<p>"We're only just moving now to our second Neuralink patient," Musk said. "But we hope to have, if things go well, high single digits this year."</p>

<p>Musk's neurotechnology company in January installed a brain implant in Noland Arbaugh, which the billionaire head of Tesla and X touted as a success.</p>

<p>Arbaugh was left paralyzed from the shoulders down by a diving accident eight years ago.</p>

<p>Since the implant operation, he has told of playing chess and the video game "Civilization," as well as taking Japanese and French lessons by controlling a computer screen cursor with his brain.</p>

<p>Musk and members of the Neuralink team detailed fixing an issue that saw Arbaugh's ability to move a computer cursor with his mind greatly reduced.</p>

<p>Neuralink's technology works through a device about the size of five stacked coins that is placed inside the human brain by a robotic surgeon.</p>

<p>Threads connecting the implant to Arbaugh's brain had "retracted," becoming less effective at picking up signals.</p>

<p>Threads will be implanted deeper in the brain and at varying depths, with ramped-up precision to maximize effectiveness, according to the Neuralink team.</p>

<p>Musk promised "it's only going to get better from here."</p>

<p>One goal is to escalate the bandwidth of the link between the brain and computer, allowing more data to move faster, according to Musk.</p>

<p>"Quite important for human-AI symbiosis is just being able to communicate at a speed AI can follow," Musk said of brains being connected to computers with artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Musk envisions Neuralink implants going beyond restoring sight to the blind to giving people infrared or ultraviolet vision or letting them share concepts with others telepathically.</p>

<p>"We want to give people superpowers," Musk said. "Not just that we're restoring your prior functionality, but that you actually have functionality far greater than a normal human."</p>

<p>Musk spoke of developing an automated process in which Neuralink's surgery robot could quickly install custom implants in people seeking "upgrades."</p>

<p>"It's very sort of 'Cyberpunk' or 'Deus Ex,' if you play those games," Musk said of the idea.</p>

<p>"An exciting possibility long term also is to take parts of the Optimus humanoid robot and combine that with a Neuralink - you could have basically cybernetic superpowers," he said.</p>

<p>Musk cofounded Neuralink in 2016.</p>

<p>The ambition is to supercharge human capabilities, treat neurological disorders like ALS or Parkinson's, and maybe one day achieve a symbiotic relationship between humans and AI.</p>

<p>Musk is not alone in trying to make advances in the field, which is officially known as brain-machine or brain-computer interface research.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Wednesday urged the West to reject "double standards" regarding the conflict in Gaza as he joined NATO leaders in supporting Ukraine.</p>

<p>Spain under Sanchez has infuriated Israel's right-wing government by recognizing a Palestinian state and criticizing Israel's conduct of its war against Hamas.</p>

<p>"If we are telling our people that we are supporting Ukraine because we are defending the international law, this is the same to what we have to do towards Gaza," he said at NATO's 75th anniversary summit in Washington.</p>

<p>The socialist leader said there should be a "consistent political position" in which "we don't have double standards."</p>

<p>Sanchez said the world needed to press to "stop this terrible humanitarian crisis" affecting the Palestinians and called for an international peace conference to push for a Palestinian state.</p>

<p>"We need to create the conditions for an immediate and urgent ceasefire," he said. "There is a real risk of escalation to Lebanon."</p>

<p>Sanchez said he also supported "democracy, freedom and the right to exist of a country such as Ukraine."</p>

<p>NATO leaders at the summit issued a declaration that said Kyiv was on an "irreversible" path to join the alliance.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday that he would not support any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites in response to its missile attack and urged Israel to act "proportionally."</p>

<p>Biden spoke a day after Iran fired more than 180 ballistic missiles at Israel in a move that he previously described as "ineffective." Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran would pay for the attack.</p>

<p>"We'll be discussing with the Israelis what they're going to do, but all seven of us (G7 nations) agree that they have a right to respond but they should respond proportionally," Biden told reporters before boarding Air Force One.</p>

<p>Some analysts said Israel's response would likely be sharper than when Iran fired missiles and drones at Israel in April, suggesting this time it could target Tehran's nuclear or oil facilities.</p>

<p>Asked whether the U.S. would back any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites, Biden told reporters: "The answer is no."</p>

<p>Biden said more sanctions would be imposed on Iran and that he would speak soon with Netanyahu.</p>

<p>"Obviously, Iran is way off course," he said.</p>

<p>U.S. Deputy Secretary Kurt Campbell said the administration was seeking to align its position with Israel on any response to Iran's attack but also recognizes the Middle East is on a "knife's edge" and a broader escalation could imperil both Israeli and U.S. interests.</p>

<p>Speaking at a virtual event hosted by Washington-based think tank Carnegie Endowment, Campbell repeated the U.S. view that what Tehran has undertaken was "deeply irresponsible" and that there must be a "return message."</p>

<p>"I think we tried to underscore our support for some of the actions that Israel has taken," he added. "We have real wariness about a extended or substantial ground set of operations in Lebanon," Campbell said.</p>

<p>The Israeli army is locked in combat at its northern border with Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah fighters. On Wednesday, eight Israeli soldiers were killed -- the deadliest suffered by Israel's military on the Lebanon front in the past year of border-area clashes between Israel and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Iran said on Wednesday its missile volley - its biggest ever assault on Israel - was over, barring further provocation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian troops are in complete control of the town of Vuhledar in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region that has resisted Russian assaults for more than two years, the SHOT Telegram channel and pro-Russian war bloggers said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Here are some key points about the town and the battle.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT IS VUHLEDAR?</strong></p>

<p>Vuhledar - which means "gift of coal" - is a coal mining town in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region with a pre-war population of around 14,000 people, nearly all of whom have fled. It was built by the Soviet Union in the mid 1960s around a mine. There are two mines there now with significant coal reserves. Russians call the town, which sits on a flat plain and is comprised of high-rise apartment buildings and other structures, Ugledar.</p>

<p><strong>WHY DID RUSSIA WANT TO TAKE IT?</strong></p>

<p>Moscow says the Donetsk region is one of four Ukrainian regions it has annexed since 2022, a claim Kyiv rejects as illegal. Moscow saw taking control of Vuhledar as an important stepping stone to incorporating the entire region into Russia.</p>

<p>Control of the town - which Russians long regarded as one of Ukraine's toughest fortified positions to crack - is considered important by both sides because of its position on elevated ground and because it sits at the intersection of the eastern and southern battlefield fronts giving it added significance when it comes to supplying both sides' forces.</p>

<p>While Ukrainian forces were in full control of Vuhledar, they were able to use the town as a platform to shell Russian military supply lines in the area.</p>

<p>The town sits close to a railway line from Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, to Ukraine's industrialised Donbas region which comprises Donetsk and the eastern region of Luhansk, most of which Moscow controls.</p>

<p>Taking Vuhledar, which Russia portrays as one of the last Ukrainian strongholds in southern Donetsk, opens the way for Russian forces to advance on other places.</p>

<p><strong>HOW DID RUSSIA TAKE CONTROL OF VUHLEDAR?</strong></p>

<p>Russian forces trapped Ukrainian soldiers in the town in what they called a mini-cauldron, gradually encircling it from all sides and thus making it increasingly difficult for Ukrainian forces to resupply or rotate in and out of the town.</p>

<p>When such a cauldron closes, something Russian military bloggers say has already happened, there is no way in or out for the defenders who in this case were bombarded with devastating aerial glide bombs.</p>

<p>Russian forces had previously launched at least four major attempts to take Vuhledar, but had been repelled with Ukraine's 72nd Separate Mechanised Brigade mounting fierce resistance.</p>

<p>Neither side discloses losses, but Ukrainian officials said Russian losses sustained during previous failed attempts to take the town had been significant. Moscow says Ukraine also paid a high human price when trying to retain Vuhledar.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT DOES VUHLEDAR LOOK LIKE NOW</strong></p>

<p>Fierce fighting since 2022 has left much of the town devastated. Images of Russian forces waving their flag on the roof of an administrative building on Tuesday in the centre showed a structure which had been reduced to rubble in parts and whose blackened windows had all been blown out.</p>

<p>Maksym Verbovsky, the town's deputy mayor, told Ukrainian state media last year that every single building had been damaged along with the entire infrastructure. He said then that fewer than 500 civilians, including three children and many pensioners, remained. All children and most adults have since been evacuated.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Masoud Pezeshkian insisted Wednesday that Iran was "not looking for war" but pledged a stronger response if Israel retaliates for its missile attack.</p>

<p>"If it (Israel) wants to react, we will have a stronger response, this is what the Islamic Republic is committed to," Pezeshkian said in a joint press conference with Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, in Doha.</p>

<p>"We are not looking for war, it is Israel that forces us to react," he said.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian spoke a day after Iran fired about 200 missiles including hypersonic weapons towards Israel, sending frightened civilians into shelters.</p>

<p>Israel intercepted most of them, while medics reported two people lightly wounded by shrapnel. One of the missiles damaged a school building.</p>

<p>On Wednesday the Israeli military said several Iranian missiles fell inside air force bases without causing any damage.</p>

<p>"The dirty goal of the Zionist regime is to cause insecurity and spread crisis in the region," Pezeshkian said.</p>

<p>"What we want from US and European countries is to tell the entity they have planted in the region (Israel) to stop the bloodshed."</p>

<p>Sheikh Tamim warned that Israel was drawing the region to the "brink of the abyss" with its attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

<p>The emir also condemned ongoing Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip, saying Doha would press on with efforts to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas, whose October 7 attacks triggered the war.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's pledge to respond to a massive missile strike from Iran has sent diplomats scrambling for ways to avert a full-blown regional war.</p>

<p>AFP spoke with five experts about Iran's calculations, Israel's choices and fears of escalation.</p>

<p><strong>Why did Iran order missile strike?</strong></p>

<p>The Islamic Republic is seen as having suffered a series of Israeli-inflicted humiliations over the last year which have left its strategy of building up allies across the Middle East in tatters.</p>

<p>An Iran-backed alliance known as "the Axis of Resistance" includes the Palestinian group Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Yemen's Houthi rebels, and other Shiite Muslim armed groups in Iraq and Syria.</p>

<p>Israel has pressed an offensive against Hamas in Gaza since October last year when Hamas launched an unprecedented attack, while the group's political leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran in July.</p>

<p>In Lebanon, exploding pagers and air strikes have severely weakened Hezbollah, while its leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed by an Israeli missile in a Beirut suburb last week -- along with an Iranian general.</p>

<p>After an Israeli strike on Iran's consulate in the Syrian capital Damascus in April, Tehran retaliated for the first time, firing 300 missiles and drones at the Jewish state, almost all of which were intercepted.</p>

<p>Tuesday's attack saw another 200 missiles fired, again with little military impact, meaning they were largely "symbolic", according to K. Campbell, a US military intelligence veteran with a history of working on Iran.</p>

<p>"All air defense systems have a saturation point, and Iran seems to have purposely stayed below the Israeli air defense saturation point," Campbell told AFP.</p>

<p>"I don't think Iran wants a big regional war," Jon Alterman, a Middle East expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think-tank, said.</p>

<p><strong>How might Israel react?</strong></p>

<p>James Demmin-De Lise, an author and political analyst who has written a book about Israel and anti-Semitism, said he thought Israel would seek to press home its advantage.</p>

<p>"Iran is now thoroughly weakened, as its proxies have been decimated," he said, predicting a "rather dramatic power shift" with Israel possibly even eyeing regime change in Tehran.</p>

<p>A senior European diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there were real fears of an "extension of the conflict."</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's "team is a bit euphoric, thinking 'we've got Nasrallah, we're going to change the Middle East,'" the source said.</p>

<p>Former Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett argued on Wednesday for a more targeted military attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.</p>

<p>But Israel is already fighting on two fronts: in Gaza -- where more than 41,000 Palestinians have died, according to the Hamas-run health ministry -- as well as in southern Lebanon where troops began a ground operation to target Hezbollah on Monday.</p>

<p><strong>Would it risk provoking a third war?</strong></p>

<p>"Israel has had a lot of successes in the last two weeks, which they wouldn't want to jeopardize," Alterman from the Center for Strategic and International Studies said.</p>

<p>He said Israel would have to choose between "two instincts of lock in a gain, or double down on a strategy that's been giving results."</p>

<p><strong>What are the 'off-ramps'?</strong></p>

<p>The UN Security Council is set to hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss the Middle East, but the global body is widely seen as ineffective and divided.</p>

<p>The only foreign power with potential sway over Israel is the United States but President Joe Biden's adminstration has shown itself to have only relative influence.</p>

<p>In a statement the day after the killing of Nasrallah, Biden reiterated US support for "Israel's right to defend itself against Hezbollah, Hamas, the Huthis, and any other Iranian-supported terrorist groups."</p>

<p>But Biden has also been pushing for a ceasefire in Gaza and had declared himself against any Israeli ground offensive in Lebanon -- to no avail.</p>

<p>"President Biden will most likely step in to negotiate but I doubt he will have much influence," said Jordan Barkin, an Israeli political analyst and former magazine editor.</p>

<p>The US also lacks direct relations with Iran, meaning any diplomatic move to defuse tensions would need European or Middle Eastern involvement.</p>

<p>"Everything will depend on the Israeli reaction and everything will depend on the advice and the efforts made by the American administration which has no interest at this time of becoming embroiled in a regional war," said Hasni Abidi, director of the Geneva-based Centre of Study and Research for the Arab and Mediterranean World (CERMAM).</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 13-year-old girl in the US has been accused of stabbing her 7-year-old sister to death following an argument over flushing the toilet. According to <em>The Independent</em>, the incident took place on Saturday in Michigan when the teenager was babysitting her younger sister. Officers responded to the scene at around 1pm to find the victim in the bathroom, suffering from over 10 stab wounds. She was rushed to the hospital where she was pronounced dead, the prosecutor's office said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/teenager-sister-stabbed-flushing-toilet-michigan-b2622082.html"><em>The Independent</em></a><i>,&nbsp;</i>the cops said that a note had been placed in the bathroom about flushing the toilet and a verbal argument broke between the two. During the argument, the 13-year-old allegedly stabbed her younger sister in the abdomen, head and neck with a butcher's knife and a hunting knife, following which she called 911.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 13-year-old is now facing several charges including first-degree premeditated murder, felony murder and first-degree child abuse, the Prosecutor's Office said. "She was very calm and just showed no emotion," Detective Zachary Digiacomo said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The identities of both the victim and suspect have not been released due to their ages.</p>

<p>The parents told the police that they had only left their older daughter to babysit her younger sister for two hours when the attack unfolded. They insisted that the siblings had only ever had "normal sibling arguments" before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Separately, one of the family's neighbours spoke out of their shock at what had happened. "Just last night I was talking to her and now she's gone... she used to walk up and down the street everyday riding her bike, walking up and down the street stopping and talking to neighbors. She was just the sweetest little girl," they said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The outlet reported that the teen will not be tried as an adult, however, she will be kept in the juvenile system. "Given her young age, the state would have seven years to diagnose, treat, and rehabilitate her until her mandatory release at age 21," Prosecutor Kym Worthy said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Hopefully then she would not be a danger to others. While this is a difficult decision given these facts, it is the right thing to do in this case," the prosecutor continued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There is absolutely no doubt that the facts in this case are horrific. It is beyond disturbing that the alleged person responsible for the stabbing death of her seven-year-old sister is thirteen years old," she added.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned Hezbollah leader Syyed Hassan Nasrallah to flee Lebanon days before he was killed in an Israeli strike, three Iranian sources said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned Hezbollah leader Syyed Hassan Nasrallah to flee Lebanon days before he was killed in an Israeli strike and is now deeply worried about Israeli infiltration of senior government ranks in Tehran, three Iranian sources said.</p>

<p>In the immediate aftermath of the attack on Hezbollah's booby-trapped pagers on Sept. 17, Khamenei sent a message with an envoy to beseech the Hezbollah secretary general to leave for Iran, citing intelligence reports that suggested Israel had operatives within Hezbollah and was planning to kill him, one of the sources, a senior Iranian official, told Reuters.</p>

<p>The messenger, the official said, was a senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander, Brigadier General Abbas Nilforoushan, who was with Nasrallah in his bunker when it was hit by Israeli bombs and was also killed.</p>

<p>Khamenei, who has remained in a secure location inside Iran since Saturday, personally ordered a barrage of around 200 missiles to be fired at Israel on Tuesday, a senior Iranian official said. The attack was retaliation for the deaths of Nasrallah and Nilforoushan, the Revolutionary Guards said in a statement.</p>

<p>The statement also cited the July killing of Hamas Leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, and Israel's attacks on Lebanon. Israel has not claimed responsibility for Haniyeh's death.</p>

<p>Israel on Tuesday began what it labelled as a "limited" ground incursion against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>Iran's foreign ministry and the office of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which oversees the country's foreign intelligence agency Mossad, did not reply to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Nasrallah's assassination followed two weeks of precise Israeli strikes that have destroyed weapons sites, eliminated half of Hezbollah's leadership council and decimated its top military command.</p>

<p>Iran's fears for the safety of Khamenei and the loss of trust, within both Hezbollah and Iran's establishment and between them, emerged in the conversations with 10 sources for this story, who described a situation that could complicate the effective functioning of Iran's Axis of Resistance alliance of anti-Israel irregular armed groups.</p>

<p>Founded with Iran's backing the 1980s, Hezbollah has long been the most formidable member of the alliance.</p>

<p>The disarray is also making it hard for Hezbollah to choose a new leader, fearing the ongoing infiltration will put the successor at risk, four Lebanese sources said.</p>

<p>"Basically, Iran lost the biggest investment it had for the past decades," said Magnus Ranstorp, a Hezbollah expert at the Swedish Defense University, of the deep damage caused to Hezbollah that he said diminished Iran's capacity to strike at Israel's borders.</p>

<p>"It shook Iran to the core. It shows how Iran is deeply infiltrated also: they not only killed Nasrallah, they killed Nilforoushan," he said, who was a trusted military adviser to Khamenei.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's lost military capacity and leadership cadre might push Iran towards the type of attacks against Israeli embassies and personnel abroad that it engaged in more frequently before the rise of its proxy forces, Ranstorp said.</p>

<p><strong>IRAN MAKES ARRESTS</strong></p>

<p>Nasrallah's death has prompted Iranian authorities to thoroughly investigate possible infiltrations within Iran's own ranks, from the powerful Revolutionary Guards to senior security officials, a second senior Iranian official said. They are especially focused on those who travel abroad or have relatives living outside Iran, the first official said.</p>

<p>Tehran grew suspicious of certain members of the Guards who had been traveling to Lebanon, he said. Concerns were raised when one of these individuals began asking about Nasrallah's whereabouts, particularly inquiring about how long he would remain in specific locations, the official added.</p>

<p>The individual has been arrested along with several others, the first official said, after alarm was raised in Iran's intelligence circles. The suspect's family had relocated outside Iran, the official said, without identifying the suspect or his relatives.</p>

<p>The second official said the assassination has spread mistrust between Tehran and Hezbollah, and within Hezbollah.</p>

<p>"The trust that held everything together has disappeared," the official said.</p>

<p>The Supreme Leader "no longer trusts anyone," said a third source who is close to Iran's establishment.</p>

<p>Alarm bells had already rung within Tehran and Hezbollah about possible Mossad infiltrations after the killing in July of Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in an Israeli airstrike on a secretive Beirut location while meeting an IRGC commander, two Hezbollah sources and a Lebanese security official told Reuters at the time. That killing was followed a few hours later by the assassination of Hamas leader Haniyeh in Tehran.</p>

<p>Unlike Haniyeh's death, Israel publicly claimed responsibility for the killing of Shukr, a low-profile figure who Nasrallah nonetheless described, at his funeral, as a central figure in Hezbollah's history who had built its most important capabilities.</p>

<p>Shukr was key to the development of Hezbollah's most advanced weaponary, including precision-guided missiles, and was in charge of the Shi'ite groups operations against Israel over the past year, Israel's military has said.</p>

<p>Iranian fears about Israeli penetration of its upper ranks stretches back years. In 2021, former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said the head of an Iranian intelligence unit that was supposed to target agents of Mossad had himself been an agent for the Israeli spy agency, telling CNN Turk that Israel obtained sensitive documents on Iran's nuclear programme, a reference to a 2018 raid in which Israel obtained a huge trove of top secret documents about the programme.</p>

<p>Also in 2021, Israel's outgoing spy chief Yossi Cohen gave details about the raid, telling the BBC that 20 non-Israeli Mossad agents were involved in stealing the archive from a warehouse.</p>

<p><strong>PAGER WARNING</strong></p>

<p>Khamenei's invitation to Nasrallah to relocate to Iran came after thousands of pagers and walkie talkies used by Hezbollah blew up in deadly attacks on Sept 17 and 18, the first official said. The attacks have been widely attributed to Israel, although it has not officially claimed responsibility.</p>

<p>Nasrallah, however, was confident in his security and trusted his inner circle completely, the official said, despite Tehran's serious concerns about potential infiltrators within Hezbollah's ranks.</p>

<p>Khamenei tried a second time, relaying another message through Nilforoushan to Nasrallah last week, imploring him to leave Lebanon and relocate to Iran as a safer location. But Nasrallah insisted on staying in Lebanon, the official said.</p>

<p>Several high-level meetings were held in Tehran following the pager blasts to discuss Hezbollah and Nasrallah's safety, the official said, but declined to say who attended those meetings.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, in Lebanon, Hezbollah began conducting a major investigation to purge Israeli spies among them, questioning hundreds of members after the pager detonations, three sources in Lebanon told Reuters.</p>

<p>Sheikh Nabil Kaouk, a senior Hezbollah official, was leading the investigation, a Hezbollah source said. The probe was progressing rapidly, the source said, before an Israeli raid killed him a day after Nasrallah's assassination. Another raid earlier last week had targeted other senior Hezbollah commanders, some of who were involved in the inquiry.</p>

<p>Kaouk had summoned for questioning Hezbollah officials involved in logistics and others "who participated, mediated and received offers on pagers and walkie-talkies," the source said.</p>

<p>A "deeper and comprehensive inquiry" and purge were now needed after the killing of Nasrallah and other commanders, the source said.</p>

<p>Ali al-Amin, the editor-in-chief for Janoubia, a news site based that focuses on the Shi'ite community and Hezbollah said reports indicated that Hezbollah detained hundreds of people for questioning after the pagers saga.</p>

<p>Hezbollah is reeling from Nasrallah's killing in his deep bunker in a command HQ, shocked at how successfully Israel penetrated the group, seven sources said.</p>

<p>Mohanad Hage Ali, deputy research director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut with a focus on Iran and Hezbollah, described the offensive as "the biggest intelligence infiltration by Israel" since Hezbollah was founded with Iran's backing in the 1980s.</p>

<p>The current Israeli escalation follows almost a year of cross-border fighting after Hezbollah began rocket attacks in support of its ally Hamas. The Palestinian group killed 1,200 people and seized 250 hostages in an attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>In Gaza, Israel's retaliation has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry.</p>

<p><strong>LOSS OF TRUST</strong></p>

<p>The Israeli offensive and fear of more attacks on Hezbollah have also prevented the Iranian-backed group from organizing a nationwide funeral on a scale reflecting Nasrallah's religious and leadership status, according to four sources familiar with the debate within Hezbollah.</p>

<p>"No one can authorize a funeral in these circumstances," one Hezbollah source said, lamenting the situation in which officials and religious leaders could not come forward to properly honor the late leader.</p>

<p>Several commanders killed last week were buried discreetly on Monday, with plans for a proper religious ceremony when the conflict ends.</p>

<p>Hezbollah is mulling the option of securing a religious decree to bury Nasrallah temporarily and hold an official funeral when the situation permits, the four Lebanese sources said.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has refrained from officially appointing a successor to Nasrallah, possibly to avoid making his replacement a target for an Israeli assassination, they said.</p>

<p>"Appointing a new Secretary General could be dangerous if Israel assassinates him right after," said Amin. "The group can't risk more chaos by appointing someone only to see them killed."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian troops on Wednesday took charge of the eastern Ukrainian town of Vuhledar, a bastion that had resisted intense attacks since Russia launched its full-scale assault in 2022.</p>

<p>The advance of Moscow's forces, which control just under a fifth of Ukraine, has underlined Russia's vast superiority in men and materiel as Ukraine pleads for more weapons from the Western allies that have been supporting it.</p>

<p>Ukraine's eastern military command said it had ordered a pullback from the hilltop coal mining town to avoid encirclement by Russian troops and "preserve personnel and military equipment".</p>

<p>The Russian defence ministry did not mention Vuhledar in its daily battlefield report.</p>

<p>Russian Telegram channels, however, published video of troops waving the Russian tricolour flag over shattered buildings.</p>

<p>The town, which had a population of over 14,000 before the war, has been devastated, with Soviet-era apartment buildings smashed apart and scarred.</p>

<p>The Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper said the last Ukrainian forces from the 72nd Mechanised Brigade, a unit famous for its resistance, had abandoned the town late on Tuesday.</p>

<p>President Vladimir Putin has said Russia's primary tactical goal is to take the whole of the Donbas region - the provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk - in southeastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>Russia controls about 80% of the Donbas, a heavy industry hub where the conflict began in 2014 when Moscow supported pro-Russian separatist forces after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Kyiv and Moscow seized Crimea from Ukraine.</p>

<p><strong>VUHLEDAR TAKEN IN RAPID RUSSIAN ADVANCE</strong></p>

<p>Since Russia sent its army into Ukraine in February 2022, the war has largely been a story of grinding artillery and drone strikes along a heavily fortified 1,000-km (620-mile) front involving hundreds of thousands of soldiers.</p>

<p>But in August the battlefield became much more dynamic: Ukraine smashed through the border in Russia's Kursk region in a bid to divert Russian forces, and Russian troops began advancing faster than before in eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>Russian forces have been pushing westwards at key points along some 150 km (95 miles) of the front in the Donetsk region, with the logistics hub of Pokrovsk also a key target.</p>

<p>They captured Ukrainsk on Sept. 17 and then began encircling Vuhledar, about 80 km (50 miles) south of Pokrovsk.</p>

<p>Russia has been using pincer tactics to trap and then constrict Ukrainian strongholds. Images from the area showed intense bombardment of the town with artillery and aerial glide bombs.</p>

<p>Neither side discloses losses, and each said the other had paid a high human price for the town.</p>

<p>Control of Vuhledar, which lies at the intersection of the eastern and southern battlefields, is significant because it will ease Russia's advance as it tries to pierce deeper behind the Ukrainian defensive lines.</p>

<p>Russian bloggers said Russia could now try to push towards Velyka Novosilka, just over 30 km (20 miles) to the west.</p>

<p>Vuhledar also sits close to a railway line connecting Crimea to the Donbas region.</p>

<p>Russian forces currently control 98.5% of the Luhansk region and 60% of the Donetsk region.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Rosh Hashanah means 'head of the year'. It is a two-day celebration that marks the beginning of Jewish High Holy Days each autumn.</p>

<p>On September 30, PM Modi held a telephonic conversation with his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu and discussed recent developments in West Asia.</p>

<p>PM Modi expressed India's commitment to supporting efforts for early restoration of peace and stability. He called it crucial to prevent recent escalation and ensure the safe release of all hostages.</p>

<p>In a post on X, PM Modi stated, "Spoke to Prime Minister @netanyahu about recent developments in West Asia. Terrorism has no place in our world. It is crucial to prevent regional escalation and ensure the safe release of all hostages. India is committed to supporting efforts for an early restoration of peace and stability."</p>

<p>In October last year, Israel launched a counter-offensive against Hamas after hundreds of Hamas terrorists burst into Israeli borders, killing over 1200 people and taking over 250 hostages, out of which 100 continue to be in captivity.</p>

<p>The turmoil in West Asia escalated after Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles towards targets in Israel on Tuesday and the United States military coordinated closely with the Israeli Defence Forces to help defend Israel against this attack.</p>

<p>US Naval destroyers joined Israeli air defence units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described Iran's missile attack on his country as a "big mistake" and said Tehran would pay for it."</p>

<p>A day after Iran targeted Israel with a rocket barrage, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) called on Lebanese civilians in two dozen villages in southern Lebanon to evacuate immediately. The Israeli military said it will update the civilians when they can return.</p>

<p>"Hezbollah's activity forces the IDF to act against it. The IDF does not wish to harm you. For your safety, you must evacuate your homes immediately. Anyone who is near Hezbollah operatives, their facilities or their weapons, puts themselves at risk," Colonel Avichay Adraee, the IDF's Arabic-language spokesman, said in a statement on X.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Iran's attack on Israel wasn't just a barrage of missiles, it was a barrage of 181 ballistic missiles, each having a warhead payload of between 700-1,000 kilograms. It is unprecedented, Israel's Ambassador told NDTV.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's attack on Israel wasn't just a barrage of missiles, it was a barrage of 181 ballistic missiles, each having a warhead payload of between 700-1,000 kilograms, which can destroy entire buildings. This is unprecedented in the history of our warfare, Israel Ambassador to India Reuven Azar said today.</p>

<p>Speaking exclusively to NDTV, the Ambassador described Iran's sharp escalation against Israel "a very serious situation", adding that "fortunately we have the best missile defence systems in the world, so most of the missiles were intercepted and no significant damage was done. The only missiles that hit Israel were in open areas that are not usually protected."</p>

<p>He went on to say that "this is not the first time", explaining that Israel has nothing against the Iranian people, but instead against "the radical regime in Iran", which he said has "tried repeatedly to destroy Israel".</p>

<p>"Iran's regime has been financing various terror groups for the last 30 years. They take the money from their own people and fail them by funding extremists. Israel will defend itself and not let this regime succeed," Mr Azar said.</p>

<h2><strong>THE DAMAGE AND THE RETALIATION</strong></h2>

<p>Quoting the IDF or Israel Defence Forces, the Ambassador said that "Fortunately we have not had any loss of life in Israel and not much damage either. But unfortunately, there was a tragic loss of life of a Palestinian national from Gaza where an Iranian missile hit. Iran's missile killed a Palestinian."</p>

<p>Not giving details of a likely counter-attack, Mr Azar said, "We have a challenge here because these kinds of radical people cannot be deterred. We have seen that time and time again. When Hamas launched a terror attack on us or when Nasrallah decided to attack Israel for 11 months, they do not even care for their own people, putting their lives in danger. We have to give a serious blow to these extremists."</p>

<p>The Ambassador further clarified that Israel is not against the people of Iran, and neither are they in the business of installing regimes in other countries. "Israel only defends itself", he said, adding that "We put our lives on the line to defend our country, not to change political realities in other countries."</p>

<p>He however said that "We have seen in the past how Iranian people have revolted against the radical regime. Change will not come from outside, it will come from within, if it does. As for Israel - we are only going to engage to the level of security of our people"</p>

<p>"People of Israel and Iran have shared friendly ties for thousands of years. Iran is not the enemy of Israel. The Persian people have a rich history, an ancient civilisation, which used to have amazing connect with the people of Israel," Mr Azar said.</p>

<p>"We want a situation where our threat to national security is dealt with effectively, a situation where our people can return to their homes in northern Israel, we want a situation where the UN Security Council resolutions 1701 and 1559 can be effectively implemented. Israel does not want to be an occupying force in Lebanon, neither does Israel want to decide on the political future of Lebanon," the envoy said.</p>

<h3><strong>DISAPPOINTMENT WITH UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY GENERAL</strong></h3>

<p>Speaking about the UN chief, the Ambassador said the United Nations are doing very good work, but "unfortunately there are blocs within the United Nations that are biased. It is unfortunate that there is a rigged system in place at the UN, wherein a majority of the countries can manipulate the functioning of the UN such, that you have a Secretary General of the UN who is not condemning this terrible barrage of missiles, it is very very worrisome."</p>

<p>"The UN should be neutral and unbiased," the envoy further said.</p>

<h3><strong>CAN INDIA PLAY A ROLE IN BRINGING PEACE</strong></h3>

<p>When asked if India can play a diplomatic role to bring peace to the region, the Israeli envoy said "That is for India to decide. Diplomacy can always work. We initially tried to resolve issues after the October 7 attack via diplomatic channels, but that didn;t work. Sometimes when there are extremist regimes, in order to defend oneself, one has to deal with it strongly to be effective."</p>

<p>He went on to say that India is an important player and a friend of Israel's, and New Delhi will definitely help in building back the Middle East as a "corridor of stability - one that connects Asia and Europe". India is a partner of Israel, he said.</p>

<h3><strong>TIES WITH THE ARAB NATIONS</strong></h3>

<p>The Israeli envoy highlighted that in the nearly year-long crisis in West Asia, and Israel's efforts to safeguard itself, "not a single Arab country has broken ties with Israel," he said, adding that "In fact, during this year Israel has been building its security cooperation and its intelligence cooperation across the Middle East. What does that show... that when this conflict is over, all these nations which have an interest in building a peaceful and progressive Middle East will work together to achieve that. It shows that there is an alternative to extremism, to fanaticism."</p>

<p>In his closing remarks, the Ambassador made it clear that "Hamas is no longer a threat to Israel, Hezbollah has faced a serious blow, and Iran will now pay for what it has done."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least seven people were killed when two gunmen opened fire and stabbed victims at a light rail station in Israel's Jaffa on Tuesday. One of the victims of the attack was a 33-year-old new mother who lost her life while protecting her 9-month-old baby boy Ari.&nbsp;Israeli officials reported that the brave woman shielded her child from harm, giving her life to protect her infant. ''One of the victims from yesterday's terrorist attack in Tel Aviv, Inbar Segev-Vigder, was murdered while shielding her 9-month-old son Ari. She saved his life. There are no words. Only heartbreak. May the memory of the victims be a blessing,'' the State of Israel wrote on X while sharing a picture of the mother-son.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, Segev-Vigder was a 33-year-old fitness and Pilates studio owner from Tel Aviv. Her husband, Yaari Vigder, serves as an Israeli reservist soldier. The couple got married in 2023 and had their first baby in December, last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Witnesses reported that Segev-Vigder was gunned down while exiting a train in Jaffa.&nbsp;Just hours before the shooting, she posted a prayer on Instagram for the safety of Israeli soldiers entering Lebanon.</p>

<p>"Ari was in a carrier that covered Inbar's entire upper body during the attack, he was not injured at all. For the rest of his life -- may he feel the same love he received from Inbar," <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-822974" rel="nofollow, noindex">Jerusalem Post</a></em> cited Yaari Vigder as telling Israel's Channel 11 news.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There were also other victims identified as Revital Bronstein, 24, Shahar Goldman, 30, Nadia Sokolenko, 40, and&nbsp;Ilya Nozadze, 42.&nbsp;Ms Sokolenko, originally from Moldova, was an office manager and a mother to a 6-year-old daughter. Her family awaited her return from grocery shopping but grew concerned when her phone went unanswered, prompting friends to search area hospitals.</p>

<p>The Israeli police said the attackers were residents of the Palestinian city of Hebron in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The tragedy unfolded mere minutes before Iran launched a massive barrage of ballistic missiles into Israeli territory. The Iranian retaliation was reportedly in response to the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and several other high-ranking officials of the terror group earlier that week.</p>

<p>Police said the two men who carried out the attack were subsequently shot dead by a civilian armed with a gun and a security guard. The identities of the men have not been confirmed.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US bomb, likely dropped during World War II, exploded near the runway at Miyazaki Airport in southwest Japan on October 2, forcing its closure. The blast created a 7 metre-wide and 1 metre-deep crater on the taxiway, prompting authorities to shut down the runway, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/3280799/japan-shuts-regional-airport-after-likely-ww2-era-bomb-explodes-near-runway">South China Morning Post</a></em> reported.&nbsp;According to Japan's Transport Ministry, a bomb disposal team confirmed the explosion was caused by an American bomb buried beneath the surface, dating back to a wartime air raid.</p>

<p>Fortunately, no injuries were reported. The runway shutdown has led to the grounding of 87 flights but there is no danger of any further explosions. Repairs to fill the crater are expected to be completed by Thursday morning, said Japan's top government spokesperson, Yoshimasa Hayashi. The officials are also determining what caused its sudden detonation.</p>

<p>The disruption at Miyazaki Airport impacted flights operated by major carriers Japan Airlines (JAL) and All Nippon Airways (ANA), as well as other airlines. These affected flights typically connect Miyazaki with key Japanese cities, including Tokyo, Osaka, and Fukuoka, according to the airport's website. The airlines affected are working to resume normal operations as soon as possible, following the completion of repairs to the damaged taxiway.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, unexploded bombs remain a persistent threat. Despite being over 79 years since the war's end, multiple unexploded bombs have previously been found at Miyazaki airport, as per the transport ministry.&nbsp; In 2023 alone, the Self-Defense Forces disposed of 2,348 bombs weighing 37.5 tonnes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Originally a Japanese naval base during World War II, the Miyazaki airport has since transitioned to civilian use.&nbsp;Located in Miyazaki Prefecture, it is a regional airport serving domestic and international flights. It features one 2,500-meter runway and a single terminal handling both domestic and international operations. Major airlines such as Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways, and Solaseed Air operate from Miyazaki, connecting passengers to key destinations like Tokyo, Osaka, and Fukuoka, and international routes to Taiwan and South Korea.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US family's outing at Walt Disney World turned into a nightmare after their 5-year-old son collapsed while riding on one of the theme park's thrilling attractions. According to the <em>New York Post</em>, the incident took place on September 21. Ernesto Tagle, 5, stopped breathing and started seizing about 20 seconds into riding an enclosed rollercoaster in Epcot. His mother, Christine, who was sitting right behind him, realised something was wrong when she couldn't feel a pulse. "I was screaming, hitting him, and saying something's wrong," she recalled.</p>

<p>In an Instagram post, the family shared that the mother performed CPR on her son once the rollercoaster ended but was quickly assisted by a passing couple, a nurse and EMT, and a Disney employee who provided an automated external defibrillator to restart the boy's heart before he was rushed to the hospital via helicopter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 5-year-old was taken to three different hospitals and underwent "test after test" before he was diagnosed with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) - a rare heart condition that can flare up during periods of extreme excitement or activity, the post said.</p>

They noted that "not all [heroes] wear capes," and called Ernesto their "miracle child."

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 37-year-old Chinese woman was fined S$5,000 (Rs&nbsp;3,26,681) by a Singaporean court for forging a medical certificate to take a nine-day leave from work. Notably,&nbsp;Su Qin, a 37-year-old software developer was employed at ETC Singapore SEC. As per a report by <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/forged-mc-death-cert-hospital-leave-chinese-national-fined-4651526#:~:text=Lydia%20Lam&amp;text=SINGAPORE%3A%20A%20woman%20was%20fined,worried%20about%20her%20mother's%20health.">Channel News Asia,</a></em> she wanted a break due to her health issues and concerns about her mother's well-being but didn't want her company to think poorly of her. Instead of taking regular leave, she opted to forge the medical certificate, which allowed her to receive hospitalization leave pay totalling S$3,541.15. She also forged her mother's death certificate to extend her stay in China and care for her ailing mother.</p>

<p>Ms Qin used Adobe Photoshop to edit a legitimate certificate, changing the hospital name to "St Luke's Hospital" and altering the dates to match her desired leave period.&nbsp;Su's plan initially worked, and she received hospitalization leave pay. However, things took a turn when she resigned on April 4, and the company's HR department reviewed her leave and benefits. They discovered the forged certificate, noticed the blurred QR code, and found the web link broken. When asked to submit an original copy, Su created a fake link and QR code and submitted a second forged medical certificate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Qi was then confronted by the HR head, fired with 24 hours' notice, and reported to the police.&nbsp;She pleaded guilty to one count of forgery, with two additional charges taken into consideration. She later compensated the company.</p>

<p>Su Qin's lawyer, Richard Lim, pleaded for a lenient fine, arguing that Su's actions weren't motivated by malice or financial gain, but rather a desperate attempt to address personal struggles.</p>

<p>"Instead, they were the impulsive decisions of an individual under immense emotional and physical strain to cope with overwhelming personal and professional stress. The accused has learned a bitter lesson and has had sleepless nights worrying about this matter. She has been terminated by both companies as a result of her wrongdoings and is currently unemployed," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Su Qin came to Singapore in 2005 as an 18-year-old scholarship recipient from the Ministry of Education. She graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from Nanyang Technological University and established a successful career as a software engineer. As the sole breadwinner for her elderly parents, she shoulders full responsibility for their well-being.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her lawyer, Mr Lim, presented these circumstances in the mitigation plea, highlighting her contributions to Singapore and her family's reliance on her.&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit to the United States, which took place at a time when the world is confronting critical geopolitical, economic, technological, and climate challenges, marked yet another milestone in the relationship between the world's two largest democracies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At a time of a swift global shift towards plurilateral approaches, the visit sought to put into action the "bold and audacious" commitments that Prime Minister Modi and U.S. President Joe Biden had made to forge one of the most defining and consequential bilateral relationships of this century.</p>

<h2><strong>A Deep Commitment</strong></h2>

<p>While the highlight of the visit was the Sixth QUAD Leaders' Summit hosted by President Biden in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, bilateral ties received a huge boost from key announcements in areas such as semiconductors, space, advanced telecommunications, artificial intelligence, quantum, biotechnology, and clean energy. These landmark initiatives demonstrate a deep commitment towards realising the ambitious goals of the US-India Comprehensive Global and Strategic Partnership.</p>

<p>The QUAD, a strategic alliance of India, the United States, Australia, and Japan with a commitment towards maintaining a free and an open Indo-Pacific, has evolved into a critical force in implementing tangible initiatives across the Pacific, Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean Region. The summit cemented cooperation across various sectors, including maritime security, health, cyber capabilities, climate security, semiconductor supply chains, and disaster preparedness. The launch of the QUAD Investors Network, designed to accelerate investments in critical and emerging technologies, coupled with the inaugural meeting of the QUAD Commerce and Industry ministers in coming months, underscores the vital role businesses are set to play within the Quad.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Chipping In</strong></h2>

<p>Most notable, however, is the establishment of the first India-US semiconductor fabrication unit, focusing on advanced sensing, communication, and power electronics. Hailed as the first-ever national security semiconductor fabrication plant, it will produce chips for military applications, not only bolstering the supply chain ecosystem but also further cementing vital India-US defence ties.</p>

<p>The success and expansion of the US-India Defense Industrial Cooperation Roadmap through India's planned procurement of 31 MQ-9B remotely piloted aircraft, enhancing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities, is another key result of Prime Minister Modi's visit. This, along with the establishment of a Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul facility for C-130J Super Hercules aircraft, and initiatives like the India-U.S. Defense Acceleration Ecosystem (INDUS-X) underscores the deepening defence partnership between the two nations, essential for addressing current and future global security challenges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET), launched in 2023 by the two countries, acts as a crucial platform guiding responsible technological development globally and secures our countries' technology supply chains. The recent meeting expanded this strategic cooperation through tangible actions, such as the mobilisation of millions of dollars in funds to support high-impact R&amp;D partnerships between US and Indian universities and research institutions in the areas of semiconductors, next-generation communication systems, biotechnology, sustainability, connected vehicles, and green technologies and intelligent transportation systems and initiatives around advanced materials, quantum, and artificial intelligence.</p>

<h2><strong>On Clean Energy</strong></h2>

<p>The newly unveiled US-India Roadmap to Build Safe and Secure Global Clean Energy Supply Chains, with a commitment to unlock over $1 billion in multilateral financing, represents another historic opportunity for both nations to lead in renewable energy transition, energy storage, and zero-emission vehicles, while collaborations under the Strategic Clean Energy Partnership to accelerate the development of supply chains for critical minerals reflects a concerted effort towards operationalising this energy partnership.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Industry across both countries has been playing a crucial role in operationalising these initiatives. While Indian companies are seeking access to investments and technologies, American companies already employing millions of Indians are keen to further dip into the vast Indian talent pool and the world's biggest market. Prime Minister Modi emphasised the enormous potential of technological collaboration in his meeting with some of America's top CEOs. This mutual growth can revolutionise the global technology landscape while driving shared India-US prosperity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, deepening relations with the United States can be central to Prime Minister Modi's vision to make India a developed nation by 2047. A bipartisan understanding of India's importance in the world makes the U.S. an important stakeholder and player in India's growth story. His latest visit not only strengthened the Quad, but also highlighted the alignment between the two nations even as it built new avenues and mechanisms of collaboration among all stakeholders. As India's largest trading partner, the United States will be instrumental in providing the capital, expertise, and market access required for India to climb the global economic ladder.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[He lifted Chen off the floor and fled the courtroom with her on his back, leaving his wife screaming.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A dramatic scene unfolded in a Chinese courtroom when a man, Li, forcibly carried his wife, Chen, out to avoid getting divorced. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3280304/china-husband-accused-abuse-flees-courtroom-wife-his-back-refusing-divorce">South China Morning Post</a></em>, Chen had filed for divorce, citing domestic violence and alleging Li's aggression when intoxicated. The couple, married for 20 years with two sons and a daughter, resides in Sichuan province. Despite Chen's claims, the court initially denied the divorce, suggesting reconciliation was possible due to their "deep emotional bond" and Li's reluctance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Chen appealed, leading to a second trial where Li's emotions got the better of him. He lifted Chen off the floor and fled the courtroom with her on his back, leaving his wife screaming. Court bailiffs swiftly intervened, reprimanding Li. Later, on September 12, Li apologized in writing, acknowledging his excesses and vowing not to repeat them.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">''In my emotional agitation, I mistakenly thought I was about to divorce the appellant, so I carried her out of the courtroom, ignoring the instructions of the judges and court officers who tried to stop my extreme actions. I now realise the seriousness of my mistake and its negative impact. I guarantee that I will never repeat this mistake in the future,'' he wrote.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the couple decided not to proceed with their divorce. Despite Chen's initial allegations of domestic violence and her appeal to end their 20-year marriage, she chose to give Li another chance.</p>

<p>The court's decision has sparked widespread concern and dissatisfaction online, with many people questioning the court's understanding of domestic violence and the legal system's handling of such cases. This isn't an isolated incident, as domestic violence remains a pervasive issue in China.&nbsp;According to the All-China Women's Federation, 30 per cent of married women reported to have experienced domestic violence and 60% of female suicides are attributed to this very issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One user said, ''If he can carry her out of the courtroom in public, what might he do in private.''</p>

<p>Another commented, ''What does it mean that the relationship has not broken down? Does it only count if someone was beaten to death?''</p>

<p>A third added, ''Oh my God! How could they not grant a divorce in this situation?''</p>

<p></p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What kinds of weapons Iran used to strike Israel on Tuesday night? Iran has an arsenal of ballistic and cruise missiles and drones, which have been used in the recent past to target Israel. It is believed nearly 200 ballistic missiles were fired by Iran on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>Let's focus on that for a moment. Now, Iran operates for starters a 300-km range missile called the Shahab-1. That's a relatively short-range missile which cannot hit Israel. It can only strike targets in a region well away from Israel.</p>

<p>Another missile is the Fateh missile which flies between 300 and 500 km. Again, that missile doesn't have the range to hit Israel.</p>

<p>The other missile is the Shahab 2, which has got longer legs - 500 km, but still out of range to hit targets in Israel.</p>

<p>The Zolfaghar missile can just about touch Israel. It has got a range of 700 km, so parts of Israel can just about be targeted by this missile.</p>

<p><strong>VIDEO</strong> | <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/iran-israel-missile-attack-iron-dome-video-israel-shoots-down-irans-onslaught-but-some-missiles-sneak-past-6699211">Iran Launching Hundreds Of Ballistic Missiles At Israel</a></p>

<p>There is a missile called Qiam-1 with a range of 750 km, or 50 km more than the Shahab-2. It is a relatively more advanced missile and can target a few more areas, but not deep inside Israel.</p>

<p>But there is the Shahab-3 with a range of 2,000 km which can quite easily strike all of Israel. In fact, it can strike many areas in the region. So that's the missile, variants of which may have been actually used in Tuesday's attacks.</p>

<p>But Israel has the world's most sophisticated ballistic missile defence systems. It's a tiered defence system, which was clearly breached last night. Videos show Iranian missiles hit Tel Aviv. Iran also released videos of the ballistic missiles being launched from its territory.</p>

<p>What we don't know is how many of these missiles hit their targets and whether some of the impacts were fragments of missiles coming down after they were intercepted by the Israeli missile shield. While we do talk about Israeli surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) being fired in defence, we really need to take a look at the distance that these interceptor SAMs travelled and the altitude they reached to take out Iranian ballistic missiles.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/vttv2vko_israel-air-defence-system_625x300_02_October_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p><strong>READ</strong> |&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/captain-aged-22-israel-says-1st-soldier-killed-in-lebanon-combat-ops-6700889">"Captain, Aged 22...": Israel Says 1st Soldier Killed In Lebanon Combat Ops</a></p>

<p>For starters, let's talk a little bit about Israel's Arrow system. It is a part of a system, so the word missile and system are used interchangeably. Now, when one talks about SAM systems, you have to talk about the range and the altitude it can reach.</p>

<p>Israel's Arrow system can intercept incoming ballistic missiles in the exosphere, just outside the atmosphere. It has a range of 2,000 to 2,400 km. It can fly to an altitude of a whopping 100 km; perhaps it's the most advanced system of its class in the world.</p>

<p>There were other systems presumably used to intercept Iranian missiles last night. Let's look at the next one, which is David's Sling system. It can fly to a range of 300 km and an altitude of about 15-odd km in making interceptions.</p>

<p>And finally, what we all talk about is the Iron Dome. It's a relatively short range missile system. In fact, when one speaks about what Israel has, people say it's the Iron Dome in action. But the Iron Dome is a part of the entire missile defence tier and the last line of defence. It can fly to an altitude of 10 km and has a range of about 70 km. It's not optimally suited to take out ballistic missiles. It is better equipped to take on short-range rockets of the type Hamas and Hezbollah have been firing.</p>

<p>Obviously, there have been breaches of the system as well. But many lives have not been lost and the damage primarily is believed to be at Israeli military bases.</p>

<p>The big question is will there be an Israeli response, and when would it happen?</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel and Hamas have been waging war since gunmen from the Palestinian militant group in the Gaza Strip stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and capturing 253 hostages, by Israeli tallies.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel and Hamas have been waging war since gunmen from the Palestinian militant group in the Gaza Strip stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and capturing 253 hostages, by Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel responded with a military offensive in Gaza in which more than 41,500 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza health authorities. Nearly the entire population of 2.3 million people in the enclave have been displaced from their homes and much of the territory has been laid to waste.</p>

<p>The Gaza war is the bloodiest episode yet in a protracted conflict between Israelis and Palestinians that has rumbled for seven decades and destabilised the Middle East.</p>

<p>Recent weeks have also seen a dramatic escalation in a related conflict across Israel's border with Lebanon, where the Iran-backed armed movement Hezbollah says it is fighting in solidarity with the Palestinians.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT ARE THE ORIGINS OF THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT?</strong></h3>

<p>The conflict pits Israeli demands for a secure homeland in what it has long regarded as a hostile Middle East against Palestinians' unrealised aspirations for a state of their own.</p>

<p>In 1947, while Palestine was under British mandate rule, the United Nations General Assembly agreed a plan to partition it into Arab and Jewish states and for international rule over Jerusalem. Jewish leaders accepted the plan, which gave them 56% of the land. The Arab League rejected the proposal.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/5ikicev_israel-palestine-map-getty_625x300_02_October_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Israel's founding father, David Ben-Gurion, proclaimed the modern state of Israel on May 14, 1948, a day before the scheduled end of British rule, establishing a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution and seeking a national home on land to which they cite ties dating to antiquity.</p>

<p>In the late 1940s, violence had been intensifying between Arabs, who comprised about two-thirds of the population, and Jews. A day after Israel was created, troops from five Arab states attacked.</p>

<p>In the war that followed, some 700,000 Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes, ending up in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, and in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Palestinians lament this as the "Nakba", or catastrophe. Israel contests the assertion that it forced out Palestinians.</p>

<p>Armistice agreements halted the fighting in 1949 but there was no formal peace. Descendants of Palestinians who stayed put in the war make up about 20% of Israel's population now.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT WARS HAVE BEEN FOUGHT SINCE THEN?</strong></h3>

<p>In 1967, Israel made a pre-emptive strike on Egypt and Syria, launching the Six-Day War. Israel captured the West Bank and Arab East Jerusalem from Jordan, the Golan Heights from Syria and the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip from Egypt.</p>

<p>A 1967 Israeli census put Gaza's population at 394,000, at least 60% of them Palestinian refugees and their descendants.</p>

<p>In 1973, Egypt and Syria attacked Israeli positions along the Suez Canal and Golan Heights, starting the Yom Kippur War. Israel pushed both armies back within three weeks.</p>

<p>Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 and thousands of Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) guerrillas under Yasser Arafat were evacuated by sea after a 10-week siege. Israeli troops pulled out of Lebanon in 2000.</p>

<p>In 2005, Israel withdrew settlers and soldiers from Gaza. Hamas won parliamentary elections in 2006 and seized full control of Gaza in 2007. Major fighting flared between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza in 2006, 2008, 2012, 2014 and 2021.</p>

<p>In 2006, Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah militants captured two Israeli soldiers in the border region and Israel launched military action, triggering a six-week war.</p>

<p>There have also been two Palestinian intifadas, or uprisings, from 1987 to 1993 and 2000 to 2005. In the second, Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups carried out suicide bombings in Israel, and Israel conducted tank assaults and airstrikes on Palestinian cities.</p>

<p>Since then, there have been several rounds of hostilities between Israel and Hamas, which refuses to recognise Israel and is regarded as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the European Union, United States and other countries. Hamas says its armed activities are resistance against Israeli occupation.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT ATTEMPTS HAVE THERE BEEN TO MAKE PEACE?</strong></h3>

<p>In 1979, Egypt became the first Arab state to sign a peace treaty with Israel, under which the Sinai Peninsula was returned to Egyptian rule.</p>

<p>In 1993, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO leader Arafat shook hands on the Oslo Accords establishing limited Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza. In 1994, Israel signed a peace treaty with Jordan. But a summit six years later attended by Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and U.S. President Bill Clinton at Camp David failed to secure a final peace deal.</p>

<p>In 2002, a proposed Arab League plan offered Israel normal relations with all Arab countries in return for a full withdrawal from the lands it took in the 1967 Middle East war, the creation of a Palestinian state and a "just solution" for Palestinian refugees. The presentation of the plan was overshadowed by Hamas, which blew up an Israeli hotel full of Holocaust survivors during a Passover seder meal.</p>

<p>Further Palestinian-Israeli peacemaking efforts have been stalled since 2014.</p>

<p>Under U.S. President Donald Trump in 2020, Israel reached deals known as the Abraham Accords to normalise ties with several Arab states, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco.</p>

<p>Palestinians stopped dealing with the U.S. administration after Trump broke with U.S. policy by recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The Palestinians seek East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.</p>

<p>Qatar and Egypt have acted as mediators in the latest war, securing a truce late last year that lasted seven days, during which some hostages held by Hamas were exchanged for prisoners held by Israel, and more humanitarian aid flowed into Gaza.</p>

<h3><strong>WHERE DO PEACE EFFORTS STAND NOW?</strong></h3>

<p>Months of on-off talks on a further Gaza truce have so far proven fruitless, circling the same issues.</p>

<p>Above all, Hamas says it will free its remaining hostages only as part of a peace deal that ends the war. Israel says it will not end the war until Hamas is destroyed.</p>

<p>Other issues holding up a deal have included control over the border between Gaza and Egypt, the sequencing of reciprocal steps in any agreement, the number and identity of Palestinian prisoners to be released alongside Israeli hostages and free movement for Palestinians inside Gaza.</p>

<p>U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has sought a "grand bargain" in the Middle East that would include normalisation of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Riyadh says this would require progress towards creating an independent Palestinian state, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT ARE THE MAIN ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN ISSUES?</strong></h3>

<p>A two-state solution, Israeli settlements on occupied land, the status of Jerusalem, agreed borders, and the fate of Palestinian refugees.</p>

<p>Two-state solution: An agreement that would create a state for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza alongside Israel. Netanyahu says Israel must have security control over all land west of the Jordan River, which would preclude a sovereign Palestinian state.</p>

<p>Settlements: Most countries deem Jewish settlements built on land Israel captured in 1967 to be illegal. Israel disputes this and cites historical and biblical ties to the land. Continued settlement expansion is among the most contentious issues between Israel, the Palestinians and the international community.</p>

<p>Jerusalem: Palestinians want East Jerusalem, which includes the walled Old City's sites sacred to Muslims, Jews and Christians alike, to be the capital of their state. Israel says Jerusalem should remain its "indivisible and eternal" capital.</p>

<p>Israel's claim to Jerusalem's eastern part is not recognised internationally. Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital, without specifying the extent of its jurisdiction in the disputed city, and moved the U.S. Embassy there in 2018.</p>

<p>Refugees: Today about 5.6 million Palestinian refugees - mainly descendants of those who fled in 1948 - live in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in Gaza. About half of registered refugees remain stateless, according to the Palestinian foreign ministry, many living in crowded camps.</p>

<p>Palestinians have long demanded that refugees and their millions of descendants be allowed to return. Israel says any resettlement of Palestinian refugees must occur outside its borders.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Senate passed a sweeping social media safety package Tuesday that would force tech companies to do more to protect children -- the first major legislation targeting Silicon Valley in a generation.</p>

<p>Social media giants like Meta and X have been confronting a torrent of political anger for not putting in guardrails to thwart online dangers for children, including from sexual predators and teen suicide.</p>

<p>A rare sign of cross-party unity in an increasingly rancorous election year, the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) were passed in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote with just three dissenters.</p>

<p>But the bills face an uncertain path through the House of Representatives, where Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has spoken broadly in favor of the package but has not scheduled a vote.</p>

<p>"I'm proud to say today, the Senate keeps its promise to every parent who's lost a child because of the risks of social media... KOSA and COPPA will be perhaps the most important updates to federal laws protecting kids on the internet in decades, and it's a very good first step," said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.</p>

<p>The legislation was drawn up in consultation with parents of teens who had been bullied or sexually exploited but has been opposed by some free speech groups worried that it could lead to censorship.</p>

<h3><strong>'Duty of care'</strong></h3>

<p>While there is widespread agreement in a politically divided Congress on curbing the negative impacts of social media, there has never been a united path on how to go about doing so.</p>

<p>House members are on their summer recess and will almost certainly be focusing on averting a looming government shutdown when they return in September.</p>

<p>But Schumer called on the lower chamber to pass the bills immediately on its return, urging lawmakers to "seize the opportunity to send them to the president's desk."</p>

<p>The KOSA bill would establish a "duty of care" obligation on the online platforms that would demand that special provisions are in place to shield minors from toxic content.</p>

<p>Supported by Microsoft, X and Snap, the company that owns Snapchat, the legislation would require companies to give users a dedicated page to report harmful content -- including sexual exploitation, online bullying, the promotion of suicide and eating disorders.</p>

<p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave a public apology to the families of victims at the Senate Judiciary Committee in January as hostile lawmakers grilled tech CEOs over the dangers that children face on social media.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for everything you have all been through," he said. "No one should go through the things that your families have suffered."</p>

<h3><strong>Censorship fears</strong></h3>

<p>Seven LGBTQ advocacy groups withdrew initial opposition based on updates to the bill they said mitigated concerns that teens would be limited in accessing information about gender identity, sexuality and reproductive health.</p>

<p>But free speech groups including the American Civil Liberties Union have argued that the definition of harm is too broad and that it could lead to censorship.</p>

<p>COPPA would beef up privacy standards for Americans aged under 17, and outlaw advertising targeted at children and teens -- requiring companies to allow users to delete personal information.</p>

<p>"Too many kids experience relentless promotion of suicide or substance abuse material. Too many kids have their personal data collected and then used nefariously," Schumer said.</p>

<p>"With studies showing that kids today spend more time on social media than ever before, now is the moment to pass KOSA, pass COPPA, and instill guardrails that protect kids from these risks."</p>

<p>But Oregan Democrat Ron Wyden posted on X that the tweaks to KOSA "remain insufficient" and voiced fears that a hard-right future Republican administration could "still use this bill to pressure companies to censor gay, trans and reproductive health information."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza has declared the Palestinian territory a "polio epidemic area," accusing Israel's military campaign of destroying health infrastructure, which it says led to the recurrence of the virus.</p>

<p>The CPV2 strain of the virus has been detected in sewage samples collected from the southern Khan Yunis area and central governorates, the ministry said.</p>

<p>It did not say if any human cases had been detected, but said the presence of the virus "constitutes a health threat to the residents of the Gaza Strip and neighbouring countries and a setback to the global polio eradication program".</p>

<p>The wild version of the virus is now endemic only in Afghanistan and Pakistan, but a type of vaccine that contains small amounts of weakened but live polio still causes occasional outbreaks elsewhere.</p>

<p>United Nations agencies said recently that such vaccine-derived type-2 poliovirus had been detected in samples collected from sewage.</p>

<p>"The brutal Israeli aggression that deprived the people of usable water, the destruction of the sanitation infrastructure, the accumulation of tonnes of garbage and a lack of food security" had led to the recurrence of the virus, the ministry said.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the World Health Organisation said it was "looking at a very problematic situation".</p>

<p>"Having vaccine-derived poliovirus in the sewage very likely means that it's out there somewhere in people," WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told journalists.</p>

<p>"But again, about 75 percent of people infected by polio don't even show any symptoms.</p>

<p>"That means it most likely is in the population but it doesn't necessarily mean that we see an outbreak of cases."</p>

<p>He said a campaign to distribute vaccines across the Gaza Strip was needed.</p>

<p>"It's not enough just to get it (the vaccine) into Ben Gurion airport and then hopefully get it into Gaza. It needs to reach people," Lindmeier said.</p>

<p>Israel's bombardments and ground assault has devastated swathes of Gaza, displacing the vast majority of its 2.4 million population.</p>

<p>The war in Gaza began after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, which resulted in the death of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Hamas also seized 251 people, 111 still held captive in Gaza, including 39 who the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's campaign has killed 39,400 people so far in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, which does not provide details of civilian and operative deaths.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Air Canada flight from Morocco to Montreal was cancelled on Friday morning following an altercation between a passenger and a flight attendant. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/29/world-news/air-canada-flight-canceled-after-flight-attendant-goes-berserk-when-passenger-asks-for-blanket/">New York Post</a></em>, the argument occurred when a passenger requested a blanket due to excessive air conditioning, which enraged the flight attendant. She yelled at the passenger, called the police, and asked the passenger to disembark.</p>

<p>The flight attendant was heard shouting in French, ''You will behave or we will get off! I'll tell the captain right away. Yes or no?''&nbsp;</p>

<p>When a passenger asked the flight attendant to call the captain, she refused and said, ''I don't want any bullying against my crew.'' She then stormed up the aisle, turned around and shouted, ''Everyone behaves! Be quiet … or you're getting off.''</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The man who tried to assassinate Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump appears to have posted violent antisemitic and anti-immigration content online as a teenager, a senior FBI official told a U.S. Senate hearing on Tuesday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The man who tried to assassinate Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump appears to have posted violent antisemitic and anti-immigration content online as a teenager, a senior FBI official told a U.S. Senate hearing on Tuesday.</p>

<p>FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate at the hearing revealed the existence of the social media account, which dated to 2019-2020 - when Thomas Crooks, who authorities have identified as the shooter, would have been 15 or 16 years old. It is some of the first evidence to become public about a potential motive in the July 13 attack at a campaign rally in western Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>"Something just very recently uncovered that I want to share is a social media account which is believed to be associated with the shooter in about the 2019-2020 time frame," Abbate told lawmakers, adding that more than 700 comments were posted by the account.</p>

<p>"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature," Abbate said.</p>

<p>Crooks, who was 20, shot at Trump with an AR-15-style rifle during the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, wounding the former president's ear, killing one rally attendee and wounding two others. Secret Service snipers killed Crooks after he opened fire.</p>

<p>Investigators have described Crooks as a loner with no close friends and a social network limited mainly to immediate family members.</p>

<p>The first shooting of a U.S. president or major party candidate in more than four decades was a glaring security lapse that led last week to former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle's resignation under bipartisan congressional pressure.</p>

<p>Her immediate successor, Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe, told lawmakers that he visited the outdoor rally site in Butler and climbed onto the roof of a nearby building from which Crooks fired.</p>

<p>"What I saw made me ashamed," Rowe told a joint hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary Committees. "As a career law enforcement officer, and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured."</p>

<p>Rowe sought to assure lawmakers that he has since taken steps to prevent similar lapses from occurring amid concerns among both Democrats and Republicans about further political violence as the campaign intensifies ahead of the Nov. 5 U.S. election.</p>

<p>Crooks flew a drone near the rally site ahead of his assassination attempt, a flight that officials failed to detect because a system designed to detect drones was not working properly due to problems with cellular network bandwidth, Rowe said.</p>

<p>The Secret Service, a federal law enforcement agency whose duties including protecting the president and certain other top political figures, has added six people to its protection list since July 13, including Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance and his family and independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, while reinforcing security details, Rowe said.</p>

<p>"This attack was a shocking reminder that the threat of political violence is alive and well in our country. By all accounts, this was inexcusable security, and planning failure," Democratic Senate Homeland Security Chairman Gary Peters said, adding that his panel is working on reforms to strengthen security protocols for the Secret Service.</p>

<p>Senator Rand Paul, the committee's top Republican, said his staff had found communication gaps between local police who first noticed Crooks and the Secret Service.</p>

<p>Rowe said that Secret Service counter snipers and members of the Trump security detail had no knowledge that there was a man with a firearm on the roof of a nearby building.</p>

<p>The attempted assassination is the topic of multiple investigations by House and Senate committees, as well as a new bipartisan task force</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Army has stopped paying wages and allowances to a U.S. soldier sentenced last month to nearly four years in a Russian penal colony and may prosecute him if he returns to the United States, U.S. officials said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Army has stopped paying wages and allowances to a U.S. soldier sentenced last month to nearly four years in a Russian penal colony and may prosecute him if he returns to the United States, U.S. officials said.</p>

<p>Gordon Black, a 34-year-old staff sergeant, was convicted in Russia of theft and threatening murder. But he broke a series of Army rules first, traveling to Russia without U.S. military authorization, and flying through China to get there.</p>

<p>He was also having an extramarital affair - prohibited in the U.S. military - with a Russian woman named Alexandra Vashchuk, who he met during a deployment in South Korea. During leave from the military, Black followed her to Russia's far eastern city of Vladivostok, where she reported him to the police after an argument.</p>

<p>A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, drew a comparison to the case of U.S. Army Private Travis King, who last year ran into North Korea and was taken into custody there. Once the United States secured his release, King was charged in October by the Army with crimes including desertion.</p>

<p>"When Black is back in the United States, there will be probably consequences, just as Private King is experiencing consequences for essentially unacceptable behavior," the official said.</p>

<p>"So the Army is going to do the right thing in terms of punishing bad behavior."</p>

<p>Black's case created another headache for U.S. officials already coping with several high-profile detentions in Russia, including Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan.</p>

<p>Russia's Foreign Ministry has said the case was not political and the U.S. military has not weighed in on the substance of the charges against Black in Russia.</p>

<p>Black was arrested in Vladivostok in May after he and Vashchuk had an argument, and on June 19 a Russian judge found Black guilty of stealing $10,000 rubles ($116) from his girlfriend's purse and threatening to kill her. He pleaded not guilty to threatening to kill Vashchuk but admitted he took the money and said he did so out of necessity.</p>

<p>His defense lawyer in Russia, who has said she will appeal the verdict, was not immediately reachable for comment.</p>

<p>The violations of Army rules present a quandary for the U.S. military, given the high-profile nature of Black's arrest and the fact he has a wife and daughter near Fort Cavazos in Texas who depended on benefits, including a portion of his housing allowance.</p>

<p>In May, the military quietly decided to stop paying Black his wages and housing allowance, Army officials told Reuters.</p>

<h3><strong>Controversial Decision</strong></h3>

<p>An Army spokesperson told Reuters Black's status was now CCA, or "Confined Civilian Authority," and that he is being kept on active duty without pay or allowances. The Army is maintaining medical benefits and base privileges for Black's family members.</p>

<p>Franklin Rosenblatt, an associate professor at Mississippi College School of Law and former Army Judge Advocate General, suggested the decision to change Black's status to CCA would be routine, if he were detained in the United States.</p>

<p>But assigning that status to him in Russia could be controversial, Rosenblatt said.</p>

<p>"There's a concern here that we may be giving legitimacy to the proceedings conducted in Russia with how we reflect his duty and pay status," he said, when informed by Reuters about Black's CCA status.</p>

<p>The U.S. military is not providing Black with any special military counsel, the Army has said.</p>

<p>Black's wife and mother, in interviews with Reuters, have portrayed a sometimes violent relationship between Black and his girlfriend.</p>

<p>His wife Megan recounted a time that Black's girlfriend stabbed him during a drunken video-call from Seoul with his daughter back in Texas.</p>

<p>Black's mother, Melody Jones, said he had followed his girlfriend to Russia even though they "fought like cats and dogs."</p>

<p>In Russia, prosecutors said that during an argument at Vashchuk's apartment, Black had grabbed her by the neck before taking her money. Black argued that Vashchuk had drunk half a bottle of vodka that day, was aggressive and had struck him.</p>

<p>Rosenblatt said while the Army might want to prosecute him now, it may opt against doing so if Black were to end up serving his entire sentence of three years and nine months in a Russian penal colony.</p>

<p>"What happened to him there (Russia) and serving that sentence, it does not entitle him automatically to confinement credit, but ... that may be a strong reason to grant leniency," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel and Hezbollah exchanged deadly fire on Tuesday, following a rocket attack from Lebanon on the Golan Heights that killed 12 children over the weekend and sent regional tensions soaring.</p>

<p>The strike on the Druze Arab town of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights on Saturday, whose victims were aged between 10 and 16, was blamed by Israel and the United States on Lebanon's Hezbollah, but the Iran-backed group has denied any connection to the attack.</p>

<p>During a visit Monday to Majdal Shams, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed a "severe response", raising fears yet again that the Gaza war could spill over into a wider regional conflagration, despite international appeals for calm.</p>

<p>Israeli medics on Tuesday said one civilian, a 30-year-old man, was killed following a rocket attack on the northern kibbutz of HaGoshrim.</p>

<p>The Israeli army meanwhile reported its forces were "striking the sources of fire", which were in Lebanon.</p>

<p>It had said earlier that it struck around 10 Hezbollah targets overnight in seven different areas of south Lebanon, killing one fighter from the Iran-backed group.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said on Tuesday that it had fired a salvo of Katyusha rockets at a military headquarters in the village of Beit Hillel, in response to "the Israeli enemy's attack on the town of Jibchit, which resulted in civilian casualties".</p>

<p>Lebanon's official National News Agency had reported a strike in the Jibchit area that caused "major damage".</p>

<h3><strong>'Constant anxiety'</strong></h3>

<p>Hezbollah has been exchanging near-daily fire with Israel in solidarity with its ally Hamas since war erupted in Gaza in October.</p>

<p>At least 531 people have been killed on the Lebanese side, according to an AFP tally. Most have been fighters, but the toll includes at least 105 civilians.</p>

<p>The violence has so far killed 22 soldiers and 25 civilians on the Israeli side, including in the Golan Heights, according to army figures.</p>

<p>Lebanon has been bracing for major retaliatory strikes following the Golan attack, amid international efforts to defuse tensions.</p>

<p>But Druze residents of the town -- the vast majority of whom have rejected Israeli citizenship and identify as Syrians -- have rejected threats of retaliation for the deadly strike.</p>

<p>Scores of Majdal Shams residents had come out to protest Netanyahu's visit after the burial of the last of the victims of the rocket strike.</p>

<p>A paramedic from Majdal Shams, Nabih Abu Saleh, told AFP his community was "against any Israeli response", and asked: "Who will we strike? Our people in Syria and Lebanon?"</p>

<p>A French diplomat told AFP that Paris "alongside other partners, notably the United States, is making all-out efforts to call on the parties to exercise restraint and not to be drawn into spiralling violence".</p>

<p>Lebanon's Middle East Airlines chairman Mohammed al-Hout said Beirut airport, its only international facility, "is not exposed to any threat, it is supposed to be a neutral place", state media reported.</p>

<p>Multiple international airlines have suspended flights to Beirut amid Israel's promises of retaliation.</p>

<p>The Lebanese public, meanwhile, has been gripped by worry, with mother of two Cosette Beshara describing living "in a state of constant anxiety".</p>

<p>"I'm always thinking about how I will escape with my children if war breaks out," said the 40-year-old, adding that "life goes on in Lebanon... but always with a looming state of anxiety."</p>

<h3><strong>Khan Younis operation</strong></h3>

<p>The Hamas attack on southern Israel that started the war resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Operatives also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,400 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, which does not provide details on civilian and operatives deaths.</p>

<p>Fighting has meanwhile raged on unabated in the besieged Gaza Strip, with the territory's civil defence agency saying on Tuesday that around 300 people had been killed in the southern city of Khan Younis during an Israeli operation there that began on July 22.</p>

<p>"Since the beginning of the Israeli ground invasion of the eastern part of Khan Younis province, the civil defence and medical teams have recovered approximately 300 bodies of martyrs, many of them decomposed," agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP.</p>

<p>The military meanwhile said it had completed its operation in the Khan Younis area, which had seen heavy fighting earlier this year, and had killed "over 150 terrorists".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Iranian reformist president Masoud Pezeshkian was sworn before parliament on Tuesday as the Islamic republic's ninth president at a ceremony attended by foreign dignitaries.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iranian reformist president Masoud Pezeshkian was sworn before parliament on Tuesday as the Islamic republic's ninth president at a ceremony attended by foreign dignitaries.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian won a runoff race against ultraconservative Saeed Jalili on July 5 to replace president Ebrahim Raisi who died in a helicopter crash in May.</p>

<p>Tuesday's ceremony came two days after Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei officially endorsed Pezeshkian and gave the 69-year-old heart surgeon presidential powers.</p>

<p>"I as the president, in front of the Holy Koran and the people of Iran, swear to almighty God to be the guardian of the official religion and the Islamic Republic system and the constitution of the country," Pezeshkian said at the ceremony which was broadcast live on state TV.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian, who is expected to unveil his government within two weeks, had secured more than 16 million votes during the runoff, or about 54 percent of the roughly 30 million ballots cast.</p>

<p>Iran's presidential election took place against a backdrop of heightened regional tensions since the Gaza war began in early October, disputes with Western powers over Iran's nuclear programme and domestic discontent over the state of the sanctions-hit economy.</p>

<p>Tuesday's ceremony was attended by senior officials from several countries including Armenia, Tajikistan, Egypt, Sudan, Iraq, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Azerbaijan, Cuba and Brazil.</p>

<p>European Union envoy Enrique Mora was also present.</p>

<p>Regional Iran-backed allies were also in attendance, namely Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and the head of the Islamic Jihad Ziyad al-Nakhalah.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Hezbollah movement was represented by the group's deputy secretary general Naim Qassem while the Yemen's Huthi rebels sent spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam.</p>

<h3><strong>'Death to Israel'</strong></h3>

<p>Haniyeh and Nakhalah, whose groups have been fighting Israel in the Gaza Strip since Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, met with Khamenei and Pezeshkian.</p>

<p>"Supporting the cause of the oppressed Palestinian nation will continue with strength, and no factor can disrupt our will in this direction," said Pezeshkian in a Monday statement.</p>

<p>Tuesday's swearing-in ceremony came amid concerns of war between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah following a rocket attack from Lebanon Saturday on the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights.</p>

<p>Israel has accused Hezbollah of responsibility for the attack that killed 12 children but the Iran-backed Lebanese group has denied any involvement.</p>

<p>During Tuesday's ceremony, parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf gave a speech lambasting what he called Israel's "crimes" in Gaza.</p>

<p>Some Iranians present in parliament chanted: "Death to Israel, Death to America."</p>

<p>Iran has made support for the Palestinian cause a centrepiece of its foreign policy since the 1979 Islamic revolution, and hailed Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.</p>

<p>Iran's president is not head of state, and the ultimate authority rests with the supreme leader -- a post held by Khamenei for the last 35 years.</p>

<p>On Monday, Pezeshkian warned Israel against attacking Lebanon, saying such an act would have "heavy consequences".</p>

<p>Since his election, Iran's new president has reaffirmed support for the so-called "axis of resistance", Tehran-aligned groups such as Hezbollah and the Huthis, that support Hamas against arch-foe Israel.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian was the only candidate representing Iran's reformist camp allowed to stand in Iran's presidential election, for which all contenders were approved by the conservative-dominated Guardian Council.</p>

<p>During his campaign, the former health minister, had vowed to try and revive a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers which collapsed in 2018 after the United States unilaterally withdrew from agreement.</p>

<p>The deal had given Iran sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear activity.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian has recently called for "constructive relations" with European countries, even though he accused them of reneging on commitments to mitigate the impact of renewed US sanctions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New demonstrations were expected in Venezuela on Tuesday, after four people died and dozens were injured when the authorities broke up protests against President Nicolas Maduro's claim of victory in a hotly disputed election.</p>

<p>Security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets Monday at angry protesters challenging the official results, which were questioned by the opposition and neighboring countries.</p>

<p>Thousands of people flooded the streets of several neighborhoods in the capital Caracas, chanting "Freedom, freedom!" and "This government is going to fall!"</p>

<p>Some ripped down and burned Maduro campaign posters while at least two statues of Hugo Chavez -- the late authoritarian socialist who led Venezuela for more than a decade and handpicked Maduro as his successor -- were knocked down by protesters.</p>

<p>In addition to the deaths, 44 were reported injured, according to the National Hospital Survey, a network that monitors crises in the country's hospitals</p>

<p>Two of the dead were in the state of Aragua and one in Caracas, the network said. The NGO Foro Penal meanwhile reported one more dead in the northwestern state of Yaracuy.</p>

<p>Amid growing fears of violence, a leading figure in the opposition coalition, Freddy Superlano, was "kidnapped" by black-clad officials, his Voluntad Popular said on X.</p>

<h3><strong>Fears of fraud</strong></h3>

<p>The elections were held amid widespread fears of fraud by the government and a campaign tainted by accusations of political intimidation.</p>

<p>The National Electoral Council (CNE) certified the reelection of Maduro, 61, to another six-year term until 2031, with the president winning 51.2 percent of votes cast compared to 44.2 percent for Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia.</p>

<p>But opposition leader Maria Corina Machado told reporters that a review of available voting records clearly showed that the next president "will be Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia," who replaced her on the ballot after she was barred from running by Maduro-aligned courts.</p>

<p>The records showed a "mathematically irreversible" lead for Gonzalez Urrutia, she said, with 6.27 million votes to Maduro's 2.75 million.</p>

<p>The Organization of American States, a regional body, charged Tuesday there was "exceptional manipulation" of the election results that handed Maduro his win.</p>

<p>Machado called for families to turn out Tuesday for "popular assemblies" nationwide to show support for a peaceful transition of power.</p>

<p>Maduro's campaign manager Jorge Rodriguez, also called on X for "large marches starting this Tuesday to celebrate the victory."</p>

<p>In Caracas on Monday, AFP observed members of the national guard firing tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters, some wearing motorbike helmets and bandanas tied over their faces. Some responded by throwing rocks.</p>

<p>Protests were reported even in poor areas of Caracas that had been bastions of support for Maduro. Shots were heard in some areas.</p>

<p>The United Nations, United States, European Union and several Latin American countries called for a "transparent" process, while allies including China, Russia and Cuba congratulated Maduro.</p>

<p>Nine Latin American countries called in a joint statement for a "complete review of the results with the presence of independent electoral observers." Chile's president said the outcome was "hard to believe."</p>

<p>Amid the tensions, Peru recalled its ambassador and Panama said it was suspending relations with Venezuela. Caracas meanwhile said it was withdrawing diplomatic staff from Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Panama, Peru, the Dominican Republic and Uruguay.</p>

<h3><strong>'Bloodbath' warning</strong></h3>

<p>Independent polls had predicted Maduro would lose Sunday's vote.</p>

<p>He has been at the helm of the once-wealthy oil-rich country since 2013. Amid US sanctions and economic mismanagement, the past decade has seen GDP drop by 80 percent, pushing more than seven million of Venezuela's 30 million citizens to emigrate.</p>

<p>Maduro is accused of locking up critics and harassing the opposition in a climate of rising authoritarianism.</p>

<p>In the run-up to the election, he warned of a "bloodbath" if he lost.</p>

<p>Sunday's election was the product of a deal reached last year between the government and opposition.</p>

<p>That agreement led the United States to temporarily ease sanctions imposed after Maduro's 2018 reelection, rejected as a sham by dozens of Latin American and other countries.</p>

<p>Sanctions were snapped back after Maduro reneged on agreed conditions.</p>

<p>Venezuela boasts the world's largest oil reserves but production capacity has been severely diminished in recent years.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Kremlin on Tuesday dismissed as absurd U.S. intelligence assertions that Russia is seeking to meddle in the presidential election and said that U.S. spies were intent on casting Russia as an enemy.</p>

<p>U.S. intelligence officials have said that Russia is seeking to influence the November election, and that Moscow has used Russia-based influence-for-hire companies to shape U.S. public opinion.</p>

<p>"As for these accusations, they are absurd, and we strongly reject them," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said when asked about the reports from Washington.</p>

<p>"There will be a lot of such statements as the U.S. elections approach because Russia and the head of the Russian state personally are essentially significant factors that both Republicans and Democrats exploit during their political struggle, especially in the election campaign," said Peskov.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The lawsuit, filed in 2022, was the first major case to be brought under Texas' 2009 biometric privacy law, according to law firms tracking the litigation.

       <description><![CDATA[The U.S. Secret Service's new acting director said in prepared congressional testimony on Tuesday he was "ashamed" of a major security lapse that preceded the July 13 attempted assassination of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at a Pennsy]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Secret Service's new acting director said in prepared congressional testimony on Tuesday he was "ashamed" of a major security lapse that preceded the July 13 attempted assassination of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania campaign rally.</p>

<p>In testimony released before addressing two Senate committees, Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe said he visited the outdoor rally site in Butler and climbed onto the roof of a nearby building from which 20-year-old Thomas Crooks fired shots that wounded Trump's right ear, killed one rally attendee and wounded two others, with an AR-15-style rifle.</p>

<p>"What I saw made me ashamed," Rowe said in the prepared testimony for a joint hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary Committees. "As a career law enforcement officer, and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured."</p>

<p>Rowe's admission of a glaring security lapse came a week after former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned under bipartisan congressional pressure after refusing to detail security shortfalls in testimony before a House of Representatives panel.</p>

<p>Rowe sought to assure lawmakers that he has since taken steps to prevent similar lapses from occurring amid concerns among both Democrats and Republicans about further political violence as the campaign intensifies ahead of the Nov. 5 U.S. election.</p>

<p>"I directed our personnel to ensure every event site security plan is thoroughly vetted by multiple experienced supervisors before it is implemented," Rowe said.</p>

<p>The Secret Service, a federal law enforcement agency whose duties including protecting the president and certain other top political figures, has added six people to its protection list since July 13, including Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance and his family and independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, while reinforcing security details, Rowe said.</p>

<p>Rowe was due to testify alongside Paul Abbate, deputy director of the FBI, which is due to interview Trump on Thursday as part of its investigation into the shooting.</p>

<p>The attempted assassination is the topic of multiple investigations by House and Senate committees, as well as a new bipartisan task force established by Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries.</p>

<p>Investigators have been unable to determine a clear motive for Crooks, who they have described as a loner with no close friends and a social network limited mainly to immediate family members. Much interest revolves around the timeline from when law enforcement officials first noticed Crooks to when Secret Service snipers killed him after he opened fire.</p>

<p>The FBI said on Monday that Crooks first came to the attention of police more than an hour before he fired at least eight shots at the former president.</p>

<p>A local officer took a photo of Crooks and sent it to other law enforcement officials at the scene. About 30 minutes later, SWAT team members saw Crooks using a rangefinder and browsing news sites, the FBI said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain on Tuesday urged its citizens in Lebanon to leave the country, warning that tensions along the Israeli border could worsen quickly.</p>

<p>"There are frequent artillery exchanges and air strikes, tensions are high, and the situation could deteriorate rapidly," Foreign Secretary David Lammy told parliament.</p>

<p>"I am working with foreign office consular teams to make sure we are prepared for all scenarios, but if this conflict escalates, the government cannot guarantee we will be able to evacuate everyone immediately. People may be forced to shelter in place."</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer chaired a meeting of the government's emergency response committee, known as COBRA, on the matter earlier on Tuesday, Lammy said.</p>

<p>"My message to British nationals in Lebanon is therefore quite simple: leave," Lammy said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taylor Swift said she was "completely in shock" on Tuesday after mass stabbings in Southport, northern England, during a dance class themed around the US pop star left three girls dead.</p>

<p>Five young children and two adults remained in critical condition, with police confirming three girls aged six, seven and nine were killed in a stabbing spree at an events space in the seaside town near Liverpool.</p>

<p>The third girl, aged nine, died on Tuesday due to her injuries, while the other two died on Monday.</p>

<p>"The horror of yesterday's attack in Southport is washing over me continuously, and I'm just completely in shock," Swift wrote in an Instagram post about the incident, which also left eight others critically injured.</p>

<p>"I am at a complete loss for how to ever convey my sympathies to these families."</p>

<p>Swift fans also raised over £60,000 ($77,000) for the families of victims through a fundraiser on JustGiving.</p>

<p>Held at the start of the UK school holidays for children aged between 6 and 11, the event was a dance and yoga class with a bracelet-making activity. The organiser had posted on Facebook "Calling all Swifties!" to sign up for the workshop.</p>

<p>A fundraiser called "Swifties for Southport" was raising money for the families affected which would go to Alder Hey Children's Hospital, where some of the victims were taken by ambulance after the attack.</p>

<p>The fundraiser, made by the organisers of the Taylor Swift UK &amp; EU Facebook group, had raised £39,375 to support families and pay for the funerals of the two children who were killed.</p>

<p>"Every donation through this link goes directly to the verified charity" and will "help make a difference to those impacted in a time of great sadness", the organisers wrote on the fundraiser page.</p>

<p>A 17-year-old male was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. While the motivation of the attack was not clear, police confirmed it was not being treated as terror-related.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris launched a $50 million advertising blitz on Tuesday, capitalizing on the momentum of a fledgling campaign against Republican rival Donald Trump with a one-minute spot titled "Fearless."</p>

<p>It was Harris' first big ad buy since consolidating support for the Democratic nomination after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race on July 21 and endorsed her.</p>

<p>In addition to garnering the backing of big-money donors, Harris has sparked newfound energy among groups such as young voters that Biden had been struggling to win over.</p>

<p>Public opinion polls in the last week have shown Harris, 59, closing the gap with 78-year-old Trump, who still leads in some national surveys.</p>

<p>The ads will be rolled out on television as well as streaming and social channels across election battleground states in the weeks before the Democratic National Convention that starts on Aug. 19.</p>

<p>The first ad in the campaign begins with images of Harris as a little girl and follows her progression to a prosecutor, attorney general and U.S. vice president. "The one thing Kamala Harris has always been: fearless," the ad says.</p>

<p>Since stepping into her new role, Harris has focused on Trump's felony convictions in a hush-money trial involving a porn star and the other criminal charges he faces, and portrayed him as responsible for a wave of anti-abortion measures in Republican-led states around the country.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign's ad buy dwarfed the $10 million advertising buy announced by Trump's campaign on Monday, to be launched in six battleground states this week as it tries to counter a surge of voter enthusiasm and donations for Harris.</p>

<p>That was Trump's biggest ad buy since January.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaza's civil defence agency said Tuesday that an Israeli operation in and around the territory's second city of Khan Younis killed about 300 people since it began last week, while the army said it had "eliminated 150 terrorists".</p>

<p>"Since the beginning of the Israeli ground invasion of the eastern part of Khan Younis province, the civil defence and medical teams have recovered approximately 300 bodies of martyrs, many of them decomposed," agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP.</p>

<p>The Israeli military launched the assault on July 22 to halt rocket fire from the area, which already saw heavy fighting earlier this year.</p>

<p>Last week, it said troops had retrieved the bodies of five Israelis from the area.</p>

<p>They had been killed during the Hamas attacks of October 7 and their bodies taken back to Gaza, the military said.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the military said it had completed the operation in the area of Khan Younis and had killed "over 150 terrorists".</p>

<p>It said troops also "dismantled terror tunnels, weapons storage facilities, and terrorist infrastructure and located weapons".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance described the last-minute entry of Kamala Harris into the US presidential race as a "sucker punch," according to a recording of his remarks at a fundraiser obtained by The Washington Post.</p>

<p>In remarks contrasting with his campaign's public messaging -- but revealing the upheaval in a race that had seemed set to feature Donald Trump against Joe Biden -- Vance told donors over the weekend that "all of us were hit with a little bit of a political sucker punch."</p>

<p>The Vance-Trump campaign has insisted that the Democratic vice president's entry into the race won't upend their strategy, and that Harris is tied to her boss Biden's policies.</p>

<p>"Nothing fundamentally changes," senior Trump advisor Jason Miller told AFP at the Republican National Convention earlier this month, as speculation was brewing that Biden might drop out.</p>

<p>"Whether it's Joe Biden or Kamala Harris, or any other radical liberal Democrats, they all share responsibility for the failure of destroying our economy and ruining our borders."</p>

<p>But Vance reportedly warned that "Harris does not have the same baggage as Joe Biden, because whatever we might have to say, Kamala is a lot younger."</p>

<p>"And Kamala Harris is obviously not struggling in the same ways that Joe Biden did."</p>

<p>Harris has emerged as the all-but-sure Democratic nominee after 81-year-old Biden's shock decision to step away from his reelection bid, dogged by concerns over his age and mental acuity.</p>

<p>The decision threw the US presidential race into uncharted waters, as Harris, Biden's vice president, sprints toward the November 5 vote on a drastically shortened timeline.</p>

<p>But her entry has also sparked enthusiasm among a vast swath of voters who had soured on a Biden-Trump rematch -- and cements 78-year-old Trump, prone to his own rambling and confusing speeches, as the oldest ever US presidential nominee.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least five Russian political prisoners have been moved from jails and prison colonies in recent days, in an apparently coordinated move that has raised speculation of a possible prisoner exchange.</p>

<p>Russia has sentenced dozens to lengthy terms of incarceration for opposing the Kremlin and Moscow's military offensive against Ukraine.</p>

<p>Prison transfers are notoriously murky in Russia, with family and lawyers provided no details and prisoners often losing contact with the outside world for weeks.</p>

<p>But they usually occur after a conviction or lost appeal, and the disappearance of several high-profile political prisoners at once is extremely rare.</p>

<p>"Apparently, we are on the cusp of a very large-scale exchange," Russian political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya said Tuesday on Telegram.</p>

<p>Lawyers for jailed opposition politician Ilya Yashin said on Tuesday he had been moved from his penal colony in the western region of Smolensk, where he was serving eight and a half years for breaching Russia's military censorship laws.</p>

<p>"Ilya Yashin was sent from the colony to an unknown destination," said his Telegram channel, which is run by his lawyers and supporters.</p>

<p>Two aides of late opposition leader Alexei Navalny -- Lilia Chanysheva and Ksenia Fadeyeva -- also disappeared from their prison colonies in recent days.</p>

<p>They ran regional headquarters for Navalny and were sentenced on "extremism" charges.</p>

<p>Chanysheva's husband said on X that she had been moved from her prison in Siberia on July 26.</p>

<p>In the case of Fadeyeva, prison officials in Novosibirsk "refused to answer her lawyer's questions about where she was taken to, when, and what it was in connection with", her allies wrote on Monday on Telegram.</p>

<p>Supporters for artist Alexandra Skochilenko, jailed for seven years for replacing supermarket price tags with messages opposing the Ukraine offensive, also said she had been moved from a jail in Saint Petersburg.</p>

<p>And rights campaigner Oleg Orlov, a key figure in the Nobel-winning Memorial group, was similarly moved from his detention centre, his lawyers said on Monday.</p>

<p>He was still contesting his conviction of two and a half years for "discrediting" the Russian army, Memorial said in a social media post.</p>

<p>The United States and Moscow have both said they are actively discussing an exchange for US journalist Evan Gershkovich -- convicted in a fast-track trial earlier this month to 16 years for spying in a case rejected as a "sham" by his employer and the White House.</p>

<p>After Navalny's death in an Arctic prison colony in February, President Vladimir Putin said he had given approval for talks on releasing him as part of a deal with the West.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Flowers, teddy bears and tributes were left near the scene of Monday's stabbing spree at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport, near Liverpool, that also saw two adults and six children critically injured and three more children hurt.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK police on Tuesday questioned a 17-year-old suspect arrested after a "ferocious" knife attack which killed three children and critically injured eight others.</p>

<p>Flowers, teddy bears and tributes were left near the scene of Monday's stabbing spree at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport, near Liverpool, that also saw two adults and six children critically injured and three more children hurt.</p>

<p>Police chief Serena Kennedy said the two adults were trying to protect the children, aged between six and 11.</p>

<p>Swift on Tuesday said she was "completely in shock".</p>

<p>"The loss of life and innocence, and the horrendous trauma inflicted on everyone who was there, the families, and first responders. These were just little kids at a dance class. I am at a complete loss for how to ever convey my sympathies to these families," she said.</p>

<p>Residents of Southport, a small seaside town popular with visitors in the summer, were still coming to terms with the attack.</p>

<p>"I'm just still in total shock -- I just cannot believe that it happened so close to home," Leanne Hassan told reporters on Tuesday.</p>

<p>She had rushed to collect her daughter from a nearby nursery which was locked down after the attack.</p>

<p>Her daughter was safe, "but unfortunately that's not the reality for a lot of parents waking up today," she added.</p>

<p>Police chief Kennedy confirmed the attack was not being treated as terror-related and that the attacker's motivation was unclear.</p>

<h3><strong>Establishing motive</strong></h3>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the events were "just truly awful, the whole country is deeply shocked".</p>

<p>"It is almost impossible to imagine the grief," he added.</p>

<p>Interior minister Yvette Cooper visited Southport Tuesday to meet Kennedy and other officials, with an evening vigil to be held for the victims.</p>

<p>Starmer is likely to visit the community as well, Chancellor Rachel Reeves told Sky News.</p>

<p>The 17-year-old male arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder is from a neighbouring village called Banks and was born in the Welsh capital Cardiff, Merseyside Police said.</p>

<p>Witnesses told UK media the attacker was seen arriving at the scene in a taxi, and that he entered the venue wearing a mask.</p>

<p>Police said officers were called to the incident shortly before 1100 GMT on Monday, just minutes before the dance event was scheduled to end.</p>

<p>Armed officers detained the suspect nearby and seized a knife.</p>

<p>The suspect was in custody at a police station Tuesday and police said enquiries were ongoing "to establish the motive for this tragic incident".</p>

<p>Targeted attacks on children are extremely rare in the UK.</p>

<h3><strong>Horror movie</strong></h3>

<p>Monday's incident evoked memories of a school massacre in the Scottish town of Dunblane in 1996, which claimed the lives of 16 young pupils and their teacher in Britain's worst mass shooting.</p>

<p>The North West Ambulance Service said it treated 11 casualties with stab injuries, who were then taken by ambulance and helicopter to Alder Hey Children's Hospital and other hospitals in the area.</p>

<p>Local business owner Colin Parry, one of the people who called police, told the Press Association (PA) news agency that he believed several "young girls" had been stabbed.</p>

<p>A member of his staff also saw "about 10 kids go running past him, all bleeding, and one of them collapsed on the floor outside the neighbour next door," he recounted.</p>

<p>Bare Varathan, who owns a local shop, told PA he saw "seven to 10 kids" who were "injured, bleeding".</p>

<p>Other witnesses told UK media they heard screams, comparing the attack to a scene from a horror film.</p>

<p>King Charles III offered his "most heartfelt condolences, prayers and deepest sympathies" and called the incident "utterly horrific".</p>

<p>Prince William and his wife Katherine posted on X that "as parents, we cannot begin to imagine what the families, friends and loved ones of those killed and injured in Southport today are going through", calling it a "heinous attack".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Apple Vision Pro is the <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/newsroom/2024/06/apple-vision-pro-is-available-to-pre-order/#:%7E:text=Starting%20today%2C%20customers%20can%20visit,Australia%20beginning%20Friday%2C%20July%2012.">newest</a> tool for Australians to access three-dimensional, immersive online environments, also known as the metaverse. Released in Australia earlier this month, it allows users to take a (virtual) walk in the savanna from their living room, watch sports matches in an immersive environment, or even buy a house after completing a virtual inspection.</p>

<p>But these new online environments also have the potential to enable new crimes.</p>

<p><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-023-05045-1">Metacrimes</a> are those crimes occurring in the metaverse. They challenge our definitions of crimes in the digital realm, because they do not fit into existing frameworks of reporting and investigating crime.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://researchoutput.csu.edu.au/en/publications/metacrime-and-cybercrime-exploring-the-convergence-and-divergence">new study</a> tackles this problem by shedding light on the key characteristics of metacrimes. And by understanding these crimes better, we will be better able to fight them.</p>

<h2>Metaverse, metacrime and cybercrime</h2>

<p>The metaverse is a loose term describing a kind of three-dimensional, virtual world that users access via a virtual reality headset.</p>

<p>The 2018 movie Ready Player One provides a good visualisation of what the metaverse might look like. In the movie, people put on special goggles and pick their avatar to enter a massive, interactive digital universe where they can do almost anything.</p>

<p>Our research found crimes committed in the metaverse have commonalities with conventional cybercrime. For example, both involve different kinds of illegal activities happening online or in virtual spaces. As technology gets better, these crimes are also becoming more global and anonymous. This makes it near impossible to catch the perpetrators.</p>

<p>But we also found a number of metacrime features that do not overlap with conventional cybercrime.</p>

<h2>The unique features of metacrimes</h2>

<p>One such feature is immersive VR attacks, which are made to feel real through <a href="https://digitalcommons.lmunet.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1190&amp;context=lmulrev">immersion and spatial presence</a>.</p>

<p>Immersion is created through a number of sensory techniques in the headset, including visual, sound and haptic (touch). This creates a feeling of spatial presence that allows the user to perceive and experience the virtual space as real. This means negative experiences such as sexual violence and harassment also feel real.</p>

<p>Unless you are constantly recording your interactions in the metaverse via your headset, crucial evidence of that unpleasant interaction would not be captured. Some companies have created user controls, such as a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-owner-meta-adds-tool-guard-against-harassment-metaverse-2022-02-04/">safety bubble</a> that can be activated around your avatar. However, we do not yet have sufficient research to know whether these are effective.</p>

<figure><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/edc05hUfwQ8?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" width="650"></iframe>

<figcaption><span class="caption">Metaverse: Why it's already unsafe for women.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Our study argues the impact of metacrimes will also be exacerbated for vulnerable populations, especially children who occupy a large proportion of active metaverse users. Difficulties in verifying children's age online add extra concerns about grooming and minor abuse.</p>

<p>These risks are not hypothetical.</p>

<p>In 2022, researchers from the Center for Countering Digital Hate conducted 11 hours and 30 minutes of recorded user interactions on Meta's Oculus headset in the popular VRChat. They <a href="https://counterhate.com/research/facebooks-metaverse/">found</a> that users, including children, encounter abusive behaviour approximately every seven minutes.</p>

<p>Bullying and sexual harassment was also rife, and minors were often manipulated into using racist slurs and promoting extremist ideas.</p>

<figure><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sUHugSKBryw?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" width="650"></iframe>

<figcaption><span class="caption">Sexual harassment in the metaverse is one of many safety concerns.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In January 2024, police in the United Kingdom launched the first case of rape in the metaverse after a 16-year-old girl's avatar was attacked. Police <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/05/metaverse-sexual-assault-vr-game-online-safety-meta">reported</a> the victim suffered psychological and emotional trauma, similar to an attack in the physical world.</p>

<p>The outcomes of the case are currently pending and are likely to set a legal precedent for the protection of minors in the metaverse. At the moment, metacrime presents new challenges in defining, measuring and pursuing avatars' liability that conventional cybercrime does not usually confront.</p>

<p>We also found other risks including hacking and recording of a person's environment. Manipulation of VR technologies, such as haptic suites that enable users to physically engage with virtual spaces, also enable perpetrators to inflict direct physical harm on users.</p>

<p>This can include inflicting <a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-vestibular-research/ves00462">visual vertigo</a>, <a href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0033-1354602">motion sickness</a>, and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94680-w">neurologic symptoms</a>.</p>

<h2>Where to from here?</h2>

<p>Major tech companies such as Apple, Meta and Microsoft are <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666281723001208?via%3Dihub#bib10">investing</a> heavily in the metaverse, developing both hardware and software to enhance their platforms. Research firm Gartner <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-02-07-gartner-predicts-25-percent-of-people-will-spend-at-least-one-hour-per-day-in-the-metaverse-by-2026">predicted</a> by 2026, 25% of people will spend at least an hour each day in the metaverse for work, shopping, education, social media and entertainment.</p>

<p>This prediction may be not too far away from reality. Australia's eSafety Commissioner's national online safety survey conducted in 2022 <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/research/the-metaverse">found</a> 49% of metaverse users said they had entered the metaverse at least once a month in the last year.</p>

<p>It is therefore urgent that governments and tech companies develop metaverse-specific legal and regulatory frameworks to safeguard immersive virtual environments. National and international legal frameworks will need to account for the new characteristics of metacrime we have identified. Law enforcement will need to <a href="https://www.interpol.int/content/download/20828/file/Metaverse%20-%20a%20law%20enforcement%20perspective.pdf">upskill</a> in metacrime reporting and investigations.</p>

<p>In the past, companies have talked about using new technologies responsibly – but <a href="https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/ps.21063.liu">haven't taken responsibility</a> when their platforms were used for crimes and harms. Instead, tech leaders deploy what researchers are now calling an “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-011-0915-9">artful apology</a>” (for example, “I'm sorry you experienced this on our platform”).</p>

<p>But this does nothing tangible to tackle the problem, and metaverse companies should instil clear regulatory frameworks for their virtual environments to make them safe for everyone to inhabit.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The once luxurious palace of Bangladesh's autocratic ex-leader Sheikh Hasina will become a museum to honour the revolution that ousted her, the leader of the caretaker government said Monday.</p>

<p>"The museum should preserve memories of her misrule and the people's anger when they removed her from power," Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus said as he toured the battered Ganabhaban palace, the former official residence of the prime minister.</p>

<p>The 84-year-old microfinance pioneer was appointed the country's "chief advisor" after the student-led uprising that forced Sheikh Hasina to flee by helicopter to India on August 5.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina's 15-year rule saw widespread human rights abuses, including the mass detention and extrajudicial killings of her political opponents, and a Bangladeshi court this month issued an arrest warrant for her arrest.</p>

<p>More than 700 people were killed, many in a brutal police crackdown, before Sheikh Hasina's fall.</p>

<p>As she fled, thousands rushed into her former residence, which the government said was a "symbol of repression".</p>

<p>The walls of the palace, looted and damaged in the chaos after Sheikh Hasina escaped, are daubed with graffiti condemning her fallen regime.</p>

<p>The museum will include a replica of the notorious "House of Mirrors" Aynaghar detention centre operated by Sheikh Hasina's regime -- given its name because its detainees were never supposed to see any other person besides themselves.</p>

<p>"The Aynaghar should remind visitors of the torture endured by secret prisoners," Muhammad Yunus said.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina's overthrow resulted in at least two days of chaos, which included the looting of a museum at the home of her father, Bangladesh's first president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.</p>

<p>Apurba Jahangir, a press official in the office of Muhammad Yunus, said construction would start by December.</p>

<p>"The museum construction hasn't begun yet, but it will start soon," Apurba told AFP.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina has not been seen in public since fleeing Bangladesh.</p>

<p>The 77-year-old's last official whereabouts was a military airbase near India's capital New Delhi.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four Indian nationals were killed and one injured when the car they were travelling in crashed and burst into flames in Canada's Ontario province, authorities said.</p>

<p>The accident occurred last week on Thursday in the Lake Shore Boulevard East and Cherry Street area of Toronto city, police said in a press release.</p>

<p>The five people, between the ages of 25-32, were travelling in a Tesla when it "lost control and struck the guard rail and then a concrete pillar" before bursting into flames, the press release said.</p>

<p>"We have gathered some evidence so far to suggest that speed was a factor," Toronto Police Duty Inspector Phillip Sinclair was quoted as saying by the Toronto Sun newspaper.</p>

<p>Four of the car occupants were pronounced dead on the scene by the police officials responding to the accident, the press release said. The fifth occupant, a 25-year-old woman, was transported to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.</p>

<p>She was rescued by a passing motorist who stopped to help, according to the report.</p>

<p>"Heartfelt condolences on tragic loss of Indian nationals in car accident that took place yesterday in Toronto," the official handle of the Indian Consulate in Toronto said in a post on X.</p>

<p>The post added that the consulate was in regular touch with local authorities and affected families in Canada and India. "All required assistance is being provided," it said.</p>

<p>Police have asked residents and drivers who may have dash camera footage or witnessed the event to contact investigators.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's not just the Harris-Trump show: US voters this November 5 will cast ballots for new members of Congress, tens of thousands of state and local officials, and in multiple referendums on topics including hot-button issues like abortion.</p>

<p>Here is a look at who and what is up for a vote beyond the choice between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris.</p>

<p><strong>Congress&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>In addition to choosing a president, millions of US voters will decide the fate of Congress: both in the House of Representatives -- where all seats are up for grabs -- and the Senate, where one-third are.</p>

<p>The House of Representatives has 435 members, with each representing a Congressional district and elected for a two-year term. Republicans hold the House by a small margin, but with Harris's entry into the race, Democrats are hoping to benefit from a surge in enthusiasm to recapture the lower house.</p>

<p>Thirty-four of the Senate's 100 seats are in play. The Senate consists of two senators from every state, who hold six-year terms. Democrats are in control now, but Republicans are hoping to reverse the situation.</p>

<p>If the same party were to win the presidency and both houses of Congress, it would have the power to push through the president's agenda without support from opposition lawmakers.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Governors&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Gubernatorial elections will occur in 11 of the 50 US states, with key races in New Hampshire, North Carolina and Washington state.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The governor is the top executive at the state level, where most powers that do not belong to the federal government lie.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Referendums&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Since the federal right to an abortion was overturned in 2022 by the Supreme Court, the issue has been ever-present on the political landscape.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Democrats have often used the debate over reproductive rights to dissuade women voters from casting ballots for Republicans.</p>

<p>Abortion rights will be the subject of referendums in 11 states, 10 of which are on whether to establish state-level abortion guarantees. Voters in Nebraska will decide whether the possibility of abortion should be limited to the first trimester.</p>

<p>In dozens of states, voters are being asked to decide on a variety of other issues.</p>

<p>In Colorado, for example, voters will vote on whether or not to ban "trophy hunting" of the mountain lion, bobcat and lynx.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And in Maine, voters will decide if they want to change their state flag.</p>

<p><strong>Local elections&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Thousands of local offices will also be up for election, including state-level lawmakers, judges, mayors, city council members, county officials, sheriffs and others.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon said an Israeli strike on Tyre on Monday killed seven people, with the Israeli army later issuing an evacuation call for swathes of the southern coastal city.</p>

<p>An "Israeli enemy strike this morning on a building" in the centre of Tyre killed "seven people and wounded 17 others", a health ministry statement said, updating an earlier toll of five dead and 10 wounded.</p>

<p>An AFP video journalist saw emergency personnel rush a survivor to an ambulance on a stretcher, while other rescuers worked to put out a heavily smouldering fire at the site, where a residential apartment block had collapsed.</p>

<p>Later Monday, the Israeli army told residents in parts of central Tyre to leave immediately, warning it would attack Hezbollah targets there.</p>

<p>"Hezbollah's activities force the (Israeli army) to act against it forcefully," military spokesman Avichay Adraee said in a post on X, urging residents to "head north".</p>

<p>An accompanying map showed large swathes of the city marked in red, including an area abutting a UNESCO World Heritage site.</p>

<p>Israel last month escalated air strikes on Hezbollah strongholds and sent ground forces into Lebanon, following a year of cross-border exchanges of fire with the Iran-backed group over the Gaza war.</p>

<p>Tyre was subjected to heavy Israeli strikes last week, leaving swathes of the centre in ruins.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Reports suggest Xie may have used some of her illicit gains to fund plastic surgery in an attempt to evade arrest.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 30-year-old Chinese woman, identified by her surname Xie, has been arrested in Thailand after evading capture for nearly two years on charges of defrauding over 1.5 million yuan (approximately Rs 1.77 crore). Xie, who allegedly underwent plastic surgery to change her appearance, was wanted for orchestrating a scheme promising airline jobs to victims in exchange for large payments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thai Immigration Police detained her following a tip-off from Bangkok residents who noticed her frequent face-covering and mask-wearing, raising suspicions of illegal immigration, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3283169/china-woman-arrested-us210000-scam-after-undergoing-plastic-surgery-evade-capture" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>South China Morning Post </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On October 7, police arrested Xie as she came down from her apartment to collect a food delivery. She failed to present a valid passport and was found to have overstayed her 15-day visa-on-arrival by over 650 days, having entered Thailand in late 2022.</p>

<p>Xie's criminal activities reportedly began nearly a decade ago. Between 2016 and 2019, she allegedly conned at least six people out of 1.52 million yuan by fabricating ties with major airlines and offering job placements to aspiring flight attendants. Among her victims was her cousin, whom she convinced to lend her 52,000 yuan (Rs 6.13 lakh) under the pretence of helping a friend buy a watch in Japan. Xie promised a reward for the favour, but her cousin only recovered a small part of the loan and later discovered that Xie's flight attendant persona was a fabrication.</p>

<p>Thai authorities revealed that Xie had an Interpol Blue Notice, indicating her status as an international fugitive. Chinese authorities requested this notice after tracking her fraudulent activities back to 2014, according to the South China Morning Post.</p>

<p>Reports suggest Xie may have used some of her illicit gains to fund plastic surgery in an attempt to evade arrest. The Thai Immigration Bureau Division has confirmed that Xie will be penalized under Thai law for visa violations before being deported to China. Her case has drawn parallels to that of Lao Rongzhi, a notorious Chinese fugitive who was apprehended in 2019 after eluding capture for 20 years through aliases and multiple surgeries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cristiano Ronaldo, a legendary footballer with a global fan base, recently met a 24-year-old superfan named Gong, who cycled from China to Saudi Arabia for seven months to meet him. Starting from his home on March 18, Gong arrived at the Al Nassr Football Club on October 20, as the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3283844/devoted-china-cristiano-ronaldo-football-fan-takes-13000km-bicycle-ride-meet-idol" rel="nofollow, noindex">South China Morning Post</a></em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3283844/devoted-china-cristiano-ronaldo-football-fan-takes-13000km-bicycle-ride-meet-idol" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em> </em></a>reported.</p>

<p>Throughout his journey, Gong cycled through several countries, including Kazakhstan, Georgia, Iran, and Qatar, before reaching Riyadh, Saudi Arabia's capital. After Ronaldo's team learned about Gong's extraordinary effort, they arranged a meeting outside the Al Nassr Football Club.</p>

<p>During their encounter, Ronaldo signed Gong's shirt and posed for several photos with him. According to the South China Morning Post, Gong faced numerous challenges. He struggled with language barriers, budget-friendly meals in different countries, and the physical exhaustion of cycling such a vast distance.</p>

<p>Gong's trip to Riyadh was inspired after Ronaldo had to cancel a planned visit to China in February due to a leg injury. Gong covered an impressive 13,000 kilometres on his bike, carrying essentials like two 60,000mAh power banks, a tent, cooking utensils, clothes, and other necessities. In places where food was costly, he relied on bread and used translation software to communicate with locals. In August, while in Armenia, he fell ill with a high fever and collapsed on the roadside, later receiving free hospital treatment.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the journey, Gong shared that the experience made him more mature and patient and helped him forge new friendships. After reaching Riyadh on October 10, he waited several days to meet Ronaldo, who was in Europe at the time. The Al Nassr FC staff assured him of a brief meeting, which finally happened after he saw Ronaldo play in an Al Nassr vs. Al Shabab match, thanks to a fan who offered him a ticket.</p>

<p>When Gong met Ronaldo, the footballer shook his hand, hugged him, and signed his No. 7 Al Nassr jersey. Ronaldo also autographed a banner with the names of Gong's friends and inscribed the phrase, "What I dream of is true love and freedom."</p>

<p>In China, Ronaldo, or "C Luo," is celebrated for his record-breaking career, boasting over 900 goals and being the most-followed individual on Instagram, with 640 million followers. Gong now plans to visit Portugal, Ronaldo's hometown, as his next adventure.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[New York is where Trump made his name as a playboy property developer, emblazoning skyscrapers with his name and searing himself into popular culture through media appearances and stunts well before he ran for office.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tourists wheeling luggage met head-on with Donald Trump supporters excited to see their idol at Madison Square Garden -- and the result was New York's sidewalks brought to a standstill.</p>

<p>The Empire State Building and the Naked Cowboy guitarist street performer -- both staples of the Manhattan cityscape -- provided a backdrop for a Trump rally held just days before the election.</p>

<p>Eric Milland, 65, from suburban Yonkers said the Republican candidate and former president deserved a warm welcome despite the city being deeply Democratic.</p>

<p>"It's great to see him in New York," said the retiree carrying a cane, who had changed the date on his camouflage Trump hat from 2020 to 2024 with orange pen.</p>

<p>"We are in big trouble, it's a crisis. Immigration is a crisis, our emergency rooms are full," he added, echoing Trump's campaign message.</p>

<p>New York is where Trump made his name as a playboy property developer, emblazoning skyscrapers with his name and searing himself into popular culture through media appearances and stunts well before he ran for office.</p>

<p>On Trump's chances of carrying true blue New York State in the presidential election, Milland said "it'd be a miracle -- but miracles have happened."</p>

<p><strong>Shouting and slurs</strong></p>

<p>The crowded streets near the venue were not without tension on Sunday.</p>

<p>A woman wearing a green North Face puffer jacket screamed abuse at Trump supporters as a film crew captured the scene.</p>

<p>Nearby, a uniformed NYPD police officer haggled with a Trump T-shirt seller, sizing up a "Trump is my savior" shirt before deciding against a purchase.</p>

<p>An anti-Trump demonstrator held up a banner reading "welcome to your Nazi rally," recalling the gathering held by an American Nazi group in 1939 at "the Garden."</p>

<p>Undeterred, a Trump supporter in a stylized black and white US flag hooded sweater posed smiling for a photo with his arm around a companion in front of the banner.</p>

<p>"I hope the terrorists kill you," one man screamed at the vendor of signature red Trump hats and T-shirts commemorating the former president's narrow escape from a sniper's bullet.</p>

<p>Police, Secret Service agents and plainclothes officers swarmed the area, a hive of activity that is home to a rail, subway and bus terminal as well as the 20,000-capacity "MSG" arena.</p>

<p>"We hope people will be happy on November 6" the day after the vote, said retired university professor Salvador, 70, from Barcelona as he and his wife weaved through Trump supporters.</p>

<p>"We wanted to come and see, for me it's interesting. Some people assume that we are against America -- but that's just the leftist politics in Europe," he said before heading to the airport to return home.</p>

<p>Some tourists stumbled into the melee, checking map apps for how to get away as their children surveyed the scene.</p>

<p>Fifty-five-year-old Democratic supporter Laura, who works in the lifestyle sector, had brought her Trump-supporting son to the rally "and then we can talk about it and discuss it later," she said.</p>

<p>"I don't think all Trump people are evil," she said. "Actually the people are a lot more normal than I thought they would be."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will make a final push to break their bitter deadlock as they head into the last week of the most dramatic and divisive White House race in modern times.</p>

<p>Despite a series of historic upheavals in a US election like no other, polls show the Democratic vice president and Republican former president remain neck-and-neck in the polls as Election Day on November 5 looms.</p>

<p>Both will pull out all the stops to sway voters, with Harris, 60, giving her closing pitch on Tuesday at the same spot where Trump rallied supporters to protest his election 2020 loss before the deadly January 6, 2021 assault on the US Capitol.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, is also relying on spectacle, and he gave a barnstorming rally at the famed Madison Square Garden arena in his home city of New York on Sunday night to kick off his final effort.</p>

<p>As the race goes down to the wire, the two rivals will hammer the seven battleground states where just a few thousand voters could decide who governs the world's top superpower.</p>

<p>"It's looking like a toss-up," John Mark Hansen, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago, told AFP.</p>

<p>A deeply divided United States will make history either way: by electing its first woman president, or by granting Trump a sensational comeback and putting the first convicted felon and oldest ever commander-in-chief into the Oval Office.</p>

<p><strong>'Crucial time in history'</strong></p>

<p>The choice reflects the starkly different visions offered by Harris, the first female, Black and South Asian vice president, and billionaire tycoon Trump.</p>

<p>Harris at first focused on a message of joy and positivity after her shock replacement of President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket in July, but has since switched to a relentless focus on Trump as a "fascist" who threatens democracy and women's reproductive rights.</p>

<p>The Democrat has pointedly chosen the Ellipse on the National Mall in Washington for her rally exactly a week before Election Day as it is where Trump spoke to supporters to deny his 2020 election defeat by Biden, shortly before they stormed the Capitol.</p>

<p>"This is a very crucial time in history," supporter Kimberly Whittaker said at a Harris rally in Kalamazoo in the battleground state of Michigan.</p>

<p>Trump is expected to reject the result in November if he loses again, raising the specter of chaos and violence in an already tense and deeply polarized United States.</p>

<p>The Republican has doubled down on his extreme rhetoric, with his right-wing base further fueled by Trump surviving two assassination attempts over the summer.</p>

<p>Trump has described migrants as animals, pledged to set up mass deportation camps and threatened to clamp down on domestic opposition, calling them the "enemy from within."</p>

<p>He has also ramped up his pledge to "Make America Great Again" with a focus on the economy, which like immigration remains a top concern for voters.</p>

<p>"I'm probably going to roll with Trump,” said Drew Roby, a 21-year-old health science student from Arizona, who is Black. “Honestly it was better when he was president."</p>

<p><strong>'Very competitive'</strong></p>

<p>At the heart of the race are the seven most hotly contested swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Wisconsin and -- most crucially -- Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The tightest US presidential election in decades will hinge on who can win over the few remaining undecided voters -- and who can get their base out to vote.</p>

<p>Polls also predict a historic gender gap between the candidates, as well as deep faultlines on race and age.</p>

<p>In the closing days both campaigns will be spending hundreds of millions of dollars on ads while both are also rolling out star surrogates.</p>

<p>Bruce Springsteen and Barack and Michelle Obama have turned out for Harris while on the stump for Trump is tech tycoon Elon Musk.</p>

<p>But Harris may face a bigger challenge overall.</p>

<p>Her campaign had a "better ground game" and more money but Trump "probably still benefits" from a built-in Republican advantage in the idiosyncratic US Electoral College system, said David Karol, who teaches government and politics at the University of Maryland.</p>

<p>“It's very competitive. There's no reason for anybody to be confident."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A record number of women have been elected to Japan's house of representatives, projections showed Monday, but at less than 16 percent they remain a minority.</p>

<p>Public broadcaster NHK projected that women had won 73 of 465 lower house seats up for grabs, figures expected to be confirmed in official results later in the day.</p>

<p>In Japan's 2021 general election some 45 women were elected to the lower house.</p>

<p>The broadcaster and other outlets had previously reported that a record number of women were running in the election, accounting for around a quarter of candidates.</p>

<p>Women leaders are still rare in business and politics in Japan, which ranked 118 out of 146 in the 2024 World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap report.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's 20-strong cabinet includes just two women.</p>

<p>In Japan, "political parties are male-oriented and not open-minded, so it's difficult to find female candidates", Momoko Nojo, head of the organisation No Youth No Japan, said last month ahead of the ruling party leadership vote.</p>

<p>"Many women also take on care work at home, which makes it difficult for them to be a politician," added Nojo, who also runs a project to encourage and support women and minorities to enter politics.</p>

<p>A cabinet office survey conducted in 2021 found that among women electoral candidates in Japan, one in four reported facing sexual harassment during their campaigns, according to Jiji Press.</p>

<p>Ishiba's ruling coalition had a disastrous showing in the election on Sunday and is projected to lose its parliamentary majority.</p>

<p>The 67-year-old premier called a vote days after taking office on October 1, but voters angry at a slush fund scandal punished his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden would celebrate Diwali at the White House Monday evening along with a large number of Indian Americans from across the country.</p>

<p>"Continuing a tradition from previous years, the President will light a Diya lamp in the Blue Room before his remarks," the White House said.</p>

<p>After this he would deliver remarks before a gathering of Indian Americans, for whom he is hosting a reception.</p>

<p>This would be President Biden's last Diwali reception at the White House as he is not running for the presidential election.</p>

<p>"Among the President's introductions will be a video message from Sunita "Suni" Williams, a decorated NASA astronaut and retired Navy Captain. She recorded a video greeting from the International Space Station, where she took over as Commander in September," the White House said.</p>

<p>"Suni is a practising Hindu and has previously sent Diwali greetings from the ISS to people across the globe. She has also brought multiple Indian/Hindu cultural items-including samosas and copies of Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita-with her to space in celebration of her heritage," it said.</p>

<p>"Nootana, a classical South Asian dance and music ensemble based in Washington, DC, will provide musical entertainment for guests, in addition to the Marine Corps Band," said the White House.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican Donald Trump led a headline-grabbing New York rally on Sunday with nonstop attacks on Kamala Harris, but Democrats sought to capitalize on crude insults from some of his allies' opening speeches.</p>

<p>Trump took to the stage at the iconic 20,000-seat Madison Square Garden arena to deliver a closing message in the exceedingly tight race for the White House that reaches its apogee on November 5.</p>

<p>"You've destroyed our country. We're not going to take it anymore, Kamala," the 78-year-old told roaring supporters wearing trademark red "Make America Great Again" hats.</p>

<p>Several speakers drew cheers with their own barbs against Harris as well as Puerto Rico and Latinos at the rally in the Democratic stronghold city.</p>

<p>Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe took aim at birthrates among Latinos and called the caribbean US territory Puerto Rico "a floating island of garbage".</p>

<p><strong>'Not a punchline'</strong></p>

<p>Harris, 60, seized on the attacks as she competes with the ex-president to win over Puerto Rican communities in the tight battleground states expected to decide the election.</p>

<p>"Puerto Ricans deserve a president who sees and invests in (their) strength," Harris said in a clip published on social media alongside Hinchcliffe's comments.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman, a Democrat, noted the state is home to almost half a million Puerto Ricans and nearly three quarters are able to vote.</p>

<p>Ricky Martin, the Puerto Rican superstar with 18.6 million followers on Instagram, quickly shared a video of Harris's appeal to Puerto Rican voters, along with a clip of Hinchcliffe's remarks.</p>

<p>"This is what they think of us," Martin wrote in Spanish. "Vote for @kamalaharris."</p>

<p>Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny also showed support for the vice president by sharing one of her videos to his 45.6 million followers on Instagram.</p>

<p>Trump's rally at "The World's Most Famous Arena" included a surprise appearance by his wife Melania and backers such as billionaire Elon Musk, who has personally hit the campaign trail for the ex-president.</p>

<p>However, the venue also hosted a far-right, pro-Hitler rally in 1939, complete with eagles, Nazi insignia and salutes -- an association that has generated darker headlines.</p>

<p>Professional wrestling legend Hulk Hogan, who also spoke at the Republican convention in July, rejected criticisms of the rally: "I don't see any Nazis in here."</p>

<p><strong>Harris 'boots on ground'</strong></p>

<p>Other speeches also drew concern and criticism, including from Stephen Miller, one of Trump's most hard-right advisors.</p>

<p>"America is for Americans and Americans only," he shouted into the microphone, after pledging a crackdown on cartels and "criminal migrants".</p>

<p>While former Fox News host Tucker Carlson took a mocking shot at Harris's background, calling her "a Samoan Malaysian low I.Q. former California prosecutor".</p>

<p>Harris, meanwhile, charged through a packed day of campaigning in must-win Pennsylvania's largest city, including stops at a Black church, a barbershop and a Puerto Rican restaurant.</p>

<p>With barely a week to go, she was leaving nothing to chance in Philadelphia, where she must run up her vote tally to win the battleground state.</p>

<p>"We must not wake up the day after the election and have any regrets," she told a rally in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Sunday's visit was the vice president's 14th trip to Pennsylvania since she jumped to the top of the ticket after President Joe Biden's shock withdrawal in July.</p>

<p>"This is the closest and the best opportunity we have to have a female in office who happes to be a Black female," Myrda Scott, from Philadelphia, told AFP at one of Harris's rallies in the city.</p>

<p>Harris rolled up to Philly Cuts barber shop in the largely Black neighborhood of West Philadelphia to meet residents, before ducking into the African-American-themed Hakim's Bookstore &amp; Gift Shop.</p>

<p>"She's boots to the ground," 43-year-old African-American woman Myrda Scott, who runs a financial firm, told AFP as she awaited Harris at a youth basketball rec center rally.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Harris will hold a major rally in Washington near the White House in the park where Trump fired up his supporters before they stormed the US Capitol to try to overturn the 2020 election result.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition fell short of his declared "victory line" of a majority in snap parliamentary elections, media projections showed Monday.</p>

<p>AFP examines the options now for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) after its worst result since 2009, and the prospects for its bruised leader Ishiba, who only took office on October 1.</p>

<p><strong>Why the big loss?</strong></p>

<p>Fiercely critical of former prime minister Shinzo Abe and his brand of establishment politics, Ishiba has long played on his relative popularity with voters as the LDP's "intraparty foe".</p>

<p>But while this won him the party leadership, in the election citizens were more interested in punishing the LDP over a scandal that saw party members pocket money from fund-raisers.</p>

<p>That the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP) recently elected moderately conservative former prime minister Yoshihiko Noda as leader also didn't help.</p>

<p>"I think the majority of Japanese people trust Noda", said Masato Kamikubo, a politics professor at Ritsumeikan University.</p>

<p>"He is a very stable politician", Kamikubo said.</p>

<p>While the LDP's seats as projected by public broadcaster NHK tumbled to 191, from 259 seats at the last election, the CDP's tally soared to 148 from 96.</p>

<p>Komeito, the LDP's coalition partner, slipped to 24 from 32, with new party chief Keiichi Ishii losing his seat.</p>

<p><strong>Could the opposition form a government?</strong></p>

<p>This is tricky given the fragmented opposition, and memories of its tumultuous rule between 2009 and 2012, analysts say.</p>

<p>"The possibility of a handover of power to the opposition isn't zero, but there are far too many opposition parties for any of them to reach a majority," said Yu Uchiyama, a political science professor at the University of Tokyo.</p>

<p>Policy differences and past fallings-out continue to divide and hobble opposition parties, from communists to the liberal CDP, the centrist Democratic Party for the People (DPP) and the "reformist conservative" Japan Innovation Party.</p>

<p><strong>Can Ishiba find new partners?</strong></p>

<p>The prime minister has his work cut out to make it happen.</p>

<p>On the campaign trail, CDP leader Noda said it would be "impossible" to join forces with the LDP, having been part of previous no-confidence votes.</p>

<p>The Japan Innovation Party also remains unconvinced, with its head Nobuyuki Baba dismissing a tie-up with the LDP in its current scandal-tainted state as "impossible".</p>

<p>The centrist DPP, too, denied it would sign up for the coalition.</p>

<p>But its leader, Yuichiro Tamaki, left open the possibility of a "partial coalition" where it can offer some flexibility on individual policies it has an affinity with.</p>

<p><strong>What about Ishiba's future?</strong></p>

<p>Ishiba will likely therefore have to resort to heading a minority administration, seeking support from other parties on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>But this is likely to destabilise Ishiba's nascent power base, and leave him susceptible to challenges from within his own party.</p>

<p>Speculation is growing that Ishiba may be forced to resign to take responsibility for the debacle -- becoming the shortest-serving prime minister in Japan's post-war history.</p>

<p>In a nuanced denial of this prospect, though, Ishiba on Sunday night answered in the affirmative when asked by a reporter whether the prime minister intends to follow through on his duties.</p>

<p>"If the ruling coalition or even just the LDP loses its majority, Ishiba will face harsh criticism from party members", Yosuke Sunahara of Kobe University told AFP before Sunday.</p>

<p>But at the same time, the ruling coalition's loss of a majority in the Lower House only goes to lay bare public disenchantment with the political funding scandal.</p>

<p>So if "Ishiba is ousted while the party tries to gloss over the issue, public backlash against the LDP will intensify," Sunahara said.</p>

<p>"This makes it difficult for Ishiba's rivals within the party to criticise him."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Within a few short weeks, Kamala Harris created an election campaign out of nothing. She held rapturous rallies, raised more than $1 billion in funds and brought what she called a burst of joy to a party that had given up hope.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The call that upended everything for Kamala Harris came on a Sunday morning in July as the US vice president did a jigsaw puzzle at home with her grand-nieces.</p>

<p>"The phone rings, and it's Joe," Harris told radio host Howard Stern recently. "I got up to take the call -- and then life changed."</p>

<p>President Joe Biden's revelation that he was going to drop out of the 2024 White House race and endorse Harris as the Democratic nominee triggered one of the most remarkable transformations in American politics.</p>

<p>Harris was previously saddled with record-low approval ratings for a "veep."</p>

<p>Within a few short weeks she created an election campaign out of nothing. She held rapturous rallies, raised more than $1 billion in funds and brought what she called a burst of joy to a party that had given up hope.</p>

<p>But with the now polls showing the 60-year-old in a dead heat with Republican former president Donald Trump, Harris is in the fight of her life to win on November 5 and become the first female president in US history.</p>

<p>"It's not easy. Usually people run for president for two years, and she's just been running since late July," David Karol, who teaches government and politics at the University of Maryland, told AFP.</p>

<p><strong>- Difficult debut &nbsp;-</strong></p>

<p>Harris was a trailblazer from the moment she entered the White House as America's first female, Black and South Asian vice president.</p>

<p>Yet the trail proved difficult at first. Harris faced withering criticism that she was not up to the job of being a heartbeat from the presidency.</p>

<p>Already criticized for vagueness on policy during a failed presidential run against Biden in 2019, she increasingly became notorious -- like Biden himself -- for "word salads."</p>

<p>Tasked by Biden with getting to the roots of the country's illegal migration problem, Harris fumbled and granted Republicans an attack line about being a failed "border czar" that they use to this day.</p>

<p>But things began to change in 2022. Harris found her voice when the US Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion.</p>

<p>She rallied around the country on the issue and took on an increasingly prominent role in Biden's second presidential campaign -- with officials privately admitting she was gearing up for her own presidential run in 2028.</p>

<p>Biden also increasingly tasked her with diplomatic missions on Ukraine and the Middle East.</p>

<p>But few dreamed that the moment for her to take a tilt at the White House would come so soon.</p>

<p>Partly that was because Harris had long been underestimated, by some Democrats and by Republicans alike.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump would soon find that the woman he called "crazy" and subjected to sexist and racist taunts was a force to be reckoned with. In their only debate she gained the upper hand by taunting the former president.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Momala' -</strong></p>

<p>Harris, however has deliberately steered away from overtly leaning into her race or her gender during the campaign.</p>

<p>When she does talk about her personal background it has largely been about her Indian-born mother who raised her and her sister alone -- while her Jamaican-born father rarely gets a mention.</p>

<p>Or there's her very public affection for "Second Gentleman" Doug Emhoff.</p>

<p>Famously his children Cole and Emma, who are now her stepchildren, dubbed her "Momala."</p>

<p>She has also used their relationship to call out Trump's running mate J.D. Vance for previously describing top Democrats as "childless cat ladies."</p>

<p>But it is more common to hear her focus on her professional history as a prosecutor and then as California attorney general -- and contrasting herself with Trump, who's bidding to become the first convicted felon in the Oval Office.</p>

<p>Harris has also repeatedly brought up the fact that's she's a gun owner, as she reaches out to Republican voters.</p>

<p>Yet there have also been familiar weaknesses. She remains uncomfortable with the media, and her failure to sit for any interviews for several weeks mid-campaign drew Republican fire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The question now is whether she can put the puzzle together and shatter America's highest glass ceiling.</p>

<p>"I think she has run a good campaign. And if she loses, some people will say 'oh, that's because she &nbsp;didn't run a good campaign' -- and I think that's wrong," said Karol.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gerard Depardieu was known for more than 50 years as a titan of French cinema, but details of his crude behaviour and allegations of sexual violence have brought his star low in recent years.</p>

<p>The 75-year-old goes on trial Monday on charges of sexually assaulting two women during a 2021 film shoot.</p>

<p>Depardieu's career spans more than 200 films, making him one of the best-known French faces on the global silver screen.</p>

<p>It has included leading roles in adapted classics of French literature, such as Cyrano de Bergerac and Jean Valjean of "Les Miserables".</p>

<p>Audiences and fellow creatives long appreciated his brash, often deliberately offensive character -- only for those qualities to begin counting against him in recent years.</p>

<p>A 2023 broadcast of images shot five years earlier in North Korea showed Depardieu making misogynistic and sexual remarks about an underage girl.</p>

<p>But while then-Culture Minister Rima Abdul-Malak called the recording a "shame for France", President Emmanuel Macron took Depardieu's defence, saying he remained a "towering actor" who "makes France proud".</p>

<p>Macron's intervention came as Depardieu faced a slew of rape and sexual assault allegations spanning decades.</p>

<p><strong>Crude scenes, big noses</strong></p>

<p>Gerard Depardieu was born December 27, 1948 in Chateauroux, central France.</p>

<p>Although his teenage years were marked by delinquency, he went on to discover the theatre in Paris and appeared in his first film in 1965.</p>

<p>One of Depardieu' breakthrough roles came as a violent small-time crook in 1974's "Les Valseuses" ("Going Places") directed by Bertrand Blier -- a film that drew opprobrium for its on-screen depictions of sexual acts and vulgarity.</p>

<p>The criticisms did nothing to harm Depardieu's career, as he went on to be crowned with France's version of an Oscar, the 1981 Cesar award for "Le dernier metro" ("The last metro") directed by Francois Truffaut.</p>

<p>US magazine Newsweek called Depardieu a "hero with a thousand faces" in 1987 as he was on a run of films that peaked with 1990's "Cyrano de Bergerac", directed by Jean-Paul Rappeneau.</p>

<p>Depardieu bagged a second Cesar and the Cannes festival's acting award for his appearance as the titular big-nosed, versifying nobleman in a classic French tale of unrequited love.</p>

<p>He launched an adventure into Hollywood in the early 90s with efforts like "Green Card" and "1492".</p>

<p>But even then, past utterances in which he appeared to confess to committing "rapes" as a young man surfaced in Time magazine.</p>

<p>Depardieu claimed that his words had been mistranslated, but the affair undermined his Californian ambitions.</p>

<p>The late 90s and early 2000s brought commercial success with live-action adaptations of the Asterix comic books and dramas like police thriller "36, Quai des Orfevres", but the actor did not reach his previous artistic heights.</p>

<p>Now a vineyard owner known for his love of rich food, Depardieu made headlines for outbursts and offensive or even violent behaviour, especially towards women.</p>

<p><strong>Allegations catch up</strong></p>

<p>Long written off as being down to his unique character, some allegations eventually made it into the justice system.</p>

<p>Depardieu was charged in 2020 with raping actor Charlotte Arnould, then in her 20s, multiple times, which he has denied.</p>

<p>A second actor, Helene Darras, filed a criminal complaint for sexual assault, but the case was dropped as it had passed the statute of limitations.</p>

<p>Where Depardieu's antics -- such as urinating on board a plane in 2011 -- had once drawn laughs, he now became a liability.</p>

<p>Studios removed him from publicity campaigns for his films before putting his career on hold in late 2023.</p>

<p>Pleading before the court of public opinion, he swore that he was "neither a rapist nor a predator" in an open letter.</p>

<p>"I've been provocative, excessive, sometimes crude throughout my life... if when I thought I was living intensely in the present moment, I have hurt or shocked anyone at all, I never meant to do harm and I apologise," Depardieu wrote.</p>

<p>Beyond his legal woes, Depardieu has appeared to shun France in favour of authoritarian governments from North Korea to Cuba and Algeria in recent years.</p>

<p>He announced in 2012 that he would give up his French nationality, living as a tax exile in Belgium and acquiring Russian citizenship.</p>

<p>Until Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Depardieu was full of praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The top commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards has warned Israel it would face "bitter consequences" after its attack on Iranian military sites, local media said on Monday.</p>

<p>Guards chief Hossein Salami, quoted by Tasnim news agency, said Israel had "failed to achieve its ominous goals" with its air raids on Saturday.</p>

<p>Israel struck military sites in response to Tehran's October 1 missile attack, itself retaliation for the killing of Iran-backed militant leaders and a Revolutionary Guards commander.</p>

<p>Salami said the Israeli attack was a sign of "miscalculation and helplessness" as Israel battles Tehran-aligned militants in Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

<p>"Its bitter consequences will be unimaginable" for Israel, Salami warned according to Tasnim.</p>

<p>Iranian media have played down the severity of the Israeli operation, signalling what analysts say is the Islamic republic's reluctance to escalate further.</p>

<p>Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday said that Israel's attack which killed four soldiers "should neither be exaggerated nor minimised".</p>

<p>He described it as a "miscalculation" on Israel's part.</p>

<p>President Masoud Pezeshkian said: "We do not seek war but we will defend the rights of our nation and country."</p>

<p>Iran "will give an appropriate response to the aggression of the Zionist regime," Pezeshkian added.</p>

<p>Also on Sunday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi reiterated Iran's "right to respond", also saying that Tehran had "received indications" hours before Israel's attack.</p>

<p>US news website Axios on Saturday said Israel has "sent message to Iran" ahead of its attack and warned it "against a response".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As hordes of supporters gathered at the Madison Square Garden, former president Donald Trump and an armada of 29 speakers rained insults on Kamala Harris, Latinos and Puerto Ricans at a 'Make America Great Again' rally.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As hordes of supporters gathered inside and outside the Madison Square Garden less than a week before the US election, former president Donald Trump returned to the city that established him as a flamboyant property developer, who found his place in popular culture through media appearances and stunts well before he ran for office in 2020.</p>

<p>Trump returned to New York with an armada of supporting speakers, even as political experts dubbed the chances of the rally flipping the blue state as a "miracle".</p>

<p>Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance,&nbsp;four-time Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, New York City Mayor&nbsp;Rudy Giuliani, Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White,&nbsp;comedian and host of "Kill Tony" podcast Tony Hinchcliffe, former WWE wrestler Hulk Hogan and Robert F Kennedy Jr were among the 30 speakers apart from Trump.</p>

<p><strong>Here are the key statements by speakers at the Make America Great again rally in New York:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>“Kamala (Harris), you're fired!” Mr. Trump said, returning to the line that he first made famous as host of “The Apprentice.”</li>
	<li>"You've destroyed our country. We're not going to take it anymore, Kamala," the 78-year-old Trump told rally attendees.</li>
	<li>"We will rapidly defeat inflation, and we will very simply make America affordable again," Trump said.</li>
	<li>In a confrontation with China, “we will kick their ass”, Trump said, asserting, “We have the greatest military in the world”.</li>
	<li>He said that if he were the president, Russia would not have invaded Ukraine or Hamas attacked Israel. “Ukraine was the apple of his (Putin's) eye, but I said, Vladimir, don't go in,” Trump said.</li>
	<li>“This is the city where I was born and raised, and this is the town that taught me that Americans can do anything,” he said, while talking about New York City.</li>
	<li>“We bleed the same blood. we share the same hope. we are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God,” he said.</li>
	<li>Elon Musk claimed that he would cut $2 trillion from the current federal budget of $6.5 trillion.&nbsp;“Your money is being wasted,” Musk . “We're going to get the government off your back and out of your pocket book.”</li>
	<li>"There's literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it's called Puerto Rico," said Tony Hinchcliffe. He went on to&nbsp;mock Hispanics as failing to use birth control, Jews as cheap and Palestinians as rock-throwers.</li>
	<li>“I don't take a risk with people that are taught to kill Americans at 2,” Rudy Guiliani said. “I'm on the side of Israel.”</li>
	<li>Tucker Carlson, a former Fox News talk show host, ridiculed Harris, whose mother is Indian, as “a Samoan, Malaysian, low-IQ”.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>An iconic venue with a dark history</strong></p>

<p>Home to some of the biggest events in history, the 20,000-seat arena has seen iconic performances by the Rolling Stones, Madonna, Frank Sinatra, Marilyn Monroe and U2, apart from appearances by two popes and "the Greatest" Muhammad Ali. Its darker history though includes a far-right rally in 1939, complete with eagles, Nazi insignia and Hitler salutes. Around 20,000 US-based Nazi sympathizers gathered under the banner of "Americanization," denouncing Jewish "conspiracies" and then-president Franklin D. Roosevelt, sparking fierce counter-protests outside.&nbsp;A week later, tens of thousands attended a communist rally at the Garden.</p>

<p>The Garden has also&nbsp;Democratic and Republican National Conventions since the 1800s, while&nbsp;Marilyn Monroe took the stage in 1962 to sing “Happy Birthday” to President John F Kennedy.</p>

<p>This Garden was also the site of the 1976, 1980 and 1992 Democratic National Conventions and the 2004 Republican National Convention, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/nyregion/trump-rally-msg-protest-nazi.html">New York Times</a>.&nbsp;Jimmy Carter&nbsp;referred to the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal as he accepted his nomination.&nbsp;Carter returned in 1980, bagging another nomination.&nbsp;As Democrats met again in 1992, Bill Clinton accepted his nomination.&nbsp;The only Republican Party&nbsp;convention held at Madison Square Garden convention was in 2004, when New York was&nbsp;reeling from the 9/11&nbsp;attacks at the World Trade Center.&nbsp;“We will build a safer world and a more hopeful America, and nothing will hold us back,” President George W Bush had said.</p>

<p>The arena&nbsp;hosted both Herbert Hoover and Franklin Delano Roosevelt in their campaigns.&nbsp;Roosevelt beat Hoover, then spoke at the Garden again during his 1936 and 1940 campaigns.&nbsp;“Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today,” Roosevelt said. “They are unanimous in their hate for me — and I welcome their hatred.”</p>

<p>However, among the most chaotic political events was the 1924 Democratic Convention, where the party took 16 days and 103 votes to pick a candidate.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iraq has condemned Israel's use of its airspace to attack neighbouring Iran in a protest letter sent to United Nations chief Antonio Guterres and the UN Security Council, Baghdad said Monday.</p>

<p>A statement from government spokesman Bassim Alawadi said the letter condemns "the Zionist entity's blatant violation of Iraq's airspace and sovereignty by using Iraqi airspace to carry out an attack on the Islamic Republic of Iran on October 26".</p>

<p>Alawadi said the Iraqi foreign ministry would also bring up "this violation" in talks with the United States, Israel's close ally and top arms provider.</p>

<p>Israel on Saturday launched air strikes on military sites in Iran, risking further regional escalation more than a year into the Gaza war and a month into the Israel-Hezbollah war in Lebanon.</p>

<p>The Israeli raid was in retaliation to an Iranian missile attack on October 1, itself retaliation for the killing of Iran-backed militant leaders and a Revolutionary Guards commander.</p>

<p>The Iranian military said that some Israeli aircraft had fired a "small number of long-range missiles... from a distance", inside the US-patrolled airspace of Iraq.</p>

<p>Baghdad has close ties with Tehran but also a strategic partnership with Washington, which has troops in Iraq as part of an international anti-jihadist coalition.</p>

<p>While the Iraqi government has sought to avoid being dragged into the escalating regional conflict, some pro-Iran factions have launched attacks on US forces in the region and claimed responsibility for drones sent to Israel.</p>

<p>One Tehran-aligned group, the influential Kataeb Hezbollah, condemned on Sunday the Israeli use of Iraqi airspace to attack Iran as a "dangerous precedent".</p>

<p>It accused the United States of being complicit in the Israeli attack, warning both of a response to this "aggression".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Sunday he had "received indications" hours before Israel launched an attack on military sites.</p>

<p>"We had received indications since the evening about the possibility of an attack that night," Araghchi told reporters without specifying the nature of the indications.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Israel carried out air strikes on military sites in Iran in response to Tehran's October 1 attack, itself retaliation for the killing of Iran-backed militant leaders and a Revolutionary Guards commander.</p>

<p>Araghchi said the "necessary measures" were taken when the attack unfolded, adding that he had been in contact with military officials and that "messages were also exchanged with different parties" whom he did not name.</p>

<p>The foreign minister emphasised in his remarks that the Islamic republic has the "right to respond".</p>

<p>US news website Axios on Saturday said Israel has "sent message to Iran" ahead of its attack and warned it "against a response".</p>

<p>Axios, citing anonymous sources, said the message "was an attempt to limit the ongoing exchange of attacks between Israel and Iran and prevent a wider escalation".</p>

<p>Earlier on Sunday, President Masoud Pezeshkian said Iran does "not seek war but we will defend the rights of our nation and country".</p>

<p>Pezeshkian added that Iran "will give an appropriate response to the aggression of the Zionist regime".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Let PM Modi bring back 1,000 Ukrainian children at least, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says in an interview.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he believes Prime Minister Narendra Modi can help end the war with Russia. “This is the huge value of him in any conflict. This is a huge value of India,” he said in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUkmGyn_SSk" rel="nofollow,noindex">an exclusive interview with the Times of India</a>.</p>

<p>At the recent BRICS Summit, PM Modi had expressed his desire to work for peace in the context of the Ukraine war. Sharing his thoughts on the Prime Minister's speech, Zelenskyy said, “Modi is the PM of a really huge country - from the perspective of population, impact, influence and economy. Such a country cannot just say that it is interested in the end of a war. We are all interested in that. All of the leaders will tell you tomorrow that they would like to end the war… this is a very common thing, especially for such a huge country as India.”</p>

<p>Countries like India could easily facilitate the end of the war by blocking the Russian economy, the Ukraine president stressed.</p>

<p>“Real influence on blocking of the Russian economy, blocking of cheap energy resource, blocking of the defence-industrial complex of Russia will lead to the decrease in capacity of Moscow to wage wars against us,” he said. “Twenty great economies can put Putin in his place to end the war. They can do that. Not just incentivizing it but vice versa to slow down all of his desires and you don't need to say we would like peace. You need to act because daily war is killing people,” he added.</p>

<p>On what India can do specifically for Ukrainian children, he said PM Modi should bring back at least 1,000 children who were forcibly deported. “You can join the coalition of the bring back of children. You can call Putin and ask him who he is. You can force him to bring the children back. Prime Minister Modi can do that. He has really huge influence. He can just say specifically, how many Ukrainian children will be given to me so that I can bring them back to Ukraine. Just say that directly. Give me 1,000 children who will be brought back to Ukraine. This is the real step. Let PM Modi bring back only 1,000 at least,” he said.</p>

<p>If every such influential person as Prime Minister Modi can bring back 1,000, we will be able to bring back the majority of our children, said Zelenskyy, that's what's needed to be done.</p>

<p>“You need to raise this issue at the G20 meet,” he added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

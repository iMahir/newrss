       <description><![CDATA[US Vice President Kamala Harris lambasted Donald Trump on Friday for her White House rival's "violent rhetoric," saying his recent verbal attack on a Republican critic should disqualify him from becoming president again.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump came under fire for violent rhetoric against a prominent Kamala Harris supporter Friday as the candidates hold dueling rallies in battleground Wisconsin four days before the climax of the most volatile US presidential campaign in modern history.</p>

<p>More than 68 million Americans have already cast early ballots ahead of Election Day on Tuesday. Opinion polls show Trump and Harris running dead even, with victory depending on who prevails across the seven swing states, including Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Both were campaigning in the state's largest city Milwaukee.</p>

<p>Trump was holding a rally in the same venue where he celebrated the Republican Party nomination over the summer and delivered a triumphant acceptance speech just days after the 78-year-old had narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Harris -- who only entered the race in July after President Joe Biden dropped out amid fears over his declining mental acuity -- was to be joined by star rapper Cardi B in the latest of a series of high-energy rallies.</p>

<p>But before the big campaign events, Harris lambasted Trump for using "violent rhetoric" when discussing one of his chief critics in the Republican Party.</p>

<p>Trump has "suggested rifles should be trained on former representative Liz Cheney," Harris told reporters in Madison, Wisconsin.</p>

<p>"This must be disqualifying. Anyone who wants to be president of the United States who uses that kind of violent rhetoric is clearly disqualified and unqualified to be president."</p>

<p><strong>- Guns 'trained on her face' -</strong><br />
As the contest draws to a close, Trump has upped his provocative rhetoric in a bid to fire up a base he needs to turn out in massive numbers.</p>

<p>Wisconsin is part of the Democrats' "blue wall" across the Midwest, but the region could go either way -- and with it the presidency.</p>

<p>The other path to victory could run through southern and western "Sun Belt" swing states, where Trump and Harris both campaigned Thursday.</p>

<p>At an Arizona event Thursday with rightwing influencer Tucker Carlson, Trump called Harris, 60, a "sleaze bag" and Biden a "stupid bastard."</p>

<p>He also claimed, without evidence, that polls are already being rigged in the biggest swing state Pennsylvania -- reinforcing expectations that, as in 2020, he will refuse to accept the results if he is defeated.</p>

<p>But it was his comments about Cheney, once a senior Republican leader who has become a supporter of Harris, that stirred most controversy.</p>

<p>Citing her hawkish foreign policy views, Trump conjured the image of Cheney -- daughter of former Republican vice president Dick Cheney -- being shot.</p>

<p>"She's a radical war hawk. Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, OK? Let's see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face," Trump said.</p>

<p>Cheney responded, saying, "This is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death."</p>

<p>Harris rushed to her defense, and warned that Trump is "someone who considers his political opponents the enemy, is permanently out for revenge and is increasingly unstable and unhinged."</p>

<p>Adding to tensions, social media is awash with disinformation that authorities say has been stirred by Russian operatives and amplified by US right-wing influencers -- including Trump ally Elon Musk, the world's richest man and owner of the X platform.</p>

<p>Much of Musk's effort has involved pushing lies about non-citizen immigrants voting.</p>

<p>Trump notably made a stop Friday in Dearborn, Michigan, the country's largest Arab-American city, where outrage over Israel's war in Gaza has alienated many Muslims from the Democratic Party -- something Trump is hoping to exploit.</p>

<p>After meeting supporters at an upscale halal restaurant, Trump confirmed to reporters that vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr would play a "big role" in health care if Trump were elected.</p>

<p><strong>- Jobs surprise -</strong><br />
Harris is running on warnings about an authoritarian Trump takeover, promising to help the middle class, and pushing back against Republican abortion curbs.</p>

<p>Trump has focused his campaign on stirring fears about immigrant violence and pessimism over the economy.</p>

<p>Economists say the US economy is actually in robust shape, shrugging off the last Covid pandemic cobwebs, with low unemployment and strong growth.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal, a major daily closely read by many conservatives, offered a very positive assessment Thursday, saying "the next president inherits a remarkable economy."</p>

<p>Figures released Friday though showed much lower job growth in October, denting Democratic messaging. Economists said the job slowdown was a blip, caused by knock-on effects from hurricanes and a strike at Boeing.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A U.S. judge on Friday denied Elon Musk's bid to move a Pennsylvania lawsuit over his $1 million voter prizes to federal court, moving the case back to state court.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A U.S. judge on Friday denied Elon Musk's bid to move a Pennsylvania lawsuit over his $1 million voter prizes to federal court, moving the case back to state court.</p>

<p>It was not immediately clear if the decision would affect the billionaire's plan to keep awarding money until the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The decision was issued by U.S. District Judge Gerald Pappert in Philadelphia federal court.</p>

<p>Musk has been giving $1 million checks to randomly selected registered voters who sign a petition supporting free speech and gun rights.</p>

<p>Musk's America PAC had awarded $1 million prizes to 14 people as of Friday and said the final prize will be given on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Democratic Philadelphia District Attorney Lawrence Krasner sued Musk and his political action committee, which backs Republican former President Donald Trump, on Oct. 28 in a state court to try to block the giveaway. Krasner called the program an illegal lottery.</p>

<p>Two days later, Tesla CEO Musk and his America PAC sought to move it to federal court, arguing Krasner's lawsuit raised questions about free-speech rights and election interference that belong in federal court. That prompted the state judge who had been overseeing the case to put it on hold.</p>

<p>In arguing that the case belonged in state court, Krasner called Musk's maneuver an attempt to "run the clock until Election Day." Krasner did not allege the giveaway violates federal law.</p>

<p>Philadelphia is the largest city in Pennsylvania, one of seven battleground states likely to determine the outcome of the race between Trump and his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Musk's offer is limited to registered voters in the seven states expected to decide the election - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Musk gave away the first $1 million at an Oct. 19 America PAC rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania's state capital.</p>

<p>The giveaway falls in a gray area of election law, and legal experts are divided on whether Musk could be violating federal laws against paying people to register to vote.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Justice warned America PAC the giveaway could violate federal law, according to media reports, but federal prosecutors have not taken any public action.</p>

<p>Musk has so far given nearly $120 million to America PAC, according to federal disclosures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As conflict escalates between Hezbollah and Israel, cancer patients from Gaza face significant emotional and medical challenges while receiving treatment in Jordan.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the past year, the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah and Israel have engaged in exchanges of fire alongside the ongoing conflict in Gaza. However, recent weeks have seen a significant escalation in hostilities. The continuous heavy shelling and artillery battles have severely disrupted medical facilities in the region.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/world/middleeast/gaza-war-cancer-jordan.html#:~:text=Laura%20Boushnak%20spent%20time%20with,after%20their%20evacuation%20from%20Gaza.&amp;text=The%20skies%20were%20quiet%20and,old%20was%20unable%20to%20sleep."><em>The New York Times</em></a>, more than 10,000 cancer patients still require immediate assistance, even though more than 4,000 patients have fled Gaza for medical treatment since the start of the conflict.</p>

<p>While undergoing therapy in Jordan, patients struggle with emotions of guilt and homesickness. Mohammed, a patient who was given a Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis in January 2023, went with his mother, Maha, who insisted on taking the family with them.</p>

<p>At the King Hussein Cancer Centre in Amman, the number of patients from Gaza has increased significantly. Patients live in a hotel nearby, fostering a sense of community. However, uncertainty looms over their futures as many fear returning to a devastated Gaza.</p>

<p>Hussam Shehadeh, another patient, reflects on his separation from his family in Gaza, expressing worries about their safety and his own health. Similarly, 13-year-old Mohammed Abdel Hadi faces emotional challenges after leaving his family behind. He locked himself in his room until a call from his mother persuaded him to continue treatment. As patients navigate their illnesses and the trauma of conflict, many hope to return to Gaza once the war ends, according to an <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/world/middleeast/gaza-war-cancer-jordan.html#:~:text=Laura%20Boushnak%20spent%20time%20with,after%20their%20evacuation%20from%20Gaza.&amp;text=The%20skies%20were%20quiet%20and,old%20was%20unable%20to%20sleep."><em>NYT report.</em></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A woman in Xinxiang, Henan province, recently uncovered that she is not biologically related to her parents after a DNA test, prompted by her coworkers' comments on her unique appearance.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an unexpected turn of events, a woman in northern China recently had a DNA test and found she was not genetically related to her parents, according to <em>South China Morning Post. </em>In an interview, the woman from Xinxiang, Henan province, with the last name Dong, disclosed that the test was triggered by her coworkers' light-hearted remarks about her unusual looks, stating that it "did not look local." Inspired by their comments, she began to wonder where she came from and sought clarification from her parents.</p>

<p>Dong asked her family members about her origins, and they gave vague, contradictory answers, including different dates of birth, as per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3284479/chinese-woman-takes-dna-test-after-joke-about-her-looks-finds-out-true-identity"><em>news portal.</em></a> Her interest was piqued by her parents' uncertainty, which is why she sought confirmation via a DNA test. Her suspicions were validated by the test results, which showed that she was not her parents' biological daughter.</p>

<p>"I've always lived in Xinxiang, but after I started working, my colleagues would say, 'You do not look like us at all. Your nose is wide, you have thick lips, and your eyes are bigger and deeper than ours. You do not look like someone from Henan at all,'" Dong told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3284479/chinese-woman-takes-dna-test-after-joke-about-her-looks-finds-out-true-identity"><em>SCMP.</em></a></p>

<p>"Every night, I kept wondering, where do I really come from?" Dong reflected.</p>

<p>China's internet community has exploded with support since this announcement, with many urging Dong to look for her biological parents. Since its initial coverage by Henan Broadcasting System on October 24, the story has generated a lot of interest and conversations on social media.</p>

<p>However, the test indicated that she likely originated from Guangxi province, located in the far southern part of China, showing no genetic connections to Henan province.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[With just four days left until Election Day, Donald Trump's baseless claims of voter fraud in Pennsylvania have raised concerns that he may attempt to overturn the vote, not just in Pennsylvania but also in other crucial battleground states.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With just four days left until Election Day, former President Donald Trump's baseless claims of voter fraud in Pennsylvania have raised concerns that he may attempt to overturn the vote, not just in Pennsylvania but also in other crucial battleground states.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump's rhetoric has sparked fears of violence and attempts to disrupt the electoral process, similar to the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack.</p>

<p>Trump's claims have raised concerns that he is preparing to blame a potential loss in Pennsylvania on voter fraud. His social media post on Thursday stated, "We caught them CHEATING BIG in Pennsylvania," and demanded criminal prosecutions. A senior Harris campaign official countered that Trump's claims are an attempt to "sow doubt in our elections and institutions when he's afraid he can't win."</p>

<p>Kyle Miller, a Pennsylvania policy strategist, warns that Trump's actions are "sowing the seeds for attempts to overturn an election result that cuts against Donald Trump." Miller believes that Trump and his allies have learned from their 2020 experience, realizing they need to spread these ideas early.</p>

<p>Trump recently intensified his unfounded allegations, claiming probes into suspect voter registration forms are proof of voter fraud. However, state officials and democracy advocates argue that these incidents demonstrate the system working as intended.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A judge extended the mail-in ballot deadline in Bucks County after Trump's campaign sued, and investigations into potentially fraudulent registrations in Lancaster and York counties have found no evidence of illegal voting.</p>

<p>The US electoral system, rooted in the 1789 Constitution, provides opportunities for Trump and his supporters to challenge or delay election results. In 2020, Trump's team attempted 60 court cases alleging fraud, all unsuccessful. However, this experience has prepared lawyers on both sides for another potential dispute.</p>

<p>Should Trump's followers manage to overturn or delay unfavourable state results through the courts or legislative obstruction, they could potentially prevent a duly elected Harris from taking office and sway the result in Trump's favor. Some states have warned local officials not to intervene illegally or refuse to certify results. Ultimately, the nine-member US Supreme Court, with six conservative justices, three appointed by Trump, would be the final arbiter in such a case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Indian Ocean island of Mauritius blocked access to social media on Friday, just days ahead of a general election, as tensions mounted over a wire-tapping scandal.</p>

<p>Mauritius has been gripped by the release of secret recordings of phone calls by politicians, journalists, members of civil society and even foreign diplomats that began to emerge online last month.</p>

<p>On Friday, the office of Prime Minister Pravind Kumar Jugnauth said it had ordered internet service providers to block access to the most widely used social networks.</p>

<p>The blockage is due to last until November 11 -- the day after the election -- according to telecoms operator EMTEL.</p>

<p>"Following the publication of certain audio tracks on social media, there is a real risk that the national security and integrity of our Republic and our international partners may have been compromised," the prime minister's office said in a statement.</p>

<p>NetBlocks, an internet governance watchdog, confirmed that Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and X were not accessible.</p>

<p>The former CEO of Mauritius Telecom, Sherry Singh, was arrested later on Friday along with three other suspects as part of the investigation into the leaks, police sources told AFP. Details of the charges were not immediately available.</p>

<p>The leaked recordings were released by an account called Missie Moustass (Mr Moustache), primarily on TikTok.</p>

<p>There have been attempts to block the account but it quickly resurfaced elsewhere and has been releasing recordings almost daily.</p>

<p>Among those causing the greatest shock was that of the police commissioner apparently asking a forensic doctor to alter a report into a person who died after being beaten in police custody. A judicial investigation into the death was launched following the leak.</p>

<p>Private calls featuring British High Commissioner Charlotte Pierre also appear to have been leaked.</p>

<p>The shock ban on social media was roundly condemned by the opposition and poses a major challenge for local media and political parties which rely heavily on Facebook and other online outlets.</p>

<p>"It's shocking, revolting and unacceptable. It's a sign of panic," said Paul Berenger, one of the leaders of the opposition Alliance for Change coalition.</p>

<p>"We are dealing with people who are dangerous to the country. Lawyers are working on what can be done legally. We will move very quickly on the legal and political level," he added.</p>

<p>Jugnauth is seeking re-election as head of the Militant Socialist Movement.</p>

<p>He inherited the premiership on the death of his father in 2017 and secured a victory for his coalition in polls two years later.</p>

<p>"This is the last desperate act of a regime in disarray," said Nando Bodha, head of opposition grouping Linion Reform.</p>

<p>"It attacks head-on the fundamental rights of citizens guaranteed by the constitution, including freedom of expression," he added, calling for an intervention by the Election Commission to ensure the polls are "free and fair".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nine immigrants from various countries, including Lebanon, Germany, Taiwan, and Mexico, took the oath to become American citizens in a scenic outdoor naturalisation ceremony overlooking Los Angeles, with the iconic Hollywood sign as their backdrop.</p>

<p>As the US presidential election draws near, many of these new citizens are eager to exercise their right to vote, with some already knowing who they'll support.</p>

<p>Chia Hsin Tsai, a 33-year-old marketing manager from Taiwan, is one of them. She's lived in the US for 11 years and applied for citizenship in March. "Becoming a part of the country that I'm living in makes me feel special," she said, though she didn't disclose who she'll vote for.</p>

<p>Floriane Turcat, a 37-year-old French actress, was inspired by American movies and TV shows. She's now registered to vote in California and plans to support Vice President Kamala Harris, citing concerns for women's rights and reproductive rights. She said, “I want to be part of the political movement of this country,” and added, “Even though California is a Democratic state, I want to be able to participate and have a voice and state that it's important for me. I want to stand for my rights.”</p>

<p>Phoenix De Los Angeles Lopez Daal, a 31-year-old set dresser from Venezuela, hopes to vote for former President Donald Trump. He is of the opinion that there should be freedom of speech, freedom of religion and the right to own and carry arms.</p>

<p>Dennis Beier, a 46-year-old German film producer, wants to vote for Harris to protect democracy, especially after the January 6 US Capitol attack. Beier has always seen the US as a land of freedom and opportunity. “I just want to keep like this whole democracy thing intact,” Beier stated. “And people need to respect when they lose, that's part of it, and if you can't, then you should not be in politics.”</p>

<p>The US presidential election is heating up, with just days to go until November 5th. Harris and Trump are neck and neck in a fiercely contested battle for the White House.&nbsp;These individuals, along with tens of millions of other Americans, will shape the country's future with their votes.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's leadership and allies are bracing for what they would regard as a dreadful outcome of the imminent US presidential election: A return to power of Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Opinion polls suggest the Republican Trump and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris remain locked in a close contest. But Iranian leaders and their regional allies in Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen are concerned that Trump could well triumph on November 5 and this could spell more trouble for them.</p>

<p>Iran's main concern is the potential for Trump to empower Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to strike Iran's nuclear sites, conduct targeted assassinations and reimpose his "maximum pressure policy" through heightened sanctions on their oil industry, according to Iranian, Arab and Western officials.</p>

<p>They anticipate that Trump, who was president in 2017-21, will exert utmost pressure on Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to cave in by accepting a nuclear containment deal on terms set by himself and Israel.</p>

<p>This potential change in US leadership could have far-reaching implications for the Middle East balance of power, and might reshape Iran's foreign policy and economic prospects.</p>

<p>Analysts argue that whether the next US administration is led by Harris or Trump, Iran will lack the leverage it once held - largely due to Israel's year-old military campaign aimed at degrading the Islamic Republic's armed proxies, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

<p>However, Trump's stance is perceived as more detrimental to Iran due to his more automatic support for Israel, they added.</p>

<p>"Trump will either put very tough conditions on Iran or let Israel carry out targeted strikes on its nuclear facilities. He is fully endorsing a military action against Iran," Abdelaziz al-Sagher, head of the Gulf Research Center think-tank, said.</p>

<p>"It's Netanyahu's dream day to have Trump back in the White House," he told Reuters.</p>

<p><strong>POISON CHALICE?</strong></p>

<p>A senior Iranian official who declined to be named told Reuters Tehran was "prepared for all scenarios. We have (for decades) consistently found ways to export oil, bypassing harsh US sanctions..., and have strengthened our ties with the rest of the world no matter who was in the White House."</p>

<p>But another Iranian official said a Trump victory would be "a nightmare. He will raise pressure on Iran to please Israel..., make sure oil sanctions are fully enforced. If so, (our) establishment will be economically paralysed."</p>

<p>In an election speech in October, Trump stated his unwillingness to go to war with Iran, but said Israel should "hit the Iranian nuclear first and worry about the rest later", in response to Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1.</p>

<p>Israel retaliated with airstrikes on Iranian military targets, especially missile production sites, on October 26.</p>

<p>Iran's choices are limited going forward, analysts say.</p>

<p>"The reality is: Trump is going to support Netanyahu and give him the green light to do whatever he wants," said Hassan Hassan, an author and researcher on Islamic groups. "Trump is much worse (than Harris) for Iran."</p>

<p>Hassan noted that Washington has delegated a substantial share of responsibility to Israel in the conflict with Iran and its proxies, with Israel leading the way. "The US is involved enough in that it's backing Israel, may be more so than before.</p>

<p>"This time it's just things are really bad for Iran. Iran is seen as a problem by both Republicans and Democrats."</p>

<p>During her campaign, Harris called Iran a "dangerous" and "destabilising" force in the Middle East and said the US was committed to Israel's security. She said the US would work with allies to disrupt Iran's "aggressive behaviour".</p>

<p>But Trump's re-election would be a "poisoned chalice", for Khamenei, according to two regional officials.</p>

<p>If he were to reinstate stringent sanctions, Khamenei may be forced to negotiate and accept a nuclear pact more favourable to US and Israeli term to preserve theocratic rule in Iran, which is facing growing foreign pressure and has been buffeted by bouts of mass protest at home in recent years.</p>

<p>A US-Saudi defence pact tied to Riyadh's establishing diplomatic relations with Israel, now in its final negotiating stages, poses a significant challenge to Khamenei too.</p>

<p>This alliance threatens to shift the regional balance of power by creating a more unified front against Iran, impacting its geopolitical standing and strategy in the Middle East.</p>

<p><strong>NEW ARCHITECTURE</strong></p>

<p>Hassan said recent attacks on Iran and its allies have been widely perceived as a significant success for Israel. They offered insights into what a limited strike on Iran might look like, setting a precedent and altering assumptions that military action on Iran would inevitably spark a wider Middle East war.</p>

<p>A senior Arab security official said that Tehran could "no longer brandish its influence through its armed proxies" in the wake of Israel's deadly strikes on Hezbollah and Hamas leaders.</p>

<p>For its own part, Iran has every reason to fear another Trump term.</p>

<p>It was Trump who in 2018 unilaterally pulled the US out of Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and ordered the killing of Qassem Soleimani, Khamenei's right-hand man and mastermind of overseas attacks on US and allied interests.</p>

<p>Trump also imposed punitive sanctions targeting Iran's oil export revenues and international banking transactions, which led to extreme economic hardship and exacerbated public discontent in the Islamic Republic.</p>

<p>He frequently said during his presidential campaign that President Joe Biden's policy of not rigorously enforcing oil export sanctions has weakened Washington and emboldened Tehran, allowing it to sell oil, accumulate cash and expand its nuclear pursuits and influence through armed militias.</p>

<p>In March, he told Israel's Hayom newspaper in an interview that Iran could have a nuclear weapon in 35 days and that Israel - which deems Iran's nuclear activity an existential threat though is widely thought to have the region's only nuclear arms - was in a "very treacherous and dangerous neighbourhood".</p>

<p>An Arab government adviser noted that Tehran recognises there is a "new architecture in the making", but also that Trump despite his tough rhetoric realises there is no alternative to a deal with Iran given its accelerated uranium enrichment program.</p>

<p>"Trump might aim for a new nuclear agreement, he could say I tore up the 2015 agreement because it was incomplete and replace it with a long-lasting agreement, touting it to 'make America great again' and preserve US interests," the adviser said.</p>

<p>As the 2015 deal has eroded over the years, Iran has escalated the level of fissile purity in enriched uranium, cutting the time it would need to build an atom bomb if it chose to, though it denies wanting to.</p>

<p>Iran Online, a state-run news website, stated that when Trump left office, Iran was capping enrichment at 3.67 percent under the deal, far below the 90 percent of weapons grade.</p>

<p>Now, Iran has "enriched uranium to 60% with IR-6 advanced centrifuges" and could achieve nuclear weapons capability "within a few weeks ... Completing the nuclear deterrence cycle is Iran's greatest trump card against Trump," it said.</p>

<p>Arab and Western officials warn that the more Iran hints it is nearing development of an atom bomb, the more they incite the need for Israel to strike.</p>

<p>"If Trump reassumes power, he will support Israeli plans to strike Iranian nuclear facilities," a Western official said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Thai YouTuber Natthamon Khongchak, also known as "Nutty," was arrested and extradited to Thailand with her mother, Thaniya, following two years on the run in Indonesia.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After two years of eluding authorities in Indonesia, Thai YouTuber Natthamon Khongchak, also known as "Nutty," was extradited to Thailand. On October 25, the 31-year-old and her mother, Thaniya, were taken into custody and sent back to Thailand.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2890133/former-youtube-star-back-in-thailand-to-face-fraud-charges"><em>The Bangkok Post,</em></a> Wissanu Chimtrakul, deputy director general of Thailand's Department of Special Investigation (DSI), made the arrest in response to claims that Khongchak and her mother planned a scam that defrauded more than 6,000 people out of about 2 billion baht (US$59 million).</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/gidan-badamasi-hit-nigerian-tv-show-raises-awareness-on-family-size-and-population-challenges-in-africa-6921443"><strong>Also Read | Hit Nigerian TV Show Raises Awareness On Population Challenges In Africa&nbsp;</strong></a></p>

<p>Khongchak, who previously gained popularity with over 800,000 YouTube followers, initially built her platform by posting singing and dancing videos, covering well-known K-pop groups such as Blackpink and BTS. She later attempted to become a K-pop idol in South Korea, briefly debuting under the label Dream Cinema, according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3284286/thai-con-woman-arrested-unable-sing-indonesian-national-anthem-while-posing-local"><em>South China Morning Post.</em></a></p>

<p>In recent years, Khongchak shifted her focus, portraying herself as a skilled investor and forex trader. She claimed her family was highly affluent, with assets including 14 cars and a team of 22 nannies, as she shared on a Thai television program. However, her bid to pass as a local in Indonesia faltered when she failed to sing the national anthem, ultimately leading to her arrest.</p>

<p>She reportedly attempted to apply for an Indonesian passport to travel overseas, but immigration officials detected her foreign accent and asked her to sing the Indonesian national anthem and recite the country's constitution. When she failed to do so, her true identity was revealed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

</div>

<p>Free and fair elections in democratic societies reveal the spirit of a nation, especially in the United States with its extended election cycles. On the eve of a pivotal vote, what is the public mood in the world's most influential country?</p>

<p>If one were to capture the prevailing sentiment in the U.S. as election day approaches, it would be "blue funk". The atmosphere is saturated with anxiety, division, and a sense of foreboding. With near-total polarisation and rising intolerance fuelled by Donald Trump's militant campaign style, this election is viewed with unprecedented worry, unhappiness, and fear.</p>

<p>Nearly nine in 10 voters believe America will suffer lasting harm if their side loses. Close to 60% of Kamala Harris supporters report feeling "frightened" about a Trump victory; 47% of Trump supporters feel similarly about a Harris win. More than half of voters anticipate potential violence after the election, and 53% expect the country's divisions to deepen regardless of the outcome. Alarmingly, one in five Americans would consider resorting to violence to achieve political ends.</p>

<h2><strong>"People Are Fed Up"</strong></h2>

<p>Scott Evans, 64, an early voter in Atlanta, expressed his disillusionment: "I feel like I live in a country I don't want to be in anymore." Madison Bates, a 21-year-old student, added, "Civil warpeople against the government. I definitely think if Trump doesn't get in, that's what could happen. People are fed up. You see it every day."</p>

<p>This grimness is evident across public opinion metrics. Six in 10 voters feel the country is on the wrong track. Over half say they are worse off than four years ago. In swing states, seven in 10 voters believe the political and economic systems require substantial change or even a complete overhaul, and they perceive the economy as rigged to benefit the wealthy and powerful.</p>

<p>The public's view of politics and politicians is "unrelentingly negative". More than a quarter of respondents (28%) view both major parties unfavourably, and 63% have little or no confidence in the political system's future. It's no surprise a nonpartisan group has labelled the American electorate an "exhausted majority".</p>

<h2><strong>What Americans Think About The Economy</strong></h2>

<p>In politics, perception often becomes reality, especially on the topic of the economyvoters' top concern. Only 5% of Americans rate the current economy as "excellent" or "good", while 51% believe it's in "poor" or "terrible" condition.</p>

<p>Real disposable personal income, essentially take-home pay, has been stagnant for the last four years. With the cost of essentials up 20% during this period, and housing, child care, and health care costs still climbing, affordability is a significant concern, with many blaming the Biden-Harris administration.</p>

<p>The impact is particularly severe on the 60% of voters without a college degree. In 1980, blue-collar workers earned almost 10% more than the national average, enabling them to support families, buy homes, take vacations, and send their children to college. Forty years later, their inflation-adjusted income is stagnant, and they now make 10% less than the average worker.</p>

<p>Unionisation rates have historically been highest in the swing states of the MidwestMichigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvaniawhere organised labour once provided a premium on wages. With the decline in unionised manufacturing jobs, incomes have fallen relative to other sectors, leaving many susceptible to the MAGA narrative that they are victims in a zero-sum economy where immigrants and women gain at their expense.</p>

<h2><strong>A Nuanced Reality</strong></h2>

<p>Yet, the reality of the U.S. economy is more nuanced and less grim. While prices rose about 20% from the beginning of the pandemic through 2023, the median worker's hourly wages rose by over 26%. From 2019 to 2023, wages for the lowest-paid decile of workers grew four times faster than those for middle-class earners, and over 10 times faster than for the wealthiest decile. Pay for workers under 25 has also increased twice as fast as for older workers. Meanwhile, the "college wage premium"the pay gap between those with and without a college degreev has fallen to its lowest level in 15 years.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances, conducted every three years, shows that from 2019 to 2022, the net worth of the median US household rose by 37%, from about $141,000 to $192,000, adjusted for inflation. This is the largest three-year increase on record since 1989. Every income group saw significant net worth gains, with the largest increases seen among lower-income, middle-class, Black, Latino, and younger households, contributing to a modest decrease in wealth inequality.</p>

<p>The economic picture remains complex, with significant improvements for many alongside persistent affordability challenges for others, shaping a conflicted national mood as voters head to the polls.</p>

<p><i>The Economist</i>&nbsp;offers some telling statistics in its recent cover story on the US economy titled <em>The World's Envy</em>. Average wages in America's poorest state, Mississippi, are higher than the averages in Britain, Canada and Germany. This year, the average American worker will generate about $171,000 in economic output, representing a 70% increase in productivity in the last 25 years. The US accounts for more than half of global private-sector investment in AI. As the paper concluded: "An economy with an unemployment rate of 4% and a per-person GDP&nbsp;of $85,000 does not have to be made great again; it is great."</p>

<h2><strong>Trump's Immigration Gambit</strong></h2>

<p>Trump knows that immigration places the Biden-Harris administration on slippery ground, which is why he has made it his leading campaign issue, sidelining his advisers' calls to prioritise the economy. The administration kept the borders relatively open until this June, when enforcement measures finally tightened. Harris has attempted to shift some blame to Trump, citing his role in blocking a bipartisan bill earlier in 2024 that would have enforced stricter policies sooner. But this strategy has not gained traction.</p>

<p>Over the last two years, net immigration to the US has been the highest globally, with 2.6 million immigrants in 2022 and 3.3 million in 2023. Since Biden took office, nine million immigrants have entered the country, roughly half of them undocumented. Only one in five Americans find these numbers acceptable; 32% believe the US should "slow the influx" of immigrants, and 16% favour "instituting a moratorium on new arrivals". One-third say America should "close the border immediately".</p>

<p>Trump has rallied his base, particularly the MAGA contingent, against undocumented immigrants, inflating their number to between 20-25 million, though the actual figure is likely about half that. He has pledged to undertake mass deportations if elected. Over 60% of Americans, including 53% of Hispanics, say they support a programme to deport undocumented immigrants.</p>

<p>Immigration has become a flashpoint, underscoring deep cultural divides in the U.S. Studies indicate that immigrants' "different way of life" is often seen as a threat to longstanding communitiesmainly among older, non-college-educated, working-class, predominantly white populations from European backgrounds, as well as religious and rural Americans. These groups feel increasingly alienated from shifting social and moral values, believing the elite is complicit in eroding traditional identities.</p>

<h2><strong>Religion And Politics</strong></h2>

<p>Despite declining religiosity, nearly two-thirds of Americans identify themselves as Christian, according to the Public Religion Research Institute. In the 1980s, white Christians, especially "born-again" evangelicals (who make up 14% of the population), emerged as a key Republican voting bloc. Today, 60% of Protestants, including 8 out of 10 white evangelicals, support Trump. Political scientist Paul Djupe's surveys suggest that 18% of Americans strongly agree that modern-day prophets continue to reveal God's plans for humanity. Among these, three-fifths believe the upcoming election may be the last chance to "rid America of demonic influence", and two-fifths think a civil war might be necessary to "set the country back on the right path".</p>

<p>Gender is another widening societal divide. Men and women's political views are diverging sharply, with a recent poll showing men favouring Trump by four points and women favouring Harris by 10. Nearly seven in 10 Trump supporters believe Harris's policies will worsen men's lives. Whereas in the Obama years, the gap between young men and women identifying as liberals was only five points, this gap has tripled to 15 points under the Trump-Biden years.</p>

<p>Historically, incumbents need nearly a 40% approval rating to secure re-election; the Biden-Harris administration's approval currently hovers around 28%. Yet, with Harris neck-and-neck with Trump in the final days, her viability largely depends on Trump's unfavourable ratings. Trump's net negative rating remains high among American voters. The Harris campaign is counting on a popular vote advantage to offset the Electoral College's Republican tilt.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for next week's final curtain raiser on the US presidential elections.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump held competing rallies in Wisconsin while trying to outperform each other in the key battleground state as the race for the White House remained razor tight five days ahead of the election day.</p>

<p>The latest CNN polls showed that Harris has a narrow advantage in Michigan and Wisconsin, while she and Trump remain tied in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>In Michigan, Harris holds a lead over Trump by 48 per cent to 43 per cent among likely voters, according to the findings.</p>

<p>Harris also leads Trump in Wisconsin, where 51 per cent support her to 45 per cent for Trump, but the race is tied in Pennsylvania, with both having 48 per cent support.</p>

<p>As the race for the White House remained very close, Trump mounted a sharp attack on Harris while using President Joe Biden's comments that appeared to call Trump's supporters "garbage".</p>

<p>Dressed in a garbage vest, Trump arrived at the venue of the rally in Wisconsin's Green Bay area in a dump truck and addressed several thousand of his supporters, arguing that Harris is not fit to become the President.</p>

<p>"My response to Joe and Kamala is very simple: You can't lead America if you don't love Americans, it's true. You can't be president if you hate the American people, which I believe they do, and Kamala Harris is not fit to be president of the United States," he said.</p>

<p>"Kamala, you are fired," Trump thundered.</p>

<p>Before the rally, Trump also spoke to reporters.</p>

<p>"How do you like my garbage truck? This truck is in honour of Kamala and Joe Biden," he said.</p>

<p>"For Joe Biden to make that statement -- it's really a disgrace," he said.</p>

<p>Earlier, Harris distanced herself from Biden's "garbage" remarks, saying she strongly disagrees with criticising anyone based on how they vote.</p>

<p>"I am sincere in what I mean: When elected president of the United States, I will represent all Americans, including those who don't vote for me, and address their needs and their desires," she said.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party leader also cautioned people against electing Trump.</p>

<p>"On day one, Donald Trump would walk into office with an enemies list," said Harris.</p>

<p>She also touched upon various policy issues, including how she plans to cut taxes on small businesses and expand healthcare coverage for families.</p>

<p>The US Presidential Election Day is on November 5.</p>

<p>Over 59 million Americans have already cast their votes in early voting.</p>

<p>Of the total number of early votes, 31,018,125 were cast in person and 27,952,363 were cast through mail, according to official details.</p>

<p>To win the race for the White House, the successful candidate will have to secure 270 of the 538 electoral votes up for grabs.</p>

<p>The seven key swing states which are seen to be crucial to determining the election results are Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Nevada.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia launched more than 2,000 attack drones at civilian and military targets across Ukraine last month, Kyiv's military said on Friday, as Kremlin forces press a grinding offensive on the front line of their February 2022 invasion.</p>

<p>Moscow has carried out regular air strikes on Ukrainian towns and cities, with the capital Kyiv coming under attack 20 times in October alone, according to city officials.</p>

<p>Ukraine's General Staff said in a statement it had intercepted 1,185 of the 2,023 drones launched last month and that another 738 were "locationally lost".</p>

<p>"In total, since the beginning of 2024, the enemy has launched 6,987 attack UAVs on the territory of Ukraine. Enemy drones mostly targeted civilian and critical infrastructure," it said.</p>

<p>Ukraine said on Friday it had destroyed 31 drones and one missile in Russia's latest overnight strike, which damaged residential buildings in at least two regions and a fire station in the southern Odesa region.</p>

<p>Russia has denied aiming at civilians and said power facilities are legitimate targets when they are part of Ukrainian military infrastructure.</p>

<p>Ukraine is girding for another season of power cuts amid the threat of new Russian attacks on the country's energy system, which had already been weakened by a series of strikes earlier this year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[False claims about voter fraud in Pennsylvania have raised concerns that former Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump may once again seek to overturn the vote there or in other battleground states likely to determine the winner next Tuesday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>False claims about voter fraud in Pennsylvania have raised concerns that former Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump may once again seek to overturn the vote there or in other battleground states likely to determine the winner next Tuesday.</p>

<p>Opinion polls, both nationally and in the seven closely divided states, show Trump locked in a tight race with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris with four days to go before Election Day.</p>

<p>Trump continues to falsely claim his 2020 loss to Democratic President Joe Biden was the result of widespread fraud in multiple states that Trump lost, while he and his supporters have spread baseless claims about this election in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Similar rhetoric about voter fraud after the 2020 vote led to a violent mob of Trump supporters attacking the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, seeking to halt or sway the congressional count of the electoral votes that determine who becomes president.</p>

<p>"This is sowing the seeds for attempts to overturn an election result that cuts against Donald Trump," said Kyle Miller, a Pennsylvania policy strategist for the advocacy group Protect Democracy. "We saw it in 2020 and I think the lesson Trump and his allies have learned since is that they have to sow these ideas early."</p>

<p>Trump on Thursday stepped up his unfounded allegations that probes into suspect voter registration forms are proof of voter fraud. Some of his supporters alleged voter suppression when long lines formed this week to receive mail-in ballots.</p>

<p>State officials and democracy advocates said the incidents show a system working as intended. A judge extended the mail-in ballot deadline by three days in Bucks County, north of Philadelphia, after the former US president's campaign sued over claims that some voters were turned away before a Tuesday deadline.</p>

<p>Election officials discovered potentially fraudulent registrations in Lancaster and neighboring York counties, prompting investigations by local law enforcement. There is no evidence the applications have led or will lead to illegal votes.</p>

<p>"This is a sign that the built-in safeguards in our voter registration process are working," Al Schmidt, Pennsylvania's top elections official, told reporters this week.</p>

<p><strong>PREPARING TO BLAME A LOSS ON FRAUD</strong></p>

<p>Trump tells his rallies to expect a big victory on Tuesday, saying he could only envision losing "if it was a corrupt election."</p>

<p>Trump's claims have raised concerns that he is preparing to again blame a potential loss in Pennsylvania, the largest of the seven states likely to decide the result of the election, on voter fraud.</p>

<p>In a social media post on Thursday, he said: "We caught them CHEATING BIG in Pennsylvania" and demanded criminal prosecutions.</p>

<p>A senior Harris campaign official on Thursday said Trump's claims were an example of the former president trying to "sow doubt in our elections and institutions when he's afraid he can't win."</p>

<p>Should Trump win the vote fairly, all the talk of fraud may dissipate quickly.</p>

<p>But the United States' unique method of choosing a president, rooted in the 1789 Constitution, provides openings for Trump and his supporters to seek to undermine or delay election results at the local, state and national level.</p>

<p>In 2020, the Trump team attempted 60 court cases alleging fraud in multiple states, all without success. But the experience has prepared lawyers from both parties for another attempt, each side sharpening their knowledge of election law.</p>

<p>Should Trump followers overturn or delay any unfavorable state results long enough through the courts or legislative obstruction, they could prevent a duly elected Harris from taking office and tilt the result to Trump.</p>

<p>Some US states are warning county and local officials not to intervene illegally or refuse to certify results.</p>

<p>But the final arbiter in such a case would be the nine-member US Supreme Court.</p>

<p>With six conservative justices, three of them appointed by Trump, the court has already granted the former president a victory in his bid to seek criminal immunity from acts committed as president.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The popular Nigerian TV show has stirred discussions on family planning across Africa, highlighting the challenges of raising large families.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Families eagerly assemble every week in Kano, the second-largest city in Nigeria, to watch the hit television program "Gidan Badamasi," a comedy-drama that emphasises the social effects of large families, according to <em>The New York Times.</em></p>

<p>Thursday nights are a time when families gather around their little TVs to witness the fictional story of a rich but careless protagonist who battles to care for his many children. The presentation highlights the difficulties of raising large children in a society that aims to provide education and employment possibilities despite a global shift in birthrates, addressing an issue that is highly relevant throughout Africa, where a sizable young population is expanding quickly.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/world/africa/africa-nigeria-birthrate-fertility.html"><em>The New York Times </em></a>report, many African women have far more children than women on other continents do: women in Nigeria have an average of over five children, while American and European women have about 1.5, and Chinese women even fewer. And recent progress in reducing child mortality in Africa means more of them survive into adulthood than ever before.</p>

<p>But Africa's birthrate is also gradually dropping. It has fallen by about 38 percent over the past 60 years. That is largely because of education, economics, and shifting attitudes toward family size on display in conversations prompted by shows like “Gidan Badamasi,” one of the biggest hits of recent years on the leading Hausa-language television channel.</p>

<p>“It's a very bad habit, breeding children he can't take care of,” Sani Ibrahim, 53, a school principal and the father of the six siblings, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/world/africa/africa-nigeria-birthrate-fertility.html"><em>NYT.</em></a></p>

<p>“It's a problem for me,” he said, “that I have this many children.”</p>

<p>Northern and southern Africa have long been going through “fertility transitions"—significant reductions in their birthrates. But in most of the rest of Africa, fertility has mostly stayed high.</p>

<p>“Gidan Badamasi” had a “massive, instant” effect, starting conversations about reducing family size. It succeeded, many viewers told NYT, where many international organisations had failed.</p>

<p>“You can't just come to this part of the world saying that people should not get married, people should not give birth to many children, people should get birth control,” the show's main writer, Nazir Adam Salih, said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump and Kamala Harris hold dueling campaign rallies Friday in Wisconsin's largest city Milwaukee, as both candidates make frantic last-ditch appeals to wavering voters with Election Day just around the corner.</p>

<p>Republican Trump will return to the venue where he was crowned his party's presidential nominee over the summer, his ear bandaged in bright white gauze after he was wounded in an attempted assassination just days earlier, while Democrat Harris will lean on the star power of rapper Cardi B to outshine her rival.</p>

<p>Their race back to the so-called Blue Wall states came after the pair spent Thursday in the US West, with three appearances each.</p>

<p>The highlight for Harris had been a star-studded rally in Las Vegas where she was introduced by pop maven Jennifer Lopez, while Trump spent a comfortable evening basking in mutual affection with right-wing provocateur Tucker Carlson in Glendale, Arizona.</p>

<p>With Tuesday's vote looming, the candidates appear set for a photo finish, despite fierce efforts by the rival campaigns to move the dial and dominate the news cycle in a week so far defined by bitter disputes and gaffes on both sides over issues including race, gender and reproductive rights.</p>

<p>Wisconsin, one of the key battleground states that will swing the November 5 election, was decided by less than one percentage point in 2016 and 2020, and the race for its 10 electoral college votes is just as tight this time around.</p>

<p>Harris -- who has fought to maintain her image as a "joyful warrior" even as Trump hurls insults against her and other Democrats -- was seeking to harness the power of musicians such as GloRilla, the Isley Brothers and Flo Milli at a "When We Vote We Win" rally and concert in Milwaukee.</p>

<p>Grammy award-winning rapper Cardi B was due to speak at the event, Harris's campaign said.</p>

<p>Trump was returning to the Fiserv Forum, the venue that hosted perhaps the high-water mark of his campaign, the Republican National Convention.</p>

<p>The convention came as the tycoon was riding high in the polls after two major events -- the assassination attempt and a debate with then-candidate Joe Biden which proved disastrous for the Democrat -- but before Biden dropped out of the race and handed the baton to Harris.</p>

<p>Lifted by a surge of enthusiasm, Harris quickly ate away at Trump's lead -- but the polls have remained mostly deadlocked ever since.</p>

<p>With fears growing that Trump could refuse to accept the result if he loses the election, many Americans were bracing for violence and unrest in the days after November 5.</p>

<p>Washington's police chief Pamela Smith told a press briefing this week that no "credible threats" had been identified against the capital, which saw a deadly riot by Trump supporters seeking to overturn Biden's election win on January 6, 2021.</p>

<p>Smith said that officials were remaining "vigilant." Police would support peaceful protests, she said, but "we will not tolerate any violence of any kind."</p>

<p>"We will not tolerate any riots, we will not tolerate the destruction of property, we will not tolerate any unlawful behavior," she said.</p>

<p>Some 63.5 million people have cast their ballots early, more than 40 percent of the 2020 total vote.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brat, the word redefined by singer Charli XCX and adopted by supporters of US presidential candidate Kamala Harris, was on Friday named the Collins Word of the Year 2024.</p>

<p>"Brat" was the name of the UK singer's hit sixth album, and the word has now come to represent a "confident, independent, and hedonistic attitude", said Collins, rather than simply a term for a badly-behaved child.</p>

<p>"Inspired by the Charli XCX album, 'brat' has become one of the most talked about words of 2024," said the UK-based dictionary.</p>

<p>"More than a hugely successful album, 'brat' is a cultural phenomenon that has resonated with people globally, and 'brat summer' established itself as an aesthetic and a way of life," it added.</p>

<p>The 32-year-old pop star, whose real name is Charlotte Emma Aitchison, described the typical brat girl as someone "who is a little messy and likes to party and maybe says some dumb things sometimes, who feels herself, but then also maybe has a breakdown, but kind of parties through it".</p>

<p>She tweeted in July that "Kamala IS brat", in reference to the US Vice President, prompting the presidential nominee to use her song "365" in one of her TikTok videos.</p>

<p>Her campaign account also re-branded with a lime green photo in the style of the Brat album cover.</p>

<p>The album hit number one in her native UK and number three in the US.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Severe food crises threaten people in vulnerable areas, including the Palestinian territories, Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti, and Mali, where populations face or near famine, says a report by the United Nations' food agencies released on Thursday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Severe food crises threaten hundreds of thousands of people in vulnerable areas, including the Palestinian territories, Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti, and Mali, where populations face or near famine, says a report by the United Nations' food agencies released on Thursday.</p>

<p>Conflicts, economic instability, and climate shocks -- combined with reduced funding for emergency food and agriculture assistance -- are driving alarming levels of acute food insecurity, the report warned.</p>

<p>“Immediate, scaled-up intervention is needed to prevent further deterioration in these already vulnerable regions,” it added.</p>

<p>The UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme said acute food insecurity is projected to worsen across 16 “hunger hotspots” during the next six months in 14 countries and two regions.</p>

<p>Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti, Mali and the Palestinian territories remain at the “highest concern level,” the report said.</p>

<p>Chad, Lebanon, Myanmar, Mozambique, Nigeria, the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen are classified as “hotspots of very high concern,” where large numbers of people are facing or are projected to face critical levels of acute food insecurity.</p>

<p>“Conflict and armed violence continue to be the primary drivers of hunger in numerous hotspots, disrupting food systems, displacing populations, and obstructing humanitarian access,” the report warned.</p>

<p>FAO and WFP experts believe that the conflict in Sudan is likely to expand, “driving mass displacement, resulting in famine levels likely to persist and the number of people in catastrophic conditions to increase.”</p>

<p>That will further aggravate the regional humanitarian crisis, resulting in increased cross-border movements to neighbouring countries, primarily Chad, South Sudan, Egypt, Libya, Ethiopia and the Central African Republic.</p>

<p>The UN agencies also stressed that the ongoing conflict in the Palestinian territories has driven “unprecedented needs, with near-total displacement of the population and an increased risk of regional spillover”.</p>

<p>In Lebanon, the ongoing escalation of conflict is significantly increasing the number of people requiring humanitarian assistance and is severely impacting levels of acute food insecurity, they added.</p>

<p>Since the last report in May 2024, Kenya, Lesotho, Namibia and the Niger have been added to the hunger hotspots list, partly due to the impact of climate extremes.</p>

<p>Beyond conflict, weather extremes and increased climate variability are exacerbating acute food insecurity in many regions, the report said.</p>

<p>La Niña -- a natural climate pattern that influences global weather marked by cooler ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific – is expected to persist through March 2025, with a significant impact on rainfall patterns and temperatures.</p>

<p>“While La Niña may enhance agricultural prospects in some areas, it also increases the risk of flooding in parts of Nigeria, Malawi, Mozambique, South Sudan, Zambia and Zimbabwe,” the report said.</p>

<p>The UN agencies warned that without “immediate humanitarian efforts and concerted international action” to address severe constraints and advocate for the de-escalation of conflicts, further starvation and loss of life are likely in Palestine, the Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti and Mali.</p>

<p>“Addressing and preventing famine in these regions will require greater investment in integrated solutions that cut across traditional mandates, targeting the root causes of food insecurity and reducing dependency on emergency aid,” they said.</p>

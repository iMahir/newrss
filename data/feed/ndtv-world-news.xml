       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India increased its imports of Russian grain and grain products 22 fold, well above other major importers, in the 2023/24 agricultural season, according to data released during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Moscow.</p>

<p>Economic cooperation between the two BRICS members and major agricultural powers is high on the agenda of the visit.</p>

<p>Modi thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin for supporting Indian farmers with stable supplies of fertilizers. At the start of the year, Russia was supplying a third of India's fertilizer imports.</p>

<p>"Thanks to our friendship, we managed to resolve difficulties for Indian farmers. We met all their needs for fertilizers. This is a special role of our friendship," PM Modi told Putin during a meeting in the Kremlin.</p>

<p>Russia and India have set a bilateral trade target of $100 billion across a "broad base" by 2030, up from the current $65 billion, Indian Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Data released by the Russian agricultural watchdog showed that Russia exported up to 89.3 million tons of grain and grain products in the 2023/24 agricultural season, 21% more than in the previous season.</p>

<p>India, with its 22-fold increase, was well ahead of Indonesia with an eight-fold increase and Tunisia with a three-fold increase. According to the Russian agriculture ministry's data, Russia was the fourth-largest agricultural products exporter to India in the first quarter of 2024.</p>

<p>The agricultural watchdog did not provide specific details of exports to India, but noted that, in the latest agricultural season, overall exports of barley rose by 67% and corn by 31%.</p>

<p>Russia does not currently export wheat to India, which has imposed a prohibitive 40% tax on wheat imports. However, wheat prices in India, the world's second-biggest producer of the grain, have been rising in recent weeks due to concerns over supplies.</p>

<p>In light of these concerns, there is speculation that the Indian government may abolish or reduce the current import tax to keep prices low, potentially opening the way for wheat from Russia, the world's leading wheat exporter, to enter the local market for the first time in six years.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Rwandan government said Tuesday that its controversial migrant deal with the UK did not stipulate the return of funds, following the decision by Britain's new government to scrap the scheme.</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer had announced on Saturday that the plan forged by the ousted Conservative government to deport asylum seekers to the East African country was "dead and buried".</p>

<p>London has already paid Kigali &amp;#163;240 million (280 million euros) since ex-prime minister Boris Johnson first announced the plan in April 2022.</p>

<p>There had been a spate of legal challenges, however, with the UK Supreme Court in November last year ruling that it was illegal under international law.</p>

<p>"The agreement we signed did not stipulate that we should return the money. Let this be clear, paying back the money was never part of the agreement," Rwanda's deputy government spokesperson Alain Mukuralinda told state television on Tuesday.</p>

<p>He said the UK had approached Rwanda and requested a partnership, which was "discussed extensively."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The agreement went to the courts, and it was even amended after the results from the courts," he said.</p>

<p>"It went to the parliament and eventually became a treaty between two countries. A treaty provides an exit clause."</p>

<p>Immigration has become an increasingly central political issue since Britain left the European Union in 2020, largely on a promise to "take back control" of the country's borders.</p>

<p>Rwanda, home to 13 million people in Africa's Great Lakes region, claims to be one of the most stable countries on the continent and has drawn praise for its modern infrastructure.</p>

<p>But rights groups accuse veteran President Paul Kagame of ruling in a climate of fear, stifling dissent and free speech.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia on Tuesday issued an arrest warrant for Yulia Navalnaya, accusing the exiled opposition figure of participating in an "extremist organisation".</p>

<p>A court said it had "approved the request of the investigators and decided a preventive measure in the form of detention for two months".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Navalnaya has vowed to continue the work of her husband Alexei Navalny, Russian leader Vladimir Putin's main opponent who died in an Arctic prison in February.</p>

<p>Navalnaya slammed the warrant in a statement, &nbsp;saying :"Vladimir Putin is a killer and a war criminal. He belongs in prison".</p>

<p>The activist's team also dismissed the allegations.</p>

<p>Navalnaya "was arrested (in absentia!) for 'being a member of an extremist community' by the infamous Basmanny court of Moscow," wrote Leonid Volkov, Navalny's former chief of staff, on X.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Quite a recognition of Yulia's determination to continue Alexei's fight!" he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Navalny's organisations have been outlawed in Russia, labelled an "extremist" group and put on an official "terrorist" list.</p>

<p>Navalnaya, an economist, stood by her husband as he galvanised mass protests in Russia, flying him out of the country when he was poisoned before defiantly returning to Moscow with him in 2021, knowing he would be jailed.</p>

<p>Following his death, Navalnaya vowed to take up her late husband's work and has lobbied against &nbsp;Putin's government from abroad. &nbsp;</p>

<p>During Russian elections in March, Navalnaya called for mass protests against Putin by forming long queues outside voting stations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With their president calling into a morning TV show and bashing so-called elites, US voters could be forgiven a sense of deja vu. But this time it's Joe Biden, not Donald Trump who's on the other end of the line.</p>

<p>As the 81-year-old Democrat fights to save his reelection bid after a catastrophic debate against the 78-year-old Republican, Biden is increasingly turning to the aggressive playbook pioneered by Trump.</p>

<p>And while Trump has stayed silent since the June 27 debate, it is Biden who has launched a media and campaign blitz to counter growing concerns about his age.</p>

<p>In a scene reminiscent from Trump's days as president when he would routinely phone in to conservative Fox and Friends, Biden dialled into the liberal-leaning MSNBC network's Morning Joe program on Monday.</p>

<p>"I'm getting so frustrated by the elites -- I'm not talking about you guys -- the elites in the party, 'oh, they know so much more,'" a fiery-sounding Biden said as he mocked Democrats who have called for him to stand down.</p>

<p>"Any of these guys that don't think I should run -- run against me. Announce for president, challenge me at the convention."</p>

<p>Populist politicians including Trump have portrayed themselves as men of the people against "elites" to appeal to voters, while being part of the elite themselves.</p>

<p>Reactions were mixed to the call-in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Legendary Hollywood director Rob Reiner, who made the comedy classic "When Harry Met Sally," said that if Biden kept up similar performances until the election "he'll be able to shut up people like me who think he should step aside."</p>

<p>And Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for president Barack Obama, said Biden's "energy is great" on his Morning Joe call but that his "message absolutely sucks."</p>

<p>"Angry, defensive, lashing out at all the wrong people," he said on X.</p>

<h3><strong>'Big crowds'</strong></h3>

<p>Biden has taken other leaves out of his predecessor's playbook since the debate.</p>

<p>Touting huge crowds at his rallies? Check.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We've been drawing big crowds. Ever since the debate, not joking, even that night we had big crowds afterwards," Biden told a campaign rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on Sunday.</p>

<p>Bragging at length about his accomplishments? Check -- at rallies, in a letter to congressmen, and to reporters.</p>

<p>And cherry-picking polls -- whether to incorrectly claim underdog status in his 2020 battle with Trump, or to deny record low approval ratings this time around? That too.</p>

<p>"Look, I remember them telling me the same thing in 2020, 'I can't win. The polls show I can't win,'" Biden, who was ahead in the polls against Trump four years ago, said during a post-debate interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos last week.</p>

<p>But in many ways the signs have been there for months.</p>

<p>Biden has taken an increasingly aggressive tone against Trump since the start of the year, starting by calling him a "loser" and threat to democracy and finally blasting him during the debate for having "sex with a porn star".</p>

<p>Trump has appeared to move in the other direction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His debate performance was restrained by the former reality TV star's standards, avoiding the frequent interruptions of four years ago.</p>

<p>Right-wing commentators have meanwhile speculated that Biden is copying another Trump trademark -- his spray-tan.</p>

<p>Biden appeared pale during the debate but there has been a rash of internet memes that his skin looked orange in more recent appearances including the ABC interview.</p>

<p>Paul Murray, a commentator on Sky Australia, said Biden had gone from "white to orange", joking: "Is he trying to trick the voters of America that he's Donald Trump?"&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia came under fire at the UN Security Council on Tuesday for conducting "systemic attacks" on Ukraine's medical facilities after a wave of deadly strikes across the country.</p>

<p>President Volodymyr Zelensky said 38 people across Ukraine were killed -- including four children -- and 190 wounded in the wave of nearly 40 missiles that targeted several towns and cities on Monday, damaging medical facilities.</p>

<p>"Intentionally directing attacks against a protected hospital is a war crime and perpetrators must be held to account," Joyce Msuya, acting under-secretary for humanitarian affairs, told the emergency meeting.</p>

<p>"These incidents are part of a deeply concerning pattern of systemic attacks harming healthcare and other civilian infrastructure across Ukraine," Msuya added.</p>

<p>Kyiv said a children's hospital was struck by a Russian cruise missile with components produced in NATO member countries, and announced a day of mourning in the capital.</p>

<p>"First Responders attending the scene immediately after the attack found children receiving treatment for cancer in hospital beds, set up in parks and on the street, where medical workers had quickly established triage areas," Msuya said.</p>

<p>Ukrainian ally France's envoy Nicolas de Riviere said "Russia has deliberately targeted residential neighborhoods and healthcare infrastructure."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"France condemns these flagrant violations of international law, which are yet another entry and note list of war crimes for which Russia will be held accountable," he said.</p>

<h3>'<strong>Abominable' attacks</strong></h3>

<p>China, which has long called for a negotiated settlement between Russia and Ukraine, said that both sides should "show political will, meet each other halfway and start peace talks at an early date."</p>

<p>"China will continue to actively promote peace talks," said Beijing's envoy Fu Cong.</p>

<p>Russia previously claimed the extensive missile damage in Kyiv was caused by Ukrainian air defense systems.</p>

<p>"We continue to insist that we do not strike civilian targets," spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a daily briefing Tuesday.</p>

<p>However, the United Nations said there was a "high likelihood" that the children's hospital in Kyiv suffered "a direct hit" from a missile "launched by the Russian Federation."</p>

<p>Russia currently holds the rotating presidency of the Security Council and its envoy to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzya, indicated earlier this month he will take a firm line with Ukraine and its Western allies.</p>

<p>As a permanent member of the UN's top security body, Moscow wields a veto which it has used on several occasions to thwart efforts to censure its war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>It initially appeared that Russia would seek to block Ukraine from participating in Tuesday's meeting after Nebenzya said Kyiv had not correctly formatted its letter requesting to participate.</p>

<p>Ukraine could participate "only on condition it was requested by the United States... we regret that Ukraine cannot act independently... (and) it has to be led by its sponsor," said Nebenzya.</p>

<p>"Mr President, we are appalled by the strikes on Ukraine by the country that you are representing," Slovenia's representative to the UN Samuel Zbogar said to Nebenzya, calling the strikes "brutal" and "another low."</p>

<p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described the deadly Russian strikes in Ukraine as "particularly shocking," his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Monday.</p>

<p>UN rights chief Volker Turk echoed Guterres, calling the attacks "abominable," and saying that "the strikes severely damaged the intensive care, surgical and oncology wards of Okhmatdyt, which is Ukraine's largest children's referral hospital."</p>

<p>Zelensky has been urging allies to bolster Ukrainian air defense systems and was expected to renew those calls as a NATO summit kicked off later Tuesday in Washington.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India said on Tuesday that Moscow has agreed to begin discharging its citizens who were "misled" into serving in the Russian army following talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>Here is a look at the problem and how the countries thrashed out a solution.</p>

<h3><strong>How Were Indians Misled Into Joining Russian Army?</strong></h3>

<p>A human trafficking network extending from New Delhi to Tamil Nadu used social media platforms and local agents to lure people to Russia by offering them lucrative jobs or admission to what Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) called "dubious private universities".</p>

<p>Once they reached Russia, however, the victims' passports were taken and they were trained in combat roles before being deployed at the front.</p>

<p>Police have arrested at least four people involved in the racket.</p>

<h3><strong>How Many People Were Lured?</strong></h3>

<p>The government estimates between 30 and 40 Indian citizens are currently serving in the Russian army.</p>

<p>At least four people have been killed in the conflict.</p>

<h3><strong>How Did India Tackle The Problem?</strong></h3>

<p>India has said that every case brought to its attention is being "strongly taken up" with Russia to ensure the "early discharge" of stranded people, and 10 Indians have been brought back as part of this effort so far.</p>

<p>Russia has not commented on the issue and has not responded to Reuters' requests for comment.</p>

<h3><strong>Have Other Countries Made Similar Allegations?</strong></h3>

<p>Nepal has said that several of its youth were similarly illegally recruited, estimating the number to be as high as 200, and stopped issuing permits for work in Russia and Ukraine in January.</p>

<p>Sri Lanka also said that several of its war veterans were lured to the Russia-Ukraine war with false promises, at least 37 of whom have been wounded and a "significant number" killed.</p>

<p>While Nepal has an agreement with India and Britain that allows its citizens to serve in their armies, Sri Lankans are not permitted to fight in armies of foreign nations.</p>

<h3><strong>What Kind Of Relationship Do India And Russia Share?</strong></h3>

<p>India has had a close relationship with Russia since the days of the Soviet Union and has emerged as the biggest buyer of its oil after 2022, when Europe banned Russian oil imports.</p>

<p>India has also refused to condemn the Ukraine war, instead calling for peace through dialogue and diplomacy.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday departed for Austria after a fruitful two-day visit to Russia during which the two countries discussed ways to further shore up bilateral cooperation in sectors such as energy, trade, manufacturing and fertilisers.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi on Monday began a high-profile visit to Russia to hold the 22nd India-Russia annual summit with President Vladimir Putin, in his first trip since the start of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Last night, the Russian president hosted a private dinner for the Indian prime minister at the former's residence on the outskirts of Moscow.</p>

<p>The Ukraine conflict also came up during Modi's talks with Putin. Modi told Putin that a solution to the Ukraine conflict is not possible on the battlefield and that peace talks do not succeed amidst bombs, guns and bullets.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, President Putin thanked Prime Minister Modi for trying to help find a peaceful solution to the Ukraine crisis.</p>

<p>"I am grateful to you for the attention you pay to the most pressing issues, particularly trying to find ways to resolve the Ukraine crisis, primarily through peaceful means," Putin was quoted as saying by the official TASS news agency.</p>

<p>PM Modi was on Tuesday officially conferred the 'Order of St Andrew the Apostle' award by President Putin for his contribution to fostering bilateral ties between the two countries. The award was announced in 2019.</p>

<p>When PM Modi lands in Vienna, it will be the first visit by an Indian prime minister to Austria in over 40 years, the last being of Indira Gandhi in 1983.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Facebook and Instagram parent said in a blog post it would remove content "attacking 'Zionists' when it is not explicitly about the political movement" and uses antisemitic stereotypes or threatens harm through intimidation or violence directed against Jews or Israelis.</p>

<p>Meta's hate speech policy prohibits direct attacks on people on the basis of what it calls protected characteristics, which include race, ethnicity, religious affiliation, disability and gender identity, among others.</p>

<p>The social media giant said its existing policies, which treat the term "Zionist" as a proxy for Jewish or Israeli people in just two narrow circumstances, did not sufficiently address the ways people use the word more broadly.</p>

<p>The policy update, which follows Meta's consultations with 145 stakeholders representing civil society and academia across global regions, comes as tensions escalate in the Middle East amid the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

<p>Meta has been criticized for years on how it handles content involving the Middle East, and those criticisms shot up further after the start of the war, with rights groups accusing the company of suppressing content supportive of Palestinians on Facebook and Instagram.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four Indian-Americans, including a woman, have been charged with allegedly running a human labour trafficking scheme out of a home in the US state of Texas, a media report said.</p>

<p>The Princeton Police Department released details of an investigation that led to four people being arrested after 15 women were found inside the home as alleged victims of human labour trafficking, news portal Fox4News.com said on Monday night.</p>

<p>Chandan Dasireddy, 24, Dwaraka Gunda, 31, Santhosh Katkoori, 31, and Anil Male, 37, all arrested in March, are now charged with trafficking of persons, a second-degree felony, and more arrests are expected, the channel reported, quoting police.</p>

<p>The authorities found that all the young women, living in the same home, were forced to sleep on the floor at a home on Ginsburg Lane in Collin County, Princeton. "There was basically no furniture inside the home at the centre of human trafficking, just a bunch of computer electronics and blankets," police said.</p>

<p>Another news portal, McKinney Courier-Gazette said officers with the Princeton Police Department were dispatched on March 13 to a residence regarding a welfare concern and suspicious circumstance.</p>

<p>"After further investigation of the initial report, Princeton Police CID detectives obtained a search warrant for the home of Santhosh Katkoori, where 15 adult females were located. During the investigation, it was discovered that the females were forced to work for Katkoori and multiple programming shell companies owned by him and his wife, Dwaraka Gunda," it said.</p>

<p>While the search warrant was executed, multiple laptops, cell phones, printers and fraudulent documents were seized. It was later determined that multiple locations within Princeton, Melissa, and McKinney were involved in the forced labouring of the victims, including adult males, the portal said, adding, additional laptops, cell phones, and documents were seized from the other locations.</p>

<p>The original concern was raised by a pest control company, which was called for possible bed bugs. "Once inside, the inspector noticed that each room had 3-5 young females sleeping on the floors. There were also large amounts of suitcases. The company contacted police," Fox4News.com added.</p>

<p>The news portal quoted Princeton Police Sgt Carolyn Crawford who said over 100 more people are involved, "more than half of them victims." However, she did not reveal what type of labour operation was happening.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A day after a Russian missile strike on a children's hospital in Kyiv, rescuers continued to clear rubble from the scene as a day of mourning was held in the Ukrainian capital.</p>

<p>But like similar strikes in the past, the Ukrainian government and the Kremlin were at odds over what exactly happened.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here's a quick rundown of what we know about the strike and the aftermath.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>What was hit</strong></h3>

<p>The strike on the hospital was part of a barrage that targeted cities across Ukraine on Monday morning, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The president said 38 people across Ukraine were killed -- including four children -- and 190 wounded.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the attack, Ukrainian officials said a cruise missile slammed into the Okhmatdyt children's hospital in Kyiv.</p>

<p>The strike caused the collapse of the facility's toxicology wing and damaged large portions of the surrounding buildings that house several different medical departments, according to AFP journalists at the scene.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"At the time of the attack, 627 children were in the hospital. Of these, eight were injured. Unfortunately, two adults were killed," said military authorities in Kyiv.</p>

<p>The hospital complex holds around 700 beds and oversees an estimated 10,000 surgeries a year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before the strike, medical staff halted operations at the facility after an air raid siren was activated and sent patients, family members, and others to the building's basement to seek shelter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, not all were able to evacuate.</p>

<p>According to a doctor at the scene, some children remained in the hospital's surgical theatres where operations had already commenced and moving them would have been difficult.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seven other districts in Kyiv were also damaged by direct hits or debris from falling missiles, said the city's military administration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ten residents at an apartment block were killed during the onslaught in central Kyiv's Shevchenkivsky district, the mayor said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Five medical staff and two patients also died at the Adonis fertility centre, the clinic said.</p>

<h3><strong>The weapon</strong></h3>

<p>The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said its initial assessment found that Moscow had struck the facility with a Kh-101 strategic cruise missile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Western expert working in the defence sector told AFP on the condition of anonymity that an image of the attack "clearly shows a Kh-101 airborne cruise missile in its dive phase".</p>

<p>"The missile shows no signs of damage, and its dive angle is itself consistent with that observed in other strikes," the expert added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yohann Michel, expert at Institute for Strategic and Defence Studies (IESD), drew similar conclusions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You'd have to check that the images haven't been altered, but on one of them you can clearly see a Kh-101 in perfect condition," he told AFP.</p>

<p>The strike was part of a wider barrage aimed at overwhelming Ukraine's air defences and focused on "different targets and used missiles with different trajectories and altitudes", Michel added.</p>

<h3><strong>Russian response</strong></h3>

<p>Following the strike, Russia's defence ministry said its forces had struck their "intended" defence industry and military targets.</p>

<p>The minister went on to blame the extensive damage inflicted on civilian targets on Ukrainian air defence missiles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia had not targeted civilian structures.</p>

<p>The United Nation disagreed, saying there was a "high likelihood" that the children's hospital suffered a direct hit from the Russian missile.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tourists thronging the Black Sea beaches of the Russian-annexed Crimean peninsula this summer share the space with a grim new arrival: bomb shelters and sandbags.</p>

<p>For more than two years, the beaches of the peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014, have been only one step removed from the raging battles of the war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Last month, fragments from Ukrainian missiles killed four people, including two children, on a beach in the city of Sevastopol, injuring 151 more. Footage on Russian state television showed some victims being carried off on sun loungers.</p>

<p>Thousands of Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the start of the more than two-year-old war, and a much smaller number of civilians inside Russia or in parts of Ukraine, such as Crimea, that Russia claims to have annexed.</p>

<p>At the beach in Uchuyevka, on the outskirts of Sevastopol, bathers now share a pebbled shoreline with a concrete bomb shelter, reinforced with sandbags - a reminder of the unwelcome ways in which the war that Moscow calls a "special military operation" has encroached on the lives of ordinary people.</p>

<p>Irina, a tourist from the close Russian ally of Belarus, said: "In my opinion (the bomb shelters) are necessary."</p>

<p>"We are visiting friends here and we were told that it is very scary here, but here there are shelters and all safety measures are observed, I think it is very important."</p>

<p>Sevastopol's Russian-installed governor Mikhail Razvozhaev said last Friday that additional defence measures were necessary and accused Ukrainian authorities of being unhinged.</p>

<p>Ukraine has carried out multiple air and naval strikes on Russian military targets in Crimea. But legions of Russian tourists continue to visit each year for their annual holiday.</p>

<p>A Russian tourist, Alexander Zhukovskiy, said: "Probably, it will be calmer to be on the beach, to rest when you are sure that at any moment you can get under protection. So yes, they are needed."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin and discussed ways to diversify cooperation between the two nations in various sectors like trade, commerce, security, agriculture, technology, commerce and innovation.</p>

<p>In a post on X, PM Modi stated, "Held productive discussions with President Putin at the Kremlin today. Our talks covered ways to diversify India-Russia cooperation in sectors such as trade, commerce, security, agriculture, technology and innovation. We attach great importance to boosting connectivity and people-to-people exchanges."</p>

— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) <a href="https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1810650724239380492?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 9, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Before the meeting, PM Modi spoke about his informal meeting with Putin on Monday. He spoke about the issues that were discussed during the meeting.</p>

<p>He noted that the talks between the two nations have been going on for 25 years. However, the attention of the entire world is focused on his visit to Russia.</p>

<p>PM Modi said, "The bilateral talks between the two nations have been going on for 25 years. We have met 22 times. This is such a meeting that the focus of the entire world is on this visit of mine. The entire world is drawing out different meanings of this visit."</p>

<p>Speaking about his meeting with Putin at the President's House, PM Modi stated, "You invited me to your residence and as a true friend, we stayed together for 4-5 hours and talked about many issues. I was happy that we were able to discuss our thoughts about Ukraine with an open mind and with great respect. We tried to respectfully understand each other's thoughts."</p>

<p>Noting that terrorism is "horrible and disgusting", PM Modi highlighted India has been facing the menace for over 40 years and said that he can imagine "how deep the pain is" when terror incidents occurred in Dagestan. PM Modi strongly condemned all kinds of terrorism during his bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>"In the last 40-50 years, India has been facing terrorism. How horrible and disgusting terrorism is, we have been facing for the last 40 years. So, when terror incidents occurred in Moscow, when terror incidents occurred in Dagestan, I can imagine how deep its pain would be. I strongly condemn all kinds of terrorism," PM Modi said during his bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>Stressing that there is no solution in the battlefield, PM Modi said, "As a friend, I have always said that for the future of our new generation, peace is the most important thing. But I also know that there is no solution in the battlefield. Peace talks do not succeed between bombs, guns and bullets. And we have to use the means of talks to adopt the path of peace."</p>

<p>PM Modi said that everyone who believes in humanity is pained when there is a loss of lives. He further stated that it is "heart-wrenching" when innocent children are dying.</p>

<p>PM Modi said, "Be it war, conflicts, terror attacks - everyone who believes in humanity is pained when there is loss of lives. But when innocent children are murdered, when we see innocent children dying, it is heart-wrenching. That pain is immense. I also held a detailed discussion with you over this."</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the Rosatom Pavilion at the VDNKh Exhibition Centre in Moscow. Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister, Denis Manturov, accompanied the two leaders, during the visit at Rosatom Pavilion.</p>

<p>After his visit to the Pavilion, PM Modi on X stated, "Visited the Atom Pavilion with President Putin. Energy is an important pillar of cooperation between India and Russia and we are eager to further cement ties in this sector."</p>

<p>Putin welcomed PM Modi at the venue and the two leaders warmly greeted each other. The two leaders then took a tour of the Rosatom Pavilion at VDNKH. PM Modi was seen interacting with the officials.</p>

<p>In a post on X, Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal stated, "PM @narendramodi accompanied by President Vladimir Putin of Russia visited the Atom Pavilion at the VDNKh Exhibition centre in Moscow. The Pavilion showcases the developments in the field of science and technology. Cooperation in peaceful uses of nuclear technology is an important pillar of the multifaceted cooperation between India and Russia."</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is currently on a two-day visit to Russia, also laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Moscow.</p>

<p>In a post on X, Randhir Jaiswal stated, "A solemn homage to the brave! PM @narendramodi laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Moscow, saluting valour, sacrifice and indomitable human courage."</p>

<p>PM Modi also addressed the Indian community in Moscow. He spoke about the ties between India and Russia and the contribution of the Indian community in strengthening them. He also announced the opening of Indian Consulates in Kazan and Yekaterinburg.</p>

<p>PM Modi arrived in Moscow for an official visit on Monday where he was received by Denis Manturov, the first Deputy Prime Minister of Russia and was accorded a ceremonial welcome. Indian community gave PM Modi a warm welcome at the hotel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greece's main opposition party Syriza said Tuesday that the recent introduction of a six-day working week for certain companies was a "disgrace".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The measure was brought into force by the right-wing ruling New Democracy party in early July. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Greece has been facing a shortage of skilled workers since the financial crisis of the late 2000s, which drove young people abroad in search of better prospects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the policy has attracted domestic and international attention as it goes against the grain of many Western countries, where the four-day week is being debated to boost productivity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Such things are unacceptable. The government must understand that this policy has consequences," said Syriza spokesperson Voula Kehagia on private television channel Skai.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kehagia added that it "shamed the country" by "ridiculing it abroad".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The six-day working week only applies to certain companies, including those that operate seven days a week, 24 hours a day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Workers will be paid at least 40 percent more for the sixth day of work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis emphasised on Facebook that it is intended to address "emergency needs" with "qualified personnel".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Athens said the move combats undeclared work and addresses work shortages exacerbated by a declining population.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the Greek average working week was the longest in the European Union at 39.8 hours last year, their productivity was lower than the average, according to Eurostat.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a tragic incident, an aviation mechanic&nbsp;died after getting sucked into a Boeing passenger jet's engine. The incident happened on July 3 at&nbsp;Chabahar Konarak airport in southern Iran when&nbsp;local technician Abolfazl Amiri was pulled into the engine of a Boeing passenger jet while performing routine maintenance work.</p>

<p>According to<a href="https://www.bild.de/news/ausland/nach-der-landung-mechaniker-von-triebwerk-angesaugt-tot-668cce13bdb18e1605d7d2cb" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">&nbsp;<em>Bild</em>,</a>&nbsp;the Boeing arrived in Tehran early at 7:15 am and landed safely in Chabahar Konarak airport. As per standard practice, the engine on the right-hand side was turned on for a test check with the cover flaps open. A safety area had also been set up around the engine as required.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, when Mr Amiri realised he had forgotten a tool on the engine, he went back towards the plane to retrieve it.&nbsp;As he went close to the turbine, he was sucked in and killed before the engine caught fire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although the airport fire brigade arrived quickly and extinguished the fire with water, rescuers were only able to recover the remains of the mechanic. The plane operated by domestic carrier Varesh Airlines was grounded for repairs, and an investigation into the accident was ordered by Iran's aviation authority.</p>

<p>In May, a similar incident happened when a man lost his life after being pulled into the engine of a KLM passenger plane at<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0dd9pxnd0lo"> Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport</a>.&nbsp;Passengers and crew members reportedly witnessed the tragic death before emergency services rushed to the scene. Speaking to the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf, witnesses said there was a "hellish noise" as the person was sucked into the jet turbine.&nbsp;It is understood the man died after deliberately climbing into the engine.</p>

<p>Last year, a 27-year-old airport employee died after being sucked into a Delta passenger plane engine in San Antonio, Texas.</p>

<p>The runway success of OpenAI's ChatGPT has unleashed a race to adopt the latest AI technology in areas such as business productivity, healthcare, and manufacturing. Investors and Big Tech firms, however, say that meaningful gains from their massive investments in AI will only materialize over the next few years.</p>

<h2>In Numbers</h2>

<p>Five out of six billion-dollar funding rounds went to AI companies.</p>

<p>Top deals included Elon Musk's xAI raising $6 billion and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave's raising $1.1 billion in its latest funding round. Also on the list, automated driving company Wayve and data preparation company Scale AI.</p>

<p>Outside of AI, cybersecurity company Wiz raised a billion-dollar in its latest funding round.</p>

<h2>Broader Landscape</h2>

<p>Despite last quarter's uptick, startup funding remains low compared to the levels seen in the past three years.</p>

<p>Global funding declined 5% to $147 billion in the first half of the year and was flat compared to the second half of 2023, according to Crunchbase.</p>

<p>A tight monetary policy in the U.S. has contributed to a slow revival in initial public offerings, hampering what is among the biggest sources of returns for institutional private market investors, who typically invest in startups and sell shares during IPOs.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico said he had returned to work on Tuesday, almost two months after a lone gunman had shot him four times on May 15.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old Fico was shot from close range after a government meeting in central Slovakia and underwent two lengthy surgeries in a nearby hospital.</p>

<p>The gunman, identified by Slovak media as 71-year-old poet Juraj Cintula and prosecuted on terrorism charges, is in custody awaiting trial.</p>

<p>Fico leads a three-party coalition of his centrist Smer-SD party, the centrist Hlas and the far-right SNS governing the EU and NATO member of 5.4 million people.</p>

<p>Slovak media said the nationalist-leaning Fico, who is often criticised by the EU along with Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban, came to Tuesday's cabinet meeting through a tunnel to avoid journalists.</p>

<p>"Dear progressive liberal media and opposition, I apologise for having survived but I'm back," Fico said on Facebook, posting a picture of himself in his office.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="250" scrolling="no" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Frobertficosk%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0XrgowSd3BpZ58djzYzQotCGNEERJ7fNx91sMAV7Smph8gFAm3TdzXiFfFThgztVcl&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=500" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" width="500"></iframe></p>

<p>When Fico took office last autumn, Slovakia refused to continue military aid to Ukraine, facing a Russian invasion since February 2022.</p>

<p>The premier himself has been advocating peace talks with Russia, like Hungary's Orban.</p>

<p>Fico's cabinet has also raised eyebrows by approving bills seen as jeopardising judicial and media freedoms.</p>

<p>Fico was released from hospital on May 31 and made his first public appearance at a ceremony near Bratislava last Friday.</p>

<p>In a speech, he hailed Orban's controversial trip to Moscow, saying he "would have loved to join him" if he were healthy enough.</p>

<p>Fico also called on Slovakia to build a wall to stop "progressive and liberal ideologies", likening them to cancer.</p>

<p>Following the assassination attempt, Fico walks with a crutch. He has also visibly lost weight.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The research shows Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help fight breast cancer. Early and accurate diagnosis can be pivotal for treatment amongst patients, and a newly developed AI system promises to do so with near perfect diagnosis.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Breast Cancer accounts for 13.6 percent of all cancer cases (male and female) in India, according to the 2022 World Cancer Report published by IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer). Amongst women, it goes up to 26 percent of all cancer cases. In the United States, breast cancer accounts for about 30% of all new cancer cases amongst women.</p>

<p>New Research shows Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help fight this menacing disease. Early and accurate diagnosis can be pivotal for treatment amongst patients, and a newly developed AI system promises to do so with near perfect diagnosis.</p>

<p>A research paper titled " Ensemble Deep Learning-Based Image Classification for Breast Cancer Subtype and Invasiveness Diagnosis from Whole Slide Image Histopathology" published in the Cancers Journal last month, details out an AI Model that classifies and identifies different types of breast cancer present in a patient, in addition to ruling out malignancy (cancer) in the first place by identifying benign tumors.</p>

<p>The study - done by researchers of Northeastern University, Boston along with Maine Health Institute for Research - has developed an AI model that analyses high resolution histopathological (tissue-level microscopic) whole slide images of breast tumor tissue.</p>

<p>The AI system, which outperforms earlier machine learning (ML) models in the domain by combining the predictions of other ML models, is capable of identifying and classifying the tumor into malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using historical data fed to the model during training.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/aiek6dd8_ai-ml-ensemble_625x300_09_July_24.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>It was trained on publicly available datasets called BreakHis (Breast Cancer Histopathological Database) and BACH (Breast Cancer Histopathology images). For BACH, microscopic breast tissue images were meticulously labelled by medical experts, categorising the images into four classes - Normal, Benign, In Situ Carcinoma and Invasive Carcinoma.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Exemplary microscopy images demonstrating the four classes in the BACH dataset (Image Source: Cancers 2024, 16(12), 2222)  " id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/04jfmlh_tumor_625x300_09_July_24.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Exemplary microscopy images demonstrating the four classes in the BACH dataset (Image Source: Cancers 2024, 16(12), 2222)  " /></div>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"></div>
</div>

<p>And for BreakHis, which consists of 9,109 microscopic images of breast tumor tissue, it was used to categorise benign and malignant tumors further into 4 subclasses each- malignant tumors into Ductal carcinoma, Lobular carcinoma, Mucinous carcinoma and Papillary carcinoma, and benign tumors into Adenosi, Fibroadenoma, Phyllodes tumor, and Tubular adenoma.</p>

</div>

<p>Put together, the ensemble ML model has an accuracy of 99.84 percent. Such a performance metric during the research and development stage shows optimistic promise for the real-world application of the technology.</p>

<p>"The AI can't miss a tumor in the biopsy and won't be exhausted after diagnosing 10 or 20 people," said Saeed Amal to Northeastern Global News. Amal is a professor of bioengineering at Northeastern university and is leading the ensemble model project.</p>

<p>Apart from diagnosis, AI systems have also made progress in prognosis and predictions related to breast cancers. For example, AI can now predict the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response of breast cancer using Hematoxylin and eosin (common stains in tissue imaging) images of pre-chemotherapy needle biopsies. The AI systems responsible for the same have an accuracy of 95.15 percent and have been detailed out in a paper titled "Development of multiple AI pipelines that predict neoadjuvant chemotherapy response of breast cancer using H&amp;E-stained tissues," published in May 2023 in the Journal of Pathology.</p>

<p>Apart from this, AI has also made significant progress in identifying lymph node metastasis (spreading of cancer cells through lymphatic nodes) and evaluation of hormonal status which is important for breast cancer treatment. These and many more advances made by AI interventions over the years in the fight against breast cancer have been stated in a review paper published in Diagnostic Pathology in February.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[UN rights experts on Tuesday accused Israel of carrying out a "targeted starvation campaign" that has resulted in the deaths of children in Gaza.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN rights experts on Tuesday accused Israel of carrying out a "targeted starvation campaign" that has resulted in the deaths of children in Gaza.</p>

<p>"We declare that Israel's intentional and targeted starvation campaign against the Palestinian people is a form of genocidal violence and has resulted in famine across all of Gaza," 10 independent United Nations experts said in a statement.</p>

<p>The UN has not officially declared a famine in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>But the experts, including the UN special rapporteur on the right to food Michael Fakhri, insisted there was no denying famine was under way.</p>

<p>"Thirty-four Palestinians have died from malnutrition since 7 October, the majority being children," said the experts, who are appointed by the UN Human Rights Council, but who do not speak on behalf of the United Nations.</p>

<p>Their statement was immediately slammed by Israel's mission to the UN in Geneva, which charged that "Mr. Fakhri, and many so-called 'experts' who joined his statement, are as much accustomed to spreading misinformation, as they are to supporting Hamas propaganda and shielding the terrorist organisation from scrutiny".</p>

<p>The UN experts meanwhile listed three children who had recently died "from malnutrition", after a number of others were said to have starved to death in northern Gaza earlier this year.</p>

<p>"Fayez Ataya, who was barely six months old, died on 30 May 2024, and 13-year-old Abdulqader Al-Serhi died on June 1, 2024 at the Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir Al-Balah," they said.</p>

<p>Nine-year-old Ahmad Abu Reida died just two days later "in the tent sheltering his displaced family in Al-Mawasi, Khan Younis", they said.</p>

<p>"With the death of these children from starvation despite medical treatment in central Gaza, there is no doubt that famine has spread from northern Gaza into central and southern Gaza," they said.</p>

<p>The experts decried that the world had not done more to avert this disaster.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"When a two-month-old baby and 10-year-old Yazan Al Kafarneh died of hunger on 24 February and 4 March respectively, this confirmed that famine had struck northern Gaza," they said.</p>

<p>"The whole world should have intervened earlier to stop Israel's genocidal starvation campaign and prevented these deaths."</p>

<p>"Inaction is complicity."</p>

<p>Gaza has been facing a deep humanitarian crisis since the war erupted following Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>In response, Israel has carried out a military offensive that has killed at least 38,243 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.</p>

<p>The UN has been warning for months of a looming famine in Gaza, especially in the north, but one has not been officially declared.</p>

<p>The Israeli mission highlighted Tuesday that the latest assessment by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) partnership determined that famine had not materialised after aid access improved somewhat.</p>

<p>"Israel has continuously scaled up its coordination and assistance in the delivery of humanitarian aid across the Gaza Strip," it said, claiming Hamas "intentionally steal and hide aid from civilians".&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three asylum seekers who brought court action to block the UK's attempt to send them to Rwanda had their cases resolved on Tuesday, after the incoming Labour government ditched the policy.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced on Saturday that the migrant deportation plan forged by the ousted Conservative government was "dead and buried".</p>

<p>There had already been a spate of legal challenges to the scheme, with the UK Supreme Court in November last year ruling that it was illegal under international law as Rwanda could not be considered a safe country for asylum seekers.</p>

<p>Government lawyer James Eadie told the High Court in London on Tuesday: "In relation to the three named claimants, these claimants' cases will be fully disposed of and withdrawn subject to the (interior ministry) paying their costs."</p>

<p>The Labour Party said before last Thursday's general election that it would ditch the scheme, which the Tories said would deter huge numbers of migrants trying to get across the Channel to the UK on small boats from northern France.</p>

<p>Sixty-five people were brought ashore Monday -- the first under the new government -- taking the total number of arrivals so far this year to 13,639, according to an AFP tally of official figures.</p>

<p>Rwanda, home to 13 million people in Africa's Great Lakes region, claims to be one of the most stable countries on the continent and has drawn praise for its modern infrastructure.</p>

<p>But rights groups accuse veteran President Paul Kagame of ruling in a climate of fear, stifling dissent and free speech.</p>

<p>A spokesman for his government said Monday that "Rwanda takes note of the intention of the UK government to terminate the Migration and Economic Development Partnership Agreement".</p>

<p>As part of the deal, the UK has already paid some £240 million ($307 million) to Rwanda, with a further £50 million scheduled to be sent at a later date.</p>

<p>In January, Kagame said the money was "only going to be used if those people will come. If they don't come, we can return the money".</p>

<p>However, he later specified there was "no obligation" to do so.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The election of relative moderate Masoud Pezeshkian as Iran's president has lifted the hopes of Iranians yearning for social freedoms and better relations with the West, but few expect big policy changes.</p>

<p>Iran's ruling clerics' political fortunes' rely on tackling economic hardship, so Pezeshkian may have a comparatively strong hand to revive the economy, but his scope to permit social freedoms will be limited, insiders and analysts said.</p>

<p>Under Iran's dual system of clerical and republican rule, the president cannot usher in any major policy shift on Iran's nuclear programme or foreign policy, since Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei calls all the shots on top state matters.</p>

<p>However, the president can influence the tone of policy and he will be closely involved in selecting the successor to Khamenei, now 85.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hardliners, entrenched in institutions Khamenei controls such as the judiciary, armed forces and the media, have in the past blocked either the new opening to the West or domestic liberalisation.</p>

<p>Khamenei has set out guidelines he would like to see in the new government by counselling Pezeshkian to continue the policies of hardline President Ebrahim Raisi, who was killed in a helicopter crash in May.</p>

<p>"Pezeshkian self-identifies as a 'principlist' - someone committed to the ideological principles of the revolution - and has been clear about his devotion to the Revolutionary Guards and Khamenei," said Karim Sadjadpour, an associate at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington.</p>

<h3><strong>Will Iran Change Its Stance On The Nuclear Standoff?</strong></h3>

<p>Pezeshkian, a 69-year-old former heart surgeon, won Iran's run-off presidential vote last week and is yet to be sworn in.</p>

<p>He has pledged to promote a pragmatic foreign policy and ease tensions with the six major powers that have been involved in now-stalled nuclear talks to revive a 2015 nuclear pact.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, analysts said, Pezeshkian's victory was a setback for hawks such as his rival, hardliner Saeed Jalili, who opposed any opening to the West and revival of the nuclear pact.</p>

<p>Jalili's supporters have criticised a hardline watchdog body for allowing Pezeshkian to run, with insiders suggesting that this decision was made by Khamenei to secure a high turnout amid consistently low participation in elections since 2020.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian hopes that revived talks with the West would lead to a lifting of tough U.S. sanctions, given growing popular discontent over economic hardships.</p>

<p>However, White House spokesperson John Kirby said on Monday the United States was not ready to resume nuclear talks with Iran under the new president.</p>

<p>For Pezeshkian the stakes are high. The president could become politically vulnerable if he fails to revive the pact, which then-U.S. President Donald Trump ditched in 2018 and reimposed harsh sanctions on Iran.</p>

<p>"He has a difficult path ahead ... Pezeshkian's inability to revive the pact will weaken the president and also lead to a backlash against the pro-reform camp who backed him," said a senior reformist former official.</p>

<p>A restoration of ties with the United States, which Iran's rulers have called the "Great Satan" since taking power in a 1979 revolution, remains out of the question.</p>

<h3><strong>Will The Economy See A Boom?</strong></h3>

<p>As the economy remains the Achilles heel for Khamenei, breaking free of the crippling U.S. sanctions, which have cost Iran billions of dollars in income from oil, will remain the top economic goal for Pezeshkian.</p>

<p>Spiralling prices and constricted spending power have left millions of Iranians struggling against a combination of sanctions and mismanagement.</p>

<p>Khamenei knows the economic struggle is a persistent challenge for the ruling clerics, who fear a revival of protests that have erupted since 2017 among lower- and middle-income people angry at enduring hardship.</p>

<p>"Failure to improve the economy will lead to street protests, particularly now that people have high hopes because of Pezeshkian's campaign promises," said an insider who is close to Khamenei.</p>

<p>Iran's economic outlook looks ever more uncertain, analysts say, with the possible return of Trump as U.S. president considered likely to lead to tougher enforcement of oil sanctions.</p>

<h3><strong>Will Strict Social Restrictions Change?</strong></h3>

<p>Pezeshkian enjoys an insider status and close relationship with the theocratic Khamenei, and may be able to build bridges between factions to yield moderation, but this would not enable him to bring about the fundamental changes that many pro-reform Iranians demand.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian, analysts said, is highly likely to end up in a similar position to his predecessors - reformist President Mohammad Khatami and pragmatist Hassan Rouhani - who whetted Iranians' appetite for change but ultimately were blocked by hardliners in the dominant elite of clerics and the powerful Revolutionary Guards.</p>

<p>"Pezeshkian is neither a reformist nor a moderate ... As a foot soldier of Khamanei, Pezeshkian will be subjected to his wishes which clearly has been to rule by violence and repression," said Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of New York-based advocacy group the Centre for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI).</p>

<p>As a lawmaker in 2022, Pezeshkian criticised the establishment over the death in custody of young Iranian woman Mahsa Amini, which triggered months of unrest in Iran.</p>

<h3><strong>Will Iran Change Its Regional Policy?</strong></h3>

<p>Unlikely. The top authority in regional policy is not the president, but the Guards, who answer only to Khamenei.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian is taking office at a time of escalating Middle East tensions over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Signalling no change in Iran's regional policies, Pezeshkian reaffirmed on Monday Iran's anti-Israel stance and its support for resistance movements across the region</p>

<p>"Supporting the resistance of the people in the region against the illegitimate Zionist regime (Israel) is rooted in the fundamental policies of the Islamic Republic," Pezeshkian said in a message to the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Russia-Ukraine war started exactly two years ago. The very next day, on February 25, 2022, India abstained from voting on a draft resolution in the United Nations Security Council. In the course of the ongoing war, New Delhi has been abstaining from taking clear sides, much to the chagrin of establishments in both the European Union and the United States. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits Ukraine, after a much-publicised visit to Moscow in July, in maintaining with India's stated position of strategic neutrality, questions are being asked in global capitals about India's motivations. This is the first time an Indian prime minister has visited an independent Ukraine after the fall of the Soviet Union.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There have been enough domestic discussions on India's purported role in world peace and other grand enterprise. Let's bring realism back into the game now.</p>

<h2><strong>Decoupling From West Is Not An Option</strong></h2>

<p>Domestic chatter aside, what the Western world - the US, EU, UK nexus - thinks about India's stand on the Russia-Ukraine conflict does, indeed, matter to India. No matter what the virulently nationalist ecosystem clamours for, decoupling from the West is not an option for India. It is not merely about diplomatic grandstanding. Since 2014, PM Modi has been making diplomatic and cultural gestures to bolster India-EU relations. There have been increased levels of engagement to secure crucial strategic and economic partnerships between India and the EU member states. While India's relationship with Ukraine may not have been headline-making historically, its implications have not been any less significant. That explains why India has consistently decried Russian aggression against Ukraine.</p>

<p>With his visit to Kyiv, PM Modi may be revealing India's growing transactions with the EU member states for its defence and strategic needs. After all, the Russian manpower and machines have put up a dismal performance in the current theatre. It's high time Indian generals stopped defending the Russian infrastructure just because they, too, are dependent on it and must swear by its fierceness. India has options for its defence and modernisation needs and must use them. After all, what use are partnerships like the Trade and Technology Council (TTC) that the EU set up with India in April 2022?</p>

<h2><strong>Exports From Russia Are Dwindling</strong></h2>

<p>It needs to be brought back into the picture that India's arms procurement from Russia saw a significant drop in the aftermath of Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. The trend has been continuing, and as per the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's latest reports, Russian exports to India have sharply declined from 76% in 2009–2013 to 36% in 2019-2024. While India remains the Russian arms industry's biggest market, it's also shopping from elsewhere, and that cart is getting bigger. A war-stressed Moscow is unlikely to meet New Delhi's growing defence needs owing to the latter's neighbourhood concerns. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Au contraire, other countries are pushing their catalogues for New Delhi to browse. The French are coming hot and sexy with their Rafael jets and a “defence industrial roadmap” to jointly design and develop mechanical infrastructure. India and France have joined hands in building submarines, combat aircraft engines, and multi-role helicopters. Ukraine, accounting for 11% of India's total defence imports, too, is an important partner. India is also deepening defence and security ties with countries like South Korea, South Africa and Poland. It is no coincidence that PM Modi made a pit stop in Poland before heading to Ukraine.</p>

<h2><b>A Wise Move By India</b></h2>

<p>By maintaining its stance of strategic neutrality, India is securing self-interest-driven allies in Europe and Asia without the overlordship of the US. It is a wise move on India's part in keeping with the ever-looming shadow of China in the neighbourhood. &nbsp;The US has exhibited reluctance to share crucial defence technology with India despite promises and agreements, like the one between General Electric and Indian partners for technology to power the new fleet of fighter jets. India knows better than to rely on the US, a country that holds its military-industrial complex dearer than any ideological principle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is clear that India—while being on “the side of peace”—is keeping its national interests above everything else. Mykhailo Podolyak, a presidential adviser in Ukraine, acknowledges that India “really has a certain influence” over Russia. It is this reputation that India aims to, ought to capitalise on in its attempt to emerge as a dependable global negotiator. Only those who have power can negotiate, the rest only nudge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The timing for Modi's Ukraine visit is almost perfect. India is not expected to use a magic wand to bring Moscow and Kyiv to the negotiating table. The military situation remains hot. Even minor dialling down of fighting, if at all, will be enough for India's influence optics. No significant developments in the region can be expected till the US elects its next president. Till the US gets its house in order and views its NATO obligations afresh, the window is open for India to pedal hard towards its strategic goals—choosing realism over idealism and empty talk.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump, touting plans on taxes and health, tried on Friday to turn the page on a week in which he was overshadowed by Kamala Harris and struggled to focus on policy issues instead of personal attacks on his opponent in the US presidential race.</p>

<p>From a lectern at a Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas, the Republican candidate spoke about his plan to eliminate taxes on tips to waiters and other service employees. He discussed his campaign's efforts to court Hispanic voters in Nevada, a battleground state that could help determine the November 5 election, and nationwide.</p>

<p>The tax proposal, a pillar of Trump's economic agenda, is the kind of issue his advisers have been pressing him to focus on, rather than his frequent personal attacks against Vice President Harris' looks, Black and Indian heritage and intelligence, warning they could turn off the moderate voters he needs to win.</p>

<p>At an event in Arizona later, the former president repeated his tax pledge, while promising to set up a commission to investigate presidential assassination attempts. He also said he would install a panel to investigate "an increase in chronic health problems and childhood diseases."</p>

<p>Both proposals are apparent concessions to independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who endorsed Trump at the event after dropping out of the race.</p>

<p>Trump's comments come one day after Harris accepted the Democratic Party's presidential nomination with a muscular speech that laid down broad foreign policy principles and sharp contrasts with Trump with 11 weeks left until Election Day.</p>

<p>Trump sought to counter-program the four-day convention with events of his own around the country, hoping to steal some media attention from Harris. However, his speeches on foreign policy, the economy and crime did little to dislodge the spotlight from Harris and received little attention - a stunning turnabout for a politician used to dominating headlines.</p>

<p>The Republican and his aides hope Thursday's boisterous convention finale marks the end of the honeymoon period for Harris, who emerged as the Democratic candidate little more than a month ago, after President Joe Biden exited the race and endorsed her.</p>

<p>During Harris' acceptance speech in Chicago, Trump attacked her with dozens of posts on his Truth Social platform, calling her a liar, a Marxist and "Comrade Kamala Harris." One post simply asked: "IS SHE TALKING ABOUT ME?"</p>

<p>William Rosenberg, a political science professor at Drexel University, said Trump's personal attacks on Harris underscored his frustration with having to face a biracial woman, a task complicated by his history of making racist remarks.</p>

<p>"His anger and his words speak volumes," Rosenberg said. "He's navigating a path which is full of problems for him."</p>

<p>Harris has surged in the polls since entering the race, with polling aggregator website FiveThirtyEight putting her ahead of Trump in six of seven battleground states.</p>

<p>She is also outraising her Republican counterpart. Her campaign told the Federal Election Commission this week that it raised $204 million last month, compared to $48 million reported to the body by Trump's main fundraising group.</p>

<p>One question still to be answered is whether Harris will also outpace Trump on the trail in the coming weeks. Biden, 81, made relatively few campaign stops, easing pressure on Trump to travel more around the country. That may now change with Harris, 59.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, will travel to Detroit on Monday to address a conference of the National Guard Association of the United States and is scheduled to give a speech at a conservative women's group's annual summit in Washington on Friday.</p>

<p>Campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Trump would hold at least one additional campaign stop between those two events, without providing details.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign has not yet released details of her movements for next week.</p>

<p>Leavitt blamed the media for focusing their stories on Trump's personal attacks, which she said made up a fraction of his otherwise policy-heavy rallies and speeches.</p>

<p>At a speech event on Wednesday in Asheboro, North Carolina, billed as one on national security, Trump said he had rejected the recommendations of his advisers to focus on policy, and he insulted Harris and other Democrats in personal terms.</p>

<p>He again recounted those conversations with advisers at the rally in Arizona on Friday.</p>

<p>"My geniuses, they get paid a fortune - actually not that much - but I call up my people, I say, 'They're knocking the hell out of me, and you say I shouldn't get personal. I have to get personal, don't I?'" Trump said to applause.</p>

<p>An outside adviser to Trump told Reuters on condition of anonymity that several advisers had told the former president that a continued focus on insults rather than policy could doom his chances in November.</p>

<p>Republican strategist Doug Heye said Trump could still win the race, which he predicted would be close, but to do that he should focus on inflation, illegal immigration and other issues that polling shows many voters give him higher marks on.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About five million people in Bangladesh were stranded by floods in low-lying areas, as strong currents washed away river embankments.</p>

<p>The death count rose to 15 as at least five rivers in the South Asian nation faced the severest flooding since 2018, according to government data. Eleven districts were affected.</p>

<p>The devastating floods are the latest setback for the country of 170 million people, recently besieged with deadly political protests and violence. An interim government led by Nobel prize winner Muhammad Yunus took over after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country earlier this month amid a student-led mass uprising.</p>

<p>"These are the worst floods we have seen in three decades," Liakath Ali, director of climate change at non-governmental organization BRAC, said in a statement. "There are people stranded across the country, and we are expecting the situation to worsen in many places as rains continue."</p>

<p>The government is rushing food and emergency medical supplies to the people marooned in the flooded areas. Authorities opened 3,176 shelters for flood victims and deployed 639 medical teams.</p>

<p>Breakdowns in telecommunications, interruptions to transport, and flooded roads and highways are complicating rescue efforts, according to BRAC.</p>

<p>"People had no time to save anything," Ali said. "Entire villages, all of the families who lived in them, and everything they owned - homes, livestock, farmlands, fisheries - have been washed away."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla vice president Sreela Venkataratnam, who appears to have worked at the automaker since 2013, has quit. Announcing her departure in a LinkedIn Post this week, Ms Venkataratnam said she was leaving the company after 11 years to take a break and spend "quality time with family, reconnect with old friends, and focus on personal well-being". She praised the company and described her journey at the firm as "nothing short of extraordinary", but, in the comments below, she said working there was "not for the faint of heart".&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to her LinkedIn profile, Ms Venkataratnam was Tesla's Vice President of Finance and Business Operations. She worked at Tesla since early 2013. Her 11-year tenure began as Director of Finance Operation, and two years later, she moved up to the post of Senior Director of Finance. She then held the vice president position from June 2019 to June 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"After 11 incredible years, I bid farewell to Tesla. Reflecting on this journey, it has been nothing short of extraordinary," Ms Venkataratnam wrote. She further expressed her pride at the company's growth during that time to become the $700 billion colossus it is today, adding that she would take a break before seeking other opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="1040" src="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:share:7231815864000339968" title="Embedded post" width="504"></iframe></p>

<p>"I joined as Director of Finance Operations in early 2013, when Tesla was a company with less than $1B in yearly revenues, a market cap of -$4B and less than 3000 cars delivered in a year," she said. "Leaving as a Vice President (one of only two women VPs in the company) with annual revenues soaring close to $100B, market cap to $700B (reaching $1T during the pandemic) and cars delivered in a year to more than 1.8 million, I am proud of how much we've achieved together," Ms Venkataratnam added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further, she expressed that she is "profoundly grateful to the incredible champions, including some who are no longer with the company, my teammates and colleagues who supported me and my team throughout this journey". "Your integrity, dedication and collaboration were instrumental in our shared success," she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In response to a comment from Jason Wheeler, Tesla's former Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Ms Venkataratnam also wrote that working for Tesla is "definitely not for the fault of heart".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You did it right, Sreela. Congrats on an amazing run at a company that wasn't always easy to work at. Bravo!" Mr Wheeler wrote. Responding to this, Ms Venkataratnam expressed gratitude to Mr Wheeler and agreed with him. "It is definitely not for the faint of heart! It was great working with you especially during those tough days!" she wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://fortune.com/2024/08/21/tesla-elon-musk-veteran-resigned/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Fortune</em></a>, Ms Venkataratnam is one of several Tesla senior employees who quit in recent months. During the month of April, three executives quit in the space of two weeks, including longtime vice president of investor relations Martin Viecha; senior vice president Drew Baglino; and Rohan Patel, vice president of public policy and business development.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has approved a possible foreign military sale of anti-submarine warfare Sonobuoys and related equipment to India at an estimated cost of USD 52.8 million.</p>

<p>The Defence Security Cooperation Agency delivered the required certification, notifying Congress of this possible sale today, the US Defence Security Cooperation Agency said in a release.</p>

<p>Notably, the Defence Security Cooperation Agency is an agency within the United States Department of Defence.</p>

<p>"The Government of India has requested to buy AN/SSQ-53G High Altitude Anti-Submarine Warfare (HAASW) sonobuoys; AN/SSQ-62F HAASW sonobuoys; AN/SSQ-36 sonobuoys; technical and publications and data documentation; US Government and contractor engineering and technical support; and other related elements of logistics and program services and support. The estimated total cost is USD 52.8 million," the agency stated.</p>

<p>This proposed sale will support US' foreign policy and national security objectives by helping to strengthen the United States-India strategic relationship and improving the security of a major defence partner that continues to be an important force for political stability, peace, and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia regions.</p>

<p>The proposed sale will also improve India's capability to meet current and future threats by enhancing its capacity to conduct anti-submarine warfare operations from its MH-60R helicopters. India will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces.</p>

<p>The agency further added that the proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region.</p>

<p>The principal contractor(s) will be Sparton Corporation, located in De Leon Springs, FL, or Undersea Sensor Systems Inc. (USSI), located in Columbia City, IN, or a combination of both. There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale, it added.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Actor Mallika Sherawat applauded US Vice President Kamala Harris on her 'self-made' political career after she was named as the Democratic Party's official candidate for the US Presidential elections.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Actor Mallika Sherawat applauded US Vice President Kamala Harris on her 'self-made' political career after she was named as the Democratic Party's official candidate for the US Presidential elections. "Coming from India, female politicians are so rare. If they are there, they come from a very dynastic or royal family. Here I was meeting a lady who had built everything with her own two hands," Sherawat told Vanity Fair in an interview.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 'Welcome' actor had incidentally hinted in 2009 that Kamala Harris could go on to become the US President, a post that has gone viral again.</p>

<p>"Having fun at a fancy event with a woman who they say could be US President, Kamala Harris. Chicks rule," Sherawat had posted on X (formerly Twitter) in 2009. It was a prescient remark, made well before Harris, then a San Francisco attorney, became the Democratic presidential nominee. Her resurfaced tweet has sparked a buzz on social media with some people calling Mallika Sherawat a clairvoyant.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Having fun at a fancy event with a woman who they say could be US President, Kamala Harris. Chicks rule!</p>
— Mallika Sherawat (@mallikasherawat) <a href="https://twitter.com/mallikasherawat/status/2288254299?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 23, 2009</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The meeting between the two took place when Sherawat was playing a character inspired by Harris in an indie film 'Politics of Love' (2011).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sherawat, who attended a Beverly Hills fundraiser for Harris in 2009, recalled feeling out of place at the event. She said Harris made her feel comfortable, advising her to get out of her comfort zone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I was feeling like a fish out of water. It was my first time in LA, and she really put me at ease. I remember her saying that getting out of your comfort zone is good to build character and it will make you a stronger person," she told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/kamala-harris-inspired-a-character-in-a-movie-youll-probably-never-see-politics-of-love" rel="no follow no index">Vanity Fair.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>"For want of a better term, she was like one of us-a normal person with inspiring goals," the 47-year-old actor added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris is now the Democratic Presidential candidate for the November 2024 US elections, following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race last month. This development has led to former President Donald Trump becoming the oldest candidate in the race, and has resulted in a series of personal attacks on Harris from Trump.</p>

<p>Mallika Sherawat has worked in several movies which hit commercial success in Bollywood. Her first hit was Anurag Basu's 'Murder' (2004). She was also seen in popular Bollywood hits such as 'Pyarr Ke Side Effects' (2006), 'Welcome' (2007), and 'Guru' (2007). She was last seen in a 2021 comedy-drama 'RK/RKay'.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking of the film 'Politics of Love' (2011), one of the producers Govind Menon said, "At that time, the Democrat-Republican divide wasn't as toxic and as horrible as it is now. I don't think that we would've made that movie now."</p>

<p>Mallika Sherawat played the character of a campaign worker for Barrack Obama in the film. This character was inspired by Kamala Harris serving as an interesting footnote in the trajectory of her political career from being a district attorney to vouching for a 'new America' while accepting the presidential nominee at the Democratic Convention on Thursday.</p>

<p>Mallika Sherawat also recalls "casually asking" of Harris, "Do you think, Kamala, you could be president one day?" To which Harris had confidently responded, "Why not?" &nbsp;If she wins, Kamala Harris will not only make history by becoming the first woman US President but also the first black woman to do so.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Royal Bank of Canada said an employee it fired over an intimate relationship with its former chief financial officer was focused on leveraging that alleged romance for his own personal advancement within the firm.</p>

<p>The bank filed a statement of defense and countersuit on Friday against Ken Mason, a former employee in RBC's treasury department, who was dismissed in April at the same time as then-CFO <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/royal-bank-of-canada-fires-cfo-over-undisclosed-close-relationship-with-another-employee-5403350" target="_blank">Nadine Ahn</a>.</p>

<p>Canada's biggest lender alleges that Mason and Ahn carried out a close personal relationship for more than a decade. That relationship crossed the line on a number of occasions, the bank says in its court documents - including when Ahn helped Mason get large raises that took his pay to almost C$1.2 million ($888,000) last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mason and Ahn are each suing RBC for wrongful dismissal. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"To Mr. Mason's knowledge, and at his urging, Ms. Ahn misused her power as CFO to bestow significant compensation increases and, ultimately, an executive-level promotion upon Mr. Mason, as part of a 'Project Ken' the two were pursuing together while in an undisclosed close personal relationship," the bank said in its latest court filing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A week ago, the bank made similar claims against Ahn.</p>

<p>Lawyers for Mason and Ahn did not immediately reply to requests for comment on Friday afternoon. In their lawsuits, they said they did not have a romantic relationship and were just friends. Ahn said the bank subjected her to "palpable reputational harm" and "public humiliation" when it fired her. Mason has said the bank would not have handled the situation in the same fashion if the two were both men.</p>

<p>A representative for RBC declined to comment and referred back to its earlier statements on the cases. The bank has previously said it hired external legal counsel to conduct an investigation after receiving an anonymous complaint in March that Ahn and Mason had been seen together and were having a relationship.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Compensation Increases</strong></h3>

<p>The bank alleges that Mason's total compensation for fiscal 2023 was C$1.18 million, up 70% from what he was making when Ahn was promoted to CFO in November 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Friday's filing includes many of the same allegations RBC has put forward in the Ahn lawsuit - including descriptions of how the two bankers regularly met outside of work for cocktails, called each other by pet names, swapped romantic poetry and sent text messages saying they loved each other.</p>

<p>When RBC confronted Mason with evidence of the undisclosed relationship on April 5, he denied they had an intimate relationship and said they were merely "work friends," the bank said in court documents. Mason went on to say he had been underpaid for his role and advocated for more money, often multiple times per year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mason claimed his promotion to vice-president was "merit-based" and that Ahn had not influenced it, the bank stated in the court filing. "This was not true: in fact, Mr. Mason's promotion to Vice President was a centrepiece of 'Project Ken,' on which Mr. Mason and Ms. Ahn closely collaborated," RBC said.</p>

<p>Ahn is seeking almost C$50 million in pay and damages, while Mason is suing the bank for more than C$20 million in pay and damages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In its counterclaims against both Ahn and Mason, RBC is seeking to claw back what it calls "excess compensation" paid to Mason as a result of Ahn's interventions on his behalf.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is also looking to recover certain bonus payments made to them as well as other damages and costs. That could include compensation owed to another employee, who was allegedly fired by Ahn after that person raised concerns about Mason's pay.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Tokyo-based television news anchor was fired from her job and faced online backlash after a controversial post on social media in which she criticised men's hygiene habits. According to the <em>South China Morning Post (SCMP)</em>, Yuri Kawaguchi, 29, is a freelance announcer known for her feminist views. She also works as a lecturer on harassment prevention. She faced severe backlash online after she claimed that men's body odour was hard to endure and suggested they shower more often.</p>

<p>In a now-deleted post on X (formerly Twitter), Ms Kawaguchi voiced her frustration about men's hygiene during the sweltering summer months, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/gender-diversity/article/3275405/feminist-japan-tv-anchor-fired-raising-stink-over-hard-endure-mens-body-odour" rel="noindex, nofollow">outlet</a>. "I'm really sorry if there's a personal situation, but the smell of men in the summer or the body odour of unsanitary people is so uncomfortable," she wrote, advising men to shower more frequently and use deodorant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I want to be clean, so I take several showers a day, use freshening wipes, and apply sweat inhibitors year-round. I think more men should do this," the 29-year-old added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Kawaguchi's post, perceived as discriminatory against men, offended many online. "Only blaming men is infuriating and undoubtedly discrimination. Women, especially older women, can have body odour too. I'm really uncomfortable with this," one social media user wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her post also prompted scrutiny of her private life, including her divorce. She was labelled as a "materialistic woman out of touch with the struggles of ordinary people".&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the controversy escalated, Ms Kawaguchi issued a public apology and removed the post. &nbsp;"This time, because of my careless remarks, many people were upset and hurt. I will deeply reflect on this. In the future, I will work hard not to hurt anyone with my remarks. I am really sorry," she said.</p>

<p>However, the apology did little to quell the uproar. VOICE, the agency that managed Ms Kawaguchi, announced that it was terminating her contract, citing "defamation of the honour of the opposite sex" as the reason. In a statement, the agency said it had received numerous complaints and emails, and stressed that it was against their principles for a professional to use language that harms others and causes discomfort.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another firm which hired the anchor as a lecturer for harassment prevention education also terminated her contract. But the decision of these two companies was criticised by Japanese netizens as "too extreme". While some said that the 29-year-old's dismissal shows a mirror to the challenges faced by women in a male-dominated society in Japan, most were not kind.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A woman asks men to be tidy and maintain decorum, yet it triggers outrage. It just shows that Japan has been a male-dominated society for too long. No matter how dirty men are, as soon as a woman complains, they punish her," one person wrote.</p>

<p>"Why are Japanese men so sensitive? They cannot handle a bit of criticism. Women are expected to maintain beauty, cleanliness, and fitness without complaint, yet men face no such expectations. If that isn't gender bias, then what is?" said another.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In her acceptance speech for the Democratic nomination, Kamala Harris vowed to resist the influence of authoritarian leaders, who she implied have allegedly manipulated Donald Trump's foreign policy by appealing to his autocratic tendencies. In a bid to position herself against Republican frontrunner Trump, Harris is stressing her resolve on national security, portraying the billionaire as a riskier alternative.</p>

<p>In her speech, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-donald-trump-race-to-us-election-photo-finish-6400682" target="_blank">Harris</a> made it abundantly clear that her presidency would mark a definitive break from the Trump era, particularly in foreign policy. "I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators," she declared.</p>

<p>As Dr Sweta Chakraborty, a Climate Surrogate for the Harris campaign, explains, Harris's approach to policy formation is rooted in a clear-eyed assessment of the threats facing the country, both from foreign adversaries and from within. Dr Chakraborty, who has been closely involved in the campaign and was present at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago, noted that Harris's message is resonating strongly with Indian-Americans and other minority communities who see in her as their leader.</p>

<h3><strong>Indian-American Perspective</strong></h3>

<p>"Kamala Harris is polling a few points ahead of Donald Trump and will surely get a surge following the DNC. Indian-Americans like myself are banding together and supporting her through various efforts and speciality collaborations. For example, we are raising funds through 'South Asians in Climate' after the DNC and ahead of the 'Harris for President Climate Group' official launch this September. South Asians are in. Climate voters are in, and as a South Asian climate surrogate, I represent both voter groups that broadly support Kamala Harris for President," Dr Chakraborty told NDTV.</p>

<p>Born in Oakland, California in 1964, Harris's father is Donald Harris, a man of Afro-Jamaican descent while his mother is Shyamala Gopalan, who emigrated to the US at the age of 19 to pursue her doctorate in nutrition and endocrinology.</p>

<p>"Having a President who shares ancestry with South Asians in America shows that South Asian immigrants and their offspring have a clear place in America. A daughter of India can make it to the highest elected office in the United States, which shows that the sky is the limit for the Indian diaspora in the US. Indians in the US already enjoy the status as the highest-earning demographic. An Indian will elevate that status and make history for minorities and women more broadly," Dr Chakraborty said.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The Usha Vance Factor</strong></h3>

<p>However, Harris is not the only Indian-American whose name and image are plastered across the US presidential campaign. Over at the Republican camp, Trump's Vice President pick JD Vance's wife is Usha Vance who traces her roots to Andhra Pradesh's Vadluru.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Usha's father, Chilukuri Radhakrishnan, was brought up in Chennai but went to the US to pursue higher studies. Usha was raised in San Diego, California and she met JD Vance at Yale Law School before getting married in 2014.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Usha Vance and her husband are trading in their morals for power," Dr Chakraborty alleged. "It is clear they had authentically shared liberal values with friends and classmates from university, but edited and adjusted their stances to maneuver in the conservative party, which they perceived would be the easier route to power."</p>

<h3><strong>Kamala Harris vs Donald Trump&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Dr Chakraborty highlighted a stark contrast between Harris and Trump: where Trump has prioritised tax breaks for billionaires and deregulation of corporate polluters, Harris has pledged to hold the oil and gas industry accountable, invest in a clean energy economy, and ensure that the benefits of climate action are shared by all Americans, not just the wealthy elite.</p>

<p>When Harris ran for vice president in 2020, her climate plan was even more aggressive than what ultimately passed during Joe Biden's presidency as the Inflation Reduction Act - a landmark climate legislation in American history. Now, as she prepares to release her full climate agenda in September, Harris is positioning herself as the 'Climate President' for the United States, Dr Chakraborty said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"As an Indian woman, she also represents members of American society that have been historically disenfranchised. She is physically the opposite of Biden and represents the ascendency of women and a future society that is more equitable and fair to all genders and races," she said.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A retired judge of Bangladesh's Supreme Court was detained from the northeastern frontier with India in Sylhet while he was allegedly attempting to flee the country, the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) said late on Friday.</p>

<p>The report came hours after the arrest of Awami League leader ASM Firoz from his residence.</p>

<p>The BGB headquarters, in an SMS, informed reporters that they have detained former top appellate division judge of the Supreme Court Shamsuddin Chowdhury Manik as he was trying to cross over to India through Sylhet's Kanaighat border.</p>

<p>Newspaper Prothom Alo said Manik was kept at a BGB outpost till midnight citing the camp's in-charge.</p>

<p>Bangladesh descended into chaos after ousted premier Sheikh Hasina's government collapsed and she fled to India on August 5 amid violent protests over quota for government jobs, while the Army stepped in to fill the power vacuum.</p>

<p>Before that, anti-government protests had killed more than 500 people since mid-July. Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took oath as the Chief Adviser of the interim government on August 8.</p>

<p>Since August 5, a number of leaders of the deposed regime, including senior ministers, have been arrested -- many of them on murder charges.</p>

<p>The Bangladesh Army has earlier said that several hundred leaders of Hasina's Awami League and others have been sheltered in cantonments as their lives were at risk.</p>

<p>Former law minister Anisul Huq and the ex-premier's private sector affairs adviser Salman F Rahman were the first to be arrested from Dhaka's main river port Sadarghat terminal area as they were allegedly trying to leave Dhaka on a boat.</p>

<p>A number of members of Hasina's cabinet, including former foreign minister Hassan Mahmud and former social welfare minister Dipu Moni, several lawmakers and leaders of Awami League and its allies, including pro-left Workers Party chairman Rashed Khan Menon, and a number of recently sacked military and civil officials have been arrested.</p>

<p>This included sacked major general Ziaul Hassan, who was serving as the head of the government's telecommunications system, and Chittagong Port Authority chairman rear admiral Mohammad Sohail, who once was the spokesman of the elite anti-crime Rapid Action Battalion.</p>

<p>A TV journalist couple Farzana Rupa and her husband Shakil Ahmed have also been arrested.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A female intern in Vietnam recently resigned from her job after an older male colleague allegedly threatened to kiss her at a company team-building event. According to the <em>South China Morning Post (SCMP)</em>, the woman, identified as Huynh Anh My, said that during an internship last year, she took part in a mandatory event with a company in Hanoi. However, after she was forced to play a "weird, perverted" game at the boozy event, she resigned from the firm, saying that the incident made her feel so anxious and terrified that she could not face anyone at the office.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Huynh said that the team-building event was mandatory for all. Skipping the seaside trip would have resulted in penalties or extra work, she told a local Vietnamese news outlet, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3275417/shocked-vietnam-woman-resigns-after-kiss-threat-older-colleague-team-building-event" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>SCMP</em></a>. She said that she and her colleagues were on the beach taking part in a water-carrying competition when she began to feel tired.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The weather was scorching, and I was exhausted from hauling buckets of water. I noticed that a female colleague sat to rest but was playfully pushed into the sea by a male colleague. I could not help but think, this is torture, not team-building," Ms Huynh said.</p>

<p>After the competition, the intern said that her team leader suggested everyone play a drinking game. "A male colleague, about the same age as my father said if I did not finish three glasses of alcohol in one go, I had to kiss him," she said.</p>

<p>Ms Huynh was aghast and wondered to herself why there were such "weird, perverted games". She said that the male colleague then walked over to her, grabbed her hand, and insisted she drink.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I burst into tears because he kept getting close to my face and I was so scared. It wasn't until I managed to drink all three glasses that he finally stopped and moved on to another girl," she continued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"After this, I was terrified and anxious for days, and I could not face anyone at the company. Eventually, I resigned," the woman told the outlet. She also said that before resigning, she reported the incident to her supervisor but received no feedback.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Huynh's story has gone viral online. "This is sexual harassment. Team-building activities should be gentle and respectful to all employees," wrote one user. "Not only young women, but people of any age and gender can experience workplace harassment," said another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In my previous company, I had to carry a female colleague in a princess-style during a group activity, and both of us felt very uncomfortable with it," shird a third user.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four jail staffers were killed after a group of prisoners staged a violent revolt at the high-security IK-19 Surovikino penal colony in Russia's Volgograd region on Friday. The prisoners, armed with knives and claiming allegiance to the so-called Islamic State (ISIS), took hostages and temporarily seized control of a section of the prison, leading to a dramatic and deadly standoff with Russian special forces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The crisis began during what was supposed to be a routine disciplinary commission meeting, a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2yp4gg0z5o">report </a>said. As the meeting was in progress, a group of inmates, later identified as Ramzidin Toshev (28) Rustamchon Navruzi (23), Nazirchon Toshov (28) and Temur Khusinov (29), launched their attack. All four men, hailing from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, slashed guards with knives, injuring several and taking eight prison employees and four fellow convicts hostage.</p>

<p>During the siege, an image circulated on social media, showing an inmate holding a knife over a bloodied prison guard. Another video showed the attackers in the prison yard where one of their hostages was in a sitting position with his face covered in blood. In videos released by the attackers, they declared their allegiance to ISIS and claimed the attack was an act of revenge for the persecution of Muslims.</p>

<p>As the situation escalated, Russian special forces, including heavily armed troops and elite snipers from the Rosgvardia National Guard, were deployed to the scene. The prison, located in the remote town of Surovikino, approximately 850 kilometres south of Moscow, became a battleground.</p>

<p>After hours of tense negotiations and strategic planning, the special forces stormed the facility. In the ensuing operation, all four attackers were shot dead by snipers, effectively ending the standoff. However, four prison employees lost their lives, with three killed on the spot and a fourth succumbing to injuries in the hospital. Additionally, several other guards and prisoners sustained injuries, some of which were severe.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Snipers of the special forces of the Russian National Guard in the Volgograd region, with four precise shots, neutralised four prisoners who had taken prison employees hostage. The hostages have been released," said state news agency RIA, quoting the national guard.</p>

<p>This marks the second such incident in recent months, following a similar hostage-taking event in June at a prison in the Rostov region, where ISIS-affiliated prisoners also attempted a revolt, resulting in the deaths of five prisoners and the capture of one.</p>

<p>In response to the Volgograd standoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin was briefed during a virtual meeting with security chiefs, where it was confirmed that the situation posed no immediate threat to the civilian population. "Everyone on our territory is obliged to respect and comply with the laws of Russia. We will not allow anyone to try to incite ethnic discord," said Volgograd's regional governor, Andrei Bocharov.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday and announced a new round of military aid for Kyiv that the Pentagon valued at $125 million.</p>

<p>The call between the two leaders came ahead of Ukraine's independence day, and on the same day that Washington announced sweeping sanctions against hundreds of individuals and companies tied to Russia's invasion of the country.</p>

<p>"I am proud we will announce a new package of military aid for Ukraine today," Biden said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The package includes air defense missiles to protect Ukraine's critical infrastructure; counter-drone equipment and anti-armor missiles to defend against Russia's evolving tactics on the battlefield; and ammunition for frontline soldiers and the mobile rocket systems that protect them," he said.</p>

<p>"Russia will not prevail in this conflict. The independent people of Ukraine will prevail -- and the United States, our allies, and our partners, will continue to stand with them every step of the way," Biden added.</p>

<p>The US Defense Department later said the package is worth $125 million and consists of items drawn from American stocks, providing Kyiv with "additional capabilities to meet its most urgent needs."</p>

<p>Zelensky praised the military aid announcement, saying there is an especially urgent requirement for air defenses.</p>

<p>"I welcomed the new US military aid package and emphasized that Ukraine urgently requires the delivery of weapons from the announced packages, particularly additional air defense systems, to reliably protect our cities, communities and critical infrastructure," he said in a post on X.</p>

<p>The United States has been a key military backer of Ukraine, committing more than $55 billion in weapons, ammunition and other security aid since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.</p>

<p>- New sanctions on Russia -</p>

<p>The latest aid announcement comes as Ukrainian troops press an attack into Russia's western Kursk region -- an offensive that is the most serious attack by a foreign army on Russian territory since World War II.</p>

<p>Earlier on Friday, the US Treasury, State and Commerce departments announced new sanctions that build on a raft of existing measures enacted against Russia over the invasion.</p>

<p>The sanctions target nearly 400 individuals and entities both inside and outside of Russia "whose products and services enable Russia to sustain its war effort and evade sanctions," the US Treasury Department announced in a statement.</p>

<p>Among those sanctioned were 60 Russia-based defense and technology firms "critical for the sustainment and development of Russia's defense industry," it added.</p>

<p>The State Department said in a separate statement that it was responsible for 190 of the sanctions, and that Treasury was responsible for close to 200 others.</p>

<p>It added that its designations "aim to disrupt sanctions evasion and target entities in multiple third countries," including China, along with businesses supporting the development of Russian energy projects.</p>

<p>Alongside the sanctions unveiled Friday, the Commerce Department announced it was taking "aggressive action" to further restrict the supply of items made in the United States, or labeled as such, to both Russia and Belarus, due to "the Kremlin's illegal war on Ukraine."</p>

<p>"Today's actions will further constrain Russia's ability to arm its military by targeting illicit procurement networks designed to circumvent global export controls," the department said in a statement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American forces killed a senior leader of an Al-Qaeda-affiliated militant group in a strike in Syria on Friday, the US military said.</p>

<p>The strike targeted Abu Abdul Rahman al-Makki, who was "a Hurras al-Din Shura Council member and senior leader responsible for overseeing terrorist operations from Syria," the US Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a social media post.</p>

<p>"Hurras al-Din is an Al-Qaeda-associated force based in Syria that shares Al-Qaeda's global aspirations to conduct attacks against US and Western interests," CENTCOM said.</p>

<p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor had earlier said that a drone strike on a motorcycle in the southern Idlib countryside had killed Makki, who it said was a Saudi national.</p>

<p>The US military has around 900 troops in Syria as part of the international coalition against the Islamic State group. The coalition was established in 2014 to help combat the jihadists, who had taken over vast swathes of Iraq and Syria.</p>

<p>American forces periodically carry out strikes in Syria targeting militants from IS -- which has since lost the territory it once held -- and other jihadist groups that are deemed to pose a threat.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Several individuals were killed on Friday night when a man stabbed passers-by at random with a knife at a city festival in the western German city of Solingen, newspaper Bild reported.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three people were killed and four others seriously wounded in a stabbing attack at a festival on Friday night in the western German city of Solingen, police said.</p>

<p>They said that at around 10 p.m. (2000 GMT) a single, unidentified man attacked multiple people and that the perpetrator was still at large.</p>

<p>"It tears my heart apart that there was an attack on our city. I have tears in my eyes when I think of those we have lost," Solingen Mayor Tim-Oliver Kurzbach said in a statement. "I pray for all those who are still fighting for their lives."</p>

<p>Fatal stabbings and shootings in Germany are relatively uncommon.</p>

<p>The police said the attack occurred at a festival to honour the town's 650th anniversary.</p>

<p>Solingen is in North Rhine-Westphalia state, Germany's most populous and bordering the Netherlands.</p>

<p>The state's interior minister, Herbert Reul, visited the scene, telling reporters it was a targeted attack on human life but declining to speculate on the motive.</p>

<p>The attack occurred at the Fronhof, the mayor's statement said, a market square where live bands were playing.</p>

<p>The German government has been aiming to toughen rules on knives that can be carried in public by reducing the length allowed.</p>

<p>In June, a 29-year-old policeman died after being stabbed in the German city of Mannheim during an attack on a right-wing demonstration.</p>

<p>There was a stabbing attack on a train in 2021, injuring several.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday said he looks forward to visiting India as it can be a "key" in the global diplomatic efforts to end the war between his country and Russia.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday said he looks forward to visiting India as it can be a "key" in the global diplomatic efforts to end the war between his country and Russia.</p>

<p>"India (is a) big influential country, not only in the world (but) also through the circle of very skeptical countries. If we will change India's attitude to this war and to Russia, we will stop the war, because Putin will want to stop it," Zeleskyy said in reply to a question while interacting with the visiting Indian media.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian president described Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first visit to Kyiv as "historic." During their bilateral talks, PM Modi invited Zelenskyy to visit India.</p>

<p>"Modi's visit was historic," and added: "I very much need your country on our side, not balancing between the US and Russia." PM Modi's nearly nine-hour visit to Ukraine, the first by an Indian prime minister since Ukraine's independence in 1991, came six weeks after he held summit talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in July in Moscow.</p>

<p>During the bilateral talks, PM Modi had earlier told Zelenskyy that both Ukraine and Russia should sit together without wasting time to find ways to end the ongoing war and that India had been on the side of peace since the beginning of the conflict in February 2022.</p>

<p>"When you begin a strategic partnership, and you begin some dialogue, you don't need to lose time. That's why I think it will be good to meet together again, and if our meeting will be in India, I'll be happy," Zelenskyy said.</p>

<p>"I think, to understand a country is to understand people also. It's better to be in your country because to find the key to your country and to your Prime Minister is to see your people and I need very much to find the key to your country, because I very much need your country on our side, not balancing between the US and Russia," he said.</p>

<p>"It's not about your historical choice, but who knows, maybe your country can be the key in this diplomatic influence," he said, adding, "That's why I'll be happy to come to India as soon as your government, Prime Minister (PM Modi) will be ready to see me." Replying to another question, he said, "We want him (PM Modi) very much to have peace summits, and of course we will be happy to work on it and of course, if he has his ideas, we will be happy to discuss it.</p>

<p>"But we don't change our territories on any propositions ... we don't change our people to any propositions, our territories our values and our freedom and democracy to any propositions ... we will not change," he said.</p>

<p>"PM Modi wants peace more than Putin. The problem is Putin doesn't want (peace). I don't know what they spoke during their meeting. But I ...." Zelenskyy said and shrugged with an expression of exasperation.</p>

<p>Asked about the discussion about defence production, Zelenskyy said, "We spoke basically about some technologies (but) we are open for a very big deal if India will be ready." Answering a question about India not supporting a UN resolution (against Russia some months ago), Zelenskyy said he wanted to forgo what happened in the past and "before new resolutions, we have to speak, we have to make more strong relations between our country (and India) before new decisions." "We will not have big challenges in our relations in the future. And I will focus on it, on future relations between our countries," he added.</p>

<p>Pointing out that there are very significant contracts between India and Russia vis-a-vis oil, the Ukrainian president said, "Putin is afraid of losing the economy, he has nothing except for oil, his main currency is oil. They do have a kind of energy-based economy, and they're export-oriented." "So, the countries importing energy resources from the Russian Federation, then they will be helping the whole world," he added.</p>

<p>On Indian citizens in Ukrainian prison, Zelenskyy denied there were any but added that if there were, he would release them and immediately inform PM Modi.</p>

<p>He said he read media reports about the death of some Indian nationals working for the Russian Army in its war with Ukraine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said on Friday he would suspend his campaign, and endorsed Republican Donald Trump.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said on Friday he would suspend his campaign, and endorsed Republican Donald Trump, likely ending a presidential bid that he began as a Democrat trading on one of the most famous names in American politics.</p>

<p>His campaign indicated that he feared staying in the race would siphon support from former President Trump, who is locked in a tight contest with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>An environmental lawyer, anti-vaccine activist and son and nephew of two titans of Democratic politics who were assassinated during the turbulent 1960s, Kennedy entered the race in April 2023 as a challenger to President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination.</p>

<p>With voters at the time turned off by both the aging Biden and the legally embattled Trump, interest in Kennedy soared. He shifted his plans and decided to run as an independent, and a November 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Kennedy drawing the support of 20% of Americans in a three-way race with Biden and Trump.</p>

<p>He ran a high-profile advertisement during the February 2024 Super Bowl that invoked his father, U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and uncle, U.S. President John F. Kennedy, and drew outrage from much of his high-profile family, who condemned his campaign.</p>

<p>For a time, both the Biden and Trump campaigns showed signs they were worried that Kennedy could draw enough support to change the election outcome. He faced an uphill battle in winning spots on the ballot as an independent but secured key positions including in Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota and North Carolina -- half of the competitive swing states expected to determine the election's outcome.</p>

<p>But as the race changed quickly in the last two months -- with Trump surviving an assassination attempt and the 81-year-old Biden bowing to pressure from his own party and passing the campaign torch to Harris -- voter interest in Kennedy, 70, waned.</p>

<p>An Ipsos poll early this month showed his national support had fallen to 4%, a tiny number, but one that could still be meaningful in a tight race such as the current Trump-Harris matchup.</p>

<p>His campaign had signaled over the past few days that a change was coming, as Kennedy set his Phoenix address. His running mate Nicole Shanahan said in an interview earlier that if the pair stayed in the race as independents, they could ultimate boost Harris' chances.</p>

<p>In exchange for endorsing Trump, Kennedy was hoping for a job in a potential Trump administration, a super PAC supporting Kennedy told Reuters on Wednesday. He also wanted Trump to allow his political movement to continue in some fashion, which could include staying on the ballot in some states.</p>

<p>Kennedy painted himself as a political outsider. He told Reuters in an interview in March that if elected president he would not restrict abortion, would repeal many provisions of Biden's signature Inflation Reduction Act and would seek to close down the southern border to immigrants entering the U.S. illegally. He also offered staunch support for Israel.</p>

<p>Trump mega-donor Timothy Mellon, an 82-year-old banking heir, has given millions of dollars this election cycle in support of Kennedy, and given $75 million in support of Trump, according to Federal Election Commission filings through July 31.</p>

<p>Shanahan has donated over $15 million to the Kennedy campaign, FEC filings showed.</p>

<p>In a video of a phone call posted online last month, Trump suggested to Kennedy that the independent candidate could do something to support the Trump campaign. Soon after, both candidates spoke a day apart from each other at a bitcoin conference in Nashville, trying to court votes.</p>

<p>BEAR, BRAIN WORMS &nbsp;</p>

<p>Kennedy said this month in a video posted online that he dumped a dead bear in New York City's Central Park a decade ago and staged it to look like a bike had hit it. He proclaimed he had "so many skeletons in my closet" after a former family babysitter accused him of sexual assault. He denied that a picture of him posing with the barbecued carcass of a large animal belonged to a canine.</p>

<p>And then there was the brain worm. Kennedy had a parasite in his brain more than a decade ago, but has since fully recovered, a fact unearthed by the New York Times and confirmed by the campaign.</p>

<p>Those stories prompted ridicule from late-night talk show hosts.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party especially has been ruthless in their opposition to Kennedy's candidacy including waging legal challenges against his ballot access, as concern grew that Kennedy could hurt the party's chances in November.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Health Organization declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years, following an outbreak of the viral infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has spread to neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>A new form of the virus, clade Ib, triggered global concern as it seems to be spreading quickly and little is known about the strain. The disease transmits through close contact.</p>

<p>The new strain has spread to at least two countries outside Africa.</p>

<p>The following are the countries that have reported cases of clade Ib mpox:</p>

<p><strong>DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO</strong></p>

<p>Two strains of mpox are spreading in the Democratic Republic of Congo - the endemic clade I and the new clade Ib, which spreads more easily through close contact, including sexual.</p>

<p>As of August 11, DRC has seen a total of 3,235 cases and 19 deaths in 2024. The country has confirmed 38 cases of mpox in the past two weeks, according to WHO data.</p>

<p><strong>SWEDEN</strong></p>

<p>Global health officials on August 15 confirmed an infection with a new strain of the mpox virus in Sweden, the first sign of its spread outside the African continent.</p>

<p>Swedish health officials said at a press conference that the person was infected while in Africa with the clade Ib type of mpox involved in the recent outbreak. The person is receiving treatment.</p>

<p><strong>THAILAND</strong></p>

<p>An mpox case reported in Thailand was confirmed to be of the clade Ib strain of the virus, the first in the country, a disease control official said on Aug. 22.</p>

<p>The case was first reported on Aug. 21, and Thailand had said it was a 66-year-old European man who had arrived from an African country where the disease was spreading.</p>

<p><strong>BURUNDI</strong></p>

<p>As of August 18, Burundi has 153 cases of clade Ib mpox with zero deaths. The country reported 113 cases of clade Ib mpox in the past two weeks, according to WHO data.</p>

<p><strong>KENYA</strong></p>

<p>On July 29, Kenya's health ministry confirmed one case of clade Ib mpox, the first-ever case of mpox identified in the country. No deaths had been reported as of August 8, according to WHO data.</p>

<p><strong>RWANDA</strong></p>

<p>As of August 7, four confirmed clade Ib mpox cases and zero deaths had cumulatively been reported by the country, according to WHO data.</p>

<p><strong>UGANDA</strong></p>

<p>As of August 18, Uganda has identified three cases of clade Ib mpox, with no deaths, according to WHO data. The cases are among the first confirmed mpox cases identified in the country.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Despite China's assurances on debris mitigation, experts worry about the growing risk from such incidents, emphasizing the need for better international regulation.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After accomplishing a noteworthy milestone of launching 18 Qianfan satellites, China's Long March 6A rocket broke apart on August 6, producing almost 300 pieces of trackable debris in low Earth orbit.</p>

<p>The first wave of these satellites was supposed to form China's "own version of Elon Musk's Starlink," the Qianfan ("Thousand Sails") broadband network. The rocket was launched from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Centre, located in the Shanxi Province of North China.</p>

<p>A report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-rocket-space-debris-5e02a603"><em>The Wall Street Journal </em></a>states that the breakup of the rocket generated a new concern over Beijing's attitude towards space junk.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/china-rocket-ends-up-as-300-piece-space-junk-after-satellite-constellation-launch-6297963"><strong>Also Read | China Rocket Ends Up As 300-Piece Space Junk After Satellite Constellation Launch</strong></a><br />
<br />
The report quoted LeoLabs, a US space-tracking firm, as saying the event might create at least 700 fragments floating some 500 miles above earth, making it one of the largest rocket breakups in history. Starlink said the debris didn't pose significant immediate risks to its fleet, but the fragments are “likely to remain in space for decades due to the incident occurring at a high altitude."</p>

<p>China and other countries are pressing ahead with plans to increase rocket launches, raising risks for humans and satellites in orbit. Yet there is little global policing of unsustainable practices.</p>

<p>“Who can enforce anything in space? It's a bit like the Wild West at times," Quentin Parker, director of the Laboratory for Space Research at the University of Hong Kong, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-rocket-space-debris-5e02a603"><em>WSJ.</em></a></p>

<p>Darren McKnight, senior technical fellow at LeoLabs, said China's recent record on generating debris related to Long March 6 launches was worrisome. “I hope it's a wake-up call for them, and they'll be part of the international dialogue," he said.</p>

<p>A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Lin Jian, said last week that China “attaches great importance to space debris mitigation" and “has taken active efforts to fulfill relevant international obligations." Without giving details, he said China took necessary measures after the recent rocket breakup.</p>

<p>It also said in the report that the Chinese activities in space are pointing toward a worrisome tendency in the direction of space junk. In 2022, a rocket stage from China had an uncontrolled re-entry into the Sulu Sea, wherein NASA criticised it for less-than-adequate data provision. Major pieces of junk have been created by Chinese rocket launches, including Long March 6A missions, which are notorious for their bad history. While other countries did better, Chinese behavior was largely responsible for space debris that affects low-Earth orbit environments.</p>]]></content:encoded>

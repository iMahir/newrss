       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US special envoy Amos Hochstein said in Beirut Tuesday that an end to the Israel-Hezbollah war was "now within our grasp" as he met officials to discuss a truce plan largely endorsed by Lebanon.</p>

<p>The United States and France have spearheaded efforts for a ceasefire in the war, which escalated in late September after nearly a year of deadly exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israeli troops.</p>

<p>Israel expanded the focus of its operations from Gaza to Lebanon, vowing to secure its northern border to allow tens of thousands of people displaced by the cross-border fire to return home.</p>

<p>Since the clashes began with Hezbollah's attacks on Israel, more than 3,544 people in Lebanon have been killed, authorities have said.</p>

<p>Most of the deaths have been since late September, among them more than 200 children, according to the United Nations.</p>

<p>After meeting with Hezbollah-allied parliament speaker Nabih Berri, who has led mediation on behalf of the group, Hochstein told reporters he saw "a real opportunity" to end the fighting.</p>

<p>"I'm here in Beirut to facilitate that decision, but it's ultimately the decision of the parties... It is now within our grasp."</p>

<p>Berri told pan-Arab daily Asharq al-Awsat after the meeting that "the situation is good, in principle", adding his team and US representatives still had "some technical details" to settle.</p>

<p>Hochstein also met Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati and army chief Joseph Aoun.</p>

<p>A Lebanon-based diplomat, requesting anonymity, said "progress" had been made in the talks.</p>

<p>A Lebanese official said Monday that the government had "a very positive view" of the truce plan.</p>

<p>But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that Israel would continue to conduct military operations against Hezbollah even if a ceasefire was reached.</p>

<p>"We will be forced to ensure our security in the north (of Israel) and to systematically carry out operations against Hezbollah's attacks... even after a ceasefire", to keep the group from rebuilding, he told parliament.</p>

<p><strong>Deaths in Lebanon, Israel&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Hezbollah began its cross-border attacks in support of its ally Hamas following the Palestinian group's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which sparked the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Hamas's attack resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said the death count from the resulting war had reached 43,972 people, the majority civilians. The United Nations considers the figures reliable.</p>

<p>Of 251 hostages seized during the October 7 attack, 97 remain in Gaza including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Netanyahu, in a video showing him inside Gaza and wearing a flak jacket and helmet, on Tuesday offered a $5-million reward to anyone in the territory "who brings out a hostage".</p>

<p>Since expanding its operations to Lebanon in September, Israel has conducted extensive bombing campaigns primarily targeting Hezbollah strongholds.</p>

<p>The UN said Tuesday that more than 200 children had been killed in Lebanon since Israel escalated its campaign.</p>

<p>"Despite more than 200 children killed in Lebanon in less than two months, a disconcerting pattern has emerged: their deaths are met with inertia from those able to stop this violence," said UN children's agency spokesman James Elder.</p>

<p>Israel has also sent ground troops into southern Lebanon, where it said Tuesday one soldier had been killed in combat and three wounded.</p>

<p>Lebanon's army said three soldiers were killed when Israel struck their position in south Lebanon on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has continued to launch rockets, drones and missiles into Israel almost daily.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Israel's military said some 40 projectiles were fired into central and northern Israel, lightly wounding four people.</p>

<p>That followed salvos on Monday that killed one woman in Shfaram and wounded 10 people there and five in Israel's commercial hub Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said Tuesday it had launched "a salvo of missiles" at the Glilot military intelligence base in the Tel Aviv suburbs.</p>

<p>It said it also attacked Israeli troops in four places in south Lebanon, including near the flashpoint town of Khiam.</p>

<p>The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) later said four Ghanaian peacekeepers were wounded when a rocket, "fired most likely by non-state actors", hit their base.</p>

<p>Another base in Shamma "was impacted by five rockets", UNIFIL said, and elsewhere "an armed person directly fired at" a patrol.</p>

<p>It did not report wounded or specify who was behind those incidents.</p>

<p>Israel's military accused Hezbollah of firing on the peacekeepers.</p>

<p><strong>'Everyone's interest'&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Monday the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the last Hezbollah-Israel war in 2006, was "what we believe is in everyone's interest".</p>

<p>Under the resolution, Lebanese troops and UN peacekeepers should be the only armed forces deployed in south Lebanon, where Hezbollah holds sway.</p>

<p>A Lebanese official said US ambassador Lisa Johnson had discussed the truce plan last week with Mikati and Berri.</p>

<p>If an agreement was reached, he said, the United States and France would issue a joint statement, followed by a 60-day truce during which Lebanon would deploy troops in the south.</p>

<p>However, Eyal Pinko, a retired Israeli navy commander and senior research fellow at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar Ilan University near Tel Aviv, said hopes for a speedy ceasefire were "wishful thinking".</p>

<p>"The most important thing that is required is that there will be no Hezbollah 30 to 40 kilometres (20 to 25 miles) from the border so that Israel can protect itself if there is a ground manoeuvre," Pinko said.</p>

<p>"Iran and Hezbollah would not accept that."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Delhi-based family of Harshita Brella, the 24-year-old found dead in a car boot in east London recently, have called for justice as the UK police continue to hunt for her husband as a suspect in her murder.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Delhi-based family of Harshita Brella, the 24-year-old found dead in a car boot in east London recently, have called for justice as the UK police continue to hunt for her husband as a suspect in her murder and renewed their appeal for information on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Northamptonshire Police released further CCTV images along with a timeline that identifies November 10 as the evening she was killed at her home in Corby, with the preliminary cause of death given as strangulation allegedly by 23-year-old Pankaj Lamba.</p>

<p>"Our inquiries have established that Pankaj Lamba drove a Silver Vauxhall Corsa from Corby to Ilford sometime on the morning of Monday, November 11. We suspect Harshita's body had been placed in the boot of the vehicle by Lamba before leaving Corby. Lamba then abandoned the vehicle in Brisbane Road, Ilford and made his getaway," said Detective Chief Inspector Johnny Campbell, Senior Investigating Officer from the East Midlands Special Operations Major Crime Unit (EMSOU).</p>

<p>"Any information, no matter how small, may be relevant to the investigation and help us get justice for Harshita. Specialist officers continue to provide support to Harshita's family and our thoughts are with them at this extremely difficult time as they try to come to terms with the tragic loss of their daughter and sister," he said.</p>

<p>In an interview with the BBC this week, Brella's mother Sudesh Kumari, father Sabir Brella and sister Sonia Dabas spoke through tears about losing Harshita. Northamptonshire Police had earlier launched an international manhunt for Pankaj Lamba, whom they suspect of murdering his wife earlier this month at her home in Corby before driving her body to London some 145km away and fleeing the country after abandoning the car.</p>

<p>"I want my son-in-law to be brought to justice and I want my daughter's body brought home," Satbir Brella told the BBC in Delhi.</p>

<p>He described his daughter as a simple and serious young woman who wanted to be a teacher. She had married Lamba after an arranged match last year and moved to the UK in April. According to Dabas, her sister worked in a warehouse and Lamba was a student in London.</p>

<p>"She struggled a lot because of her husband," said Dabas, adding that she had asked her sister to "quit and come to India".</p>

<p>"She was a part of me and I was a part of her. I now feel like I can't do anything in life without her," she said.</p>

<p>The family says they had last spoken to Harshita over the phone on November 10, when she told them she had made dinner and was waiting for Lamba to come home. Her phone was then switched off for the next two days and by November 13 they were worried for her safety and asked people they knew to file a complaint. Northamptonshire Police was contacted then regarding concerns for Harshita's welfare, which then led to the discovery of her body and the launch of a murder investigation.</p>

<p>"Our inquiries lead us to suspect that Harshita was murdered in Northamptonshire earlier this month by her husband Pankaj Lamba," said Chief Inspector Paul Cash.</p>

<p>"We suspect Lamba transported Harshita's body from Northamptonshire to Ilford (east London) by car. We believe he has now fled the country... More than 60 detectives are working on the case and are continuing to follow numerous lines of inquiry, including house to house, property searches, CCTV and ANPR (automatic number plate recognition)," he said.</p>

<p>According to the family, Harshita's husband had complained about her failing to make him food on time and said that she was talking to her mother too much. At the end of August, she had phoned her father in India to say she had run away because her husband was violent. The police have since confirmed that Harshita had been the subject of a domestic abuse order, which imposes restrictions on the accused against approaching or threatening the victim.</p>

<p>Her father told the BBC the family hopes her body can be brought home to India so "her soul can get peace and then maybe we will too".</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the police are continuing to appeal for any information that will help "piece together exactly what happened as we work to get justice for Harshita".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a rare visit to Gaza on Tuesday where he said Hamas shall never rule the Palestinian enclave again once the war is over. He also reaffirmed his pledge to annihilate the militant group and said that the Israeli armed forces have destroyed Hamas's military capabilities thoroughly.</p>

<p>Mr Netanyahu, seen in a battle vest and a ballistic helmet, stood at a seaside location in Gaza and recorded a video where he said "Hamas shall not return" and spoke about the Israeli hostages still in captivity.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Netanyahu said that the search for the remaining 101 Israeli hostages still missing in Gaza will continue. He even offered a $5 million reward for the return of each hostage.</p>

<p>He then went on to warn the terrorists by saying "Anyone who dares to harm our hostages will have blood on their head. We will hunt you down and get you."</p>

<p>Mr Netanyahu also said that "Whoever brings us a hostage will find a safe way. So, the choice is yours, but the result will be the same. We'll get them all back."</p>

<p>Benjamin Netanyahu was visiting Gaza to get a first-hand briefing of operational activities on ground by Israel's military. The Defence Minister and Army chief had accompanied him.</p>

<p>Hamas's 2023 attack on Israel marked the country's bloodiest day in its history, with 1,200 people killed and over 250 taken hostage. The attack, which triggered the over-year-long war so far, saw Israel respond with its most destructive offensive in Gaza ever, killing nearly 44,000 people and wounding 103,898, according to the Gaza health ministry, and turning the Strip into a wasteland of rubble with millions desperate for food, fuel, water and sanitation.</p>

<p>Israel, which has since the beginning of the war, targeted and killed several top Hamas leaders, has vowed to destroy the group entirely. While Israel and its Western allies have declared Hamas a terrorist group, Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Iran have been supporting it in its activities.</p>

<p>Hamas's supporters regard them as heroes leading the fight for Palestinian statehood, which had drifted off the international agenda.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[President-elect Donald Trump nominated Howard Lutnick, the co-chair of his transition team, as his commerce secretary on Tuesday -- a choice set to bring a tougher stance on China from the incoming administration.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>US President-elect Donald Trump nominated Howard Lutnick, the co-chair of his transition team, as his commerce secretary on Tuesday -- a choice set to bring a tougher stance on China from the incoming administration.</p>

<p>Lutnick will also lead the country's tariff and trade agenda, with "additional direct responsibility for the Office of the United States Trade Representative," Trump said in a statement.</p>

<p>Tariffs are a key part of Trump's economic agenda and he has promised sweeping duties on all imports when he returns to the White House.</p>

<p>Lutnick is chief executive of financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald and a Trump ally originally tipped as a front-runner for treasury secretary.</p>

<p>But he was instead named to helm Commerce, a smaller department that works to boost American industry and has a key role in policy to shore up the US semiconductor sector and reduce reliance on Asia.</p>

<p>Under President Joe Biden, the Commerce Department stepped up export controls on critical technologies like quantum computing and semiconductor manufacturing goods, taking aim at access by adversaries like Beijing.</p>

<p>Trump's administration could harden this stance.</p>

<p>Lutnick has expressed support for a tariff level of 60 percent on Chinese goods alongside a 10 percent tariff on all other imports.</p>

<p>Both are among proposals that Trump has floated, with the Republican taking aim at countries which have been "ripping us off for years."</p>

<p>In Trump's first term he engaged in a tariffs war with China, with the US Trade Representative's office issuing duties on imports from the world's second-biggest economy.</p>

<p>Lutnick also previously lamented the loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States and offshoring to China.</p>

<p>"I'm all in with Donald Trump," Lutnick told podcaster Anthony Pompliano last month.</p>

<p>In the same interview, he slammed electric cars as "coastal elite nonsense" and blamed China for being the source of fentanyl in the United States.</p>

<p>The deadly drug, many times more powerful than heroin, is responsible for tens of thousands of overdose deaths a year.</p>

<p>"China is attacking America from its guts," he charged.</p>

<p><strong>Crypto support</strong></p>

<p>Lutnick was initially tipped to head the Treasury Department but a tussle over the position spilled into the public eye last weekend.</p>

<p>Trump's health secretary pick Robert F. Kennedy Jr. expressed support for Lutnick, saying on social media that "Bitcoin will have no stronger advocate" than him.</p>

<p>The world's richest man Elon Musk also threw his support behind Lutnick for Treasury chief while calling the other top contender, hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, "a business-as-usual choice."</p>

<p>"Business-as-usual is driving America bankrupt, so we need change one way or another," said Musk, who Trump has tapped to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency.</p>

<p>Lutnick recalls losing hundreds of employees in the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center, a tragedy narrowly he avoided as he was taking his son to school.</p>

<p>Besides Cantor Fitzgerald, Lutnick heads financial technology firm BGC Group and real estate services firm Newmark Group.</p>

<p>He graduated from Haverford College and has a degree in economics, according to his biography on Cantor's website.</p>

<p>As co-chair of Trump's transition team, Lutnick has been identifying new hires for the president-elect's administration.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi starts a two-day visit on Tuesday to Guyana, the energy-rich nation with strong historic cultural links with India through a large community.</p>

<p>He will co-chair the India-CARICOM summit with 14 nations participating, underscoring India's role as the voice of the Global South that supports the political and economic aspirations of those countries.</p>

<p>"India is an important global actor. Our Member States are keen to meet Prime Minister Modi and develop deeper technical relationships, deepen the relationship in terms of advocacy for small states in the international arena, and strengthen people-to-people ties," CARICOM Assistant Secretary-General Elizabeth Solomon was quoted as saying by Antigua Newsroom.</p>

<p>PM Modi said in a statement previewing the visit that he will pay his respects to one of the oldest Indian community, who migrated more than 185 years ago.</p>

<p>"We will exchange views on giving strategic direction to our unique relationship, which is based on shared heritage, culture and values," he said.</p>

<p>Guyana's Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo said, "The visit underlines the historically strong relations between India and Guyana."</p>

<p>The 2nd India-CARICOM Summit will be co-chaired on Wednesday by Guyana's President Mohamed Irfaan Ali and Grenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell.</p>

<p>CARICOM is the group of the Caribbean countries and the first summit was held in 2019 on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly where India offered a $150 million credit line for climate change and renewable energy projects.</p>

<p>Beyond the cultural links, PM Modi will be looking to Guyana for India's energy security as the small Caribbean country is emerging as a potential major petroleum and gas power.</p>

<p>According to the US Energy Information Agency, the estimate of Guyana's oil and natural gas resources is more than 11 billion oil-equivalent barrels, which is more than three times Kuwait's.</p>

<p>The discovery of the oil reserves, most of which are offshore, has spurred interest in the country by many countries and multinationals.</p>

<p>Guyana could play a role in India's quest to diversify its energy sources.</p>

<p>People of Indian descent make up 39.8 per cent of the population of the multi-ethnic country, with Hindus at 28.4 per cent of the largest religious community.</p>

<p>The Indo-Guyanese are the descendants of the people brought over by the British Raj starting in 1838 as indentured labourers to work on sugar plantations or those who came over as traders or to work in other occupations.</p>

<p>According to Jaggdeo, PM Modi will visit the Indian Arrival Monument which commemorates the arrival of the first ship carrying Indian indentured labourers to the Caribbean in 1838.</p>

<p>PM Modi will address Guyana's Parliament and speak to the Indian community and the community.</p>

<p>Ali visited India last year as the chief guest at the Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.</p>

<p>PM Modi will be the first Indian prime minister to visit the country since Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's visit in 1968.</p>

<p>India has provided assistance to Guyana with several projects, including $25 million National Cricket Stadium which was the venue for the T20 World Cup Cricket this year.</p>

<p>India has also helped set up of a Centre of Excellence in Information Technology (CEIT).</p>

<p>The trade between the two countries was $223.36 million in 2021-22, with Guyana's exports amounting to $156.96 million, boosted by energy products.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first time G20 leaders took their photo together at a summit in Rio they forgot Joe Biden. On Tuesday they had a reshoot -- with the outgoing US president firmly back in the frame.</p>

<p>Biden, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni all missed the photo on Monday due to what US officials called "logistical issues."</p>

<p>No one was taking any chances the second time around.</p>

<p>This time Biden, attending his final G20 summit ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House on January 20, was given a spot near the middle of the front row of the assembled world leaders.</p>

<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi grabbed Biden's hand as the US leader stepped onto the stage. Trudeau, who was next to him, chatted with Biden and pointed at him at one moment.</p>

<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping entered the cavernous room at a Rio art museum where the leaders were gathered just over a minute later and took his place.</p>

<p>When it was all over the leaders clapped and held hands.</p>

<p>The fulsome show of unity could not have contrasted more starkly with the farcical scenes when Biden missed out on the photo a day earlier.</p>

<p>Biden had been spotted walking through some palm trees towards the photo-op on the Brazilian city's stunning bayside on Monday -- but the other leaders were already dispersing after the picture was snapped.</p>

<p>His no-show had seemed to symbolize the 81-year-old's waning influence as the world looks towards a second Trump presidency following the Republican's sweeping US election win.</p>

<p>Throughout a six-day swing through South America, Biden has been making a last pitch for global support on issues from Ukraine and the Middle East to climate change.</p>

<p>But his counterparts have often seemed to have their eyes on January, with Xi saying after meeting Biden in Lima last week that he would work for a "smooth transition" with Trump.</p>

<p>Biden has also kept a low media profile and has not taken questions from the media during his trip, despite major developments such as his granting of approval for Ukraine to use long-range US-made missiles to hit Russia.</p>

<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov -- attending in place of President Vladimir Putin, who faces an International Criminal Court warrant over the war in Ukraine -- was in the photo on Monday but not on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Lavrov said earlier Tuesday that Kyiv's first strikes with the missiles marked a "new phase" -- while also urging the West to read a decree signed by Putin that lowers the threshold for Russian use of nuclear weapons.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia warned on Tuesday that it would respond after Ukraine fired longer-range US missiles at its territory for the first time, as President Vladimir Putin issued a nuclear threat on the 1,000th day of the war.</p>

<p>A senior official told AFP that a strike on Russia's Bryansk region earlier on Tuesday "was carried out by ATACMS missiles" -- a reference to the US-supplied Army Tactical Missile System.</p>

<p>Speaking 1,000 days after Russia invaded Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the attack showed Western countries wanted to "escalate" the conflict.</p>

<p>"We will be taking this as a qualitatively new phase of the Western war against Russia. And we will react accordingly," Lavrov told a press conference at the G20 summit in Brazil.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Tuesday lowering the threshold for using nuclear weapons, a move that the White House, UK and European Union condemned as "irresponsible".</p>

<p>Putin has used nuclear rhetoric throughout the conflict but has grown increasingly belligerent since last year, pulling out of a nuclear test ban treaty and a key arms reduction agreement with the US.</p>

<p>Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky accused G20 leaders at a summit in Brazil of failing to act over Putin's nuclear threats, saying the Russian leader had no interest in peace.</p>

<p>A Russian strike in the eastern Ukrainian region of Sumy late Monday destroyed a Soviet-era residential building and killed at least 12 people, including a child, according to officials.</p>

<p><strong>Nuclear sabre-rattling&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Washington this week said it had cleared Ukraine to use ATACMS against military targets inside Russia -- a long-standing Ukrainian request.</p>

<p>Russia said on Tuesday that Ukraine had used the missiles against a facility in the Bryansk region close to the border overnight.</p>

<p>"At 03:25 am (0025 GMT), the enemy struck a site in the Bryansk region with six ballistic missiles. According to confirmed data, US-made ATACMS tactical missiles were used," said a defence ministry statement.</p>

<p>Lavrov said the 300-kilometre (186-mile) range missiles could not have been fired without US technical assistance.</p>

<p>Moscow has said the use of Western weapons against its internationally recognised territory would make the US a direct participant in the conflict.</p>

<p>Confirmation of the strike came shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree that enables Moscow to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states such as Ukraine if they are supported by nuclear powers.</p>

<p>The new nuclear doctrine also allows Moscow to unleash a nuclear response in the event of a "massive" air attack, even if it is only with conventional weapons.</p>

<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said this was "necessary to bring our principles in line with the current situation."</p>

<p><strong>'Direct threat' to West&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The 1,000th day of Russia's invasion -- launched on February 24, 2022 -- comes at a perilous time for Ukrainian forces across the front, particularly near the war-battered cities of Kupiansk and Pokrovsk.</p>

<p>Russia has also intensified strikes on Ukrainian cities in recent days, with attacks on city centres and residential buildings that have killed dozens of civilians.</p>

<p>Ukrainian forces have steadily lost ground in Russia's Kursk region where they seized territory in August, and have warned that Russia has massed some 50,000 troops, including North Korean forces, to wrest back the region.</p>

<p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told Chinese President Xi Jinping Tuesday that the alleged deployment of North Korean soldiers by Russia in its war against Ukraine risked worsening the conflict.</p>

<p>Both sides have steered their economies to help the war effort.</p>

<p>Ukrainian lawmakers voted Tuesday to approve the 2025 budget with more than $50 billion -- or 60 percent of all expenditure -- allocated to defence and security.</p>

<p>Russia's parliament last month approved a budget that will see a defence spending surge of almost 30 percent next year.</p>

<p>NATO chief Mark Rutte warned Tuesday that Putin must not be allowed to prevail.</p>

<p>"Why is this so crucial that Putin will not get his way? Because you will have an emboldened Russia on our border... and I'm absolutely convinced it will not stop there," Rutte told reporters in Brussels.</p>

<p>"It is then posing a direct threat to all of us in the West," he said.</p>

<p>The EU's outgoing top diplomat Josep Borrell also pressed member states to align with Washington in allowing Kyiv to strike inside Russia using donated long-range missiles.</p>

<p>"It is fully in accordance with international law," he said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that Israel was offering a reward of $5 million to anybody who brings out a hostage held in Gaza.</p>

<p>"Anybody who brings out a hostage will find with us a secure way for them and their family to leave" Gaza, Netanyahu said in a video filmed inside the Palestinian territory, according to his office.</p>

<p>"We will also give them a reward of $5 million for each hostage."</p>

<p>Wearing a helmet and a bullet-proof jacket, Netanyahu spoke with his back to the Mediterranean in the Netzarim Corridor, Israel's main military supply route which carves the Gaza Strip in two just south of Gaza City.</p>

<p>"Anyone who dares to do harm to our hostages is considered dead -- we will pursue you and we will catch up with you," he said.</p>

<p>Accompanied by Defence Minister Israel Katz, Netanyahu underlined that one of Israel's war aims remained that "Hamas does not rule in Gaza".</p>

<p>"We are also making efforts to locate the hostages and bring them home. We won't give up. We will continue until we've found them all, alive or dead."</p>

<p>During Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack which triggered the war in Gaza, militants took 251 hostages. Of those, 97 are still held in Gaza, including 34 who have been confirmed dead.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several European countries are advising their residents to be ready for war even as Russia and Ukraine witnessed a grim milestone recently - the 1,000th day of conflict. Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark have issued advisories that ask citizens to make sure they sustain themselves in case of a crisis.</p>

<p>While Sweden started sending out millions of pamphlets on Monday that contained information about how to prepare for war, natural disasters and cyber or terror attacks, Finland launched a website gathering information on preparedness for different crises.</p>

<p>The Swedish pamphlet says: "Military threat levels are increasing. We must be prepared for the worst-case scenario -- an armed attack on Sweden".</p>

<p>The 32-page booklet 'If Crisis Or War Comes' contains tips such as stocking up on non-perishable food and water, keeping cash on hand and growing fruit and vegetables in gardens.</p>

<p>"If Sweden is attacked by another country, we will never give up. All information to the effect that resistance is to cease is false," reads a line in the booklet.</p>

<p>It is an updated version of a pamphlet that Sweden has issued five times since World War II.</p>

<p>The new version doesn't mention Russia, Ukraine or any other country by name.</p>

<p>The brochure is available in print in both Swedish and English and digital versions are available in several other languages -- including Arabic, Farsi, Ukrainian, Polish, Somali and Finnish.</p>

<p>Finland's website asserts authorities are "well prepared for self-defence".</p>

<p>The country shares a 1,340-kilometre border with Russia and it has maintained a higher level of preparedness.</p>

<p>After Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, Finland announced plans to build a 200-kilometre border fence - 10 feet tall and topped with barbed wire - with Russia which is due to be completed by 2026.</p>

<p>Both Swedish and Finnish checklists include easy-to-cook food. Finland has also asked its citizens to arrange for a backup power supply.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Norway has urged its citizens to be prepared to manage on their own for a week in the event of war and other threats.</p>

<p>"We have sent out 2.2 million paper copies, one for each household in Norway," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr4zwj2lgdo">BBC quoted Tore Kamfjord,</a> responsible for the campaign of self-preparedness at the Norwegian Directorate for Civil Protection (DSB), as saying.</p>

<p>Tins of beans, energy bars, pasta, and medicines - including iodine tablets in case of a nuclear accident - are included in the list of items to be kept at home.</p>

<p>The Nordic neighbours Sweden and Finland dropped decades of military non-alignment to join the US-led defence alliance NATO in the wake of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Norway was a founding member of the Western defensive alliance.</p>

<p>Denmark's emergency management agency, as per a BBC report, emailed its citizens details on the water, food and medicine they would need to get through a crisis for three days.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Vladimir Putin eased Russia's rules for nuclear strikes days after the US allowed Ukraine to fire long-range American-made missiles into Russian territory.</p>

<p>Twenty-three of the 32 NATO members - up from just three a decade ago - have now agreed to reach the target of spending two per cent of gross domestic product on defence.</p>

<p>The growing consensus, however, is that Europe will have to do more to make sure it can stand on its own.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[An Italian village, Ollolai, offers $1 homes and fast-track opportunities for disappointed US voters seeking a fresh start.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US presidential election is one such event that gets the massive attention of the whole world, and the results of 2024's polls were much more awaited as it was being seen as either a comeback of Trump or as the end of his political career. Now Donald Trump has won the 2024 election as the nominee of the Republican Party and is now the president-elect of the United States. He is scheduled to begin his second term on January 20, 2025.</p>

<p>Americans are experiencing mixed emotions around the election results and have different perspectives on how the Trump administration will act. As many Democrat supporters are still getting over the election shock, a village on the Italian island of Sardinia has sniffed a potential opportunity; it offers $1 homes to Americans upset by the US election result, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/19/travel/italian-village-ollolai-wants-americans-election-one-dollar-homes/index.html"><em>CNN.</em></a></p>

<p>Like many other places in rural Italy, Ollolai has long been trying to persuade outsiders to move in to revive its fortunes after decades of depopulation. It's been selling dilapidated houses for as little as one euro-just over a dollar-to sweeten the deal.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/19/travel/italian-village-ollolai-wants-americans-election-one-dollar-homes/index.html"><em>CNN,</em></a> now, following the November 5 vote outcome, it's launched a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.liveinollolai.com/"><em>website</em></a> aimed at would-be American expats, offering up more cheap homes in the hope that those upset by the result will rush to snap up one of its empty properties.</p>

<p>"Are you worn out by global politics? Looking to embrace a more balanced lifestyle while securing new opportunities?" the website asks. "It's time to start building your European escape in the stunning paradise of Sardinia."</p>

<p>Mayor Francesco Columbu tells <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/19/travel/italian-village-ollolai-wants-americans-election-one-dollar-homes/index.html"><em>CNN</em></a> that the website was specifically created to attract American voters in the wake of the presidential elections. He says he loves the United States and is convinced Americans are the best people to help revive his community.</p>

<p>"We just really want, and will focus on, Americans above all," he says. "We can't, of course, ban people from other countries from applying, but Americans will have a fast-track procedure. We are betting on them to help us revive the village; they are our winning card."</p>

<p>In addition to this Italian village, a cruise line is also providing Americans who are unhappy with the outcome of the US election with a four-year getaway from the Trump administration. Through the "Skip Forward" service, visitors can visit over 425 ports across 140 countries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's presidency in the United States is going to be "pro-business and pro-growth" and good for the tech services industry, Wipro Executive Chairman Rishad Premji said at an event in Bengaluru on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Indian companies and investors will keep a close eye on Donald Trump's return to the White House to assess the impact of his policies on the country's $254 billion IT services industry.</p>

<p>Mr Premji said the conversation on fewer taxes and regulations during Trump's presidency could be powerful and "bodes well for the business and how customers will spend."</p>

<p>"The government is very pro-business and pro-growth, which helps all of our customers, which ultimately helps partners here in India and world over," he said, pointing to the potential corporate tax rate cuts and easier business regulations.</p>

<p>This shift in perspective comes after IT services players underwent consecutive difficult quarters of clients holding back spending, particularly on discretionary projects, due to macroeconomic concerns and inflationary pressures.</p>

<p>Mr Premji noted that IT firms must remain "watchful" about inflationary pressures, particularly in regard to tariffs and how immigration policies evolve.</p>

<p>Stricter US policies on outsourcing and restrictions on H-1B work visas could weigh on India's IT sector, which relies heavily on the US market, a note by CareEdge Ratings said.</p>

<p>"Indians receive the highest number of work visas from the United States, mainly for the IT sector," the note added.</p>

<p>The sector also relies on US-based clients for a significant portion of its revenue.</p>

<p>The overall impact of Donald Trump's second presidency should be "positive" on India's IT sector, JPMorgan said in a note earlier this month.</p>

<p>"Starting with the positives, extension and deepening of US corporate tax rates could support a bounce-back in enterprise technology spending," the brokerage said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday urged the G20 grouping to accelerate efforts to ensure a cleaner and more sustainable future for all.</p>

<p>In an address at a session on sustainable development and energy transition at the G20 summit, PM Modi said it is essential for developed countries to fulfil their commitments to provide technology and finance in a timely manner to the developing nations.</p>

<p>India is sharing its successful experiences with all friendly countries, particularly with Global South, he said.</p>

<p>On the challenge of climate change, the prime minister said India is the first G20 country to have fulfilled the commitments made under the Paris Agreement ahead of time.</p>

<p>Our efforts are based on traditional Indian thought which is both progressive and balanced, he said.</p>

<p>The summary of PM Modi's remarks were posted on 'X' by External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.</p>

<p>During the New Delhi G20 summit, we had adopted the Varanasi Action plan to accelerate achievements of the SDGs (sustainable development goals), PM Modi said.</p>

<p>Under Brazil's presidency priority has been accorded to implementation of these goals, and we welcome this, he noted.</p>

<p>The prime minister pitched for ensuring a more sustainable future for all, including through initiatives such as the International Solar Alliance, One World-One Sun-One Grid and the Global Bio-Fuel Alliance.</p>

<p>Modi said India launched Mission LiFE or Lifestyle for the Environment in order to promote a sustainable lifestyle at a global level.</p>

<p>We launched the International Solar Alliance and over 100 countries have joined it, he added.</p>

<p>The prime minister also highlighted India's "green transition" and said the initiative has been made a people's movement.</p>

<p>Over the last one decade, we have built homes for more than 40 million families, he said.</p>

<p>Over the last five years, clean water supply has been ensured for 120 million homes, PM Modi added.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid growing tension between New Delhi and Ottawa, passengers travelling from Canada to India are being subjected to extra security screening now. This decision was announced by Canada's Transport Minister Anita Anand late on Monday evening, as part of new temporary protocols, implemented "out of an abundance of caution."</p>

<p>"Transport Canada has implemented temporary additional security screening measures," for travellers to India, Ms Anand was quoted as saying by Canadian broadcaster <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-increase-screening-india-1.7386941" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">CBC</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Passengers "may experience some screening delays while these measures are in place.," she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The enhanced security protocols will be implemented by the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA), the agency responsible for screening passengers and their baggage before entering the restricted areas of Canadian airports.</p>

<p>In view of the new protocols, Air Canada has warned passengers bound for Indian destinations of longer security wait times and asked them to reach airports at least four hours before their scheduled departure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Due to heightened security mandates by Transport Canada for all passengers travelling to India, security wait times are expected to be longer than anticipated for your upcoming flight," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-enhances-security-screening-for-passengers-flying-to-india-101731992253851.html" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Hindustan Times</a> reported citing a notification sent by Air Canada to fliers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"To minimise any disruption to your travel plans, we recommend you arrive 4 hours prior to your flight's departure. We appreciate your patience and understanding," the notification added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The move to enhance security protocols for travellers to India came a month after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCPM) claimed it had evidence of involvement of "agents", acting on behalf of the Indian government, involved in 'organised' crimes in Canada including extortion, intimidation, coercion and harassment.</p>

<p>India has denied the RCMP's allegations and said they were "simply not true". India also withdrew its High Commissioner in Canada Sanjay Kumar Verma after dismissing Ottawa's allegations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since then, both countries have expelled each other's top diplomats. India-Canada ties remain deeply troubled over the North American country's alleged support to Khalistani separatists and its accusation of India's involvement in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian citizen who has been designated a terrorist by India.</p>

<p>India has been maintaining that the main issue between the two countries is that of Canada giving space to pro-Khalistan elements operating from Canadian soil with impunity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The 32-page guide offers advice on crisis management, air raid cover, and safeguarding psychological and digital security.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Swedish government has started giving out a handbook on war preparation to its citizens on Monday, in a move that reflects escalating security worries around the world. The handbook provides helpful guidance on managing crises, including possible military attacks. The move has come at a time when US President-elect Donald Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr, has claimed that recent aid to Ukraine by the Joe Biden administration is an attempt to start "World War III".</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/17/politics/biden-authorizes-ukraine-missiles-russian-targets/index.html"><em>CNN,</em></a> US President Joe Biden has authorised Ukraine to use powerful long-range American weapons inside Russia, according to two US officials familiar with the decision, as North Korean troops deploy in support of Moscow's effort.</p>

<p>Instruction provided by the Swedish authorities, which is available in several languages, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://rib.msb.se/filer/pdf/30874.pdf"><em>including English</em></a>, focuses on identifying warning signs, locating cover during air raids, and protecting digital and psychological security. These are all included in the 32-page handbook. The program is in line with other Nordic nations' initiatives to inform the public about crisis management and how to react to possible dangers, such as the possibility of Russian aggression.</p>

<p>"We live in uncertain times. Armed conflicts are currently being waged in our corner of the world. Terrorism, cyber attacks, and disinformation campaigns are being used to undermine and influence us," the booklet's prologue says.</p>

<p>"To resist these threats, we must stand united. If Sweden is attacked, everyone must do their part to defend Sweden's independence-and our democracy. We build resilience every day," the pamphlet adds. "Together with our loved ones, colleagues, friends, and neighbours. In this brochure, you learn how to prepare for and act in case of crisis or war. You are part of Sweden's overall emergency preparedness."</p>

<p>"Military threat levels are increasing. We must be prepared for the worst-case scenario-an armed attack on Sweden," the first chapter of the handbook reads.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iraq will begin its first full national census in more than three decades on Wednesday, a pivotal moment as it looks to gather demographic data for future planning and development.</p>

<p>The census, the first full one since Saddam Hussein was President in 1987, aims to provide a comprehensive count of Iraq's population, estimated to exceed 43 million people by the end of 2024, said Iraq's planning ministry spokesperson Abdul Zahra al-Hindawi.</p>

<p>Attempts at conducting a national census were delayed by years of conflict, instability and disagreement among political factions, but with the country now in a period of stability, authorities hope the process will be completed successfully.</p>

<p>A census carried out in 1997 excluded the Iraqi Kurdistan region, which had been governed by Kurdish authorities since the 1991 Gulf War.</p>

<p>It counted 19 million Iraqis and officials estimated there were another 3 million in the Kurdish north, according to official statistics.</p>

<p>The census was repeatedly postponed over worries it was being politicised. Ethnic groups in contested areas like the northern city of Kirkuk, home to Arabs, Kurds, Turkmen and a valuable part of Iraq's oil fields, opposed it because it might reveal demographics that would undermine political ambitions.</p>

<p>"We have fears (of the census) not only in Kirkuk but all other disputed areas which are subjected to strong disagreements between various powers," said Shwan Dawoodi, a Kurdish politician.</p>

<p>The data gathered will be used to guide decisions in areas such as infrastructure development, education, healthcare and social services, said Hindawi.</p>

<p>The census will feature only one question regarding religious affiliation — Muslim or Christian — and none about ethnic background or sectarian affiliation.</p>

<p>The Iraqi government has made extensive efforts to ensure the process, scheduled to take two days to complete, is as inclusive and accurate as possible, imposing a two-day curfew from midnight on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Preliminary results will be announced within 24 hours and final results released in two to three months.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Brazilian police on Tuesday arrested five people, including a member of former President Jair Bolsonaro's cabinet, suspected of involvement in an alleged plan to kill then-President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in 2022, days before he took office.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brazilian police on Tuesday arrested five people, including a member of former President Jair Bolsonaro's cabinet, suspected of involvement in an alleged plan to kill then-President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in 2022, days before he took office.</p>

<p>Documents seized by police revealed a plan to shoot or poison Lula and his Vice President-elect Geraldo Alckmin and put two retired army generals, National Security Adviser Augusto Heleno and former Defense Minister Braga Netto, in charge of leading the country with the idea of holding new elections.</p>

<p>The conspiracy included the attempted murder of a Supreme Court justice with an explosive device or poison, police said in a statement.</p>

<p>The Army confirmed the arrests of retired Brigadier General Mario Fernandes, who had served as a deputy minister in Bolsonaro's cabinet, and Lieutenant Colonels Helio Ferreira Lima, Rodrigo Bezerra de Azevedo and Rafael Martins de Oliveira.</p>

<p>The officers were in Rio de Janeiro but were not involved in the security operation for the summit of leaders of the G20 group of major economies that is ongoing in the city, the Army statement said.</p>

<p>Most of the men under investigation in the alleged 2022 coup plot are military personnel with Special Forces training, or close aides to Bolsonaro, a hard-right former army officer who won the presidency in 2018.</p>

<p>The arrests were the first time the federal police have described a plot to kill Lula and Alckmin, and stage a coup to prevent him returning to power.</p>

<p>Police identified the main plotter as Fernandes, who was found in possession of a plot outline that had been printed at the presidential palace.</p>

<p>"A detailed operational plan called 'Green and Yellow Dagger' was identified, which would be executed on December 15, 2022, aimed at the murder of the elected candidates for president and vice president," the police said in a statement.</p>

<p>Federal police served five arrest warrants on Tuesday, without naming the men arrested, as well as three search and seizure warrants and other 15 precautionary measures.</p>

<p>These included banning suspects from contacting the others and forbidding them from leaving the country.</p>

<p>"Investigations indicate that the criminal organization used a high level of technical-military knowledge to plan, coordinate and execute illicit actions in the months of November and December 2022," the police statement said.</p>

<p>FEDERAL POLICE PROBE</p>

<p>Lula defeated Bolsonaro in a presidential election in October 2022 and the leftist leader took office on Jan. 1, 2023. Bolsonaro had filled his government with military officers, many of them opposed to Lula.</p>

<p>Bolsonaro left Brazil days before Lula's inauguration for Florida and never recognized his electoral defeat. He eventually returned to Brazil and is under investigation for his alleged role in encouraging the riots in Brasilia on Jan. 8, 2023, when his supporters stormed and vandalized government buildings in the capital, hoping to cause chaos and spur the military to take power.</p>

<p>A federal police investigation will conclude that Bolsonaro conspired to engineer the attempted coup after he lost the election, a source with direct knowledge of the investigation told Reuters. The probe is expected to be finished this month.</p>

<p>Bolsonaro has made no public comment on the coup plot allegations. Reuters was trying to reach representatives of the former president and Fernandes for comment.</p>

<p>The Brazilian army monitored the federal operation against the coup plotters, which was carried out on Tuesday in Brasilia and Rio de Janeiro, Goias and Amazonas states.</p>

<p>According to the sources Reuters spoke to, the plotters also planned to kill Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who led investigations into Bolsonaro for abuse of power and unproven attacks on Brazil's voting system when he was president, and banned him from running for elected office until 2030.</p>

<p>More than 2,000 people were arrested for participating in the January 2023 uprising in Brasilia, although most were later released. Others have been convicted by the Supreme Court on charges of involvement in an attempted coup.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marius Borg Hoiby, the 27-year-old son of Norway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit, has been arrested on suspicion of rape. He was taken into custody on Monday in Oslo on a preliminary charge of having sexual intercourse with someone unconscious or unable to resist the act, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/19/europe/norway-hoiby-arrested-intl/index.html">CNN</a></em> reported.&nbsp;Police specified that he is accused of carrying out a "sexual act without intercourse" on a victim "said to have been unable to resist the act." Authorities have not disclosed when the alleged rape took place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The alleged victim, a woman in her 20s, didn't know Marius Hoiby before meeting him on the day of the incident, according to her lawyer, Hege Salomon. She also wasn't in a romantic relationship with Hoiby.</p>

<p>Hoiby pleaded not guilty to the charge, and was cooperating with the police and wanted to explain himself, his defence attorney Oyvind Bratlien&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nrk.no/norge/hoiby-pagrepet-pa-nytt-_-siktet-for-voldtekt-1.17132588" target="_blank">told Norwegian state broadcaster NRK</a>&nbsp;on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the alleged victim's lawyer, Hege Salomon, said that the woman "is having a hard time" and said that police had brought the case, not her client.</p>

<p>“We do not have a comment on this case and direct all questions to police and attorney for Marius Borg Hoiby,” Simen Sund, Communications Advisor for the Royal Palace,&nbsp;told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/marius-borg-hoiby-arrested-rape-norway-royal-crown-princess-rcna180743"><em>NBC News.</em></a></p>

<p>This isn't Hoiby's first run-in with the law as he was previously detained in August for bodily harm and criminal damage. He was arrested again in September for allegedly violating a restraining order.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;August, he issued a statement saying he had "struggled with substance abuse for a long time". He said he would "resume" treatment for the problem and "take it very seriously".</p>

<p>Notably, Hoiby was born in 1997 from a relationship prior to Mette-Marit's 2001 marriage to Crown Prince Haakon, the heir apparent to the Norwegian throne. He and his step-siblings -- Princess Ingrid Alexandra, 20 and Prince Sverre Magnus, 18 -- were raised together by Mette-Marit and Haakon.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday met Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and took stock of the full range of bilateral ties while reaffirming India's commitment to improving cooperation in sectors like energy, biofuels, defence and agriculture.</p>

<p>Modi, who arrived in the Brazilian city on Sunday after concluding a two-day trip to Nigeria, met Lula on the sidelines of the G20 Summit here and complimented him on various efforts of Brazil during their G20 Presidency.</p>

<p>"We took stock of the full range of bilateral ties between our nations and reaffirmed our commitment to improving cooperation in sectors like energy, biofuels, defence, agriculture and more," Modi said in a post on X after talks with Lula.</p>

<p>Brazil is hosting the 19th G20 Summit. India is part of the G20 Troika along with Brazil and South Africa.</p>

<p>Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said that Prime Minister Modi thanked President Lula for successfully hosting the G20 Summit.</p>

<p>"PM assured India's full support to Brazil's initiative of 'Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty'. Discussions focused on exploring opportunities for greater cooperation in renewable energy, biofuels, defence, agriculture, healthcare, and digital technology," he said in a post on X.</p>

<p>On Monday, Prime Minister Modi was warmly received by President Lula at the G20 Summit venue.</p>

<p>Alongside Modi, Chinese President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden are among the leaders attending the Rio de Janeiro summit on November 18-19.</p>

<p>From Brazil, Modi will travel to Guyana at the invitation of President Mohamed Irfaan Ali. It will be the first-ever visit of an Indian prime minister to Guyana in more than 50 years.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States was not surprised by Russia's announced change in its nuclear doctrine and does not plan to adjust its own nuclear posture in response, a White House National Security Council spokesperson said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"As we said earlier this month, we were not surprised by Russia's announcement that it would update its nuclear doctrine; Russia had been signaling its intent to update its doctrine for several weeks," the spokesperson said in a statement that also cited "more of the same irresponsible rhetoric from Russia."</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday lowered the threshold for a nuclear strike in response to a broader range of conventional attacks, and Moscow said Ukraine had struck deep inside Russia with U.S.-made ATACMS missiles.</p>

<p>"Observing no changes to Russia's nuclear posture, we have not seen any reason to adjust our own nuclear posture or doctrine in response to Russia's statements today."</p>

<p>The statement also cited Russia's use of North Korean troops in Ukraine, which it called a significant escalation.</p>

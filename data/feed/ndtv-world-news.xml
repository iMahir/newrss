<p>The Quad leaders are also set to unveil a "milestone" initiative to prevent, detect, treat and alleviate the impact of cancer on patients and their families.</p>

<p>Earlier, a large group of the Indian diaspora greeted PM Modi upon his arrival at the Philadelphia International Airport, from where he travelled to Wilmington.</p>

<p>PM Modi greeted a group of people dressed in traditional attire, with many of them holding the Indian tri-colour. He walked along the fenced area, signed autographs for some of them and shook hands with some others.</p>

<p>"An energetic welcome in Philadelphia! Our diaspora's blessings are greatly cherished," PM Modi said in another post on X.</p>

<p>"The Indian community has distinguished itself in the USA, making a positive impact across diverse sectors. It's always a delight to interact with them," the prime minister said. "Let's celebrate the bonds that connect our nations!" From Wilmington, PM Modi will travel to New York to attend an Indian community event at Long Island on September 22 and address the Summit of the Future at the UN General Assembly the next day.</p>

<p>The prime minister's other engagements include joining an Indian diaspora event at Long Island and participating in a round table with CEOs of American firms working on cutting-edge technologies such as AI, quantum computing and semiconductors.</p>

<p>"I am eagerly looking forward to engaging with the Indian diaspora and important American business leaders, who are the key stakeholders and provide vibrancy to the unique partnership between the largest and the oldest democracies of the world," PM Modi said.</p>

<p>"The Summit of the Future is an opportunity for the global community to chart the road ahead for the betterment of humanity. I will share the views of one-sixth of humanity as their stakes in a peaceful and secure future are among the highest in the world," the prime minister said.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[New Zealand pilot Phillip Mehrtens has been released from captivity by rebels in Indonesia's restive Papua region and is in good health despite the 19-month ordeal, Indonesian and New Zealand authorities said Saturday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Zealand pilot Phillip Mehrtens has been released from captivity by rebels in Indonesia's restive Papua region and is in good health despite the 19-month ordeal, Indonesian and New Zealand authorities said Saturday.</p>

<p>Phillip Mehrtens, 38, was working for Indonesian airline Susi Air when he was snatched by rebels from the West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB) insurgent group at Papua's Nduga airport on February 7 last year.</p>

<p>A joint task force of police and military forces collected Mehrtens in a village in Nduga district early Saturday, before he was given medical and psychological checks and flown to the Papuan city of Timika, said the unit's head Faizal Ramadhani.</p>

<p>"Today I have been freed. I am very happy that shortly I will be able to go home and meet my family," Mehrtens told reporters earlier in Timika, speaking in Indonesian.</p>

<p>"Thank you for everybody who helped me today, so I can get out safely in a healthy condition."</p>

<p>Mehrtens arrived in capital Jakarta from Timika on Saturday evening where Hadi Tjahjanto, coordinating minister for political, legal and security affairs, told reporters Mehrtens had been handed over to New Zealand's ambassador.</p>

<p>New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters earlier said Mehrtens was "safe and well" and had been able to speak with his family.</p>

<p>"This news must be an enormous relief for his friends and loved ones," Peters added.</p>

<p>Mehrtens was providing vital air links and supplies to remote communities at the time of his abduction.</p>

<p>The task force released footage of an emotional Mehrtens taking a phone call from his family, with one unidentified loved one heard saying "hang in there".</p>

<p><strong>Video addresses</strong></p>

<p>His release came after intense diplomatic efforts by Wellington and Jakarta.</p>

<p>Indonesian President Joko Widodo said Saturday that Jakarta had secured Mehrtens's freedom through negotiation, not force.</p>

<p>"We prioritised the safety of the pilot who was held hostage. It took a long process and I appreciate the authorities," he told reporters.</p>

<p>Rebels had demanded Indonesia recognise Papuan independence in return for his freedom.</p>

<p>A TPNPB spokesman, Sebby Sambom, said another faction of the rebel group agreed to a deal with the Indonesian government, accusing them of accepting a payment without providing evidence.</p>

<p>The rebels had at one point threatened to kill Mehrtens if talks were not forthcoming. The group had said foreign nationals were targets because their governments had ties with Indonesia.</p>

<p>In February 2023, TPNPB rebels set fire to a Susi Air plane and released five passengers, but held on to Mehrtens.</p>

<p>During his captivity in the Papuan countryside, the New Zealander made sporadic appearances on video, likely under duress, to address his family and his government.</p>

<p>The rebels said he was in good health throughout, but his appearance changed drastically over time, with the pilot becoming gaunt, long-haired and bearded in proof-of-life videos.</p>

<p>Mehrtens appeared in good physical condition in handout images published by Indonesian authorities on Saturday.</p>

<p><strong>'Gentle man'</strong></p>

<p>Mehrtens, a father of one, grew up in the New Zealand city of Christchurch.</p>

<p>During his captivity, he was described by friends as a "kind and gentle man" who was helping Papuans by flying into remote areas not accessible by road and that many would not fly to, according to New Zealand media outlets.</p>

<p>Indonesia maintains a heavy military presence in resource-rich but underdeveloped Papua to quell the long-running separatist insurgency.</p>

<p>Rebel attacks in the region have risen in recent years and flying is the only way to reach remote mountainous areas there.</p>

<p>Another New Zealand pilot, 50-year-old Glen Malcolm Conning, was shot dead last month after landing in the region with two Indonesian health workers and two children, all of whom survived.</p>

<p>The former Dutch colony declared independence in 1961, but neighbouring Indonesia took control two years later, promising a referendum. In 1969, a thousand Papuans voted to integrate into Indonesia in a UN-backed vote.</p>

<p>Papuan independence activists regularly criticise the vote and call for fresh polls, but Jakarta says its sovereignty over Papua is supported by the United Nations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Kamala Harris on Saturday challenged Donald Trump to another debate in the lead-up to the US presidential election, with her campaign saying she had accepted an invitation from broadcaster CNN to host the event on October 23.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris on Saturday challenged Donald Trump to another debate in the lead-up to the US presidential election, with her campaign saying she had accepted an invitation from broadcaster CNN to host the event on October 23.</p>

<p>"Vice President Harris is ready for another opportunity to share a stage with Donald Trump," her campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The American people deserve another opportunity to see Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump debate before they cast their ballots."</p>

<p>Republican Trump has attended two debates so far, one against President Joe Biden and one against Harris, who has since replaced her boss at the top of the Democratic ticket.</p>

<p>Trump has previously rejected the idea of facing Harris again. His campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Most pundits put Harris as the winner of the last debate, which was held on September 10.</p>

<p>Biden's poor debate performance against Trump in June, where the president struggled to complete some of his sentences, catalyzed concerns over his age and ramped up pressure for the 81-year-old to drop out of the race.</p>

<p>The move has left Trump, 78, now the oldest presidential nominee against a much younger Harris, 59.</p>

<p>- Voting already underway -</p>

<p>Saturday's announcement came as three states -- Virginia, Minnesota and South Dakota -- have already begun early voting in what is an agonizingly close race.</p>

<p>On the campaign trail on Friday, Harris cast Trump and his party as "hypocrites" over abortion, blaming Trump for an abortion ban in the battleground state of Georgia that she said had caused the deaths of two women.</p>

<p>Trump has frequently bragged on the campaign trail that his three Supreme Court picks paved the way for the 2022 overturning of the national right to abortion, turning the issue over to state governments.</p>

<p>At least 20 states have since brought in full or partial restrictions, with Georgia banning most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.</p>

<p>The race remains neck-and-neck, with Trump running with the support of a conservative religious voter base and others, many of whom feel disaffected by the country's political status quo.</p>

<p>Hardline anti-immigrant rhetoric has become a centerpiece of his election campaign.</p>

<p>The race between Harris and Trump has continued despite a tense atmosphere that was brought to the fore last weekend when a gunman appeared to have tried to assassinate Trump in Florida, the second such threat in as many months.</p>

<p>Every vote will count in the race, whose result Trump has once again refused to say he will accept if he loses.</p>

<p>The former president faces criminal charges for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 result, after which his supporters violently rushed into the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.</p>

<p>The result is expected to hinge on just seven crucial swing states, including Georgia.</p>

<p>Trump on Friday sought to lay the blame for any potential loss at the door of Jewish American voters, sparking outrage.</p>

<p>"If I don't win this election... in my opinion the Jewish people would have a lot to do with a loss," Trump told an anti-Semitism event on Thursday, repeating his grievance that Jewish voters have historically leaned towards the Democrats.</p>

<p>He is set to campaign on Saturday in North Carolina.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi landed in Philadelphia Saturday to begin his three-day US trip with the Quad Leaders' Summit being held in Wilmington, Delaware.</p>

<p>The Quad Leaders' Summit this year was earlier supposed to be held in India, but US President Joe Biden was keen to hold the event in his hometown.</p>

<p>This will be a farewell summit for both Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida as they near the end of their terms in office -- January 20, 2025, for the US president and October 1 for the Japanese prime minister.</p>

<p>The fourth leader attending the meeting is Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.</p>

<p><strong>Here's a look at previous summits</strong></p>

<p>-- May 20, 2023 (Hiroshima, Japan) Format: In-person Attending leaders: PM Albanese, PM Modi, PM Kishida, and President Biden Notes: Australia was the host of the summit for the year, and was supposed to hold the summit in Sydney just after the G7 Hiroshima Summit. However, President Biden postponed his trip to Australia and Papua New Guinea at the last minute due to debt ceiling negotiations with Congress. Australia hosted the summit in Hiroshima instead. According to the readout from the Japanese side, the summit lasted about 50 min.</p>

<p>-- May 24, 2022 (Tokyo, Japan) Format: In-person Attending leaders: PM Albanese, PM Modi, PM Kishida, and President Biden Notes: Australia held its federal election on May 21, and Anthony Albanese became Australia's 31st prime minister on May 23, the day before the summit.

<p>-- March 3, 2022 (Virtual) Format: Video Call Attending leaders: PM Scott Morrison (Australia), PM Modi, PM Kishida, and President Biden Notes: According to the readout from the Japanese side, the video call was initiated and hosted by the United States. 4 leaders mainly exchanged views on the tense situation and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. It lasted about 70 min.</p>

<p>-- Sept 24, 2021 (Washington, DC) Format: In-person Attending leaders: PM Morrison, PM Modi, PM Yoshihide Suga (Japan), and President Biden Notes: This was the first in-person summit. PM Suga attended the summit after he announced he was stepping down as prime minister on Sept 3. Fumio Kishida became the next prime minister on Oct 4. According to the readout from the Japanese side, it lasted about 2 hour and 20 min.</p>

<p>-- March 12, 2021 (Virtual) Format: Video Call Attending leaders: PM Morrison, PM Modi, PM Suga, and President Biden Notes: This was the first Quad Leaders' Summit.

<p>Climate change, though not a new issue, has only led to increased frequencies and intensities of extreme weather phenomena, which added to already increasing degradation, making controlling global warming an imperative.</p>

<p>Extreme heat with high humidity can be lethal, and, with global warming, their incidence is on the rise. The body loses heat by sweating, but in hot and steamy conditions, the sweating process ceases and the body temperature shoots up precariously.</p>

<p>To measure the amount of both heat and moisture, a wet-bulb thermometer is used-a device that mimics the principle by which sweat cools the human body by evaporation. When humidity reaches 100 percent, there is no longer any additional loss of heat, and the WBT equals the actual temperature, which becomes an extreme danger to humans.</p>

<p>A WBT of 35 degrees Celsius had been considered for decades a critical threshold at which the body can cool itself anymore over and above that level even for the fittest individuals.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/humans-cant-endure-temperatures-and-humidities-high-previously-thought">Recent studies at Penn State University</a> suggested that this threshold is actually even lower, approximately 31 degrees Celsius. Even those engaged in light work, like cooking or taking a shower, are always increasing their inner heat temperature, which may lead to unconsciousness or even death due to a failure of organs.</p>

<p>It seems to endanger mostly elders, children, and people who work outdoors. Though temperatures of 35 degrees Celsius are still very exceptional, especially in Saudi Arabia, India, and Pakistan, where values as close as 31 degrees Celsius have been recently recorded, millions are increasingly threatened by a warming world.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Indian community in Delaware was buzzing with excitement as they welcome PM Modi. Chants of "Modi, Modi" filled the air as community members prepared for the PM's arrival outside hotel.</p>

<p>Expressing joy upon PM Modi's arrival in US, an Indian community member said, "I don't think there is any other politician like him who has given his life and has made sure that India is respected and loved. He has brought it to the forefront of the world."<br />
"I am blessed to welcome him to Delaware," she said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, another community member said, "I shook hands with PM Modi. I am very happy."</p>

<p>"He has brought the golden age of India back. Modi Ji is great... This is a historical moment for us to cherish," said another member of the Indian community as PM Narendra Modi arrived at Hotel duPont and met members of the Indian community gathered to welcome him there.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived at Philadelphia International Airport on Saturday morning (local time) on the first day of his three day visit to the United States.</p>

<p>"Landed in Philadelphia. Today's programme will be focused on the Quad Summit and the bilateral meeting with @POTUS @JoeBiden. I am sure the discussions throughout the day will contribute to making our planet better and addressing key global challenges," PM Modi said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Welcoming the leaders to Delaware President Biden said, "Today, I'll welcome Prime Ministers Albanese, Modi, and Kishida to my home: Delaware. These leaders aren't just essential to ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific - they're friends of mine and friends of our nation. I look forward to all we'll accomplish in the Summit ahead.</p>

<p>At the Quad Summit, PM Modi will join US President Joe Biden, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to discuss regional security and cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. The last Quad Leaders' Summit, the fifth edition, was held in Hiroshima, Japan, on May 20 last year.</p>

<p>From Delaware the PM travels to New York where he will address a community event on September 22 and engage with CEO's in a roundtable discussion. On September 23, PM Modi will address the Summit of the Future at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The study, published in Biological Psychology, highlights the growing importance of understanding how infants interact with technology and the potential impact of robots on early social development.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New research published in the<em> journal Biological Psychology </em>suggests that infants, even at age 6 to 8 months old, already have a sense of the implications of eye contact, including that from such robots as those with human features.</p>

<p>While most research has concentrated on how babies interact with humans, the increased use of robots in childcare and education raises questions about how infants perceive these machines. The study highlights the growing importance of understanding how infants interact with technology.</p>

<p>The authors of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051124001170?via%3Dihub">the report</a> state that, similar to the responsiveness of infants to human interaction, infants respond to robots' gaze, meaning infants grasp the social significance of gaze and can decode such meaningful behaviours coming from other providers.</p>

<p>There is therefore a need to continue researching the role that robots may play in early socialisation, but further research is needed on the long-term effects of infants interacting with this technology.</p>

<p>"Humanoid robots are becoming increasingly common in social environments, and people are suddenly expected to engage in social interactions with these artificial agents. We are interested in how the human brain understands the 'sociality' of artificial humanoid robots," said study author Samuli Linnunsalo, a doctoral researcher at Tampere University and member of the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://research.tuni.fi/hiplab/">Human Information Processing Laboratory.</a></p>

<p>"We believe that, to fully explore people's instinctive interpretations of humanoid robots' sociality, it is necessary to use physiological measures to investigate their responses to robots' nonverbal social cues, such as eye contact. After finding initial evidence that adult humans' psychophysiological responses to eye contact with a humanoid robot were similar to their responses to eye contact with a human, we sought to investigate whether young infants react similarly to a humanoid robot's and a human's eye gaze. This was particularly interesting to us because infants do not have knowledge of the humanoid robots' purpose as social interaction partners, nor do they understand that people are expected to treat humanoid robots as social agents."</p>

<p>As <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.psypost.org/robots-eye-contact-elicits-human-like-responses-in-infants/">per a release,</a> the study involved 114 infants, aged between 6 and 8 months. The researchers invited the infants to a laboratory where they were exposed to three different types of stimuli: a human, a humanoid robot called Nao, and a non-human object, in this case, a vase. The researchers used live stimuli rather than videos or images to make the experience more realistic for the infants.</p>

<p>Each of the human and robot models was presented to the infant either looking directly at them (direct gaze) or looking away (averted gaze). To ensure the infants were engaged, the researchers used a carefully controlled environment with an interactive introduction for both the human and the robot. The robot would introduce itself, mimicking natural social gestures like nodding and hand movements, while the vase served as a non-interactive control object.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hundreds had also gathered at the hotel where PM Modi will be putting up during his stay in Delaware.</p>

<p>Irrespective of the long flight, PM Modi and the travelling Indian delegation will have no time to get over the jetlag considering the busy schedule lined up for the day, immediately after their arrival.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister will be holding bilateral discussions with President Biden and other leaders of the Quad grouping, including Australian PM Anthony Albanese and Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan.</p>

<p>Some key Indo-Pacific Economic Framework-related agreements and an India-US Drug Framework related MoU are expected to be signed following PM Modi's meeting with Biden. A bilateral fact sheet will also be released after the bilateral discussions between the two leaders.</p>

<p>The all-important sixth Quad Leaders' Summit - fourth in-person - is scheduled at around 4 PM EST (around 1.30 AM, India time on Sunday) at Archmere Academy, where Biden attended High school.</p>

<p>After the plenary session, the Quad leaders will gather together for the unveiling of Cancer Moonshot event, a signature initiative that aims at implementing innovative strategies to prevent, detect, treat, and alleviate the impact of cancer on patients and their families.</p>

<p>It is for the first time that Biden will also be hosting foreign leaders in Wilmington as President - including an "intimate leaders' dinner" at his private home following the Moonshot event - which the White House believes is "a reflection of his deep personal relationships with each of the Quad Leaders", and the importance of the Quad to all countries.</p>

<p>"I look forward to joining my colleagues President Biden, Prime Minister Albanese and Prime Minister Kishida for the Quad Summit. The forum has emerged as a key group of like-minded countries to work for peace, progress and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region. My meeting with President Biden will allow us to review and identify new pathways to further deepen India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership for the benefit of our people and the global good," said PM Modi before his departure, on Saturday.</p>

<p>Quad - a diplomatic partnership between India, the United States, Australia and Japan - remains committed to supporting an open, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific that is inclusive and resilient.</p>

<p>The Quad countries account for 1.9 billion combined population, 44 per cent of two-way merchandise trade across the Indo-Pacific region, US $34.8 trillion combined GDP and hold 30 per cent of Global Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) stock.</p>

<p>Having swapped its turn with the US due to scheduling issues, India will now be hosting the 2025 Quad Summit as the relationship between the partner nations continues to expand both strategically and economically.</p>

<p>From Wilmington, Prime Minister Modi will travel to New York where he will address a community rally at the Nassau Coliseum in Long Island on Sunday which is expected to be attended by more than 16,000 people.</p>

<p>"The Indian community has distinguished itself in the USA, making a positive impact across diverse sectors. It's always a delight to interact with them. At around 9:30 PM India time on Sunday, 22nd September, I will address the Modi and US programme in New York City. Let's celebrate the bonds that connect our nations!" said PM Modi after his arrival in the United States.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister will also be attending a Business Roundtable with CEOs of leading US companies in the cutting-edge areas of Artificial Intelligence, semiconductors, quantum computing, and biotechnology besides holding bilateral meetings with several other world leaders during his stay in New York.</p>

<p>On Monday (September 23), PM Modi will address the Summit of the Future in the UN General Assembly that will bring together world leaders with the objective of enhancing multilateral cooperation and tackling the most pressing global challenges.</p>

<p>An outcome document Pact for the Future, along with annexes on the global digital compact and a declaration for future generations, are expected to be adopted by the world leaders during the event.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A high profile global initiative to tackle cancer called the 'Cancer Moonshot' will be announced on the sidelines of the Quad Summit. Ahead of that an India cancer specific cancer genome atlas has been released. Till date, all cancer treatments were based on western datasets, say the experts who made the cancer atlas. This had led to complications. India has the third-highest number of cancer cases after the US and China.</p>

<p>The release of the Cancer Genome Atlas of India is timely since according to estimates by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), in India, the incidence of cancer cases is likely to increase from 1.46 million in 2022 to 1.57 million in 2025.</p>

<p>The Quad Summit to be held in Philadelphia will be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, US President Joe Biden, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. While global security will be high on the agenda, the menace of cancer is also not being ignored.</p>

<p>Cancer Moonshot is a special programme spearheaded by Mr Biden and the US First Lady. The White House says it is building a world where the word cancer loses its power, a diagnosis isn't a death sentence, and to prevent cancer before it starts.</p>

<p>"We catch cancer early so people live longer and healthier lives, and patients and families don't have to navigate their cancer journey alone. To prevent more than four million cancer deaths by 2047 and to improve the experience of people who are touched by cancer," it said.</p>

<p>The Indian Cancer Genome Atlas (ICGA) is aimed at transforming cancer research and treatment for the Indian population. Historically, cancer treatments in India have been based on western data sets. However, cancers in Indian patients can differ significantly at the molecular level.</p>

<p>The ICGA's mission is to create Indian-specific datasets to help researchers and clinicians develop personalised treatment protocols. This new open-access portal represents a monumental step in revolutionising cancer research, specifically for Indian patients.</p>

<p>Currently, the platform consists of data from 50 breast cancer patients, with plans to expand to over 500 patients in the coming year. Experts suggest that in 2022, India reported 1.92 lakh cases of breast cancer, constituting 26.6 per cent of all cancer cases, along with 98,337 deaths, accounting for 13.7 per cent of all cancer-related fatalities.</p>

<p>The Indian Cancer Genome Atlas (ICGA) is a national initiative focused on mapping cancers across India, supported by a foundation formed by over 50 clinicians, researchers, and data analysts. Its mission is to enhance cancer diagnosis and treatment for Indian patients and contribute to the global understanding of cancer biology.</p>

<p>The open access dataset will drive transformative breakthroughs in cancer treatment, said professor Shekhar C Mande, former Director General, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and currently senior professor at Savitribai Phule Pune University.</p>

<p>"Making this invaluable cancer data publicly accessible marks a pivotal step in accelerating scientific discoveries and enhancing patient outcomes. By openly sharing this data, we are empowering researchers, clinicians, and innovators to collaborate, explore new frontiers, and drive transformative breakthroughs in cancer treatment," Mr Mande said.</p>

<p>India uniquely has a high burden of cancers related to the digestive system; oral and lung cancer, mostly related to tobacco use; cervical cancer is increasing and breast cancer are all on the rise.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This year's Quad summit is being held in US President Joe Biden's hometown Wilmington, in US's Delaware. This will be the last Quad Summit for US President Joe Biden, who is not seeking a second term in the top office. It will also be the last Summit for Japanese PM Fumio Kishida.</p>

<h2><strong>WHAT IS THE QUAD GROUPING, WHO ARE THE MEMBERS</strong></h2>

<p>The Quad, short for 'Quadrilateral', is a diplomatic strategic partnership between India, Australia, Japan, and the United States. The Quad grouping is committed to supporting an open, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific region that is inclusive and resilient.</p>

<p>The Quad assumes significance amid rising concerns over China's aggressive posturing in the South China sea, Indian Ocean as well as the Pacific. The Quad cooperation is there to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific and to ensure that there is freedom of navigation of the seas and there is regard for international laws and adherence to a rules-based order.</p>

<p>The Quad has emerged as a key platform of like-minded countries focusing on peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region, PM Modi said on Saturday before he left for the US.</p>

<h3><strong>FOCUS OF THE QUAD SUMMIT 2024</strong></h3>

<p>This year the Quad leaders will delve in areas of health security, climate change, emerging technologies, infrastructure, connectivity and counter-terrorism.</p>

<p>The Quad, which also focuses on other significant global concerns, will discuss in detail the escalation between Israel and Hezbollah and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars.</p>

<p>The Quad summit has plans to expand the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness initiative from South East Asia to the Indian Ocean Region, the White House has said.</p>

<p>A formal announcement about the expansion will be made in Wilmington on Saturday, a senior administration official told reporters on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>Besides the expansion, the partnership will now include "new sophisticated technologies to improve the maritime domain picture", as well as new training programmes, the official said.</p>

<p>Another senior administration official said the expansion of the IPMDA to the Indian Ocean "provides opportunities, not just for Australia to coordinate with us in the Pacific, but also with India to coordinate more with a lot of our partners in the Indian Ocean region."</p>

<p>"We believe you'll see... that the Quad is more strategically aligned and more relevant than ever before," John Kirby, White House National Security Council Strategic Communications Director told reporters.</p>

<p>2024 was India's turn to host the Quad Summit. But following a request from Washington, India agreed to host the Summit next year.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi told Barack Obama in 2014 that the size of the then-US president's car was almost as big as the house his mother lived in, helping the two leaders with humble origins make a deeper connection, India's Ambassador to the United States Vinay Kwatra has said.</p>

<p>Mr Kwatra, a former foreign secretary, told 'Modi Story', a social media handle which chronicles anecdotal accounts related to the prime minister, that the heartfelt conversation between the two leaders occurred as they headed together for the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial after formal discussions.</p>

<p>As they sat together in Mr Obama's stretch limousine for the 10-12 minute drive, their conversation turned to family, he noted.</p>

<p>In a friendly exchange, Mr Obama asked about Prime Minister Modi's mother.</p>

<p>With a smile, the prime minister gave a candid and unexpected response: "President Obama, you might not believe this, but the size of your car is almost the size of the house my mother lives in," Kwatra, who was present as a translator, recalled.</p>

<p>The car the two leaders were travelling in was a stretch limousine.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi's statement, Mr Kwatra said, surprised the US president.</p>

<p>This candid revelation offered him a glimpse into Modi's modest upbringing and straightforwardness.</p>

<p>Mr Kwatra said the conversation became a point of deeper connection between the two leaders as both had risen from humble beginnings to the highest offices in their respective nations.</p>

<p>It was Prime Minister Modi's first visit to the country after becoming prime minister the same year.</p>

<p>His mother lived in their old home in Gujarat till she passed away in 2022.</p>

<p>Officials highlighted Prime Minister Modi's ability to connect with world leaders, including US presidents, and forge deeper bonds, noting that he connects with them at a personal level, drawing on his own life experiences to bridge cultural and geopolitical differences.</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, Prime Minister Modi embarked on a three-day visit to the US to attend a summit of the Quad grouping and address a key conclave at the United Nations.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Palestinians said an Israeli strike killed at least 22 people in a school sheltering displaced people in southern Gaza City on Saturday, while the Israeli military said the attack targeted a command centre of Hamas.</p>

<p>The Gaza health ministry said most of those killed were women and children. The Hamas-run government media office said 13 children and six women were among the dead.</p>

<p>The military said it hit a Hamas command centre embedded in the compound that previously served as a school, repeating an accusation that the group uses civilian facilities for military purposes. Hamas denies that.</p>

<p>Reuters footage from the site showed blasted walls, wrecked and burnt furniture, and holes in the ceiling of one room as people tried to salvage what they could of belongings.</p>

<p>"The women and their children were sitting in the playground of the school, the kids were playing, and suddenly two rockets hit them," said one witness Said Al-Malahi.</p>

<p>Some of the dead were wrapped in blankets and carried away on donkey carts, as ambulances transferred other bodies.</p>

<p>"I couldn't take it, I did not see a single man that is injured, it was all women and children, let the Arab countries rejoice, let them rejoice and clap for (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu and the United States of America," said another eyewitness, Ahmed Azzam, bitter that regional neighbours were not taking a tougher line against Israel.</p>

<p><strong>MEDICS KILLED</strong></p>

<p>In Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, the Gaza health ministry said four health workers were killed by an Israeli strike that hit ministry warehouses. Ambulance crews could not reach the dead or treat the wounded, it added.</p>

<p>In a statement, the Israeli military said forces, operating in Rafah since May, have killed dozens of operatives in recent weeks and dismantled military infrastructure and tunnel shafts.</p>

<p>Israel's demand to keep control of the southern border line between Rafah and Egypt has been a major sticking point in international efforts to conclude a ceasefire deal.</p>

<p>Hamas says it is focused on an agreement to end the war and get Israeli forces out of Gaza, while Israel says the war can only end once Hamas is eradicated. Another sticking point has been the specifics of an exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.</p>

<p>This war in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on Oct. 7 when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent assault on the enclave has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry, and displaced nearly the entire 2.3 million-strong population.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A California couple's two-month heartbreak over their lost cat has ended in a joyous reunion. Benny and Susanne Anguiano were reunited with their beloved feline, Rayne Beau, last month after he was found 800 miles (1,287 km) away in Roseville, California.</p>

<p>They had been camping in Yellowstone National Park in June when Rayne Beau was frightened by something in the woods and ran into the trees. They looked for it fruitlessly for 60 days, leaving out treats and toys recognisable to their pet, with no result.</p>

<p>"We had to leave without him," Susanne Anguiano told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ksbw.com/article/salinas-cat-travels-1000-miles-home-california-lost-yellowstone/62251513"><em>KSBW Action News 8.</em></a> "That was the hardest day because I felt like I was abandoning him."</p>

<p>But just when things were the worst, things took a dramatic turn when an animal welfare group contacted them, saying that Rayne Beau has been found in Roseville, California, 800 miles from Yellowstone.</p>

<p>The reunion was huge for the couple, as they were extremely happy to meet their pet, for whom they had already lost all hope.</p>

<p>"He was really depleted," said Susanne. "He probably didn't have a lot of energy to even go further."</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ksbw.com/article/salinas-cat-travels-1000-miles-home-california-lost-yellowstone/62251513"><em>news portal</em></a>, still, the couple does not know how their cat, in two months, was able to get from Yellowstone to Roseville, which is over 800 miles away. Now, they hope someone will see their story and recognize Rayne Beau.</p>

<p>"Hey, I remember that cat, and like we saw it here, we saw it there or even they took it in," said Benny.</p>

<p>The couple also wants to encourage other pet owners to take precautions, such as microchips or a global tracker, to protect their animals.</p>

<p>"Definitely microchip your cat or your pet and register the microchip online," said Susanne. "We would have never gotten them back had that not happened."</p>

<p>With Rayne Beau back home, reunited with his siblings and safe, they hope to take their cats back on trips again, but only when everyone is ready for it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's visit to India, New Delhi and Berlin have decided to shore up cooperation in the areas of renewable energy, urban development, agroecology and mobility.</p>

<p>Ways to expand engagement in these key areas figured prominently at the development policy negotiations led by India's Department for Economic Affairs and Germany's Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, German officials said on Saturday.</p>

<p>Both sides agreed to continue their cooperation in the areas of renewable energy, urban development, mobility and agroecology in the coming years, they said.</p>

<p>The Indo-German cooperation is strategically guided by the "Partnership for Green and Sustainable Development", which was established in 2022 following talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Scholz.</p>

<p>The German chancellor is scheduled to visit India next month.</p>

<p>"Germany and India share a long-standing, trusting and strategic partnership," said Barbara Schafer, the head of the German delegation at the talks.</p>

<p>"This has been further demonstrated in 2024 by both sides. With the launch of the 'India-Germany Platform for Investments in Renewable Energy Worldwide'," she said.</p>

<p>The new initiative was launched on September 16 during the fourth RE-Invest in Gujarat's Gandhinagar.</p>

<p>"With our commitments this year, Germany has made it clear that it reliably fulfils its international obligations," Schafer explained.</p>

<p>The German official said it is important not only to make commitments but also to achieve concrete results.</p>

<p>"We have already succeeded in many areas in our partnership with India -- through Indo-German cooperation, 7,700 kilometres of modern transmission lines have been built and with German (co-)financing, metros in Mumbai, Surat and Ahmedabad have been constructed," she said.</p>

<p>"Germany supports Indian farmers in making their agricultural production more climate-resilient, resource-efficient and sustainable. Additionally, we are working on triangular projects in Peru and various African countries to leverage our respective strengths there," Schafer added.</p>

<p>The German side said these developments create favourable conditions for the upcoming Indo-German government consultations at the level of Prime Minister Modi and Chancellor Scholz, scheduled for October.</p>

<p>"The term 'sustainable energy transition' takes on a new quality when Germany and India combine their unique capabilities, setting a positive example not only in their own countries but also globally," said Uwe Gehlen, Head of the German Development Cooperation in India and Minister Counsellor at the German Embassy.</p>

<p>This year, Germany has allocated more than Euros 1 billion for initiatives in these areas, in the form of concessional loans and technical cooperation (capacity building), according to a German readout.</p>

<p>The funds are earmarked for projects in the following sectors -- renewable energy, transmission lines or energy distribution, urban development, mobility, forest ecosystems, water, sustainable and resilient agriculture, agroecology, vocational education and cooperation with the National Mission for Clean Ganga, it said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The White House today met with a group of Sikhs who are sympathisers for the Khalistan movement This is the first time ever that they have officially engaged with such groups. The White House has also assured them "protection from any transnational aggression on its soil".</p>

<p>The White House said it is committed to "protecting American Citizens" from harm while they are within the borders of the United States.</p>

<p>This development comes amid concerns that Canada and the US are giving shelter and asylum to Khalistani separatists.</p>

<p>Groups aligned to the Khalistan separatist movement are banned in India and several of these organisations have carried out terrorist activities in the last few decades.</p>

<p>While the US has not made any official comment on "giving shelter" to such elements, Canada had called it their "freedom of speech".</p>

<p>In response, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had said, "India respects and practices freedom of speech, but freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom to support separatism. It does not equate with freedom to threaten foreign diplomats or allow political space to elements advocating violence."</p>

<p>"In any rules-based society, you would imagine that you would check people's background, how they came, what passports they carried etc," he had said.</p>

<p>"If you have people whose presence there was itself on very dubious documents, what does it say about you? It actually says that your vote-bank actually is more powerful than your rule of law," Mr Jaishankar had said.</p>

<h2><strong>THE WHITE HOUSE MEETING</strong></h2>

<p>The meeting at White House took place hours before PM Modi is to land in the US to attend the Quad summit in Delaware and to address the 'Summit of the Future' event at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.</p>

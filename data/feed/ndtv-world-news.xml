       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crowds of protesters invaded Mexico's Senate on Tuesday, forcing lawmakers to suspend a debate on controversial proposals by outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to allow voters to elect judges.</p>

<p>The judicial reform plan, which experts say would make Mexico the world's only country to elect all judges, has sparked mass demonstrations, diplomatic tensions and investor jitters.</p>

<p>Senate president Gerardo Fernandez Norona declared an "indefinite recess" because demonstrators had entered the building, as television images showed crowds of protesters inside the upper house chamber.</p>

<p>Upper house lawmakers began discussing the proposals Tuesday ahead of a vote that had been expected to be held later in the day or Wednesday.</p>

<p>Lopez Obrador, who wants the bill to be passed before he is replaced by close ally Claudia Sheinbaum on October 1, argues that in the current system the courts serve the interests of the political and economic elite, calling the judiciary "rotten," corrupt and rife with nepotism.</p>

<p>"What most worries those who are against this reform is that they will lose their privileges, because the judiciary is at the service of the powerful, at the service of white-collar crime," the leftist leader said at a news conference.</p>

<p>Opponents, including court employees and law students, have held a series of protests against the plan, under which even Supreme Court and other high-level judges, as well as those at the local level, would be chosen by popular vote.</p>

<p>Serving judges would have to stand for election in 2025 or 2027.</p>

<p>"This does not exist in any other country," said Margaret Satterthwaite, United Nations special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers.</p>

<p>"In some countries, such as the US, some state judges are elected, and in others, such as in Bolivia, high-level judges are elected. If this reform passes, it will place Mexico in a unique position in terms of its method for judicial selection," she told AFP.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Demolition of judiciary' -</strong><br />
In an unusual public warning, Supreme Court chief justice Norma Pina said that elected judges could be more vulnerable to pressure from criminals, in a country where powerful drug cartels regularly use bribery and intimidation to influence officials.</p>

<p>"The demolition of the judiciary is not the way forward," she said in a video released on Sunday.</p>

<p>Pina said last week that the top court would discuss whether it has jurisdiction to halt the reforms, though Lopez Obrador has said there is no legal basis for it to do so.</p>

<p>The reforms were passed last week in the lower house by ruling party lawmakers and their allies, who were forced to gather in a sports center because access to Congress was blocked by protesters.</p>

<p>In the upper house, the ruling coalition is one seat short of 86 votes for a two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution.</p>

<p>In a move that could potentially tip the balance in favor of the ruling coalition, one opposition senator was allowed to be excused for health reasons and be replaced by his father, prompting cries of "traitor" in the chamber.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Dangerous proposals' -</strong><br />
The United States, Mexico's main trading partner, has warned that the reforms would threaten a relationship that relies on investor confidence in the Mexican legal framework.</p>

<p>The changes could pose "a major risk" to Mexican democracy and enable criminals to exploit "politically motivated and inexperienced judges," US Ambassador Ken Salazar said last month.</p>

<p>Satterthwaite has also voiced "deep concerns" about the plan, calling access to an independent and impartial judiciary "a human right essential for protecting rights and checking power abuses."</p>

<p>"Without strong safeguards to guard against the infiltration of organized crime (in the judicial selection process), an election system may become vulnerable to such powerful forces," she warned.</p>

<p>Human Rights Watch has urged lawmakers to reject what it called the "dangerous proposals," saying they would "seriously undermine judicial independence and contravene international human rights standards."</p>

<p>Financial market analysts say investor concerns about the reforms have contributed to a sharp fall in the value of the Mexican currency, the peso, which has hit a two-year low against the dollar.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military has said it had killed three senior Hamas militants in strikes on a designated safe zone in southern Gaza.</p>

<p>The strikes targeted a crowded tent camp housing displaced Palestinians in the Mawasi area of Khan Younis, killing at least 19 people, with more being trapped under the rubble, according to Gaza-based health authorities.</p>

<p>Video footage on social media showed dozens of tents caught on fire and large craters resulting from the strikes.</p>

<p>The Israeli military confirmed in a statement on Tuesday that it attacked the location, describing it as an intelligence-based "precise strike" targeting "senior Hamas terrorists operating within a command and control centre embedded inside the humanitarian area in Khan Younis", Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>According to the Israeli military, the strikes killed Samer Ismail Khadr Abu Daqqa, head of Hamas's aerial unit in the Gaza Strip, Osama Tabesh, head of the observation and targets department in Hamas's military intelligence headquarters, and Ayman Mabhouh, a senior Hamas militant.</p>

<p>The three militants were "directly involved" in the Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, and had been "recently planning terror activities against the Israel Defense Forces and the State of Israel," the military said.</p>

<p>Later, the Israeli army conducted another attack on the Al-Farouq Mosque in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza. The army said the attack aimed to destroy another Hamas command and control centre located within the mosque.</p>

<p>The Palestinian news agency Quds News reported an unspecified number of casualties and injuries in Bureij.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;A Pakistani man accused of plotting to attack a New York City Jewish center in support of Islamic State was in Canada on a student visa, Canada's immigration minister said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, 20, was arrested in Canada last Wednesday as he allegedly tried to enter the U.S. He was charged with attempting to provide material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization, namely Islamic State, or ISIS.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Justice accused Khan of plotting a mass shooting at a Jewish center in Brooklyn around Oct. 7, 2024, about a year after Hamas' attack in Israel.</p>

<p>Khan came to Canada on a student visa in June 2023, Canadian Immigration Minister Marc Miller told reporters on Tuesday. The visa was issued the month before.</p>

<p>According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Khan began posting his support for ISIS on an encrypted messaging application in November 2023. He allegedly communicated his attack plans to undercover agents.</p>

<p>Miller said he had no further comment on Khan's case because criminal charges were pending.</p>

<p>"We take any security breach and any entry into Canada very seriously," he said. "Let's not be naive: A determined individual can gain access to this country and that is for the security services inside our country to apprehend this person if they commit a crime or if they're about to commit a crime. And that's exactly what happened."</p>

<p>Canada approved more student visas in May and June 2023 than in any month since at least January 2019, according to data from the immigration department. Approvals have since fallen.</p>

<p>Canada has been seeking to reduce its ranks of international students, issuing a two-year cap in January.</p>

<p>Khan is set to appear in court in Montreal on Sept. 13.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his Democrat counterpart Kamala Harris will participate in the crucial US Presidential debate being hosted by ABC Networks globally. The presidential debate comes exactly 8 weeks ahead of election day across the United States.</p>

<p>The US presidential debate may prove to be a game-changing moment for either candidate with the most recent polls showing Kamala Harris and Donald Trump neck-and-neck in the high-stakes battle for the top post.</p>

<p>The debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will be their first, and most-likely, only debate. The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/harris-vs-trump-what-to-expect-from-the-us-presidential-debate-6535082" target="_blank">clash could prove pivotal</a> for either participant in the pitched battle for the White House.</p>

<p>Tens of millions of views in the United States and several million more across the world will tune in to the debate at 9 pm Eastern Time or ET (01:00 am GMT, 06:30 am IST).</p>

<p>The significance of the debate and its timing can be ascertained from the fact that early voting will begin in quite a few states just days after the televised debate. The battle is so intense that even a small faux pas could result in a major swing in either direction.</p>

<p>The encounter is particularly crucial for Kamala Harris as latest opinion polls have suggested that more than a quarter of likely voters across the United States feel they do not yet know enough about the Vice President, in contrast to former President Donald Trump.</p>

<p><strong>THE BATTLE</strong></p>

<p>The globally televised debate offers Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor, the chance to make her case and corner Donald Trump, whose felony convictions, outspoken backing for supporters convicted of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and frequent falsehoods all offer plenty of fertile ground.</p>

<p>In the last few weeks, Donald Trump has also indulged in personal attacks on Kamala Harris, included racist and sexist insults.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris, 59, who enjoys a significant advantage among women voters according to the most recent polls, is expected to press Donald Trump on reproductive rights after he made a number of seemingly contradictory comments recently on abortion rights.</p>

<p>Donald Trump, 78, will meanwhile try to corner Kamala Harris, the current vice-president on issues like the economy, immigration, and inflation.</p>

<p>The ABC News debate is scheduled to last for 90 minutes and will be held without an audience. There are also some <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/these-are-the-5-rules-of-kamala-harris-vs-donald-trump-debate-6534850" target="_blank">established rules</a> for the debate.</p>

<p><strong>THE CANDIDATES, THE PREPARATION</strong></p>

<p>Kamala Harris is America's first female, Black and Indian-American Vice President. Ms Harris arrived in Philadelphia a day before the debate after isolating in a hotel in Pittsburgh for five days amid intense practice sessions.</p>

<p>Donald Trump's team has claimed that he has taken a more relaxed approach ahead of his seventh presidential debate, choosing to arrive in Philadelphia just hours before and keeping his preparations limited.</p>

<p>The debate will certainly see a contrast in styles of both candidates, but is likely to be a quiet one with the rules stating that the two candidates' microphones will be muted when they are not speaking. This was done on the Trump team's request.</p>

<p>While Donald Trump has been part of six previous Presidential debates, this would be the first one for Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>The 90-minute debate will take place at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SpiceJet said on Tuesday that Carlyle Group's commercial aviation investment and servicing unit will write off $40.2 million of the airline's lease arrears and convert $30 million of its arrears into equity.</p>

<p>The conversion, at 100 rupees ($1.19) per share of SpiceJet, is a 56% premium to its close on Monday.</p>

<p>The budget carrier's shares jumped as much as 6% after the announcement.</p>

<p>The write-off comes days after the airline said it will convert dues to Carlyle Aviation into equity and debentures. The airline has been struggling to fully restore operations despite multiple fundraises over the last year, trailing rivals IndiGo and Tata-owned Air India in terms of market share.</p>

<p>The conversion will "significantly" increase Carlyle Aviation's stake in the carrier, SpiceJet said.</p>

<p>Carlyle Aviation currently holds a nearly 6% stake in SpiceJet, the latter said in a response to a Reuters inquiry. The airline did not disclose the stake Carlyle Aviation will hold post-conversion.</p>

<p>Late last month, the country's aviation watchdog placed SpiceJet under enhanced surveillance after a recent audit revealed "certain deficiencies".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Tuesday's nationally televised debate, the first face-to-face meeting between Trump and his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, could be a critical juncture in a race that is essentially tied eight weeks before the November 5 election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the 2016 presidential debates, Republican candidate Donald Trump loomed over Democratic contender Hillary Clinton, called her a "nasty woman" and said she didn't have the "look" or "stamina" to serve as commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>Tuesday's nationally televised debate, the first face-to-face meeting between Trump and his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, could be a critical juncture in a race that is essentially tied eight weeks before the November 5 election.</p>

<p>Trump has already leveled a series of racist and sexist attacks against Harris. The former president has falsely claimed Harris, who is Black and South Asian, only recently "became a Black person." He reposted a vulgar online message suggesting she used sex to advance her career. He fired off insults that play into tropes about women and Black people, calling her "weak," "dumb as a rock" and "lazy."</p>

<p>Deploying those attacks in front of tens of millions of viewers - and Harris' response - would carry risks for both candidates, according to interviews with eight pollsters, debate and political experts, and Black activists. More than 51 million TV viewers tuned in to watch the debate between Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden in June.</p>

<p>Trump's insults might alienate key voter groups, including women, Black voters and moderates, according to John Geer, a professor at Vanderbilt University and an expert on presidential politics. "They're just going to get turned off by that kind of rhetoric," he said.</p>

<p>But Ford O'Connell, a Republican strategist, said the persistent tightness of the race showed that Trump's attacks had not cost him support.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris, who would be the first woman, Black woman and South Asian American to serve as president, faces a complicated political calculus on Tuesday.</p>

<p>If she brushes off Trump's attacks on the debate stage, as she has done on the campaign trail, she could be seen as unwilling to stand up for herself. If she engages with Trump's rhetoric, she could be dragged into the mudslinging he thrives on and expose herself to accusations, fair or not, that she is exploiting her race and gender.</p>

<p>Too forceful a reaction also risks playing into the stereotype of an angry Black woman, said Kelly Dittmar, the director of research for Rutgers University's Center for American Women and Politics.</p>

<p>"If Kamala calls it out, will she be accused of playing the race card, the gender card?" Dittmar said.</p>

<p><strong>'I'M SPEAKING'</strong></p>

<p>Harris has the additional challenge of fielding Trump's attacks while also defining herself for voters who are still getting to know her after her surprise entry into the race seven weeks ago.</p>

<p>In a national poll released on Sunday by The New York Times and Siena College, 28% of likely voters said they needed more information about Harris, while opinions on Trump were largely set.</p>

<p>Harris will try to avoid getting pulled into personal exchanges while aiming to draw Trump into the sort of offensive comments likely to go viral, campaign sources said.</p>

<p>Harris, a former prosecutor, may be able to send a more subtle signal about Trump's attacks without explicitly calling them out as racist or sexist. She managed that in her 2020 vice presidential debate against Mike Pence, when she responded to his interruptions by saying, "Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking," a moment that went viral.</p>

<p>"That was an effective way to acknowledge the gendered style of how men speak over women," Dittmar said. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In a radio interview that aired on Monday, Harris said she was prepared for Trump's tactics.</p>

<p>"[Trump] plays from this really old and tired playbook," she told the "The Rickey Smiley Morning Show." "There's no floor for him in terms of how low he will go."</p>

<p>In a call with reporters on Monday, former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who has been advising Trump ahead of the debate, said the former president would focus on Harris' record and speak to her the same way he did Biden.</p>

<p>"President Trump respects women and doesn't feel the need to be patronizing or to speak to women in any other way than he would speak to a man," Gabbard said.</p>

<p>Trump has previously dismissed calls from advisers and fellow Republicans to moderate his tone and stick to the issues, telling reporters, "I have to do it my way."</p>

<p><strong>PERSONAL ATTACKS</strong></p>

<p>But the former president has labored to find an effective attack line against Harris, who unlike Clinton is not saddled with decades of political baggage, and who has unleashed a wave of energy among Democrats since she took over Biden's flailing reelection campaign.</p>

<p>The Democratic research firm Blueprint polled various negative messages against Harris in late July and found that personal attacks based on her race, gender or family were "incredibly unproductive" across all voter groups, including independents, according to Evan Roth Smith, the firm's pollster.</p>

<p>Criticisms that focus on immigration and economic policies or portray Harris as a California liberal tested better, Smith said.</p>

<p>The firm also examined possible rebuttals to attacks focused on Harris' race and gender. Responding by calling Trump racist was far less effective than labeling the insults a distraction from Trump's "extreme" agenda. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Some Trump attacks - such as questioning Harris' Blackness - are so transparently false that Harris doesn't need to respond directly, said Andra Gillespie, a professor at Emory University who researches African American politics.</p>

<p>"It was so unbelievably outrageous that everybody was like, 'That's ridiculous,'" she said. "She didn't have to say anything."</p>

<p>But Aaron Kall, a debate expert at the University of Michigan, said Trump should not be underestimated. Trump has proven to be a skilled debater, Kall said, dispatching more experienced opponents with sharp retorts and unpredictable segues and using his background as a reality television star to command the camera.</p>

<p>"He may be the best counter-punching debater of all time," Kall said. "He gets people off their talking points. He has relatable language and talks like undecided voters.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel is planning a major investment in India in the semiconductor sector, its envoy said today, calling the development a "big news".</p>

<p>"Israel will soon invest in the semiconductor industry in India, the newly appointed Ambassador of Israel to India, Reuven Azar, told news agency ANI, adding that, "We expect big news when it comes to semiconductors in the coming days, we have something in the pipeline," he said.</p>

<p>Israel has announced that it will make a major announcement regarding the semiconductor industry, likely from a private Israeli company.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While he refused to reveal any specific information, Mr Azar said, "I don't want to put the carriage in front of horses; there are some private sector people that are initiating this, they are going to announce it, the trend is very clear, we are going to see a lot of movement there and another field we want to promote."</p>

<p>There have been reports suggesting that Tower Semiconductor, an Israeli company specialising in manufacturing integrated circuits, is expected to invest billions of dollars in India. However, no official announcements have been made yet.</p>

<p>The Ambassador also shared that Israel is planning to invest USD 35 billion in infrastructure projects, including a new metro system in Tel Aviv and an airport. For this, Israel is seeking the help of Indian infrastructure companies, he said.</p>

<p>This comes days after India signed a semiconductor ecosystem partnership with Singapore during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the country last week.</p>

<p>The government had launched the India Semiconductor Mission in 2021 with a Rs 76,000 crore chip incentive scheme. This was part of a recent push by the centre to grow semiconductor manufacturing in the country.</p>

<p>When asked whether Israel would prefer India over China as an investment destination, the Ambassador said, "I am a diplomat but it goes without saying that the bonds that unite India and Israel are unique. First of all because of our common history. Both Jewish and Indian people were subjected to the invasion of empires 2,000 years ago...We have in common principles of freedom and motivation of accepting others."</p>

<p>He also highlighted the strong relationship between PM Modi and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, noting how it helps in strengthening the ties between the two nations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Frenchman being tried for recruiting strangers to rape his drugged wife will be back in court to testify on Wednesday after being admitted to hospital, the presiding judge at his trial said.</p>

<p>The hospital admission on Tuesday of Dominique Pelicot, a 71-year-old retiree accused of repeatedly raping and enlisting dozens of strangers to abuse his heavily sedated wife, had sparked speculation that the trial may be adjourned, but the presiding judge said the trial could now continue as planned.</p>

<p>The judge, Roger Arata, said he had been handed a medical certificate saying that Pelicot was fit to resume his ordinary daily activities and his state allowed the transfer from his prison cell to the courtroom.</p>

<p>Pelicot has been on trial since last week, as are 50 other men, aged between 26 and 74, for alleged involvement, in a case that has horrified France.</p>

<p>The main defendant, who has admitted to the charges against him, had been scheduled to be questioned on Tuesday afternoon, but on Monday appeared frail, leaning on a cane and the glass side of the dock, and was excused from court over what his lawyer Beatrice Zavarro said was abdominal pain.</p>

<p>Zavarro said that her client was in no way "evading" his trial.</p>

<p>"He has always said he would be present and testify. It's essential," she added.</p>

<p>Presiding judge Arata ordered that the accused be examined, saying he could request a suspension of the trial "until his state of health improves".</p>

<p><strong>'Nothing will change'</strong></p>

<p>But based on the doctor's note, Arata said on Tuesday that now "nothing will change" for Wednesday's agenda, and Pelicot would be questioned "during the breaks" scheduled in the original programme.</p>

<p>Experts on Monday had described Pelicot as a self-centred manipulator with no empathy and a split personality.</p>

<p>His ex-wife and victim Gisele Pelicot, 71, says she was troubled by strange memory lapses for years until police uncovered the abuse by chance after he was caught filming up women's skirts in a local supermarket.</p>

<p>The trial is open to the public at her request to raise awareness about the use of drugs to commit sexual assault.</p>

<p>The family's attorney Stephane Babonneau earlier on Tuesday said it was "absolutely necessary that Mr Pelicot be treated medically and be able to attend the debates".</p>

<p>Gisele "Pelicot and her children do not wish to testify without him being present," he added.</p>

<p>Most of the alleged rapes took place in the Pelicot home in Mazan, a village of 6,000 people in the southern region of Provence.</p>

<p>Pelicot kept meticulous records of the abuse of his wife, discovered after police seized his computer and other equipment.</p>

<p><strong>'Deep unconscious state'</strong></p>

<p>An investigator, who waded through images and footage found on the main defendant's computer, told the court on Tuesday that all the co-accused must have known that Gisele Pelicot was unconscious.</p>

<p>"Beyond the images, you need to listen to the sound. You immediately notice that she's sleeping," Stephan Gal said.</p>

<p>"Some even came back on several occasions, and none could have been unaware that she was in a deep unconscious state."</p>

<p>Eighteen of the 51 accused, including Pelicot, are in custody, while 32 other defendants are attending the trial as free men.</p>

<p>The last one, still at large, is being judged in absentia.</p>

<p>The investigator recounted the case of one of the co-defendants, Mathieu D., accused of sexually abusing Gisele Pelicot, like many others without a condom.</p>

<p>Police identified him thanks to a distinctive tattoo, Gal said.</p>

<p>They found his contact in the main defendant's telephone, and his phone data showed he was in Mazan on the same day.</p>

<p>When interrogated, Mathieu D. "said he knew Dominique Pelicot was going to put his wife to sleep, but he thought it was part of a 'sexual game'. He said it was presented as a scenario and he had naively, blindly gone for it," Gal said.</p>

<p>The main defendant's daughter Caroline Darian, 45, has said her life was "literally turned upside down" when she heard of the abuse.</p>

<p>Photomontages of her naked had also been found on her father's computer.</p>

<p>The couple's two sons are still due to speak.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Revising its travel advisory for Pakistan, the United States has advised its citizens to reconsider travelling to the country citing a threat of terrorism. The advisory mentions the "immediate vicinity" of the India-Pakistan border and the Line of Control on the Pakistani side due to terrorism and the potential for armed conflict, and the restive Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces and the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) because of a threat of terror acts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In its updated travel advisory issued on Tuesday after a periodic review, the US has classified the country under Level 3, which means "reconsider travel". It is just a step below the final Level 4 category, which is "do not travel". Level 4 has been applied to the Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and FATA areas as well as the vicinity of the Line of Control.</p>

<p>The advisory noted that Pakistan's security environment is fluid, "sometimes changing with little or no notice" and violent extremist groups are continuing to plot attacks in the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Large-scale terrorist attacks have resulted in numerous casualties, and small-scale attacks are frequent. Terrorism and ongoing violence by extremist elements have led to indiscriminate attacks on civilian, as well as local military and police targets. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, military installations, airports, universities, tourist attractions, schools, hospitals, places of worship, and government facilities. Terrorists have targeted US diplomats and diplomatic facilities in the past," the advisory said. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"Local law prohibits protesting or demonstrating without a permit. Being near a protest can draw scrutiny from Pakistani security forces. US citizens have been detained for participating in protests and for posting content on social media perceived as critical of the Pakistani government, military, or officials. Internet and mobile phone service outages are common, especially during protests," it added.</p>

<p>On Balochistan, the advisory said extremist groups have conducted deadly terrorist attacks while the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, it said, has seen terrorist and insurgent groups targeting government officials and civilians.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Assassination and kidnapping attempts are common, including the targeting of polio eradication teams and Government of Pakistan security service (police and military) personnel," the advisory said of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including the former FATA.&nbsp;</p>

<p>About the vicinity of the Line of Control on the Pakistani side, the advisory said militant groups are known to operate in the area and India and Pakistan maintain a strong military presence on both sides of the border.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday demanded an overhaul of Israeli military conduct in the occupied West Bank as he decried the fatal shooting of an American protester against settlement expansion, which Israel said was accidental.</p>

<p>Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, 26, who is also a Turkish national, was shot dead last Friday at a protest march in Beita, a village near Nablus where Palestinians have been repeatedly attacked by far-right Jewish settlers.</p>

<p>Israel's military said on Tuesday that its initial inquiry found it was highly likely its troops had fired the shot that killed her but that her death was unintentional, and it voiced deep regret.</p>

<p>In his strongest comments to date criticising the security forces of Washington's closest Middle East ally, Blinken described Eygi's killing as "unprovoked and unjustified". He said Washington would insist to the Israeli government that it makes changes to how its forces operate in the West Bank.</p>

<p>"No one should be shot and killed for attending a protest. No one should have to put their life at risk just for freely expressing their views," he told reporters in London.</p>

<p>"In our judgment, Israeli security forces need to make some fundamental changes in the way that they operate in the West Bank, including changes to their rules of engagement.</p>

<p>"Now we have the second American citizen killed at the hands of Israeli security forces. It's not acceptable," he said.</p>

<p>An Israeli government spokesperson declined to comment on Blinken's remarks.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said an investigation by the Military Police Criminal Investigation Division was under way and its findings would be submitted for higher-level review once completed.</p>

<p>"We're going to be watching that very, very closely," White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters, saying a criminal probe was an unusual step by Israel's military.</p>

<p>"We're going to want to see where it goes now in terms of the criminal investigation and what they find, and if and how anyone is held accountable," Kirby added.</p>

<p>Eygi's family called the preliminary inquiry "wholly inadequate" and urged U.S. President Joe Biden to demand an independent investigation.</p>

<p><strong>PRELIMINARY INQUIRY</strong></p>

<p>In a statement, the Israeli military said its commanders had conducted an initial investigation into the incident and found that the gunfire was not aimed at her but another individual it called "the key instigator of the riot."</p>

<p>"The incident took place during a violent riot in which dozens of Palestinian suspects burned tyres and hurled rocks towards security forces at the Beita Junction," it said.</p>

<p>Israel has sent a request to Palestinian authorities to carry out an autopsy, it said.</p>

<p>"We are deeply offended by the suggestion that her killing by a trained sniper was in any way unintentional," Eygi's family said in a statement.</p>

<p>A surge in violent settler assaults on Palestinians in the West Bank has stirred anger among Western allies of Israel, including the United States, which has imposed sanctions on some Israelis involved in the hardline settler movement. Tensions have been heightened amid Israel's war against Hamas militants in Gaza.</p>

<p>Palestinians have held weekly protests in Beita since 2020 over the expansion of nearby Evyatar, a settler outpost. Ultra-nationalist members of Israel's ruling coalition have acted to legalise previously unauthorised outposts like Evyatar, a move Washington says threatens the stability of the West Bank and undercuts efforts toward a two-state solution to the conflict.</p>

<p>Since the 1967 Middle East war, Israel has occupied the West Bank of the Jordan River, an area Palestinians want as the core of a future independent state.</p>

<p>Israel has built a thickening array of settlements there that most countries deem illegal. Israel disputes that assertion, citing historical and biblical ties to the territory.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Western powers on Tuesday announced fresh sanctions on Iran for supplying Russia with short-range missiles for imminent use against Ukraine, calling it a dangerous escalation of the conflict that threatened European security.</p>

<p>Britain, France and Germany said they would cut aviation agreements with the Islamic republic and sanction its national carrier Iran Air, claiming Tehran had repeatedly defied warnings about the weapons transfers.</p>

<p>"This act is an escalation by both Iran and Russia, and is a direct threat to European security," the so-called E3 powers said in a joint statement.</p>

<p>On a visit to London, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned that the missiles could be used against Ukraine "within weeks".</p>

<p>Dozens of Russian military personnel have trained in Iran using the Fath-360 missile, which has a range of 75 miles (120 kilometres), he added.</p>

<p>"Iran's new president and foreign minister have repeatedly said that they want to restore engagement with Europe," he said.</p>

<p>"They want to receive sanctions relief. Destabilising actions like these will achieve exactly the opposite."</p>

<p>The British government announced soon afterwards that it had already begun "the termination of all direct air services between the UK and Iran".</p>

<p>Washington accused Iran Air of "operating or having operated in the transportation sector of the Russian Federation economy", sanctioning it and 10 individuals and companies involved in the supply.</p>

<p>The move was dismissed In Iran, where foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said the Western claims were false and a distraction from US backing for Israel in its war against Hamas militants.</p>

<p>"Spreading false and misleading news about the transfer of Iranian weapons to some countries is just an ugly propaganda and lie with the aim of concealing the dimensions of the massive illegal arms support of the United States and some Western countries for the genocide in the Gaza Strip," he added.</p>

<p><strong>Joint Ukraine visit</strong></p>

<p>On Ukraine, the State Department said that Blinken would travel to Kyiv on Wednesday in a solidarity trip with UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, as Ukrainian forces face Russian advances in the east.</p>

<p>Moscow has stepped up its aerial attacks in recent weeks but is also trying to fight off a major Ukrainian cross-border offensive into its western Kursk region, which has reshaped the course of the two-and-a-half-year war.</p>

<p>Lammy said the joint trip demonstrated the two countries' commitment to Ukraine, and comes before UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer visits the White House on Friday.</p>

<p>Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Britain has been at the forefront of pushing for more assistance to Kyiv, including loosening restrictions on the use of Western weapons on Russian territory.</p>

<p>Asked about reports that Britain is waiting for a US green light to let Ukraine use long-range Storm Shadow missiles against Russia, Lammy said he would not discuss "operational issues" as "the only person who could benefit" was Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>Last week, the UK said that it would send Ukraine 650 new specialist missile systems after President Volodymyr Zelensky complained of slow deliveries from the West.</p>

<p><strong>'Special relationship'</strong></p>

<p>The US-UK "special relationship" has persevered across partisan lines since Starmer's Labour ended the Conservatives 14 years in power in July.</p>

<p>But for Starmer, a full alignment with President Joe Biden's Democratic Party agenda could carry risks just two months before US elections in which Biden's political heir Kamala Harris is running neck and neck in polls with Republican Donald Trump.</p>

<p>While backing Ukraine, Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, has taken a harder line than the Conservatives on Israel, which relies on the United States as its foremost backer in the Gaza war.</p>

<p>His Labour government last week announced restrictions on some weapons to Israel, voicing concern that they could be used to violate international humanitarian law.</p>

<p>The Labour government has also dropped its Conservative predecessor's plans to challenge the right of the International Criminal Court to seek the arrest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

<p>The United States -- while backing The Hague-based court when it comes to Russia -- has denounced the bid to target Netanyahu, arguing that Israel has its own ways to ensure accountability.</p>

<p>Asked if Britain would oppose a formal move to seek Netanyahu's arrest, and with Blinken by his side, Lammy said that "we believe in international law".</p>

<p>"We believe in the statute of Rome," he added, referring to the treaty that founded the International Criminal Court.</p>

<p>"But these must be decisions for the international courts to determine."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Justin Trudeau may survive as Canada's prime minister into next year, political analysts say, even though his minority Liberal government is more vulnerable after a small left-wing party withdrew a pledge to support it on key votes.</p>

<p>Mr Trudeau, facing voter fatigue after almost nine years in power, was weakened last week when the New Democratic Party ended a 2022 deal in which it agreed to back him in return for more social spending.</p>

<p>The change of heart means the 52-year-old prime minister can no longer be sure of surviving confidence votes in the elected House of Commons chamber, where the Liberals only hold 154 of the 338 seats.</p>

<p>If 170 opposition legislators vote against the Liberals, the government would fall before its term expires at the end of October 2025, forcing an early general election.</p>

<p>In that scenario, polls strongly suggest the right-of-center Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, would win a majority.</p>

<p>Mr Trudeau appears safe at least for about a couple of months. The next confidence vote the government must face is when it asks the House to ratify the so-called budget update, due in late November or December.</p>

<p>When such a vote takes place, the NDP will have the option of voting with the Liberals. NDP leader Jagmeet Singh last week said his party would decide on such votes on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>Crucially, there is doubt over whether the NDP wants to pull down Mr Trudeau, since polls suggest the Conservatives, who have blamed the government for rising prices and a housing crisis, could squeeze the number of seats the small party might win in an early election.</p>

<p>"There's a lot of expectation here that the NDP is actually planning on making the government fall, and I have yet to see evidence for that," said Philippe Lagasse, a professor and constitutional expert at Ottawa's Carleton University.</p>

<p>Jagmeet Singh ended his automatic support for Mr Trudeau after months of private complaints that voters were not giving the NDP credit for the government's increased social spending.</p>

<p>But Nik Nanos, head of Nanos Research, said the NDP had little interest in bringing down the Liberals soon, since Jagmeet Singh needs time to carve out an identity separate from Mr Trudeau's after supporting him for so long.</p>

<p>"It would be difficult to reconcile propping the Liberals up ... one day, and the next, campaigning against them," Nanos said.</p>

<p><strong>Winter Election</strong></p>

<p>Parliamentary rules dictate that the three opposition parties have a total of seven chances between Sept. 16 and Dec. 10 to present whatever motions they wish. The Conservatives, the largest opposition party, would most likely have three of those opportunities to bring Mr Trudeau down.</p>

<p>But the timing of opposition motions is in the hands of Liberal House leader Karina Gould, who could bunch them at the very end of the session in December.</p>

<p>A Liberal defeat in such a motion would mean a winter election, something that tends to be unpopular with voters. The results could prove more difficult to predict, giving the NDP pause in any push to bring the government down.</p>

<p>Karina Gould's office did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>NDP legislators could abstain on key votes. Former Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff used that tactic when in opposition in 2010 to avoid bringing down a minority Conservative government.</p>

<p>That said, Jagmeet Singh's case-by-case strategy has its limits, said Karl Belanger, a former top NDP official.</p>

<p>"The NDP cannot afford to vote for the Liberals in confidence vote after confidence vote without getting anything in return," he said.</p>

<p>As an alternative, Mr Trudeau could turn to the separatist Bloc Quebecois, the third-largest party in the House. It tilts left of center, like the Liberals, but seeks to take Quebec out of the Canadian confederation. Working with the separatists could prove to be politically toxic for the Liberals.</p>

<p>If Mr Trudeau manages to hold power into 2025, a vote on the federal budget, usually in March or early April, is the next danger point. At that time, he might decide to take the country to the polls, although a senior Trudeau aide said the prime minister had no plans to trigger an early election.</p>

<p>As well as external threats, Mr Trudeau faces unhappiness inside his own party over the poor poll numbers. Even so, he insists he will not step down as Liberal leader and prime minister.</p>

<p>Mr Trudeau and the rest of his Liberal caucus gathered in British Columbia this week to plot strategy. As it started, the Liberals announced that former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney, often mentioned as a potential replacement, would chair a task force reporting to the prime minister on economic growth.</p>

<p>Liberal grumbling - and speculation about Carney - picked up after the party lost a safe seat to the Conservatives in a special election in June. Mr Trudeau aides concede the pressure for him to quit could grow if the party loses another special election, this time in a Montreal stronghold, on Sept. 16.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein, 72, was recovering and "out of danger" Tuesday following emergency heart surgery, a representative told AFP.</p>

<p>Harvey Weinstein, who is being held at New York's Rikers Island prison, was rushed to hospital overnight Sunday to Monday for the operation.</p>

<p>"He's resting. He's weak," his spokesman Juda Engelmayer told AFP. "He's out of danger at the moment."</p>

<p>Weinstein is serving a 16-year sentence after being convicted on rape charges by a California court.</p>

<p>He had also been convicted by a New York court in 2020 of the rape and sexual assault of actor Jessica Mann and of forcibly performing oral sex on a production assistant. He was sentenced to 23 years in prison in that case.</p>

<p>An appeals court, however, overturned that conviction in April, a shock reversal in one of the defining cases of the #MeToo movement.</p>

<p>He is now awaiting retrial in that case.</p>

<p>Prosecutors say they may bring new sexual assault charges against him ahead of the retrial, and Weinstein was due to attend a procedural hearing in that case on Thursday.</p>

<p>His lawyers have argued for a retrial in the California case, too.</p>

<p>Arthur Aidala, Weinstein's lawyer, said in July that his client's health had deteriorated in prison.</p>

<p>The once-powerful film mogul has made court appearances in a wheelchair, looking frail and pale.</p>

<p>In 2017, the allegations against Weinstein helped launch the #MeToo movement, a watershed moment for women fighting sexual misconduct.</p>

<p>More than 80 women accused him of harassment, sexual assault or rape, including prominent actors Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ashley Judd.</p>

<p>Weinstein says that any sexual relations in question were consensual.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK said Tuesday it has started terminating "all direct air services between the UK and Iran" as part of new sanctions on Tehran for supplying Russia with missiles to use in Ukraine.</p>

<p>London said it was acting alongside international partners to "cancel its bilateral air services arrangements with Iran", which would "restrict Iran Air's ability to fly in to the UK".</p>

<p>Iran Air operates direct flights between London and Tehran three days a week, according to the schedule listed on its website.</p>

<p>The UK move came as Western powers unveiled fresh sanctions on Iran for supplying Russia with short-range missiles for imminent use against Ukraine, calling it a dangerous escalation of the conflict that threatened European security.</p>

<p>The foreign ministry in London said in a statement shortly after the curbs were announced that they followed "repeated warnings" to Tehran not to transfer the deadly weapons to Russia.</p>

<p>"We will continue to use every lever at our disposal to put pressure on Iran to end its support for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's illegal invasion," UK Transport Secretary Louise Haigh said.</p>

<p>"(This) is why we have begun the termination of all direct air services between the UK and Iran."</p>

<p>The UK said it was also joining the United States in sanctioning "a number of key individuals and organisations for their role in facilitating Iran's military support to Russia".</p>

<p>It noted they included those involved in ballistic missile and drone supply chains.</p>

<p>Several Russian organisations were also sanctioned for "their intent to use the weapons systems" against Ukraine, as well as five Russian cargo ships involved in transporting military supplies from Iran to Russia.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The woman at the centre of an affair that led to the resignation of Italy's culture minister was banned from parliament on Tuesday for allegedly illicitly filming inside the chamber using spy glasses.</p>

<p>Gennaro Sangiuliano quit his post last week after admitting to having an affair with Maria Rosaria Boccia and trying to hire her as an adviser, before having second thoughts due to conflict of interest issues.</p>

<p>Boccia was disciplined by the lower house of parliament over videos captured with a pair of glasses equipped with a camera and microphone, through which she said she wanted to give her followers a guided tour of parliamentary corridors and rooms.</p>

<p>In a statement, the committee said Boccia would not be allowed in "until otherwise decided by the competent bodies", in light of the violation of the rule prohibiting the taking and circulation of photos and videos from inside the building.</p>

<p>"The violation affected particularly sensitive sites," the statement added.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Boccia wrote on her Instagram account that she had done nothing illegal with the glasses.</p>

<p>The Boccia-Sangiuliano case has dominated Italian media coverage for the past two weeks, embarrassing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and forcing the first ministerial resignation since her right-wing coalition took office in late 2022.</p>

<p>Boccia filled her Instagram account with pictures of herself accompanying Sangiuliano to various events, and said in media interviews she had access to ministry premises and documents in her role as a consultant.</p>

<p>Her appointment, however, was never formalised.</p>

<p>Judicial sources told Reuters on Tuesday that prosecutors opened an investigation into Sangiuliano for possible misuse of public funds and disclosure of confidential information. The Court of Auditors is also looking into the case.</p>

<p>Sangiuliano repeatedly said no public money had been spent on Boccia and denied she had access to any classified document. He has also pledged to take legal action against his former mistress.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar today held wide-ranging discussions with his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock and took stock of the India-Germany Strategic Partnership, covering areas such as trade, defence and security.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar, who arrived in Berlin from Saudi Arabia after attending the first India-Gulf Cooperation Council Ministerial Meeting for Strategic Dialogue, said they also exchanged views on Ukraine, Gaza and the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<p>"Held wide-ranging discussions with FM @ABaerbock in Berlin today. Took stock of India-Germany Strategic Partnership, with a focus on trade and investment, green &amp; sustainable development, skilled workers' mobility, technology and defence &amp; security," the minister said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said he also exchanged views on Ukraine, Gaza and the Indo-Pacific region and added that he was looking forward to welcoming Baerbock to India for the 7th Intergovernmental Consultations.</p>

<p>"Ms Baerbock and I had a good discussion on the state of the world...Our conversation touched on many subjects...We discussed Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi's recent visit to Ukraine. We talked about the situation in West Asia/Middle East, especially the Gaza conflict and its ramifications," Mr Jaishankar said in a press statement alongside the German foreign minister.</p>

<p>He said they also spent some time on the Indo-Pacific and briefly on some things which have been happening in their immediate neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"Our interactions in defence and security have also increased. We held the first-ever air exercises this year. And we hope to welcome your naval ships in Goa next month. Our policy and other exchanges have been mutually beneficial. And we would like to explore how our defence industries can cooperate more closely," he said.</p>

<p>During their talks, they also touched briefly on cooperation with the European Union. "With the incoming Commission, we hope to move faster on the FTA, and other agreements and we count on Germany's support for that. Also, we would like to hold an early meeting of the Trade and Technology Council," the minister said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said India plans to create 12 new industrial zones across the country and this can constitute new opportunities for India-Germany cooperation.</p>

<p>"Trade between us is probably in the range of about USD 30 billion annually. And I think investments from Germany are about 25 million USD, it's somewhat less from our side. But what is clear is that there is still a vast potential till there to be realized," he said.</p>

<p>"Germany is a crucial partner in accelerating our growth and development. In turn, India can contribute to building reliable and resilient supply chains, diversified production and trusted digital partnerships. We welcome the forthcoming Asia Pacific Conference of German businesses in New Delhi in October 2024," he added.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said that when Ms Baerbock visited India in December 2022, they signed a Migration and Mobility Partnership Agreement. "This has facilitated a smooth movement of skills and talent and I was pleased to learn that today there are 125,000 Indian nationals who are working in their professional capacity in Germany," he said.</p>

<p>He said both India and Germany are active internationally in a variety of geographies and programmes. "We exchanged views about how we can work together where possible in third countries," he said.</p>

<p>"Later this month, we will be heading to New York for the UNGA. This year there is a special Summit of the Future and Germany is one of the co-facilitators. We naturally discussed global issues and reforming the UN. Do remember that we are both aspiring for a more prominent role in the UN Security Council," he added.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar earlier addressed the Annual Ambassadors' Conference of the German Foreign Office in Berlin.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A slick video by Catherine, Princess of Wales announcing that her chemotherapy has finished marks a dramatic shift in communications for the British royal family, media and commentators said Tuesday.</p>

<p>Kate, as she is widely known, posted the three-minute footage on social media on Tuesday, some six months after she dramatically revealed in another video that she was being treated for the condition.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">A message from Catherine, The Princess of Wales<br />
<br />
As the summer comes to an end, I cannot tell you what a relief it is to have finally completed my chemotherapy treatment.<br />
<br />
The last nine months have been incredibly tough for us as a family. Life as you know it can change in an… <a href="https://t.co/9S1W8sDHUL">pic.twitter.com/9S1W8sDHUL</a></p>
— The Prince and Princess of Wales (@KensingtonRoyal) <a href="https://twitter.com/KensingtonRoyal/status/1833165733368574081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 9, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>But the intimate portrait of the 42-year-old princess, her husband Prince William and their young children was notable for its departure from the stiff formality of traditional royal public relations.</p>

<p>"It's groundbreaking, an absolute first, a tectonic shift in how the royal family controls its image," said PR consultant Mark Borkowski.</p>

<p>"Kate's journey is profound and deeply personal, but they've learned that emotion can be controlled -- and weaponised -- in small, potent doses.</p>

<p>"By doing this through a polished film, they maintain dignity and control while still appearing relatable."</p>

<p>The Times likened the video, shot by filmmaker Will Warr in the Norfolk countryside of eastern England where the family has a home, to a Hollywood trailer for the Instagram generation.</p>

<p>The daily assessed it was "the most intimate portrayal of royal family since (Queen Elizabeth II) invited a fly-on-the-wall documentary crew into her home in 1969".</p>

<p>"In 40 years of covering the Royal Family I have never seen anything like Catherine's video. It's a first for the royals," veteran photographer Arthur Edwards wrote in The Sun tabloid.</p>

<p><strong>Narrative</strong></p>

<p>Newspapers sought to decode the meaning behind the soft-focus scenes of the young family seeking solace in nature and enjoying each other's company.</p>

<p>Many saw in it a clear sign that the princess, who will be queen when William succeeds his father King Charles III, was carefully attempting to control the narrative of her illness.</p>

<p>"She's the one in the driving seat," said The Times, while Jennie Bond, a former BBC royal correspondent, said she was "putting down her marker" for the future.</p>

<p>"This is how she wants to communicate with people," she told Sky News.</p>

<p>"With this she has shown she wants to be straight with people, she wants to be direct, she wants the message to be quite simple."</p>

<p>The largely positive public response to the video comes after criticism of Kensington Palace, the couple's private office, and its handling of communications about Kate's illness this year.</p>

<p>Speculation ran riot, especially online, after Kate -- one of the world's most photographed women -- was not seen in public for months following abdominal surgery in January.</p>

<p>An attempt to silence the rumours failed in March, when a family portrait, issued by the palace, was found to have been digitally altered, fuelling the chatter.</p>

<p>Kate's announcement that she was being treated for an undisclosed form of cancer followed soon afterwards, prompting widespread public sympathy and support.</p>

<p>Borkowski said the latest video, and Kate's commentary accompanying it, showed the royal family was now "on the front foot".</p>

<p>"They lost control of the cancer narrative by staying silent," he added. "It shows they learnt from earlier mistakes," he added.</p>

<p>Like other senior royals, William and Kate have a strong social media presence, which is seen as essential to maintain the British royal family's relevance and appeal.</p>

<p>Since the late queen's death, Charles has faced vocal protests from republicans who want an elected head of state instead of a hereditary monarch, and a decline in support among younger people.</p>

<p>Royal author Robert Jobson, who has recently published a new biography on Kate, told reporters in London that accountability and transparency was "very important" for the taxpayer-funded royals.</p>

<p>But he said Kate's full return to public duties could still take time as she seeks to fully recover.</p>

<p>According to The Sun, William, on a visit to Wales on Tuesday, told well-wishers that the end of Kate's chemotherapy was "good news" but added: "There is still a long way to go."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Israeli strike Tuesday on eastern Lebanon killed a Hezbollah commander, a source close to the group and the Israeli military said, with the Iran-backed movement saying it launched rockets in retaliation.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has traded near-daily fire with Israeli forces in support of ally Hamas since the Palestinian group's October 7 attack triggered war in the Gaza Strip, with repeated escalations during more than 11 months of the cross-border violence.</p>

<p>A source close to Hezbollah told AFP that Mohammad Qassem al-Shaer, "a field commander" in the group's elite Radwan Force, "was targeted in an Israeli strike on a motorcycle in the Bekaa" Valley in Lebanon's east, far from the Israeli border.</p>

<p>Hezbollah earlier announced Shaer had been killed by Israeli fire, but did not refer to him as a commander.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said its air force "eliminated the terrorist Mohammad Qassem al-Shaer in the area of Qaraoun", in the Bekaa Valley, referring to him as "a Hezbollah Radwan Force commander".</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Lebanon's health ministry said an "Israeli enemy" strike on a building in the southern city of Nabatiyeh wounded 12 people, most of them lightly, revising an earlier toll.</p>

<p>Hezbollah later said it launched "dozens of Katyusha rockets" at two north Israel military positions "in response to the enemy attacks... particularly the assassination the enemy carried out in the Bekaa" Valley and the "targeting of a building", referring to the Nabatiyeh strike.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said about 45 "projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanon", with some intercepted and no immediate reports of casualties, adding that the air force later struck "Hezbollah launchers" in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>The cross-border violence since early October has killed some 615 people in Lebanon, mostly fighters but also including 138 civilians, according to an AFP tally.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, including in the annexed Golan Heights, authorities have announced the deaths of at least 24 soldiers and 26 civilians.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistani authorities arrested several leaders of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan's party, including its chairman and around a dozen lawmakers, as National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq on Tuesday promised action against those responsible for the crackdown.</p>

<p>The Pakistan-Tehreek-e-Insaf workers had clashed with police, injuring several police officials, including a senior officer, during a rally of the party on Sunday. The government accused the party of violating the permission for the rally by over-stepping the allotted time limit.</p>

<p>PTI chairman Gohar Khan and fellow member of parliament Sher Afzal Khan Marwat were arrested from outside the Parliament building while leading lawyer and party leader Shoaib Shaheen was arrested from his office by Islamabad police on Monday night, according to police spokesperson Jawad Taqi.</p>

<p>PTI spokesman Zulfi Bokhari confirmed in a WhatsApp group that thirteen PTI leaders were arrested since night raids, including Gohar Khan, Sher Afzal Marwat, Shoaib Shaheen, Sheikh Waqas, Zain Qureshi, Ahmad Chatha, Molana Naseem, Awais Jhakhar, Amir Dogar, Shah Ahad, Yousaf Khattak, Lateef Chitrali and Zubair Khan.</p>

<p>National Assembly Speaker Sadiq took notice of the development and said he "will take action on the incident and address it seriously".</p>

<p>Mr Sadiq, the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader, further said that if necessary, an FIR would be filed, and those involved in the crackdown would be named as he summoned political leaders from all parties for an urgent meeting in his chamber to discuss further steps.</p>

<p>He also summoned Islamabad's Inspector General of Police Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi and a senior superintendent of police for allegedly arresting the PTI leaders from within the jurisdiction of the parliament.</p>

<p>According to a parliamentary rule, police should inform the speaker before arresting any lawmaker and the rule was violated in the case.</p>

<p>The PTI also shared videos on social media about the arrest of some of its leaders.</p>

<p>Speaking to the media after his release on Tuesday evening, Gohar termed the arrests as an attack on the parliament and September 9 as "a black day for Pakistan".</p>

<p>"PTI will not forget this," he said. "This time, CCTV footage would be disclosed and this time, the common person would not be punished." He said that the PTI was targeted by the government, but the party forgave it for the sake of the country, people and democracy.</p>

<p>"Our election result was changed, but we didn't go for a rally, we didn't resort to a boycott," Gohar said. "We stayed in parliament so we could play our role and we did so." He warned that if the largest political party was not given space, then non-political elements would get stronger. "Extremist and separatist movements will get stronger," he said.</p>

<p>He also announced to challenge the arrest of other party leaders in the high court.</p>

<p>Referring to Mr Marwat's arrest, the PTI said in a post on X that the "PML-N government should be completely ashamed of this step against a sitting MNA".</p>

<p>In another post on X, the party condemned the "illegal" arrest of party chairman Gohar Khan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is a moment of shame for entire parliament, as this must be considered a direct attack on the remaining democracy in Pakistan...Speaker NA should be ashamed for allowing such disrespect to parliament. Pakistan has descended further into the undeclared Martial Law," the post said.</p>

<p>Omar Ayub Khan, the Leader of the Opposition, condemned the arrests and alleged that Islamabad police had formed teams to arrest him, PTI leader Zartaj Gul Wazir, and "other colleagues".</p>

<p>"This fascist regime and its backers have gone completely mad," Omar wrote in a statement on X. "Just found out that they have included my name along with Zartaj Gul sahiba and other colleagues in 2 additional FIRs. Islamabad Police teams have been made for our arrests." Speaking against the arrest in the parliament, PTI leader Ali Muhammad Khan condemned the police raid at Parliament House, calling it an assault on democracy and Pakistan.</p>

<p>"Democracy has faced arrests before, but what happened last night, with masked men entering parliament and arresting members, is unacceptable," he said.</p>

<p>Members of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), both government allies, also expressed discontent with the arrests, warning that it would further escalate tensions.</p>

<p>The arrests come just a day after the PTI flexed its muscles through a political rally in the suburbs of Islamabad, demanding the release of their leader Imran Khan and warning to get him out of jail through street protests.</p>

<p>The 71-year-old former-cricketer-turned-politician faces a slew of legal cases and has been in prison for more than a year after being sentenced in a graft case.</p>

<p>Mr Khan was arrested on August 5 last year after his conviction in the first Toshakhana corruption case filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan. Since then, he has been in jail in different cases.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

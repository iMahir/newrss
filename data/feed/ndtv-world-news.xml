       <description><![CDATA[They targeted primarily adult men in the US and used fake accounts to mask their identities Meta said in a statement]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta on Wednesday said it has removed 63,000 Instagram accounts linked to sextortion scams from Nigeria, days after authorities in the West African country slapped a $220 million fine on the company.</p>

<p>The deleted accounts included a network of 2,500 profiles traced to a group of 20 people.</p>

<p>Some 1,300 Facebook accounts, 200 Facebook Pages and 5,700 Facebook Groups originating from the country were also removed for "providing tips for conducting scams".</p>

<p>Gangs run sextortion scams by pretending to be members of the opposite sex and persuading people to provide explicit images of themselves and then threatening to release them to the public unless their victims send them money.</p>

<p>"They targeted primarily adult men in the US and used fake accounts to mask their identities," Meta said in a statement.</p>

<p>It blamed "Yahoo Boys", a Nigerian slang for internet fraudsters, for the scam accounts.</p>

<p>The social media giant explained that while the majority of the attempts by scammers were unsuccessful and mostly focused on adult victims, they have also targeted minors.</p>

<p>A Homeland Security Investigation between October 2021 and March 2023 received 13,000 reports of financial sextortion involving 12,600 minors, mostly boys, in the United States.</p>

<p>The scams triggered at least 20 suicides, according to the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).</p>

<p>"Offenders who engage in financially motivated sextortion are often located outside the United States-primarily in west African countries such as Nigeria and Ivory Coast, or Southeast Asian countries such as the Philippines," FBI said in a statement in January.</p>

<p>To combat the rising spate of the crime, Meta announced in April that it was testing an AI-powered "nudity protection" feature in Instagram direct messages to protect teenagers.</p>

<p>Two men were arrested in Nigeria the same month for trying to extort an Australian teenager by threatening to release "personal photos of the boy" if he did not pay them 500 Australian dollars ($330).</p>

<p>Australian police said the boy had killed himself after being threatened by the suspects in the alleged "sextortion" scam.</p>

<p>Meta said it is also working with law enforcement agencies in the investigation and prosecution of the alleged crimes.</p>

<p>The clampdown on the scam accounts came days after Nigerian authorities fined the Facebook parent company for "multiple and repeated" data violations.</p>

<p>The country's Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) on Friday accused Meta of violating the country's data protection and consumer rights laws on Facebook and WhatsApp.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p><p><div class='table-div suicide'><table class='table'><thead><tr><th colspan='2'>Helplines</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vandrevala Foundation for Mental Health</td><td><a href='tel:+919999666555'>9999666555</a> or <a href='mailto:help@vandrevalafoundation.com'>help@vandrevalafoundation.com</a> </td></tr><tr><td>TISS iCall</td><td><a href='tel:+912225521111'>022-25521111</a> (Monday-Saturday: 8 am to 10 pm)</td></tr> <tr><td colspan='2'>(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian and Chinese bomber jets carried out a joint patrol over far eastern Russia and the Bering Sea near Alaska, Russia's defence ministry said Thursday.</p>

<p>It said "Russian space forces' Tu-95MS strategic missile carriers and the Chinese air force's Xian H-6 strategic bombers carried out an aerial patrol over the Chukchi and Bering Seas and the north Pacific Ocean".</p>

<p>The statement came after the joint US-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) said American and Canadian warplanes had intercepted two Russian and two Chinese bombers in international airspace near Alaska on Wednesday.</p>

<p>It said the bombers "remained in international airspace" and were "not seen as a threat".</p>

<p>Moscow also said the patrol observed international law and did not breach foreign airspace, adding that "at certain stages of the route, the aviation group was accompanied by fighter jets of foreign countries".</p>

<p>The patrol was part of "a plan of military cooperation for 2024 and not directed against third countries," Moscow said.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry posted images of planes taking off and landing as well as footage from the air.</p>

<p>The TU-95MS planes were developed in the Soviet era to carry long-range cruise missiles and are part of Russia's nuclear triad. The Xian H-6 planes are also nuclear-capable.</p>

<p>China and Russia have drawn closer in recent years and hold joint military exercises regularly.</p>

<p>Beijing has strengthened its diplomatic, economic and military ties with Moscow since the start of the Russian offensive in Ukraine in February 2022.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin visited China in May on his first trip abroad after re-election and met Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping again this month at a regional summit in Kazakhstan.</p>

<p>Russia said Sunday that it scrambled fighter jets to prevent two US strategic bomber planes from crossing its border over the Barents Sea in the Arctic.</p>

<p>The US military routinely carries out flights over international waters, operations that it says are conducted in neutral airspace, but Moscow has responded more aggressively in recent months.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Olympic Games, considered the pinnacle of sporting competition, got off to a grand start in Paris today. The Games also honours refugee athletes who have overcome incredible obstacles to pursue their dreams. One such athlete is Yusra Mardini, a Syrian refugee who fled her war-torn country as a teenager and went on to compete in the 2016 and 2020 Olympic Games.</p>

<p>Yusra was 16 years old when she escaped from a civil war in her home in Syria in August 2015.</p>

<p>Accompanied by her sister, the journey was grueling. They traveled by plane from Syria to Lebanon, then to Turkey, before boarding a boat bound for Greece.</p>

<p>The short 10-kilometer journey was supposed to take just 45 minutes, but the vessel, already in disrepair and overcrowded with 20 people, began to falter just 20 minutes in. Yusra, her sister, and two others were forced to abandon the ship and push the boat towards shore, a desperate effort that took over three hours.</p>

<p>"The whole time, you could hear all our prayers in one voice," the ambassador to the Olympic refugee team recounted in an interview.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mayne Pharma has filed a lawsuit against Sun Pharma over infringements of patents related to a certain product used for menopause-related vaginal pain, the Australian drugmaker said on Thursday.</p>

<p>In the lawsuit filed at the United States District Court for New Jersey, Mayne Pharma accused its rival of violating all 20 Orange Book-listed patents linked to IMVEXXY - a vaginal insert aimed at reducing pain during sexual intercourse after menopause.</p>

<p>Orange Book-listed patents are those approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and deemed safe to use.</p>

<p>The Australian drugmaker said it filed the lawsuit after a notification indicated Sun Pharma's submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) to the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of IMVEXXY.</p>

<p>The ANDA is a request filed to the health regulator for approval of an already licensed drug to manufacture the medication in the United States. These application processes do not warrant the applicant to go through a clinical trial.</p>

<p>Sun Pharma did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.</p>

<p>Mayne Pharma's complaint also indicated that Sun Pharma filed a Paragraph IV certification, suggesting the latter challenged the patent's (IMVEXXY) listing in the Orange Book as invalid or inapplicable.</p>

<p>This "formally initiates the litigation process under the Hatch-Waxman Act and triggers a 30-month stay of any potential FDA approval for Sun Pharma's ANDA," Mayne Pharma said in a statement.</p>

<p>IMVEXXY is distributed by TherapeuticsMD and had sealed the FDA's approval in 2018.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One of the greatest electoral races in the world, the election to the office of the President of the United States (POTUS), is about to begin. By the end of the fourth week of August, Democrats will finalise their candidate to take on former President and Republican nominee Donald Trump.</p>

<p>After the disastrous debate last month between Biden and Trump, Democrats are now struggling with the candidature of the incumbent POTUS after he recently announced that he will not seek re-election. His endorsement of Vice-President Kamala Harris has yet to secure final approval from party leaders. Naturally, time is short for the Democrats to mount an effective challenge.</p>

<p>The American political landscape changed drastically after Trump escaped an assassination attempt earlier this month. Though many argue that the election is not a done deal yet, the odds seem to favour the GOP heavily as of now. The party may wrest not only the White House but both Houses of the U.S. Congress, that is, the House of Representatives and the Senate.</p>

<h2><strong>The 'Transition Project'</strong></h2>

<p>Governments and administrations across the globe are trying to estimate what a second Trump administration might bring. Of course, unlike 2016, they now have the benefit of hindsight to draft a calibrated policy to engage with the United States. Here, besides previous experience, policy planners are dipping into a 900-odd page document, the 2025 Presidential Transition Project, in which domain experts have listed department-wise policy prescriptions and drawn a roadmap for the Conservatives to effect fundamental changes in the way the country is governed.</p>

<p>The Project, helmed by Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based think tank that reflects Republican views, is considered a key and expansive input given that Trump in his first administration had drawn heavily from the organisation's expertise. Trump may not have officially granted recognition to the document, but it is being read by policy planners with wide interest.</p>

<h2><strong>How India-US Relations May Evolve</strong></h2>

<p>Bilateral relations between the two democracies are characterised by India as a 'Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership'. One defining feature of that is the fact that New Delhi enjoys bipartisan support in Washington. Successive administrations, whether Democrat or Republican, have continued to engage with India. From deep sea to outer space, the partnership encompasses a wide range of subjects. By extension, members of the U.S. Congress have also shown a greater accommodative spirit over the last three decades.</p>

<p>As for multi-sector engagement, three key areas have been defence cooperation, strategic engagement and trade and investment. Going by his previous administration, these are likely to remain Trump's top priorities if he manages to return as President. He is riding on his 'Make America Great Again' pitch and aims to restore to the US shop floors across industrial units that shifted their jobs to off-shore facilities.</p>

<h2><strong>What's In For Trade Relations</strong></h2>

<p>Statistics for 2022 show that the India-US bilateral trade for merchandise and services stood at $191.43 billion. Of this, while India's exports accounted for $118.53 billion, US exports were around $72.90 billion. India enjoyed a balance of trade of over $100 billion in its favour.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A second Trump administration is expected to exert pressure towards expanding trade and services with all countries, including India. The section on trade in the Project 2025 report, quoting US government figures, states that of the $1,138 billion deficit that the US has with 14 major trading partners, India is in 11th position. Negotiators can expect hard bargaining, with each side insisting on securing the best deal for the country.</p>

<h2><strong>Defence And Strategic Ties</strong></h2>

<p>The ties in this sector continue to flourish, especially since the signing of the Framework for Defence Cooperation in 2005, which was renewed for another decade in 2015. Besides designating India as a 'Major Defence Partner', the pact moved up New Delhi to grant it licence exemption for Strategic Trade Authorisation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last year, both sides also finalised a Defence Industrial Cooperation Roadmap and launched a Defence Acceleration Ecosystem to build a network of universities, incubators, think tanks and private investments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sector will be watched with much interest given that India is working on a plan to build specialised industrial corridors to manufacture defence equipment in the country with technology transfers, something that American companies working with critical technologies are not particularly keen about. However, this contrasts with the decision on Capitol Hill to provide India with incentives to wean it away from Russian military hardware.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, India is part of the Quad and Indo-Pacific groupings, both of which got a boost during the previous Trump administration. While China, Iran and North Korea occupy a central place in the report's analysis, India's reference in the document appears in relation to Pakistan and tensions over Jammu and Kashmir, and suggests a 'Quad Plus' approach.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has been no spike in Covid cases in France as tourists surge in for the Paris Olympic Games, a minister said Thursday, adding that the government would remain "vigilant".</p>

<p>"Covid is still with us at a low level" but "we're not in a period with an explosion or strong return" of the virus, junior health minister Frederic Valletoux told broadcaster Franceinfo.</p>

<p>He added that authorities were not "for now" expecting to introduce mask requirements in venues.</p>

<p>"There's no kind of very strong alert signal at this stage," Valletoux said.</p>

<p>A few of the 10,500 athletes set to participate have tested positive for Covid since arriving.</p>

<p>"We knew there is no such thing as zero risk," Valletoux said.</p>

<p>Among the worst hit are Australia's female water polo team, with the delegation's head Anna Meares confirming five cases, while several Belgian competitors have also tested positive according to Olympic Committee doctors.</p>

<p>Some delegations have toughened up precautions in response.</p>

<p>For instance, France's rowing team insisted on masks at media events ahead of the competition.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video showing a British police officer kick and stamp on a man's head during an arrest at Manchester airport in northern England sparked a protest outside a police station late on Wednesday night.</p>

<p>Police said they had referred the actions to an independent complaints watchdog after the video, filmed by an onlooker, was posted on social media platforms and attracted immediate criticism.</p>

<p>It showed a chaotic scene in an airport car park in which several officers armed with tasers restrained two suspects. One man was kicked and stamped upon as he lay face down on the floor. The second man also appeared to be struck in the head by an officer.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Dozens of teachers and professors have been fighting on the front lines and one-fifth of the sector's facilities have been damaged or destroyed by Russian bombardments]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anton Yushyn spent four years studying Italian at university in Kyiv but the outbreak of war taught him the most valuable lesson of his student life: to prioritise what matters most.</p>

<p>When he enrolled at Kyiv National Linguistic University, Russia had not yet invaded, and his main concerns were socialising and passing exams to placate his parents.</p>

<p>"Maybe it's not my goals that have changed but my values," Yushyn, 22, told AFP on graduation day in Kyiv last month.</p>

<p>"It all used to be about parties and having fun. Now you need to spend more time with family and friends because they could be gone at any moment," he said.</p>

<p>Thousands of Ukrainians graduating from around 300 universities this summer are entering into a society transformed by war -- their futures in doubt with no end in sight to the fighting.</p>

<p>As Ukraine mobilises young men to replenish the army's stretched ranks, male graduates face the prospect of being called up once they turn 25.</p>

<p>Higher education has not been immune from the conflict.</p>

<p>Dozens of teachers and professors have been fighting on the front lines and one-fifth of the sector's facilities have been damaged or destroyed by Russian bombardments.</p>

<p>In December 2022, a missile landed just a few hundred metres from Yushyn's campus.</p>

<h3><strong>To stay, or leave</strong></h3>

<p>But on graduation day, the mood at Yushyn's alma mater was festive. Perfume hung in the hot summer air and staff congratulated joyful students for completing their studies in the face of historic turbulence.</p>

<p>Student life was barely back to normal after the Covid pandemic when Russia invaded in February 2022.</p>

<p>Universities suspended classes and Korean language student Nikoletta Shova was sent by her parents to stay with relatives in Italy.</p>

<p>The 22-year-old compared the "emotional" time abroad to being in a "stupor", left wondering if she would ever be able to return.</p>

<p>Teaching restarted at most universities just a few weeks later -- online or in person -- when Russian forces were still on Kyiv's outskirts.</p>

<p>Shova returned after three months away and was able to finish her degree in person while raising money for the war effort with classmates.</p>

<p>Now, with her diploma in hand, uncertainty had returned.</p>

<p>She was considering studying abroad -- possibly marketing in the United States -- but she was also open to finding a creative job at home.</p>

<p>Building a future in Ukraine despite the war was possible, she said, borrowing a popular phrase to underscore that it would take perseverance: "he who doesn't take risks never drinks champagne".</p>

<h3><strong>Jokes, memes</strong></h3>

<p>"So I'm being realistic but with a bit of positivity," she said of her future.</p>

<p>Daryna Dekhtiar, 22, also a graduate of Kyiv National Linguistic University, went numb when Russia invaded.</p>

<p>"I didn't cry at all. I just went into autopilot," she said, but her friends had helped lift her spirits too, she added.</p>

<p>"We created our own memes, our jokes, it made it all much easier," she recalled.</p>

<p>Dana Andriichuk, who already had secured an office job by graduation, was rushing to meet friends after the ceremony.</p>

<p>She didn't want to dwell on the relative comfort of her student years or spend too much thinking about the prospect of a long war.</p>

<p>"I'm trying to avoid being a pessimist stuck in the past. I want to live now and not in the future, because we don't know what will happen next," she said.</p>

<p>"If the government encourages young people to stay and do everything possible to build a better future even in a state of war -- and society becomes nationally conscious -- then we can consider staying in the country," she said.</p>

<h3><strong>- 'Don't run and hide' -</strong></h3>

<p>Like thousands of other male graduates, Yushyn does not have as much freedom to choose. Authorities have barred men aged between 18 and 60 from leaving Ukraine.</p>

<p>Thousands have left illegally and dozens have died trying.</p>

<p>But Yushyn was resigned to life at home.</p>

<p>"Real men don't run and hide. If the time comes and I get a summons, I won't run from it," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"I can wind myself up, cry, sit here trembling all I want, it won't change the trajectory of the rocket," he said.</p>

<p>Whatever the future holds, he said he was unlikely to use Italian, but was resolved to spending his time as best he could.</p>

<p>"I need to use it to the fullest."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Malaysia's digital minister, Gobind Singh Deo, has asked Microsoft and CrowdStrike to consider compensating companies that suffered losses during last week's global tech outage, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/malaysia-asks-microsoft-crowdstrike-consider-covering-losses-global-outage-2024-07-24/ ">Reuters</a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The outage, caused by a faulty CrowdStrike software update, affected computers powered by Microsoft's Windows operating system, disrupting internet services worldwide. In Malaysia, five government agencies and nine companies in aviation, banking and healthcare were affected.</p>

<p>Minister Deo, who met with representatives from Microsoft and cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, has requested a detailed report on the incident and urged the companies to take preventive measures to avoid future outages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He announced that he has also requested the companies to consider compensation claims from parties who have suffered damages or losses due to the recent global tech outage. However, the full extent of the losses has yet to be determined.</p>

<p>Tony Fernandes, CEO of Malaysia's Capital A, which operates budget airline AirAsia, also called for compensation, stating companies deserved reimbursement for losses incurred due to the tech failure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The global outage affected airports, pharmacies, banks, payment systems and train services, causing significant inconvenience to many. Even a terminal cancer patient's <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/terminal-cancer-patients-brain-surgery-delayed-by-microsoft-outage-6169686 ">brain surgery was delayed</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft and CrowdStrike collaborated to resolve the issue, releasing a recovery tool and providing guidance for affected customers. The recovery tool offered two options - "Recover from WinPE" and "Recover from safe mode", to help customers restore their systems.</p>

<p>Airports have advised passengers to continue checking for potential disruptions before travelling. Although systems are now back online, some journeys may still be impacted by delays and cancellations. Major airlines, including Ryanair, British Airways and EasyJet, were affected, with some flights cancelled due to software issues.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Australian judge on Thursday dismissed a class action lawsuit claiming Bayer's Roundup weedkiller can cause a type of blood cancer, a boost for the company which is grappling with a slew of similar cases in the United States.</p>

<p>Justice Michael Lee of Australia's Federal Court ruled that on the balance of probabilities, there was insufficient evidence to conclude that Roundup can cause non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL).</p>

<p>"It is not proven in this proceeding on a balance of probabilities... that throughout the relevant period use of, and or exposure to Roundup products increased an individual's risk of developing NHL," Lee said.</p>

<p>The German pharmaceutical and chemicals company has maintained that Roundup, a glyphosate-based herbicide, is safe. It says it "fully stands behind its glyphosate-based products, which have been used around the world for almost 50 years."</p>

<p>The Australian class action against Bayer subsidiaries united more than 1,000 claimants and is one of some 40 cases filed outside the United States, all in either Canada or Australia.</p>

<p>Lead claimant, 41-year-old Kelvin McNickle, said he used Roundup to spray weeds for over two decades on his family's property and while working for a vegetation management company. He developed non-Hodgkins lymphoma at age 35.</p>

<p>In the United States, Bayer has prevailed in 14 of the last 20 Roundup trials, but it also racked up a string of losses in late 2023 and early 2024, resulting in more than $4 billion in damages awarded in verdicts.</p>

<p>Some of those verdicts have seen the amounts awarded reduced but the string of wins for plaintiffs shattered investor and company hopes that the worst of the Roundup litigation was over.</p>

<p>The company still faces more than 50,000 outstanding claims in the United States. A request for an agreement to prevent future cases was denied by a U.S. court.</p>

<p>Roundup was originally produced by U.S. agrochemical company Monsanto, which Bayer acquired for $63 billion in 2018.</p>

<p>The company has replaced glyphosate with new active ingredients in its products for household use in the United States to reduce the risk of litigation as most claims have come from home users.</p>

<p>It continues to sell glyphosate-based weedkillers to farmers, who rely on it heavily.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Disturbing videos showing a British police officer kicking and stomping on a man's head at Manchester Airport on Tuesday night have sparked outrage on social media. In one of the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/doamuslims/status/1816111762057368046">clips</a>, the uniformed male officer is seen holding a Taser over the man, who is lying face down, before striking him twice while other officers shout at onlookers to stay back. The officer is also seen stomping his boots on the back of the man's head and slamming his knee into his back before sitting on top of him. Later in the same video, another man, whose hands were in the air while sitting nearby, is also taken to the ground after a police officer points a taser at him. Both men appeared to be handcuffed and taken into custody.</p>

<p>The second&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/doamuslims/status/1816206815404888228">video </a>shows another man being confronted, pepper-sprayed in the face and brought to the ground by a police officer who wrapped his arm around the man's neck as he wrestled him down. The clips appear to show the attacks taking place on the ground level of the airport outside of several elevators.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a statement on X (formerly Twitter), Greater Manchester Police (GMP) confirmed the incident, which took place in the airport's Terminal 2 on Tuesday. The cops said that footage on social media showed a confrontation that began after three officers were injured in a "violent assault", including one female officer who suffered a broken nose. However, they also added that the event seen in the videos was "truly shocking" and an "unusual occurrence". A male officer has been "removed from operational duties," the police said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We know that a film of an incident at Manchester Airport that is circulating widely shows an event that is truly shocking, and that people are rightly extremely concerned about," said Assistant Chief Constable Chaudhry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The use of such force in an arrest is an unusual occurrence and one that we understand creates alarm. One male officer has been removed from operational duties and we are making a voluntary referral of our policing response to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC)," Mr Chaudhry added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The IOPC said it would assess GMP's referral "and decide what further action is required".</p>

<p>In its post, the Greater Manchester Police also outlined what it said were the events that led up to the videos. Cops said that they were called to Terminal 2 of the airport on Tuesday evening following reports of an assault. When they confronted the male suspect, three officers were injured in a "violent assault, where they were punched to the ground," with one female officer ending up with a broken nose, the force said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Four men have been arrested for assaulting an emergency worker, the statement added.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on social media, the incident has sparked an outcry over whether violence used by police was proportionate or justified. According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7259wpl1x9o"><em>BBC</em></a>, protesters gathered outside the force's divisional headquarters in the town of Rochdale on Wednesday. Many British politicians also condemned the incident and called the videos "disturbing".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, called the videos "disturbing" in a post on X. UK Home Office Minister Diana Johnson said on X that she was "aware of the disturbing footage" and "understand(s) the public concern it has prompted. I have asked for a full update from Greater Manchester Police."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Heavy rain from Typhoon Gaemi has flooded the Philippine capital Manila and nearby cities, forcing authorities to shut schools, and offices and cancel flights on Wednesday and declare a state of calamity in a region that is home to 13 million people.</p>

<p>The storm, which is strengthening as it gusts towards Taiwan, did not make landfall in the Philippines but has intensified seasonal monsoon rains, causing landslides and flooding over the past few days.</p>

<p>At least 12 people have died and more than 600,000 are displaced due to the storm, known locally as Typhoon Carina, the national disaster agency said. Water in some areas is neck-high.</p>

<p>The Philippine Coastguard said 260 passengers and 16 vessels were stranded in ports while airlines cancelled 114 flights out of Manila on Wednesday, the airport authority said.</p>

<p>The financial markets were also closed.</p>

<p>President Ferdinand Marcos Jr told the disaster relief agencies to provide assistance and prepare supplies for isolated communities during a briefing on Wednesday, and the mayors of 16 cities in the Greater Manila region have asked for emergency funding, officials said.</p>

<p>In the riverside city of Marikina, emergency workers waded through waist-deep waters and used rubber dinghies to rescue residents from their inundated homes.</p>

<p>Some people were sheltered in churches, among the statues of Catholic saints.</p>

<p>"The flood reached the second floor of our house, all our things are ruined, everything got wet, nothing was saved," Ladylyn Bernas, an evacuee at a nearby church, told Reuters.</p>

<p>Social media posts showed several vehicles stuck in water or floating down streets and highways.</p>

<p>The Philippines sees an average of 20 tropical storms annually, causing floods and deadly landslides.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French authorities have launched a major operation to clean up computers infected by a cyber-espionage programme that has struck millions of users worldwide, a senior prosecutor said Thursday.</p>

<p>"On the eve of the Olympics, this operation demonstrates that different players in France and abroad are mobilised to fight against all forms of cybercrime," Paris chief prosecutor Laure Beccuau said in a statement.</p>

<p>She said investigators were targeting a network of bots suspected of infecting computers with PlugX malware and of stealing data from them "notably for purposes of espionage".</p>

<p>She said analysts and investigators had managed to take control of a server that was controlling millions of the infected computers and were administering a fix.</p>

<p>They launched the operation on July 18 and it is expected to last several months, having already aided victims in several European countries, the statement said.</p>

<p>It did not cite a specific threat to the Paris Olympics. But separately, the French government's cyber security agency warned last week that ransomware attacks will be "inevitable" during the Games, which officially open Friday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Frankfurt airport, Germany's busiest, has resumed operations after suspending flights on Thursday morning when several climate activists blocked runways by gluing themselves to the tarmac.</p>

<p>Planes were able to take off and land again, the airport said on its website, but passengers were still advised to check on their flight status before setting off for the airport.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Frankfurt, a vital international transit hub and one of Europe's biggest airports, said around 140 flights had been cancelled out of 1,400 planned on Thursday.</p>

<p>Last Generation climate activists said in a statement that six protesters had cut through a fence and had reached various points around the Frankfurt airport runways with posters reading "Oil kills". Images released by the group showed protesters in orange safety vests with their hands glued to the tarmac.</p>

<p>A federal police spokesperson said several climate activists were on the airport grounds.</p>

<p>The group, which wants the German government to pursue a global agreement to exit oil, gas, and coal by 2030, has listed several countries across Europe and North America where similar disruptions are planned as part of a protest campaign that began on Wednesday.</p>

<p>In Norway, around a dozen activists blocked a part of the check-in area of the Oslo Airport, in a second day of actions, but there was no disruption of flights to and from the Norwegian capital, an airport official said.</p>

<p>Germany's Cologne-Bonn airport, the country's sixth-largest, suspended flights for several hours on Wednesday after climate activists glued themselves to a runway, while similar actions at other European airports had been foiled by authorities.</p>

<p>German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, whose ministry wants to punish unauthorized airfield access with up to two years in jail, called the action "dangerous, dumb and criminal."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The group has raised nearly $400,000 from anti-Trump groups and encourages former Haley supporters to vote for Harris.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of anti-Donald Trump voters,&nbsp;that previously backed Nikki Haley in the Republican primary, has now thrown its support behind the Democrat's likely US presidential nominee Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>The political action committee (PAC) in question, known as PIVOTPAC, rebranded from 'Haley Voters for Biden' to 'Haley Voters for Harris' after President Joe Biden quit the presidential race.</p>

<p>The PAC encourages Haley supporters to now support Kamala Harris for the race to the White House.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We stress that we proudly supported <a href="https://twitter.com/NikkiHaley?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NikkiHaley</a> over Trump. We have no regrets. We wish her well.<br />
<br />
It was always about what was best for our country.<br />
<br />
While we respect her personal decision to support the Republican nominee, we believe <a href="https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@KamalaHarris</a> is better for the country.</p>
— Haley Voters for Harris (@HaleyVte4Harris) <a href="https://twitter.com/HaleyVte4Harris/status/1816150751112278108?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>This comes after Nikki Haley sent a cease and desist letter demanding the group stop using her name to support Harris. "Kamala Harris and I are total opposites on every issue. Any attempt to use my name to support her or her agenda is deceptive and wrong," Haley stated firmly.</p>

<p>Haley, a former Republican primary challenger, served as the US Ambassador to the United Nations in Donald Trump's first tenure as American President. She has now endorsed Trump for president and her lawyers argue the group's use of her name implies she supports Harris, which is false.</p>

<p>"I support Donald Trump because he understands we need to make America strong, safe and prosperous," Haley said, as per KTSM.</p>

<p>The 'Haley Voters for Harris' group, with nearly 7,000 followers, responded, "We will not be suppressed". The PAC has raised nearly $400,000 from anti-Trump groups and claims they don't speak on behalf of Haley and will continue to support Harris, calling her the "clear better choice" for the country.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We enthusiastically supported <a href="https://twitter.com/NikkiHaley?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NikkiHaley</a> over former President Trump in the primaries.<br />

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The Harris campaign has welcomed the group's support, with a spokesperson saying, "We're glad to have the support of voters who share our vision for a better America."</p>

<p>The director of Haley Voters for Harris, Craig Snyder, defended the group's name in an NPR interview, calling it a "factual statement" of how many people feel and plan to vote in November.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Harris campaign's National Republican Engagement Director, Austin Weatherford, welcomed "millions of Republicans" who rejected Trump's extremism, saying they "have a home in the Harris campaign's coalition".</p>

<p>Mr Weatherford said the campaign was focused on earning support from these voters, who prioritise democracy and national security.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-election-2020-when-kamala-harris-called-president-elect-joe-biden-after-historic-win-says-we-did-it-joe-watch-2322207">"We did it, Joe,"</a> exclaimed the 49th Vice-President of the United States four years ago-the phrase becoming a war cry of sorts, coming from a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/kamala-harris-and-her-india-connection-818442">half-Black, half-Indian woman</a>, married to a Jewish-American man. This moment became a landmark in the sociopolitical history of the US. For all its celebratory moments, American democracy has a long way to go in terms of representation and inclusivity. When it comes to women, the gender schemas work as effectively in the oldest democracy of the world as it does in the emergent ones to keep women away from the high table.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Can <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/kamala-harris-to-rishi-sunak-indians-must-be-realistic-about-the-rise-of-indian-origin-leaders-6117384">Kamala Harris</a> be successful in the Holy Grail pursuit of occupying the Oval Office? The odds are stacked against her, starting from the delayed announcement of her candidature. With less than a month to go for the Democratic convention to secure her name on the ticket, Harris has a mountain to climb. The funding numbers are encouraging but the money can go only thus far in attitudinal and ideological battles.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Women And Politics</strong></h2>

<p>To begin with, there is a problem with the recall. Studies (J Hitchon &amp; C Chang, 1995) have revealed that voters recall women candidates in terms of their family and appearance and their men counterparts in terms of campaign activities. Harris understands that and has made this tendency work for her by highlighting her family background. However, in a deeply polarised American society which is in the throes of backlash against diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), this strategy may not work as desired any longer.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/indians-abroad/kamala-harris-says-number-of-indian-americans-in-elected-offices-not-reflective-of-their-population-5673477">Also Read |&nbsp;Indian Americans In Offices Not Reflective Of Their Population: Kamala Harris</a></strong></p>

<p>American women have been consistently voting at a higher rate than men for more than four decades now. They are certainly not less political than men. Yet, even they are not sending enough women to political offices. Women candidates continue to get penalised for expressing emotions, particularly anger. Harris has been trying to keep her 'anger' in check, often descending into banalities in her public speeches. She has become a constant fodder for the meme factory. Whether this is a carefully crafted strategy, only time will tell. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>"Too Coloured", "Not Coloured Enough"</strong></h2>

<p>Harris was only the second Black woman elected to the US Senate in the history of the country. This tells the world something that the Americans cannot be proud of. "The most disrespected person in America is the Black woman. The most unprotected person in America is the Black woman. The most neglected person in America is the Black woman," said Malcolm X in 1962. Per some critical indices like education, healthcare, wages et al, the observation holds even today. Harris has come a long way jumping over fiery hoops of racial and gender discrimination. Her win in the presidential polls will be a bigger moment than Barack Obama's presidency in terms of America's race issue. A decade after the 'Black Lives Matter' movement first made its appearance on social media, American society continues to struggle to find the golden equilibrium. The anti-DEI rabble-rousers have now found effective means to punish individuals and institutions that do not toe supremacist lines.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/us-presidential-election-she-s-experienced-tough-capable-joe-biden-praises-kamala-harris-818474">Watch |&nbsp;"She's Experienced, Tough, Capable": Joe Biden Praises Kamala Harris</a></strong></p>

<p>But Harris is not just Black, she's also half-Indian and the country celebrated her <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pride-of-our-village-kamala-harris-ancestral-village-in-tamil-nadu-celebrates-her-victory-2322250">from New Delhi to Chennai</a> as its prodigal daughter. With a steadily growing population in the US over the years, Indians have emerged as a group with political aspirations. Indian community's cultural, regional and religious associations have played an important role in increasing the political heft of Indian Americans. The flip side of this is the growing resentment among the fraudulently so-called originals-the Whites-against powerful immigrant communities. Ironically, even Black Americans harbour some resentment against immigrant communities that have reached the upper rungs of the socio-economic ladder. While this is sociologically 'natural', people like Harris are peculiarly affected. She's coloured but not adequately so for some.</p>

<h2><strong>A Course-Correction Too Late</strong></h2>

<p>2024 is no 2018, when a surge for Democrats in general and women candidates in particular, sent Democratic women politicians of different ethnicities like Debra Haaland and Sharice Davids (Native American); Ayanna Pressley and Jahana Hayes (Women of Colour); Veronica Escobar, Sylvia R. Garcia, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Latinas) to the Congress. The Republican campaign is bolstered by many a foreign policy faux pas of the Biden administration, the most important one being its role in the Israel-Palestine conflict. Even the captive Democratic voter is expressing dissent. The assassination attempt on Donald Trump has catapulted his already strong chances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Choosing Harris over Biden is a tactical course-correction for Democrats, but it may have come a bit too late in the day. Her strengths may not get optimised, her weaknesses are for all to see. As her V-P tenure goes, she has all the blame to carry but no benefits to reap.</p>

<p>Harris has the unenviable position of being the woman who cleans up after a man. If she emerges triumphant, it will be her personal victory, not that of the party.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia on Thursday followed Europe and the United States by levying sanctions on Israeli settlers accused of "beatings, sexual assault and torture" of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Penny Wong announced financial sanctions and travel bans on seven individuals and the Hilltop Youth religious settler group.</p>

<p>"The individuals sanctioned today have been involved in violent attacks on Palestinians," Wong said.</p>

<p>"This includes beatings, sexual assault and torture of Palestinians resulting in serious injury and in some cases, death."</p>

<p>Settlement expansion has increased sharply since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned to power in late 2022 at the helm of a hardline pro-settler coalition.</p>

<p>The West Bank -- occupied by Israel since 1967 -- has seen a significant spike in violence since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.</p>

<p>At least 589 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank by Israeli troops or settlers since the outbreak of the war on October 7, according to Palestinian authorities.</p>

<p>Over the same period at least 17 Israelis, including soldiers, have been killed in attacks in the territory involving Palestinians, according to Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Canberra's announcement echoes moves by the US, Britain, Canada and the European Union who have also blacklisted Israeli settlers.</p>

<p>"Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories are illegal under international law and a significant obstacle to peace," Wong added.</p>

<p>The International Court of Justice found Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories illegal on Friday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli forces retrieved the bodies of five people taken hostage in the Gaza Strip during Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, the military said Thursday.</p>

<p>The army said the bodies of hostage Maya Goren as well as soldiers Ravid Aryeh Katz, Oren Goldin, Tomer Ahimas and Kiril Brodski had been returned to Israel.</p>

<p>The bodies were recovered on Wednesday during an operation in Khan Yunis, the main city in the south of the Gaza Strip, the military said.</p>

<p>The four soldiers were killed during the October 7 attack launched by Hamas militants, it added.</p>

<p>In December, the military had announced the death of Goren, who was abducted and taken to Gaza on October 7.</p>

<p>Thursday's announcement comes after two Israeli kibbutzim, Nir Oz and Nir Yitzhak, said in separate statements that the army had recovered the bodies of Goren and Goldin.</p>

<p>"Last night, we were informed that in a military rescue operation, the body of the late Maya Goren was recovered," kibbutz Nir Oz said, adding that her family had been informed and more information would follow.</p>

<p>Later in a separate statement kibbutz Nir Yitzhak said the army had returned the body of Goldin.</p>

<p>"This evening, we were informed about the rescue operation for the late Oren Goldin, a member of the kibbutz emergency team, who fell on October 7" during the attack by Hamas militants, Nir Yitzhak said.</p>

<p>On October 7 Hamas militants attacked southern Israeli communities, which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Militants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom remain in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,145 people, also mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

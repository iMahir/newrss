       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With candles, prayers and music, commemorations for the October 7 attack began in Israel's Tel Aviv on Sunday at a ceremony to mark the first anniversary of the Hamas onslaught at the Nova music festival.</p>

<p>Picture of those killed appeared on a screen at the entrance to the ceremony, as hundreds gathered to light candles at a makeshift shrine, leave handwritten notes or simply embrace each other.</p>

<p>"Coming to this event one year after this terrible massacre that happened on October 7, it's very touching, it's very breathtaking," said one of the event's organisers Solly Laniado.</p>

<p>"Three days ago, we were not even going to hold the event at all," he said, citing the deluge of rocket warnings and last week's missile attack on Tel Aviv that have left many people on edge and large parts of the usually vibrant city empty.</p>

<p>The anniversary comes with Israel engaged in a fresh war in Lebanon against Hezbollah and preparing to retaliate against Tehran, raising fears of an even wider conflict.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anticipation is building over how and when Israel will respond to Iran's missile barrage last week, with the uncertainty casting a shadow over the commemoration.</p>

<p>"It's a difficult day," said Omri Sasi, 35, one of the producers of last year's festival who survived the attack.</p>

<p>By his own estimate, he lost roughly 50 friends that day, including an uncle, a pregnant cousin and her husband.</p>

<h3><strong>Onslaught of violence&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The two-day festival in the fields around Kibbutz Reim was just beyond the Gaza border in southern Israel and attracted over 3,000 attendees from October 6 and 7.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At least 370 people were killed at the Nova rave in the Negev desert, making it the deadliest location during the October 7 attack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Footage from the day filmed by Hamas showed the militants gunning down festival-goers en masse as they attempted to flee and taking others hostages, with the heavily armed Hamas fighters moving through the area unopposed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the attack, the festival location was left largely untouched with dozens of burnt-out vehicles and abandoned tents, sleeping bags and clothes strewn across the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The festival attack was part of an onslaught of violence unleashed by Palestinian Hamas militants that resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on the latest official Israeli figures. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Some 251 people were captured and taken as hostages to the Gaza Strip, of whom 97 are still held captive in the coastal territory, including 37 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>During a one-week truce in late November, 105 hostages were released in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hours after the October 7 attack, Israel launched a blistering military offensive on Gaza that has reduced large swaths of the territory to rubble and displaced nearly all of its 2.4 million residents at least once amid an unrelenting humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p>In Gaza, at least 41,870 people have been killed since the start of the Israel offensive, a majority of them civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>The figures have been deemed to be reliable by the United Nations.</p>

<p>But as the anniversary arrives, for many it's just the latest marker in a year tarnished by trauma, loss and ongoing war.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's not easy to think a lot about it," said Sasi.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been a year since the war between Israel and Hamas erupted, a conflict that has brought unspeakable devastation to the Gaza Strip. The days since October 7 have stretched into months of relentless bombings, displacement, and desperation. For the people living in Gaza, the conflict has stripped them of their homes, their loved ones, and their sense of normalcy. It is not just buildings that have crumbled, but entire lives - careers, dreams, families - torn apart by the ravages of war.</p>

<p>The numbers tell only part of the story. Behind each statistic is a personal tragedy. Homes are now rubble, hospitals are overwhelmed, and the world seems to look on helplessly, watching as the conflict deepens. The war has displaced hundreds of thousands, turning vibrant communities into mere shadows of their former selves. For the survivors, daily life is a continuous struggle, and yet within that struggle, there are those who push forward.</p>

<p>One such individual is Dr Khaled Alshawwa, a 31-year-old surgeon from Gaza City. Khaled, like many in his community, never planned to be on the frontlines of a humanitarian crisis. Just a week before the war, he had completed his surgical training at Almakassed Hospital in Jerusalem, a prestigious medical institution. He had returned to Gaza for what was meant to be a brief family visit-just a few days to reconnect with loved ones before continuing his career.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/41i3rc68_gaza-doctor-_625x300_06_October_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>But then the war began, and everything changed. In an instant, Khaled found himself in the midst of one of the most brutal conflicts Gaza has seen, unable to leave, compelled to stay and help.</p>

<p>"The immediate aftermath was chaos," Khaled recalls. "We faced an overwhelming influx of severely injured patients with limited medical supplies and infrastructure. This was much aggregated and intensified after the destruction of many hospitals. As a doctor, I have to prioritise cases, often making difficult decisions with minimal resources."</p>

<p>Khaled, a surgeon trained for the most complex procedures, was forced to make rapid, agonising decisions with almost no support.</p>

<p>"Life has drastically changed. I am constantly navigating between being a surgeon, managing medical points, struggling to provide basic daily needs to me and my family like fresh water, food and a place to stay in amidst severe shortages of resources and ongoing bombings," Khaled said.</p>

<p>The injuries that filled the hospitals were devastating: shrapnel wounds, blast injuries, complex fractures, severe burns, and traumatic amputations. "Many of the injuries involve multiple body parts," he explains, requiring teams of surgeons working in tandem. But with a healthcare system on the brink of collapse, they don't have the luxury of specialisation. "We are stretched beyond belief. A surgeon might have to handle trauma, pediatric surgery, even urology, and vascular procedures, all at once. It is exhausting, physically and mentally."</p>

<p>The situation was made worse by the fact that medical supplies are running low. Basic necessities - anaesthetics, sutures, bandages, antibiotics - are in short supply. "We have to improvise," he says. "In some cases, we had no choice but to turn to telemedicine, relying on colleagues abroad for guidance."</p>

<p>The chaos of the war meant that Khaled's life is in constant motion. "I have moved seven times since the war began," he says, each relocation a desperate attempt to keep his family safe. His base of operations has also shifted as the conflict ebbs and flows. "I have volunteered at almost every hospital in Gaza City," he explains, as the nature of the war has required him to be flexible. "Wherever I go, I try to offer what little help I can."</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/5kkd5dto_gaza-doctor-_625x300_06_October_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>For Khaled, each new base brings with it a fresh set of challenges. He describes the scenes with stark clarity - overcrowded refugee camps, where families huddle together in makeshift shelters, trying to stay alive amidst airstrikes from Israel. "Infection control is nearly impossible in these conditions," he says, pointing to the lack of sanitation and clean water. Overcrowding in the camps has led to the rapid spread of disease. "We are seeing infections in open wounds, as well as dermatological diseases in previously healthy people."</p>

<p>These camps, Khaled notes, are where the most vulnerable-women and children-are suffering the most. "Maternity and pediatric care are severely impacted," he says. "Many women are giving birth in unsafe environments, and children are missing out on basic healthcare." Immunisation programs, vital to protecting children from preventable diseases, have also been disrupted. Khaled himself was involved in a recent polio vaccination campaign organised by the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Despite the overwhelming challenges, including maintaining cold chains for vaccines in areas with no electricity, the team managed to vaccinate over 120,000 children under the age of ten in North Gaza.</p>

<p>But it is not enough.</p>

<p>The strain on Gaza's healthcare system is unprecedented, and the long-term impact of the war on public health is staggering. "The magnitude of disability we are witnessing is terrifying," Khaled says. The rise in amputations, spinal injuries, and traumatic brain damage will have consequences that last for decades. "These are injuries that will require years, if not a lifetime, of care," he warns. "The healthcare system simply isn't equipped to deal with this."</p>

<p>Like many in Gaza, Khaled's personal losses are intertwined with the collective grief of his people. "I lost my mother in a bombing," he revealed. In addition to his mother, he has lost his home and many close friends. But despite this immense personal loss, Khaled has remained resolute. "It's tough," he admits. "Psychologically, it's very hard. The constant pressure, the loss, the fear for your family - it takes a toll."</p>

<p>And yet, like so many others in Gaza, Khaled continues to move forward. "Staying focused on helping others is what keeps me going," he says, though there are moments when the weight of it all feels unbearable. "Every day is a struggle," he admits. "But I can't give up, not when there are so many people depending on us."</p>

<p>The war in Gaza is not happening in isolation. The Israeli-Hamas conflict has drawn in international players, with each new development bringing the risk of a broader regional conflict. In Lebanon, Israeli airstrikes have intensified, killing hundreds. Hezbollah, a militant group backed by Iran, has escalated its exchanges with Israel, meaning that the war has extended far beyond Gaza's borders.</p>

<p>In Europe, the conflict has sparked a political backlash. Countries like Spain and Ireland have recognised the State of Palestine in defiance of Israeli opposition. The United States on the other hand continues to provide Israel with military and financial support, most recently approving an $8.7 billion aid package. For Palestinians like Khaled, international aid is critical to the survival of Gaza's healthcare system, yet the future of that support remains uncertain.</p>

<p>The United Nations estimates that nearly 80,000 homes have been destroyed, and it could take decades to rebuild the city. Khaled agrees. "It will take years, maybe even decades, to get Gaza's health infrastructure back on track," Khaled says. "Without substantial international aid, the recovery will be slow, and people will continue to suffer."</p>

<p>But the road to recovery is long, and the scars of this war will linger for generations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The incident occurred on flight QF59, causing discomfort among travellers, particularly families with children.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Passengers on a Qantas flight from Sydney, Australia, to Haneda, Japan, were shocked when an explicit movie was accidentally played on all in-flight screens due to a technical glitch, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/incidents/passenger-claims-qantas-played-an-xrated-film-to-entire-flight/news-story/21a8c95380e77adf90b5ab7fcea6776f" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>news.com.au </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The incident occurred on flight QF59, causing discomfort among travellers, particularly families with children, as the film "Daddio" (2023) was shown without an option to turn it off.</p>

<p>The R-rated movie, starring Dakota Johnson and Sean Penn, includes explicit sexual content and scenes of graphic nudity.</p>

<p>"It was impossible to pause, dim, or turn it off. The worst part was that the movie was extremely inappropriate," one passenger wrote on Reddit, noting that it took nearly an hour to replace the film with a more family-friendly option.</p>

<p>"It was super uncomfortable for everyone, especially with families and kids on board"</p>

<p>Qantas acknowledged the incident, stating that a technical malfunction in the in-flight entertainment system prevented passengers from selecting individual films.</p>

<p>According to the<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/06/world-news/qantas-flight-from-australia-to-japan-airs-r-rated-movie-daddio-to-entire-flight/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em> New York Post</em></a>, the airline explained that crew members attempted to resolve the issue by asking passengers for their movie preferences, which led to the entire cabin being shown "Daddio."</p>

<p>When it became apparent that the film was not appropriate for all viewers, crew members tried to help passengers avoid the movie by fixing their screens. However, when this proved impossible, they switched the film to a more family-friendly option, as reported by the *New York Post*.</p>

<p>In a statement to news.com.au, a Qantas spokesperson apologized for the incident, noting that the standard procedure is to play family-friendly films when individual selection is unavailable.</p>

<p>"The movie was clearly not suitable to play for the whole flight, and we sincerely apologize to customers for this experience," the spokesperson said, adding that they are investigating how the film was chosen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's Quds Force commander Esmail Qaani has not been heard from since Israeli strikes on Beirut late last week, two senior Iranian security officials told Reuters.</p>

<p>Qaani travelled to Lebanon after the killing last month of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike.</p>

<h3><strong>Here are some facts about Qaani:</strong></h3>

<p>-Tehran named Qaani the head of the Revolutionary Guards Corps' overseas military intelligence service after the United States assassinated his predecessor Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad in 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Part of Qaani's task in that post has been to manage Tehran's paramilitary allies across the Middle East, as well as in other regions around the world.</p>

<p>- According to people familiar with both Qaani and Soleimani, as well as Western military and political analysts, Qaani has never commanded the same respect as his predecessor Soleimani or maintained the same close relationships among Iran's allies in the Arab world.</p>

<p>- While Soleimani held the reins of the Quds Force during a time when Iran's proxies - from Lebanese Hezbollah to Iraqi Shi'ite Muslim militias to the Houthis of Yemen - grew their power in the Middle East, Qaani has presided over their battering at the hands of Israeli spies and warplanes.</p>

<p>- Qaani became deputy commander of the Quds Force, the overseas arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, in 1997 when Soleimani became the Force's chief commander.</p>

<p>- When Qaani took over he vowed to boot US forces out of the Middle East in revenge for Soleimani's killing. "We promise to continue martyr Soleimani's path with the same force ... and the only compensation for us would be to remove America from the region," state radio quoted Qaani as saying ahead of Soleimani's funeral in Tehran.</p>

<p>- Qaani, 67, was born in Mashhad, a conservative Shi'ite Muslim religious city in northeastern Iran. He fought for the Revolutionary Guards during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s.</p>

<p>- Qaani has also had experience of overseas operations beyond Iran's eastern borders, including Afghanistan and Pakistan. He does not speak Arabic, unlike Soleimani who spoke fluently with Iraqi militias and Hezbollah commanders.</p>

<p>- He has adopted less of a public persona than Soleimani and little information is available on him online or in leaked diplomatic cables.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Unlike Soleimani, who over the years was widely photographed on battlefields in Iraq and Syria alongside the militias Tehran has armed and trained, Qaani has preferred to keep a lower profile and conduct most of his meetings and visits to neighbouring countries in private.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A massive blast on a road near the airport of Pakistan's largest city killed two Chinese nationals, Beijing's embassy said Monday, after a separatist militant group claimed an attack in the area.</p>

<p>An AFP journalist heard the explosion in Pakistan's southern megacity of Karachi around 11:00 pm (1800 GMT) Sunday.</p>

<p>The regional government of southern Sindh province said on X that a "tanker" had exploded on the airport motorway.</p>

<p>The separatist militant group the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) said in a statement that it had "targeted a high-level convoy of Chinese engineers and investors" coming from Karachi's airport.</p>

<p>Beijing's embassy to Pakistan said in a statement on Monday that two Chinese citizens had been killed in a "terror attack" on a convoy of personnel from the Chinese-funded Port Qasim power project.</p>

<p>The attack also left one Chinese and several Pakistani citizens wounded, the embassy said.</p>

<p>The embassy urged authorities to "conduct a thorough investigation of the attack and severely punish the killers, while at the same time taking practical measures to fully ensure the safety of Chinese citizens, institutions and projects".</p>

<p>The BLA is a separatist militant group advocating for the autonomy of Pakistan's Balochistan province, the largest but poorest region of the country.</p>

<p>The group has regularly targeted Chinese nationals, claiming ethnic Baloch locals are not receiving their fair share of wealth extracted by foreign investors.</p>

<p>Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority said flights from Karachi were continuing "as usual" and "agencies are investigating the cause at the scene of the accident/explosion".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Recently, the officer was assigned to the Fugitive Unit of the Atlanta Police Department (APD). He joined the department in November 2015.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An off-duty police officer in Georgia, USA, who was previously honoured as "Investigator of the Year," was shot and killed while allegedly attempting to enter a neighbour's home, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/06/us-news/atlanta-police-officer-aubree-horton-shot-killed-while-breaking-into-neighbors-home/" rel="NoFollowNoIndex">New York Post reported</a>. Aubree Horton reportedly entered Winston's residence through the front door, where he confronted the homeowner. The police had been called to the scene regarding a suspected burglary in the St Andrews Country Club neighbourhood at around 5am.&nbsp;Authorities suspect that Horton was either undergoing a mental health crisis or was under the influence of drugs.</p>

<p>"When he entered the home, the homeowner acted in self-defence and shot him," said Captain John Mauney, as reported by Fox 5 Atlanta.</p>

<p>The officer was reported to be living only half a mile from where the incident took place, leaving residents in shock.</p>

<p>"I've been living here for five years, and this is something you'd never expect to happen," said resident Milton Johnston. Another neighbour commented, "It's a quiet golfing community. You just don't think something like this would ever happen here."</p>

<p>Recently, Mr Horton was assigned to the Fugitive Unit of the Atlanta Police Department (APD). He joined the department in November 2015. His recent recognition was linked to his work on a high-profile case involving the disappearance and death of 21-year-old Leondre Flynt, whose remains were found in July. Three suspects were arrested in connection with Flynt's death.</p>

<p>At the awards ceremony, Horton expressed his commitment to solving the case, saying, "It was a challenging investigation, but I felt the family deserved justice." Reflecting on the case's resolution, he added, "It was a significant achievement to provide the family with closure and hold someone accountable. That's why I do this job-to bring closure to people."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump's much-hyped return to Butler, Pennsylvania, came exactly one month before the November 5 presidential election, the outcome of which President Joe Biden suggested on Friday might not be peaceful.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump defiantly returned Saturday to the site of a campaign rally where an assassin's bullet almost killed him in July, questioning whether his opponents were responsible and declaring he would "never quit."</p>

<p>"Exactly 12 weeks ago this evening, on this very ground, a cold-blooded assassin aimed to silence me," the Republican candidate told tens of thousands of supporters after taking the stage behind bulletproof glass.</p>

<p>Calling the gunman a "vicious monster," Trump vowed he would "never quit... never bend... never break" to cheers of "fight, fight, fight" from the crowd.</p>

<p>Trump's much-hyped return to Butler, Pennsylvania, came exactly one month before the November 5 presidential election, the outcome of which President Joe Biden suggested on Friday might not be peaceful.</p>

<p>Trump lashed out at his political opponents, calling them the "enemy within" who had pushed to indict him and "who knows, maybe even tried to kill me."</p>

<p>"I wasn't supposed to make it," he said ominously.</p>

<p>Security was noticeably tighter than Trump's July rally, with sniper squads atop surrounding buildings, and a surveillance drone deployed overhead.</p>

<p>"There's a lot going on that's unnerving," said Heather Hughes, 43, who had travelled from New Castle in must-win Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>"Do I think he's safe? No, I think there's going to be another attempt. But I think he's going to make it through."</p>

<p>After the assassination attempt, pictures of Trump -- with a blood-streaked face, pumping his fist and shouting "fight, fight, fight" -- became defining images of the campaign.</p>

<p>On Saturday, many Trump supporters wore shirts emblazoned with the iconography, and some sported ear coverings recalling the bandage the former president wore after the shooting.</p>

<p>Billionaire Elon Musk joined Trump on stage, stressing the tight margins that will likely decide the election in battleground states like Pennsylvania and encouraging voter registration.</p>

<p>Trump "must win to preserve democracy in America," said Musk, echoing the alarmist messaging he frequently pushes to his 200 million followers on his X platform.</p>

<h3><strong>Race upended&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Much has changed since Trump's last visit to Butler, when he was riding high in polls after crushing Biden in a TV debate.</p>

<p>Barely a week after the failed assassination bid, the presidential race was turned on its head when Biden dropped out and was replaced as the Democratic nominee by Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Harris has clawed back the poll deficit -- reversing it in some states -- and the seismic events in Butler that had threatened to unleash chaos were largely overtaken.</p>

<p>Trump's rally appeared aimed at recovering the momentum as a bruising campaign enters its final phase.</p>

<p>Harris, who Trump called incompetent, was in North Carolina Saturday meeting first responders and people hit by Hurricane Helene, which killed at least 220 as it ripped through the southeast.</p>

<p>The emergency response is "an example of the best we can do when we bring resources together at the federal, state and local level and tap into the kind of collegiality that produces results," she told officials at a briefing.</p>

<p>Trump has criticized the federal response, alleging without evidence that the Biden-Harris administration wrongly redirected relief funds to migrants.</p>

<h3><strong>Election violence?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The heavy security presence on Saturday highlighted persistent security fears, underscored when another attempt on Trump's life was foiled last month.</p>

<p>The Secret Service has been pilloried for failing to secure the building where the Butler shooter managed to fire at Trump eight times before being shot dead.</p>

<p>Along with Trump, two supporters were wounded and one -- firefighter Corey Comperatore -- was killed.</p>

<p>Trump and his campaign have sought to challenge Democrats' warnings about the former president representing a threat to democracy.</p>

<p>"The Republicans aren't violent... I think they (the Democrats) incite. They keep talking about Hitler and the end of democracy," said retiree Glen Scheirer, who was with five relatives wearing identical "By the grace of God" T-shirts showing Trump after the shooting. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In the immediate aftermath of the Butler incident, all sides urged a lowering of the political temperature.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Trump quickly reverted to his signature inflammatory rhetoric and refused to commit to accepting the eventual result in November.</p>

<p>He has been indicted over the effort to subvert the 2020 election that culminated in his supporters storming the Capitol.</p>

<p>Asked about the possibility of further election-related violence, Biden said Friday he did not know if the vote would be peaceful.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Maldives will not act to undermine India's security and views Delhi as a "valued partner and friend", and cooperation in several fields will "always be a priority", President Mohamed Muizzu said Sunday as he arrived in the national capital.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/maldives" target="_blank">Maldives</a> will not act to undermine India's security and views New Delhi as a "valued partner and friend", and cooperation in several fields - including defence - will "always be a priority", President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/mohamed-muizzu" target="_blank">Mohamed Muizzu</a> said Sunday as he arrived in the national capital for his first bilateral visit.</p>

<p>Mr Muizzu - seen by some as a 'pro-China' leader who ran his election campaign on an 'India Out' platform - told a national English daily Maldives' relationship with India is "built on respect and shared interests" and that Delhi has been, and is, one of his country's largest trade and development partners.</p>

<p>The Maldives leader is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi later today.</p>

<p>"Maldives would never do anything to undermine security of India. While we enhance cooperation with other countries in various sectors, we remain committed to ensuring our actions do not compromise the security and stability of our region..." he told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/president-muizzu-in-india-will-never-hurt-indias-security-interests-maldives-first-but-will-prioritise-ties-with-india/articleshow/113989329.cms" target="_blank">The Times of India</a>&nbsp;in an extensive interview.</p>

<p>Mr Muizzu, while not naming China, also underlined his administration's resolve to "fostering growth and development through diverse international collaborations". He flagged his 'Maldives First' policy, saying "it is essential for the Maldives to diversify international relations and reduce over-dependence on any one country". However, he said that such engagements would not undermine India's interests.</p>

<p>"Respect for our neighbours and friends is embedded in our DNA," he said as he also called on Indian tourists to return. "Indians make a positive contribution... Indian tourists are welcome," he said, batting for his country's most important economic sector, which took a hit last year after the diplomatic row.</p>

<p>This is Mr Muizzu's first bilateral visit and the comments reflect growing bonhomie after a months-long diplomatic stand-off last year, over three Maldivian ministers' comments about Prime Minister Modi after a social media post about Lakshadweep as an alternate tourist destination to the Maldives.</p>

<p>The Maldives' Foreign Ministry distanced itself from the remarks and the ministers were suspended; two - Mariyam Shiuna and Malsha Shareef - <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/maldivies-president-mohamed-muizzu-to-visit-india-soon-2-ministers-resign-amid-strained-ties-6533861" target="_blank">resigned last month</a>&nbsp;after the bilateral visit was confirmed.</p>

<p>And then the request in May - weeks before attending Mr Modi's swearing-in ceremony - to remove 90 military personnel deployed to three aviation platforms gifted by India - also raised eyebrows.</p>

<p>Delhi accepted the request and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/centre-confirms-withdrawal-of-indian-military-personnel-from-maldives-5627860" target="_blank">replaced military personnel with "competent technical" staff</a>.</p>

<p>The ejection of Indian military personnel and an 'India Out' agenda was seen as one of Mr Muizzu's key poll promises. Pressed on these topics, the Maldives President said he "did what the people of Maldives asked of me", but stressed India remains a key partner in efforts to secure regional stability.</p>

<p>"This historic relationship is intertwined like the roots of a tree... built on centuries of exchange and values shared. The relationship between the Maldives and India has always been strong..."</p>

<p>Earlier Mr Muizzu denied having an 'India Out' agenda but insisted his country had a "serious problem" with the presence of foreign military on its soil.&nbsp;"The people of Maldives do not want a single foreign soldier in the country," news agency PTI quoted his comments to local website adhadhu.com.</p>

<p>Mr Muizzu also spoke about India-assisted infrastructure projects, like the Greater Male connectivity scheme and water and sewerage facilities for 28 islands in the archipelago.</p>

<p>The Maldives is one of India's key maritime neighbours in the Indian Ocean region and the overall bilateral ties, including in the areas of defence and security, witnessed an upward trajectory under the previous government led by President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday vowed to achieve victory and said his country's military "completely transformed reality" in the year since Hamas's October 7 attack, which has left the country fighting two wars.</p>

<p>Netanyahu told troops Israel "will win" as it battles militants in both the Gaza Strip and Lebanon and prepares to strike Iran, almost a year since the unprecedented attack by Palestinian Hamas militants sparked the Gaza war.</p>

<p>Israel's army chief, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said that, one year on, "we have defeated the military wing of Hamas".</p>

<p>Netanyahu had pledged to "crush... and destroy" the militants as fighting began last October, but troops have returned to several areas across Gaza where they had previously conducted operations against Hamas, only to find militants regrouping.</p>

<p>In late September Israel turned its focus north, intensifying military action against Iran-backed Hezbollah, which had been routinely sending rockets over the border from Lebanon in support of Hamas.</p>

<p>"A year ago, we suffered a terrible blow. Over the past 12 months, we have completely transformed reality," Netanyahu said during a visit to the Lebanon border, according to his office.</p>

<p>Hamas on Sunday called the October 7 attack "glorious" and said the Palestinians were "writing a new history with their resistance".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Their attack resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity. Dozens of other hostages are still held.</p>

<p>At last 370 people were killed at one location alone, the Nova rave in the Negev desert, which was commemorated with candles, prayer and music in Tel Aviv on Sunday.</p>

<p><strong>Destroyed, displaced</strong></p>

<p>In northern Gaza, the military said it had encircled the Jabaliya area after indications Hamas was rebuilding there despite a year of air strikes and fighting.</p>

<p>Rescuers said 17 people, including nine children, had been killed on Sunday by Israeli air strikes on the area.</p>

<p>Israel's military offensive in Gaza has killed at least 41,870 people, the majority of them civilians, according to figures provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry and described as reliable by the UN.</p>

<p>Most of Gaza's population is displaced and much of the territory's housing and other infrastructure destroyed.</p>

<p>Despite fighting, which has escalated in Lebanon since late September, and the threat of war with Iran, Netanyahu told French President Emmanuel Macron in a phone call that Israel's actions in Lebanon would help bring "stability, security and peace in the entire region", according to Netanyahu's office.</p>

<p>Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati appealed to the international community to push Israel for a ceasefire.</p>

<p>US Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris said in a pre-recorded interview that Washington was "not going to stop" pressuring Israel and Arab leaders to agree a Gaza truce.</p>

<p>The leaders of Jordan and the United Arab Emirates called for intensified international efforts to stop both wars. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani warned the fighting could "plunge the region and the world into prolonged conflicts".</p>

<p>Such appeals, and efforts by mediators, failed to secure a truce and hostage-release deal in Gaza. Critics of Netanyahu accuse him of obstructing such a deal.</p>

<p>Israel has been on high alert in the run-up to the October 7 anniversary, which the military said could lead to "attacks on the home front".</p>

<p><strong>Policewoman killed</strong></p>

<p>In southern Israel's Beersheba central bus station, a border policewoman was killed and 10 other people injured, first responders said. Police called it a suspected "terrorist" attack, adding that the assailant had also been killed.</p>

<p>Official Lebanese media late Sunday reported four Israeli strikes on Hezbollah's south Beirut stronghold, shortly after the latest calls by Israel's military for residents to leave the area.</p>

<p>Israel's military said it struck weapons storage facilities and infrastructure while taking measures "to mitigate the risk of harming civilians".</p>

<p>In a later statement, they said the latest strikes had "struck Hezbollah terrorist targets and weapons storage facilities in Beirut".</p>

<p>Late Sunday, Lebanon's health ministry said six people were killed and 13 wounded in an Israeli strike on the village of Keyfoun, 20 kilometres (12 miles) from Beirut.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It said Israeli strikes around the country killed 25 people the day before.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said Sunday it launched attack drones towards a military base near the northern Israeli city of Haifa. It later said it had targeted a second base nearby with a salvo of rockets.</p>

<p>Israel's military said rockets fired from northern Gaza had crossed into Israel, with one intercepted and the rest falling on open areas.</p>

<p>UN peacekeepers accused the Israeli military of compromising their safety by operating "immediately adjacent" to one of their positions in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>UNIFIL previously said it had rejected an Israeli request to relocate some of its peacekeepers.</p>

<p>- Foreigners flee -<br />
Israel, which began ground operations in Lebanon last Monday, says it aims to allow tens of thousands of Israelis displaced over the past year by Hezbollah rocket fire into northern Israel to return home.</p>

<p>Tehran, which backs armed groups across the Middle East, on Tuesday launched around 200 missiles at Israel in revenge for Israeli killings of militant leaders including Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah.</p>

<p>Israeli officials including Netanyahu have said Israel will respond to Iran's missile barrage, most of which was intercepted by the country's sophisticated air defences.</p>

<p>Iran has prepared its own plan to respond to a possible Israeli attack, Tasnim news agency reported, citing an informed source.</p>

<p>Flights at some Iranian airports were suspended Sunday, Tehran's aviation body announced, citing "operational restrictions".</p>

<p>Across Lebanon, strikes have killed more than 1,110 people since September 23, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Director General of Education Imad Achkar said Sunday that 40 percent of Lebanon's 1.25 million school pupils had been displaced by Israel's strikes.</p>

<p>Several countries have been evacuating their nationals from Lebanon.</p>

<p>Gaza's health ministry said Sunday an Israeli strike on a mosque-turned-shelter in central Deir el-Balah had killed 26 people. Israel said it had targeted Hamas militants.</p>

<p>Ahead of the October 7 anniversary, tens of thousands of protesters marched in cities around the world over the weekend calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On October 7, 2023, Hamas - a militant group which controlled Gaza - crossed over into Israel and launched 'Operation Al Aqsa Flood', a deadly terror attack, that killed over 1,200 people across the country. Israel was caught off-guard. Hamas operatives fired over 5,000 rockets, they came through paragliders, broke the Gaza wall and went on a killing spree. Israel responded with an air-ground invasion of Gaza, which has killed over 40,000 since last year.</p>

<p>Israel primarily has three objectives - Avenge the killing of people, uproot Hamas from Gaza and ensure the safe return of hostages from the territory. Gaza is left to ruins with over 66 per cent of buildings have been flattened, lakhs have been displaced and thousands have died in bombings. Hamas' Command and Control structure has been disrupted while several hostages have returned, some (assumed to be alive) are still in Gaza.</p>

<h2><b>Reduced To Rubble</b></h2>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/two-thirds-of-buildings-in-gaza-damaged-since-war-began-last-year-un-6685216">UN Satellite Centre (UNOSAT)</a> analysed satellite images of the 365 sq km of land. The report compares satellite images from September 2024 with pictures taken before the invasion began. "UNOSAT identified 52,564 destroyed structures, 18,913 severely damaged structures, 56,710 moderately damaged structures, and 35,591 possibly damaged structures for 163,778 structures," the report said.</p>

<p>Open-source satellite images from EOS Landviewer, accessed by NDTV, show the structural changes in north Gaza, primarily near the Jabalia refugee camp which was established in 1948 after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. NDTV analysed four images - three after the war and one from 2022 to understand the changes to the buildings and loss of cropland after the bombing.</p>

<h2><strong>What Satellite Images Say</strong></h2>

<p>A picture taken on September 26, 2024, by Sentinel-2 shows a razed area, with almost no vegetation after the bombing campaign. When the image of the same area is compared with one taken on December 16, 2022 - A year before the invasion - a massive change is visible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The grey patch represents buildings, while green represents croplands. Gaza is one of the most densely populated regions in the world with over 2.3 million living in an area 1/4th the size of Delhi. By September 26, the density was reduced after the area was bombed several times.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/wiped-off-the-map-gazans-back-in-war-ravaged-jabalia-refugee-camp-5795492">Several families in the region</a> have relocated and moved south to escape death. With their belongings on bullock carts, cars, trucks and other modes of transportation, the mass evacuation took place amid air strikes and ground assault.</p>

<p>The images were compared with UNOSAT's cropland damage analysis to underpin the notable changes. UNOSAT used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a widely used metric to quantify the health and density of vegetation using sensor data. North Gaza has 31.3 sq km of cropland, of which 24.6 sq km or 79 per cent has been destroyed, leaving just 6.7 sq km.</p>

<p>During a conflict, natural vegetation is the most vulnerable to damage, leading to soil erosion and damage to croplands, impacting food production and causing other health impacts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The UN report states "The methodology evaluated the damage as a decline in the health and density of crops in September 2024, in comparison to the preceding seven seasons spanning from 2017 to 2024. The decline in the health and density of the crops can be observed due to the impact of activities such as razing, heavy vehicle activity, bombing, shelling, and other conflict-related dynamics. The analysis includes damage assessment for orchards and other trees, field crops and vegetables."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The analysis shows that the agricultural extent in the Gaza Strip is estimated to be 150 sq. km, accounting for approximately 41% of the total area of the Gaza Strip."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The United Nations estimates there are over <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/a-year-of-devastation-and-tonnes-of-rubble-to-deal-with-gazas-continued-struggle-6728537">42 million tonnes of debris</a>, including both shattered edifices that are still standing and flattened buildings across Gaza.</p>

<h2><strong>Israel: One Year After Attacks</strong></h2>

<p>Israel is still under attack from all directions. The frequency of attacks from Gaza has significantly reduced, but the war opened several fronts for the nation to deal with. Hezbollah - A Shia militant group in Lebanon - has been relentlessly attacking north Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, forcing over 70,000 Israelis to leave their homes for a safer location.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel said the gravity of the conflict has moved north to ensure the safe return of its citizens that have been under attack but the pager and walkie-talkie blasts across Lebanon to target Hezbollah, led to a wider conflict where the militant group alleged that Israel was behind the explosions. The conflict escalated to an air, artillery campaign, similar to Gaza, killing thousands including the group's chief, Hassan Nasrallah, and his potential successor Hashem Safieddine a week later. Israel has eliminated a majority of Hezbollah leaders.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Houthi rebels - a group backed by Iran - in Yemen have carried out several attacks since last year, opening another front for Tel Aviv.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since last year, Israel and Iran - two arch-rivals in West Asia - have confronted each other directly with missile and drone attacks. In April, Iran launched a missile and drone attack on Israel after strikes on its consulate in Damascus, Syria. The projectiles were mostly aimed at non-civilian areas. An Israeli response followed it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/rockets-fired-from-iran-on-israel-civilians-hiding-in-bomb-shelters-says-israel-defence-forces-6694961">Six months later,</a> Iran launched over 200 missiles targetting military and civilian areas, a paradigm shift in its approach to confront Israel after it killed Nasrallah. An Israeli response to the attack is expected soon.</p>

<p>Since last year, the US and other regional powers have failed to broker a ceasefire since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is adamant about fulfilling the military objectives and attacks from Gaza have not stopped.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Palestinian group Hamas on Sunday praised its October 7 attack on Israel in a video message ahead of the first anniversary of the deadly storming of southern Israel which sparked the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>"The crossing of the glorious 7th of October shattered the illusions the enemy had created for itself, convincing the world and the region of its supposed superiority and capabilities," Qatar-based Hamas member Khalil al-Hayya said in a video statement.</p>

<p>Last year's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>At least 41,870 Palestinians, a majority of them civilians, have been killed in Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip since the war began, according to data provided by the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. The UN has acknowledged these figures as reliable.</p>

<p>Al-Hayya, said a year after the October 7 attack, "all of Palestine, particularly Gaza, and our Palestinian people are writing a new history with their resistance, blood, and steadfastness".</p>

<p>The Hamas member, who has emerged as the Islamist group's public face following the killing of its former leader Ismail Haniyeh in July, said Gazans had remained "resilient to all attempts at displacement... despite the kinds of torture and terrorism you have endured, and the horrific genocide and daily massacre".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese hackers accessed the networks of US broadband providers and obtained information from systems the federal government uses for court-authorized wiretapping, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday.</p>

<p>Verizon Communications, AT&amp;T and Lumen Technologies are among the telecoms companies whose networks were breached by the recently discovered intrusion, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>The hackers might have held access for months to network infrastructure used by the companies to cooperate with court-authorized US requests for communications data, the Journal said. It said the hackers had also accessed other tranches of internet traffic.</p>

<p>China's foreign ministry responded on Sunday that it was not aware of the attack described in the report but said the United States had "concocted a false narrative" to "frame" China in the past.</p>

<p>"At a time when cybersecurity has become a common challenge for all countries around the world, this erroneous approach will only hinder the efforts of the international community to jointly address the challenge through dialogue and cooperation," the ministry said in a statement to Reuters.</p>

<p>Beijing has previously denied claims by the US government and others that it has used hackers to break into foreign computer systems.</p>

<p>Lumen Technologies declined to comment, while Verizon and AT&amp;T did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>The Journal said the attack was carried out by a Chinese hacking group with the aim of collecting intelligence. US investigators have dubbed it "Salt Typhoon."</p>

<p>Earlier this year, US law enforcement disrupted a major Chinese hacking group nicknamed "Flax Typhoon," months after confronting Beijing about sweeping cyber espionage under a campaign named "Volt Typhoon."</p>

<p>China's foreign ministry said in its statement that Beijing's cybersecurity agencies had found and published evidence to show Volt Typhoon was staged by "an international ransomware organization."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military said Sunday it deployed more troops to defend southern communities and areas bordering Gaza, ahead of the anniversary of the October 7 attack by Hamas.</p>

<p>"The IDF's (army) Gaza Division has been reinforced with several platoons, with forces stationed to defend both the communities and the border area," the military said.</p>

<p>"The soldiers are fully equipped to defend the region in coordination with local security forces," it said in a statement.</p>

<p>Inside Gaza, the military said three divisions were working to "dismantle terrorist infrastructure and degrade Hamas's capabilities".</p>

<p>"The Southern Command remains at a heightened state of vigilance and readiness for the coming days," commanding officer Major General Yaron Finkelman was quoted as saying.</p>

<p>Earlier, the military said its forces had surrounded the area of Jabaliya in central Gaza where Hamas was trying to rebuild its operational capabilities.</p>

<p>On October 7 last year, Hamas militants broke through the border from Gaza into Israel in what would become the deadliest attack in Israel's history.</p>

<p>At the end of the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, the militants launched their assault by land, air, and sea.</p>

<p>A year later, the confirmed death count from the attack, including hostages killed in captivity, has reached 1,205 on the Israeli side, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Militants abducted 251 hostages, 97 of whom are still captive in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military has said are dead.</p>

<p>Hours after the attack Israel launched a lightning military offensive on Gaza, which has reduced large swathes of the territory to rubble, and nearly all of the 2.4 million residents have been displaced at least once as a humanitarian crisis worsened.</p>

<p>Israel's relentless offensive on Gaza has so far killed at least 41,870 people, a majority of them civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>The figures have been found to be reliable by the United Nations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gazan mother Rana Salah cradles her one-month-old daughter Milana in her arms in a sweltering tent for the displaced, and speaks of the guilt she feels for bringing her child into a world of war and suffering.</p>

<p>"If it were up to me, I wouldn't have gotten pregnant or given birth during the war because life is completely different; we've never lived this life before," she said, speaking at a camp in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>"I gave birth twice before, and life was better and easier for me and the child. Now, I feel like I've wronged both myself and the child because we deserve to live better than this."</p>

<p>Milana was born in a hospital tent by caesarean owing to complications with Salah's pregnancy. The family have not been able to return home due to the conflict, moving instead from one tent to another.</p>

<p>Milana is one of around 20,000 babies to have been born in Gaza in the last year, according to UNICEF statistics.</p>

<p>The current war, a particularly deadly episode in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict, was triggered on October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israeli air and artillery strikes in response have reduced much of the Palestinian enclave to rubble and more than 41,500 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli assault, according to the Gaza health ministry. Most of Gaza's 2.3 million residents have been displaced.</p>

<p><strong>INFECTION RISK</strong></p>

<p>Salah fans Milana with cardboard and says the heat is bad for the baby's skin.</p>

<p>"Instead of returning to our house, we keep moving from one tent to another... where diseases are widespread and the water is contaminated."</p>

<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has said postnatal services have decreased significantly in Gaza, so women who have complications have less access to the care they need, as do their babies.</p>

<p>Rick Brennan, the WHO's Eastern Mediterranean Regional emergency director, said malnutrition was a threat to newborns, particularly if their mothers were unable to breastfeed, as there was no access to breast milk substitutes.</p>

<p>Displacement and being constantly on the move are disruptive for a newborn and expose them to risks of infection, he said.</p>

<p>Manar Abu Jarad is staying in a school shelter run by the UN Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA). Her youngest daughter Sahar was born on Sept. 4th, also by caesarean section. Her husband was killed in the war.</p>

<p>On hearing she would need a caesarean for the birth, she worried about how she would care for her other children.</p>

<p>"I already have three girls. I started shouting... How can I carry (water) buckets? How can I bathe my daughters? How can I help them and my husband is not with me, he was martyred."</p>

<p>Children rock baby Sahar, who is swaddled in a crib, next to Jarad.</p>

<p>"I've reached the point where I cannot carry the responsibility for this girl ... Thank God I found some help here," she said. She has borrowed what she can from family and uses one diaper a day for the baby as she can't afford more.</p>

<p>"I don't have the money to provide diapers or milk for her."</p>

<p>Jarad longs for an end to the war and a return to her home, even if it is just a tent next to her former home.</p>

<p>"The important thing is to go home. Enough of all the exhaustion we are experiencing here, enough carrying buckets, enough of the dirt in the bathrooms. It's really, really hard and really tiring for us. Diseases are everywhere."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The southern French city of Marseille was this week shaken by two apparently drug-related killings, including the murder of a 15-year-old boy who was "stabbed 50 times" and burned alive, prosecutors said on Sunday.</p>

<p>Marseille, France's second-largest city but also one of its poorest, is plagued by drug-related violence.</p>

<p>The historic port city on the Mediterranean coast has in recent years witnessed a turf war for control of the highly profitable drug market between various clans including DZ Mafia and Yoda.</p>

<p>The problem was once again thrust into public eye this week, with Marseille prosecutor Nicolas Bessone telling a news conference on Sunday that victims and perpetrators of such violence were getting increasingly younger.</p>

<p>The 15-year-old teenager was murdered on Wednesday in a case Bessone described as one of "unprecedented savagery".</p>

<p>On Friday, a 36-year-old football player, Nessim Ramdane, was shot and killed "in cold blood" by a 14-year-old in a case linked to Wednesday's murder.</p>

<p>The two latest cases mean that the number of drug-related killings in Marseille has risen to 17 since the start of the year.</p>

<p>Marseille's drug lords have been recruiting foot soldiers with ads on social media, "outsourcing" street dealing to youngsters known as "jobbeurs".</p>

<p>Bessone said on Sunday that now young boys were responding to ads not only to sell cannabis resin but also to kill "without any remorse or reflection".</p>

<p>The teenager had been hired via social networks by a 23-year-old prisoner to intimidate a competitor by setting fire to his door, the prosecutor said, adding the youth had been promised 2,000 euros.</p>

<p>The detainee of the Luynes prison south of Aix-en-Provence had described himself as a member of DZ Mafia.</p>

<p><strong>Shot in the head</strong></p>

<p>During his mission, the teenager was spotted by members of a rival gang who searched him and discovered that he was carrying a gun. To punish the minor, they repeatedly stabbed him then set him on fire.</p>

<p>"He was stabbed 50 times and taken to the Fonscolombes housing estate, where, according to the results of the autopsy, he was burned alive," said Bessone. His friend, also aged 15, was able to escape, Bessone added.</p>

<p>The same prisoner then again turned to social media, recruiting a 14-year-old minor to carry out a revenge attack and kill a member of the Blacks gang, promising to pay him 50,000 euros.</p>

<p>The 14-year-old for his part hired Ramdane, a football player who also worked as a chauffeur to support his family, the prosecutor said.</p>

<p>The minor, accompanied by a friend, asked the driver "to drop them off and wait for them, but he apparently "didn't comply", Bessone said.</p>

<p>The teenager then "shot him in the back of the head", he added.</p>

<p>The minor was taken into custody and admitted shooting the driver, but insisted that the shot had "gone off accidentally".</p>

<p>In September, Franck Rastoul, public prosecutor at the Aix-en-Provence court of appeal, warned of the scourge of drug-related violence.</p>

<p>"It is imperative that we fully understand the ravages of drug trafficking, which undermines the very foundations of our society," he said.</p>

<p>Rastoul said young people were "intoxicated by easy drug money" to the point of "total disregard for human life."</p>

<p>Drug-related violence caused a record number of 49 deaths in Marseille last year.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a groundbreaking discovery, experts have identified ancient remnants of a long-lost tectonic plate, dubbed Pontus, dating back an astonishing 120 million years. This finding sheds new light on Earth's history and underscores the ongoing quest for knowledge about our planet. According to<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.indy100.com/science-tech/lost-earth-crust-northern-borneo-2669278686"> Indy100.com</a></em>, researchers Suzanna van de Lagemaat and Douwe van Hinsbergen from Utrecht University made the breakthrough by analysing geological data from the Asia-Pacific region. Their prediction has now been confirmed, revealing the existence of Pontus, a previously unknown part of Earth's crust in Borneo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Geologist Suzanna van de Lagemaat said, "We thought we were dealing with relics of a lost plate that we already knew about. But our magnetic lab research on those rocks indicated that our finds were originally from much farther north, and had to be remnants of a different, previously unknown plate."</p>

<p>Researchers reconstructed the ancient Pontus plate, estimating it covered an area roughly one-quarter the size of the Pacific Ocean. Formed during the supercontinent Pangaea, Pontus lay beneath the vast ocean separating Eurasia and Australia 160 million years ago. As Pangaea broke apart, the Pontus plate was gradually subducted or swallowed by neighbouring plates. This geological process carried countries like the Philippines and Borneo to their present-day locations.</p>

<p>Notably, van de Lagemaat focussed her research on the intricate Junction Region, where tectonic plates converge between Japan, Borneo, the Philippines, New Guinea, and New Zealand. Her groundbreaking research enabled the creation of a stunning visual reconstruction.</p>

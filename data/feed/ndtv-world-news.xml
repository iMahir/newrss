       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Center for Countering Digital Hate said on Thursday it would leave Elon Musk-owned social media site X, citing concerns that upcoming changes to the platform's terms of service could hinder the nonprofit's ability to prevail in court battles.</p>

<p>The exit marks the latest development in an ongoing tussle between Musk and CCDH, which has faulted him for letting hate speech spread on the platform formerly known as Twitter. British news publisher the Guardian also said earlier this week it would no longer post on X due to "disturbing content" on the platform.</p>

<p>CCDH said the updated terms for X set to roll out on Friday will steer future legal battles toward judges Musk believes "will be on his side".</p>

<p>Under the updated terms, all legal disputes related to X will be brought exclusively in the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas or state courts in Tarrant County, Texas.</p>

<p>"Now, the billionaire will be able to bring lawsuits to friendly courts against whoever disagrees with him on his platform," CCDH said.</p>

<p>"We made the decision to leave X because the platform has declined further."</p>

<p>Musk and X did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, a US judge dismissed Musk's lawsuit accusing the nonprofit of cherry-picking data to create false and misleading reports that the billionaire turned X into a haven for hate speech, extremism and misinformation.</p>

<p>X is also embroiled in other lawsuits with nonprofits.</p>

<p>The US District Court for the Northern District of Texas is presiding over X's lawsuit against Media Matters, accusing the group of defamation over a report about ads next to extremist posts.</p>

<p>The court is also presiding over X's lawsuit against Global Alliance for Responsible Media, accusing the group of unlawfully conspiring to boycott the site and causing it to lose revenue.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Europe's medicines watchdog on Thursday partially approved a marketing request for a long-awaited new treatment for Alzheimer's disease, reversing an earlier decision not to give it the green light.</p>

<p>"After re-examining its initial opinion, the EMA... has recommended granting marketing authorisation to Leqembi (lecanemab) for treating mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease," the European Medicines Agency said, adding treatment would only apply to a certain group of patients.</p>

<p>Leqembi, developed by US multinational Biogen and Japanese-based Eisai, is the brand name of an active substance called lecanemab that is used to treat adults with mild memory and cognitive problems resulting from the early stages of the common type of dementia.</p>

<p>The EMA in July rejected a marketing request, saying the side effects, including potential brain bleeding, outweighed the benefits.</p>

<p>The EMA now endorsed the treatment, but only for patients with a lower risk of potential brain bleeding -- those who had "only one copy or no copy of ApoE4", a type of gene know as an important risk factor for Alzheimer's.</p>

<p>Such patients are less likely to experience certain serious health problems than people with two copies of the gene, the Amsterdam-based EMA said.</p>

<p>The health problems in question, known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), include fluid on the brain and brain bleeding.</p>

<p>"The benefits of Leqembi outweigh the risks in patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease with one or no copy of ApoE4."</p>

<p>This was "provided that risk minimisation measures are in place to reduce the risk of severe and symptomatic ARIA and monitor its consequences in the long term," it stressed.</p>

<p>Bringing down the risks included providing Leqembi through a "controlled access programme to ensure that the medicine is only used in the recommended patient population" and through MRI scans before and during treatment.</p>

<p>The Amsterdam-based EMA's approval will now be sent to the European Commission for a final decision to roll it out on the continent.</p>

<p>Pricing and reimbursement will be left up to member states, the EMA said.</p>

<p>Lecanemab has been hailed by Alzheimer's researchers and charities for being the first approved treatment which tackles the early stages of the disease, rather than managing the symptoms.</p>

<p>It works by using antibodies which bind to and clear the proteins that normally build up in the brains of people with Alzheimer's, the most common type of dementia.</p>

<p>The treatment has been shown to decrease cognitive decline by a quarter in people in the early stages of the disease.</p>

<p>Britiain's medicines regulator approved lecanemab in August, making it the country's first such licensed treatment.</p>

<p>Leqembi, together with another Alzheimer's drug called Aduhelm, received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration early last year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People with diplomatic immunity in the UK allegedly committed offences including sexual assault, indecent exposure and child cruelty last year, a British government minister said on Thursday.</p>

<p>A total of nine "serious and significant offences" by suspects with diplomatic protection were recorded with the foreign ministry in 2023, junior foreign minister Catherine West told parliament in a written statement.</p>

<p>They included a Libyan accused of sexual assault, an Iraqi accused of possession or distribution of indecent images of children, a Portuguese person accused of indecent exposure and someone from Singapore facing an accusation of child cruelty or neglect.</p>

<p>"The vast majority of diplomats and dependants abide by UK law," said West, referring to the 26,500 people in Britain who have diplomatic or international organisation-related immunity from prosecution.</p>

<p>She said that when alleged criminal conduct is brought to the ministry's attention "we ask the relevant foreign government or international organisation to waive immunity, where appropriate, to facilitate further investigation.</p>

<p>"For the most serious offences, and when a relevant waiver has not been granted, we request the immediate withdrawal of the diplomat or dependant," West added.</p>

<p>She also revealed that diplomatic missions owe more than £152 million ($193 million) in unpaid congestion charge fees in London, from its introduction in 2003 to last month.</p>

<p>The US embassy owes more than £15 million alone. It refuses to pay the £15 daily charge to enter central London because it views it as a tax from which diplomatic missions should be exempt.</p>

<p>Japan owes £10.4 million while China owes £9.3 million.</p>

<p>West also disclosed that diplomats owed almost £1.5 million in unpaid parking fines at the end of June. Saudi Arabia owed the most at £196,000, she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alphabet's Google on Thursday released a smartphone app for its artificial intelligence chatbot on Apple's App Store that introduced the latest generation of its voice assistant to the popular mobile operating system.</p>

<p>The new Gemini app will include Gemini Live, a voice-based feature that allows users to have natural conversations with the chatbot. Apple has already said it will incorporate OpenAI's ChatGPT into a refreshed version of its voice assistant, Siri.</p>

<p>"It's great for when you want to practice for an upcoming interview, ask for advice on things to do in a new city, or brainstorm and develop creative ideas," Brian Marquardt, a senior director of product management at Google, said in a statement.</p>

<p>Gemini is Google's answer to ChatGPT, the popular application developed by Microsoft-backed OpenAI. Google initially launched it in February 2023 under the name Bard, and has since added more capabilities while weathering controversies.</p>

<p>Google announced the voice feature during an August event and first added it to phones powered by its own mobile operating system, Android.</p>

<p>Technical advances in AI spurred by the rise of large language models have fostered the emergence of a new generation of voice assistants far more capable than Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri and Google Assistant.</p>

<p>Google's Gemini Live is a replacement of Assistant, an eight-year-old product built using older AI technology.</p>

<p>Hundreds of employees on the Voice Assistant team were laid off in January as part of a reorganization to "become more efficient," a company spokesperson said at the time.</p>

<p>Google has since consolidated further. Last month it folded the Gemini app team into DeepMind, its AI research lab, in a move that CEO Sundar Pichai also attributed to increasing efficiency.</p>

<p>DeepMind is among the research organizations implementing new techniques to improve AI models as the traditional approach of building ever-bigger models has run in to unexpected delays and challenges, Reuters reported this week.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Bangladesh's top legal official has proposed to remove the words "secularism" and "socialism" from the Constitution apart from a provision prescribing capital punishment for regime change through extra-constitutional means.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's top legal official has proposed to remove the words "secularism" and "socialism" from the Constitution apart from a provision prescribing capital punishment for regime change through extra-constitutional means.</p>

<p>In his statement in the High Court during a hearing on a writ petition filed by a group of citizens, Attorney General Mohammad Asazzaman on Wednesday sought to remove "secularism" and "socialism" as two of the four principles of the Constitution alongside the designation of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as the Father of the Nation.</p>

<p>Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was the undisputed leader of Bangladesh but the Awami League politicised him in the party's interest, he said, referring to the founding leader of Bangladesh who is popularly known as Bangabandhu.</p>

<p>The writ petition challenged the validity of the Constitution's 15th amendment made by the now-ousted Awami League regime of deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina in 2011 while a two-judge High Court bench issued a rule asking the interim government to come up with its stance on the matter.</p>

<p>"As a whole, we do not want that (HC) rule to be scrapped," the attorney general said, clarifying the government's stance on the writ petition while talking to newsmen at his office.</p>

<p>Several people, mostly lawyers, emerged as interveners in the writ petition, some supporting the plea and some opposing it.</p>

<p>The 15th amendment was passed in parliament with the strength of a brute majority of the Awami League, restoring, inserting and scrapping several provisions in the Constitution.</p>

<p>The amendments included the restoration of secularism as a state principle, the scrapping of the caretaker government system for election oversight, assuming state power through extra-constitutional means and the designating of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as the Father of the Nation.</p>

<p>In his concluding arguments, Asaduzzaman told the court that the interim government wanted to declare the 15th amendment to the Constitution largely unconstitutional, retaining only select provisions.</p>

<p>He particularly demanded the restoration of the caretaker government system and the provision of the referendum in the Constitution.</p>

<p>The Awami League regime was toppled on August 5 in the face of a mass upsurge originating from a quota reform campaign by the Anti-Discrimination Students Movement. Three days later Nobel laureate Muhammad assumed office as the chief adviser of the interim government.</p>

<p>The attorney general criticised Article 7A inserted under the 15th amendment that criminalises any attempt to repeal, suspend, or subvert the Constitution through force or unconstitutional means, calling such acts as sedition, which are punishable with the death penalty.</p>

<p>He argued that this restriction limits democratic change and disregards the recent mass uprising that deposed the Awami League government and demanded the restoration of the caretaker government system.</p>

<p>"The (provisions of the 15th) amendment betrays the sacrifices of martyrs like Abu Sayed and Mugdho," said Asaduzzaman, referring to two students who were shot dead during the July-August mass protests.</p>

<p>Asaduzzaman was appointed as the attorney general days after the ouster of the past regime and the resignation of his predecessor.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Iranian state is planning to open a treatment clinic for women who flout the mandatory hijab laws that require them to cover their heads in public.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Iranian state is planning to open a treatment clinic for women who flout the mandatory hijab laws that require them to cover their heads in public. Announcing the opening of a "hijab removal treatment clinic", Mehri Talebi Darestani, the head of the Women and Family Department of the Tehran Headquarters for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice said the establishment will offer "scientific and psychological treatment for hijab removal".</p>

<p>"The establishment of this center will be for the scientific and psychological treatment of removing the hijab, specifically for the teenage generation, young adults, and women seeking social and Islamic identity and visiting this center is optional," a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.iranintl.com/en/202411128960" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Iran International</a> quoted Talebi as saying.</p>

<p>Notably, the Women and Family Department of the Tehran Headquarters for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice falls under the direct authority of Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei. The body is reportedly responsible for defining and enforcing strict religious standards in Iran, particularly those related to women's dress.</p>

<h2><strong>Move Sparks Outrage</strong></h2>

<p>The announcement came weeks after a university student, who stripped down to her underwear on a Tehran campus in an apparent protest at harsh treatment by dress code enforcers, was detained and sent to a psychiatric hospital for mental health treatment.</p>

<p>The news of the new clinic has spread among the "Woman, Life, Freedom" protest groups and women, sparking fear and outrage.</p>

<p>Speaking with The Guardian on the condition of anonymity, a young woman from Iran said, "It won't be a clinic, it will be a prison."</p>

<p>"We are struggling to make ends meet and have power outages, but a piece of cloth is what this state is worried about. If there was a time for all of us to come back to the streets, it's now or they'll lock us all up," she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Iranian human rights lawyer, Hossein Raeesi, the idea of a clinic to treat women who did not comply with hijab laws is "neither Islamic nor aligned with Iranian law".&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Use Of Psychiatric Facilities To Curb Dissent</strong></h3>

<p>Iranian authorities have been widely accused of using mental health institutions to curb the dissent against the strict hijab law. The method has been condemned by human rights advocates as psychologically abusive and manipulative.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/nov/14/iran-announces-treatment-clinic-for-women-who-defy-strict-hijab-laws" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>, Sima Sabet, a UK-based Iranian journalist who was a target of an Iranian assassination attempt last year, said the move is “shameful”.</p>

<p>“The idea of establishing clinics to ‘cure' unveiled women is chilling, where people are separated from society simply for not conforming to the ruling ideology," she said.</p>

<p>Since the "Woman, Life, Freedom" movement began, hardliners have increased efforts to enforce strict dress codes for women. Artists, including actresses Afsaneh Bayegan, Azadeh Samadi, and Leila Bolukat, who posted images of themselves without a hijab, reportedly received court-ordered mandates for weekly visits to psychological centers for mental health certificates in response to their conduct.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;"Woman, Life, Freedom" movement began in Iran after the death of young woman Mahsa Amini in police custody over hijab violations in September 2022.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Satirical news outlet The Onion said Thursday it had acquired Infowars, a conspiracy-laden website whose owner made money by running stories that called one of America's most notorious school shootings a hoax.</p>

<p>The Onion said it prevailed in a bankruptcy auction to buy Alex Jones' Infowars site with the support of families of victims of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.</p>

<p>The new Infowars, starting in January, will operate as a parody of its former self, The Onion said, with a anti-gun violence nonprofit founded after the 2012 shooting advertising on the site that once claimed the bloody attack was staged.</p>

<p>The massacre left 20 small children and six educators dead in a particularly gruesome chapter of America's gun violence epidemic.</p>

<p>Families sued Jones in 2018 after he spread the claim that the shooting rampage was staged with actors.</p>

<p>Four years later they won a $1.4 billion defamation settlement against Jones, who declared bankruptcy, and his company Free Speech Systems.</p>

<p>In September a judge in Texas said Infowars and other assets owned by Free Speech Systems could be auctioned to raise money for creditors who include Sandy Hook families.</p>

<p>The Onion declined to say how much it paid for Infowars, including its production studio and a dietary supplement business.</p>

<p>Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit created after the Sandy Hook shooting, will advertise on an overhauled version of Infowars.</p>

<p>The nonprofit said it and the Onion share the goal of ending gun violence.</p>

<p>A famous headline that The Onion runs after mass shootings is, "'No Way To Prevent This,' Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens."</p>

<p>The Onion's parent company, Global Tetrahedron, said bidding to buy Infowars was an easy decision to make, calling it an "invaluable tool for brainwashing and controlling the masses."</p>

<p>"InfoWars has shown an unswerving commitment to manufacturing anger and radicalizing the most vulnerable members of society -- values that resonate deeply with all of us at Global Tetrahedron," the company wrote Thursday on its website.</p>

<p>Ben Collins, the chief executive of Global Tetrahedron, said the new Infowars would make fun of internet personalities like Jones who traffic in misinformation.</p>

<p>"We thought this would be a hilarious joke," Collins told The New York Times.</p>

<p>"This is going to be our answer to this no-guardrails world where there are no gatekeepers and everything's kind of insane."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A groundbreaking study by New York University (NYU) reveals that memory formation isnt limited to brain cells but may occur in various body cells, altering our understanding of memory.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A groundbreaking discovery made by researchers at New York University (NYU) implies that memory creation occurs in cells other than the brain. Treatments for memory-related disorders and learning strategies may be significantly impacted by this study.</p>

<p>The long-held belief that memories are only retained in brain cells is called into question by this study. Rather, NYU researchers found that cells from different body areas had a memory function, suggesting that learning by repetition may occur at the cellular level. This implies that the ability of our body to "remember" extends beyond the brain, with each cell possibly having the power to adjust in response to past events.</p>

<p>"Learning and memory are generally associated with brains and brain cells alone, but our study shows that other cells in the body can learn and form memories, too," explains New York University's Nikolay V. Kukushkin, the lead author of the study, which appears in the<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-53922-x"><em> journal Nature Communications.&nbsp;</em></a></p>

<p>The research sought to better understand if non-brain cells help with memory by borrowing from a long-established neurological property-the massed-spaced effect-which shows that we tend to retain information better when studied in spaced intervals rather than in a single, intensive session-better known as cramming for a test.</p>

<p>In the Nature Communications research, the scientists replicated learning over time by studying two types of non-brain human cells in a laboratory (one from nerve tissue and one from kidney tissue) and exposing them to different patterns of chemical signals-just like brain cells are exposed to patterns of neurotransmitters when we learn new information. In response, the non-brain cells turned on a "memory gene"-the same gene that brain cells turn on when they detect a pattern in the information and restructure their connections in order to form memories.</p>

<p>"This reflects the massed-space effect in action," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2024/november/memories-are-not-only-in-the-brain--new-research-finds.html">says Kukushkin,</a> a clinical associate professor of life science at NYU Liberal Studies and a research fellow at NYU's Center for Neural Science. "It shows that the ability to learn from spaced repetition isn't unique to brain cells, but, in fact, might be a fundamental property of all cells."</p>

<p>The researchers add that the findings not only offer new ways to study memory, but also point to potential health-related gains.</p>

<p>"This discovery opens new doors for understanding how memory works and could lead to better ways to enhance learning and treat memory problems," observes Kukushkin. "At the same time, it suggests that in the future, we will need to treat our body more like the brain-for example, consider what our pancreas remembers about the pattern of our past meals to maintain healthy levels of blood glucose or consider what a cancer cell remembers about the pattern of chemotherapy."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump's 2024 victory is very reminiscent of his 2016 one. However, comparing Trump's 2016 and 2024 presidential campaigns reveals some striking differences as well.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's 2024 victory is very reminiscent of his 2016 one. However, comparing Trump's 2016 and 2024 presidential campaigns reveals some striking differences as well.</p>

<p>Despite the passage of time, Trump's appeal remained consistent across both elections. His support base remained loyal, and he continued to draw significant support from key demographic groups.</p>

<p>According to a CNN exit poll, White voters without college degrees have always supported Trump and this was the case in 2024 as well. Latino voters were shifting towards Trump since 2016, but this year, Trump won them in full glory. Votes from women plateaued for Harris as compared to women's votes for Biden and Clinton, even though she aimed to mobilise women through reproductive rights and Trump enjoyed his edge among men.</p>

<p>One notable difference between the two elections was Trump's ability to secure a popular vote majority in 2024. This was a significant departure from 2016, where he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Trump's false statements have remained consistent over the years. His comments on crime rates and poverty have been a subject of debate. In 2016, he highlighted a 17 per cent increase in homicides in the 50 largest US cities, which was the largest increase in 25 years. However, this claim cherry-picked statistics and ignored the overall decline in murders during the Obama administration and preceding decades.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to 2024, Trump claimed that "our crime rate is going up," but according to the FBI's preliminary analysis, violent crime and property crime are near historic lows and decreased in the first quarter. His 2016 statement on Latino poverty was accurate in raw numbers, stating that two million more Latinos were in poverty since Obama took office. However, he omitted the fact that the Latino population grew and their poverty rate actually decreased.</p>

<p>Trump's selective use of statistics has raised concerns. For instance, while food prices have increased by 21 per cent and gas prices by 35 per cent since Biden took office, Trump's claims exaggerate these numbers. He mentioned a 57 per cent increase in the cost of groceries and 60 per cent increase in gas.</p>

<p>The 2024 election also highlighted the ongoing issues with polling accuracy. Despite efforts to improve polling techniques, Trump's support was consistently underestimated during both the years - 2016 and 2024. Hilary Clinton and Kamala Harris had both headed into Election Day asserting that they would defeat Trump.</p>

<p>The Trump voter phenomenon has left many scratching their heads, and two key theories attempt to explain why polling predictions often miss the mark. Firstly, Trump supporters tend to be anti-establishment and wary of authority, which may lead them to systematically refuse pollsters' calls, essentially staying under the radar. This reluctance to engage with pollsters could be due to a sense of mistrust or a desire to keep their opinions private.</p>

<p>Secondly, some hypothesise that the criteria pollsters use to identify "likely" voters inadvertently screens out individuals inclined to support Trump.</p>

<p>The "Bradley effect" or "Wilder effect" offers insight into this phenomenon, where voters conceal their true preferences due to social desirability bias, particularly when faced with questions about racial or sensitive topics.</p>

<p>The similarities between the 2016 and 2024 elections suggest that American politics has become increasingly polarised. The country is largely divided between two equal-sized coalitions, resulting in Groundhog Day-style repeat elections. This polarisation has significant implications for the future of American politics.</p>

<p>After Barack Obama's win in 2008, the country was positive about heading in the right direction, fair, even-handed and unbiased. However, after two disastrous losses of 2016 and 2024, it is hard to shirk off the thought that the losses might just be related to the candidates' identities since one of the common denominators between both the elections are that the Democratic contenders were both women.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Two years after surgery, three patients experienced improved corneal transparency with no serious side effects.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japanese researchers have successfully tested a stem cell transplant in a groundbreaking clinical experiment, significantly improving the vision of three patients with serious corneal damage.</p>

<p>This ground-breaking study, which was recently published in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01764-1/fulltext"><em>The Lancet, </em></a>concentrated on limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD), a crippling disorder that causes significant visual impairment due to scar tissue accumulation on the cornea.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/spacex-launches-24-starlink-satellites-in-back-to-back-space-missions-7020058"><strong>Also Read | SpaceX Launches 24 Starlink Satellites In Back-To-Back Space Missions</strong></a></p>

<p>Scientists created corneal epithelial cell sheets (iCEPS) produced from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) for this treatment. In an attempt to restore vision by repopulating the vital stem cells that preserve the cornea's clarity, these sheets were then placed onto the participants' injured corneas. With encouraging results, the trial-the first of its kind worldwide-marks a critical turning point in regenerative medicine.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/indian-gaming-market-to-hit-rs-76-000-crore-66-gamers-from-small-towns-report-7018797"><strong>Also Read | Indian Gaming Market To Hit Rs 76,000 Crore, 66% Gamers From Small Towns: Report</strong></a></p>

<p>Two years post-surgery, the three patients showed no serious side effects, and each cornea appeared far more transparent than before, signaling a substantial improvement in vision. This success highlights the potential of stem cell therapy for restoring sight in individuals suffering from LSCD, where the natural loss of limbal stem cells hinders the eye's ability to maintain a clear cornea.</p>

<p>With four participants enrolled, this study could pave the way for more extensive trials and ultimately provide new options for patients with similar eye conditions. Researchers hope this innovative approach will offer lasting relief and clarity to those affected by corneal diseases worldwide.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid a rise in global demand for it, India today successfully completed the flight-test of its advanced guided weapon system Pinaka. During the test, the Pinaka system's range, accuracy, consistency and rate of fire for multiple target engagement in a salvo mode were assessed.</p>

<p>"Defence Research and Development Organisation or DRDO has successfully completed the flight-tests of Guided Pinaka Weapon System as part of Provisional Staff Qualitative Requirements (PSQR) validation trials," the Defence Ministry said today, adding that the flight-tests have been conducted in three phases at different field firing ranges.</p>

<p>"Twelve rockets from each production agency from two in-service Pinaka launchers upgraded by the launcher production agencies have been tested," the statement said.</p>

<p>With this, New Delhi's defence manufacturing push under 'Make in India' is gaining momentum. France has recently showed interest in the Pinaka Multi-Barrel Rocket Launcher or MBRL system to bolster its defences.</p>

<h2><strong>THE PINAKA SYSTEM</strong></h2>

<p>The Pinaka system, considered on par with America's HIMARS system, has been India's first major defence export as conflict-hit Armenia had placed the first order. Now France has also shown interest in the advanced rocket system to boost its army's artillery division. In fact, talks are already at a fairly advanced stage, sources familiar with the matter said, adding that France has decided to test the system in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Named after Lord Shiva's divine bow, the Pinaka rocket system was a replacement for the Russian Grad BM-21 rocket launcher for the Indian Army. It was first deployed during the 1999 Kargil War. The Pinaka system had played a pivotal role in destroying Pakistani positions at strategic heights during the war.</p>

<p>The Pinaka rocket system is developed by Armament Research &amp; Development Establishment or ARDE, which comes under the DRDO. The system comprises of a free-flight artillery rocket having a maximum range of 38 km with different types of warheads and fuzes. It comes with a multi-tube launcher vehicle, a replenishment-cum-loader vehicle, a replenishment vehicle, and a command post vehicle.</p>

<p>The multi-barrel rocket system has two pods containing 6 rockets each, capable of firing all 12 rockets in salvo mode within 44 seconds, neutralizing a target area of 700 x 500 meters. For the Indian Army's specific requirement of a free flight rocket with enhanced range, ARDE has successfully developed the Pinaka Mk-II rocket with a 60-km range. The existing launch vehicle and ground systems of Pinaka MBRS is used for the Mk-II as well, with minor modifications for firing this new rocket.</p>

<p>A battery can fire 72 rockets. Each launcher can now be operated independently and rockets can be fired individually or simultaneously in different directions. The launcher may be operated in manual, remote, stand alone, and autonomous modes. Its shoot-and-scoot capabilities also enable it to escape counter battery fire.</p>

<p>The current version of the Pinaka system is a guided one, which means that the rockets have seekers, which are used for precision strikes. Because of it becoming a guided system, it has now been able to increase its range to nearly double of what the first version was. The DRDO is now working on a guided Pinaka system which is capable of ranges greater than 120 km, 150 km, and 200 km to counter China's long-range guided rocket systems.</p>

<h3><strong>GLOBAL INTEREST</strong></h3>

<p>The system is already in service with the Indian Army and deployed both at the LoC with Pakistan and LAC with China. It was also reportedly delivered to Armenia via Iran in 2023 to bolster its defence against Azerbaijan.</p>

<p>France's move to consider buying the Pinaka system is part of the effort to boost defence and strategic ties between the two nations. France is India's second biggest defence supplier after Russia. The recent T AC 295 transport aircraft deal and the Rafael deal are testament to Paris and New Delhi's steadfast defence ties.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The EU fined online giant Meta almost 800 million euros on Thursday for breaching antitrust rules by giving users of its Facebook social network automatic access to classified ads service Facebook Marketplace.</p>

<p>The European Commission said the US tech titan also abused its dominant position by imposing unfair trading conditions on other online classified ads service providers that advertise on its platforms.</p>

<p>"This is illegal under EU antitrust rules. Meta must now stop this behaviour," the bloc's competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, said in a statement.</p>

<p>Meta said it would appeal, alleging the decision ignored "the realities of the thriving European market for online classified listing services.</p>

<p>"Facebook users can choose whether or not to engage with Marketplace, and many don't. The reality is that people use Facebook Marketplace because they want to, not because they have to," the firm said in a statement.</p>

<p>Among the 10 largest antitrust fines ever imposed by the 27-nation European Union, it is the latest in a string of hefty penalties slapped on Big Tech companies in recent years by the commission, the regulator for the bloc.</p>

<p><strong>'Abusive practices'</strong></p>

<p>Detailing what it termed "abusive practices" by Meta, the commission said that because Facebook Marketplace was tied to Facebook, the former enjoyed a "substantial distribution advantage which competitors cannot match."</p>

<p>"All Facebook users automatically have access and get regularly exposed to Facebook Marketplace whether they want it or not," it said.</p>

<p>Additionally Meta imposed unfair conditions on competitors in the classified ads service who advertised on Facebook and Instagram, the commission said.</p>

<p>This allowed it to "use ads-related data generated by other advertisers for the sole benefit of Facebook Marketplace", it said.</p>

<p>Meta, which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, contended it did not "use advertisers' data for this purpose" and has "built systems and controls to ensure that".</p>

<p>"It is disappointing that the Commission has chosen to take regulatory action against a free and innovative service built to meet consumer demand," the company said.</p>

<p>Meta's dominant position in the market for personal social networks comes with a special responsibility not to abuse it by restricting competition, according to the EU.</p>

<p><strong>'Duration and gravity'</strong></p>

<p>The commission opened formal proceedings into possible anticompetitive conduct by Facebook in June 2021, communicating its concerns to Meta in December 2022 -- and receiving the firm's response in June 2023.</p>

<p>The EU fined the company 797.72 million euros ($840 million), a sum the commission said took into account the "duration and gravity of the infringement", as well as the turnover of Meta and Facebook Marketplace.</p>

<p>Meta's total revenue last year stood at around $135 billion.</p>

<p>The European commissions has had several run-ins with Meta as part of a broader clampdown on abusive Big Tech practices.</p>

<p>Its policy arsenal has been amped up over the past two years with major twin laws, the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, that carry massive financial penalties in the event of infringements.</p>

<p>In July the EU accused Meta of breaching the digital rules with its new "pay or consent" system. It meant users had to pay to avoid data collection, or agree to share their data with Facebook and Instagram to keep using the platforms for free.</p>

<p>Bowing to pressure from EU regulators, Meta announced this week it was offering non-paying users in the bloc the option of receiving less targeted ads, as well as cutting subscription rates for entirely ad-free services.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greece is in talks with Israel to develop a 2 billion euro ($2.11 billion) anti-aircraft and missile defence dome, part of a wider push to modernise its armed forces as it recovers from a protracted debt crisis, Greek officials said on Thursday.</p>

<p>The defences would likely mimic Israel's Iron Dome and other systems that intercept short- and long-range missiles launched during strikes from its neighbours amid the ongoing conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

<p>Greece is keen to invest in its defences to keep up with its NATO ally and historic rival Turkey, which is also developing its own air defences, despite some improvement in relations.</p>

<p>"The plan is to create a multi-layer anti-aircraft and anti-drone system," one source with knowledge of the issue told Reuters after a closed door briefing with Greek Defence Minister Nikos Dendias.</p>

<p>"We are in discussions with Israel," the source said.</p>

<p>A second official confirmed the scale of the potential deal, adding that Greece needs to spend 12.8 billion euros by 2035 to modernise its armed forces.</p>

<p>The air defences are part of Athens' 10-year military purchasing plan that includes acquiring up to 40 new F-35 fighter jets and drones from the US, and four Belharra frigates and Rafale jets from France.</p>

<p>"Our effort is for a quick transition of our armed forces to the 21st century," Defence Minister Dendias said before the Thursday briefing.</p>

<p>Greece currently uses US Patriot and old Russian S-300 systems to protect its airspace.</p>

<p>Despite some thaw in Greece's long-troubled relations with Turkey, its much larger eastern neighbour, the two countries remain at odds on a range of issues including sea boundaries, energy resources and airspace in the eastern Mediterranean.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel expects the incoming Trump administration to take a hard line against Iran and its nuclear ambitions, which will create an opportunity for more peace deals with Arab neighbors, a senior member of Israel's security cabinet said.</p>

<p>Energy Minister Eli Cohen, in an interview with Reuters, also said that Israel is closer than ever to reaching an agreement to end fighting in Lebanon and push Iran-backed Hezbollah away from the border, while insisting that Israel maintains the right to act military should it be violated.</p>

<p>Israel has been in a multi-front war since Hamas, which is also supported by Iran, launched its assault from Gaza on southern Israel on October 7, 2023. Hezbollah began attacking the following day. Israel in turn started a devastating air and ground campaign in Gaza and, in recent months, intensified its operation in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>Iranian-backed militias have frequently fired on Israel from Yemen and Iraq, and Israel and Iran have traded direct blows.</p>

<p>Cohen said that incoming US President Donald Trump has been appointing senior staff who "certainly support determined action against Iran".</p>

<p>"The period of Trump's previous administration was characterized by greater regional stability," he said. "Towards the end of his presidency, the sanctions on Iran were close to making Iran to change its behavior on the nuclear issue."</p>

<p>"So we certainly hope and believe that the Trump administration's policy will continue that, and first and foremost, we see the most central issue is acting assertively against Iran."</p>

<p>During his campaign, Trump said that President Joe Biden's policy of not rigorously enforcing oil export sanctions has weakened Washington and emboldened Tehran, allowing it to sell oil, accumulate cash and expand its nuclear pursuits and influence through armed militias.</p>

<p>Trump has tapped US Senator Marco Rubio, an advocate of muscular foreign policy on Iran, for secretary of state. Mike Waltz, who is slated to become national security adviser, has also pushed for a tougher stance.</p>

<p>"We think he (Trump) is targeting the bottom line. To rein in the threatening actors and create new regional alliances that are very important," Cohen said.</p>

<p><strong>NUCLEAR DISPUTE</strong></p>

<p>In 2018, as president and with support from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump withdrew from a multi-national deal aimed at preventing Iran from building a nuclear bomb. Washington then reimposed sanctions to force Tehran into talks on a broader agreement addressing its missiles and support for regional proxies.</p>

<p>Iran denies ever having a nuclear weapons programme, though Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has said that if it wanted to world leaders "wouldn't be able to stop us".</p>

<p>Israel is widely believed to have a nuclear arsenal but has never confirmed nor denied this, maintaining a policy of ambiguity on the issue for decades.</p>

<p>Also during Trump's first term, Israel signed the US-brokered Abraham Accords, which normalized ties with Muslim countries including the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.</p>

<p>Israel hopes to forge a similar deal with Saudi Arabia, which says it will not normalize ties with Israel unless it includes at least the pathway to a Palestinian state.</p>

<p>Regarding fighting in Lebanon, Cohen said: "I think we are at a point that we are closer to an arrangement than we have been since the start of the war."</p>

<p>A key sticking point for Israel, he said, is ensuring it retains freedom of action should Hezbollah return to border areas.</p>

<p>"We will be less forgiving than in the past over attempts to create strongholds in territory near Israel. That's how we will be, and so that is certainly how we will act."</p>

<p>In terms of a mechanism to enforce the agreement, Cohen said: "There are discussions, but it has not been agreed upon."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 1,700-piece private collection of Chinese ceramics with an estimated value of £1 billion ($1.27 billion) has been donated to the British Museum -- a record for any UK institution.</p>

<p>The central London museum announced late on Wednesday that the Trustees of The Sir Percival David Foundation had gifted the collection permanently to go on public display.</p>

<p>David, who died in 1964, was a British businessman and Sinophile who collected ceramics from Europe, Japan, Hong Kong and China.</p>

<p>His collection had been on loan to the museum since 2009.</p>

<p>Museum chair George Osborne said he was "thrilled by this blockbuster decision" to make the loan permanent, calling it "the largest bequest to the British Museum in our long history".</p>

<p>Colin Sheaf, chair of The Sir Percival David Foundation of Chinese Art, said the donation coincided with the centenary of the businessman's first trip to China, which inspired his love of its art and culture.</p>

<p>He said he hoped it would continue to inspire and educate future generations.</p>

<p>Highlights from the collection include vases from 1351 and a cup used to serve wine for the Chenghua emperor in the 15th century, as well as ceramics made for the Northern Song dynasty court in the 11th century.</p>

<p>Some pieces from the collection will be loaned to the Shanghai Museum in China and the Metropolitan Museum in New York.</p>

<p>The British Museum was founded in 1753 and is one of the most famous in the world, with a collection of about eight million objects.</p>

<p>But like many Western museums, it has come under pressure in recent years to address calls to return items acquired during the British Empire, not least the Parthenon, or Elgin, Marbles.</p>

<p>Last year the museum -- home to the Rosetta Stone -- was rocked by revelations that thousands of artefacts from its collection were found to be "missing, stolen or damaged". Hundreds have since been recovered.</p>

<p>It dismissed a staff member suspected of involvement in what it called "an inside job", and alerted police who have interviewed a person but made no arrests.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Zealand's youngest MP Hana-Rawhiti Kareariki Maipi-Clarke, who shot to viral fame after she performed a haka during her maiden speech in parliament last year, is back in the limelight after once again staging the traditional Maori dance and ripping up a copy of a contentious bill during a House session.</p>

<p>A viral video of the vote on the Treaty Principles Bill shows the 22-year-old Te Pati Maori MP interrupting the session by tearing apart a copy of the legislation before performing a haka. She is then joined by the people in the public gallery, prompting Speaker Gerry Brownlee to briefly suspend the House.</p>

<p>The ACT New Zealand party, a junior partner in the country's centre-right coalition government, last week unveiled the bill, which seeks to change some of the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi - a move opposed by many Maori.</p>

<p>First signed in 1840 between the British Crown and more than 500 Maori chiefs, the Treaty lays down how the two parties agreed to govern. The interpretation of clauses in the document still guides legislation and policy today.</p>

<p>The bill, however, is seen by many Maori and their supporters as undermining the rights of the country's indigenous people, who make up around 20% of the population of 5.3 million.</p>

<p></p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">?Unprecedented &amp; simply magnificent.

<p></p>

<p>As the proposed bill passed its first reading, hundreds of people set out on a nine-day march, or hikoi, from New Zealand's north to the national capital of Wellington to mark their protest.</p>

<p>Coalition partners the National Party and New Zealand First are only supporting the legislation through the first of three readings as part of the coalition agreement. Both parties have said they will not support it to become legislation.</p>

<p>"You do not go negate, with a single stroke of a pen, 184 years of debate and discussion, with a bill that I think is very simplistic," Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told reporters before leaving for Peru to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[SpaceX completed a remarkable coast-to-coast double launch on November 14, expanding its Starlink satellite network with 24 new satellites.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX successfully launched its second set of Starlink satellites today (November 14th) in an incredible display of efficiency, according to Space.com. At 8:21 am EST, a Falcon 9 rocket carrying 24 Starlink satellites took out from Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station after a morning launch from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.</p>

<p>This doubleheader of launches shows a new commitment by SpaceX to build up the Starlink satellite constellation. The constellation should then provide high-speed internet to remote and underserved areas around the world.</p>

<p>A weathered booster on its 18th launch, the first stage of the Falcon 9 landed well on the SpaceX droneship "Just Read the Instructions" in the Atlantic Ocean. This reusable booster has played a crucial role in numerous Starlink missions.</p>

<p>These 24 join the constellation, so it will continue to increase in numbers, already having exceeded 6,560 active satellites. Mission control of the global internet by SpaceX is slowly within reach with time.</p>

<p><strong>What is Just Read the Instructions (JRTI)?</strong></p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://space-offshore.com/just-read-the-instructions"><em>space-offshore.com</em></a>, JRTI is a SpaceX autonomous spaceport droneship (ASDS) operating out of Port Canaveral, Florida. The droneship is built upon a modified barge-Marmac 303-and is named after a spacecraft of the same name from the novel 'The Player of Games', from the Culture series of books by author Iain M. Banks.</p>

<p>The JRTI droneship is a modified barge that is outfitted with a large landing platform, station-keeping thrusters, and other equipment to allow SpaceX to land Falcon boosters at sea on high-velocity missions that cannot carry enough fuel to allow for a return-to-launch-site landing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India will follow up a November 10 request to Canada to extradite terrorist Arshdeep Gill, alias <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/arsh-dalla" target="_blank">Arsh Dalla</a>, the de facto chief of the banned <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/khalistan-tiger-force" target="_blank">Khalistan Tiger Force</a>, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday.</p>

<p>In a statement on X, the ministry said a court in Canada's Ontario had listed its extradition request for hearing and that it had sent separate requests to verify financial details as provided last year.</p>

<p>The ministry labelled Dalla a "proclaimed offender" named in over 50 cases of murder, attempt to murder, extortion and terrorist acts, including terror financing. He was designated a 'terrorist' in January last year and is also an accused in multiple cases filed by the National Investigation Agency.</p>

<p>Delhi also believes Dalla has taken over the reins of the Khalistani terror outfit after Hardeep Nijjar was shot dead. The June 2023 killing of Nijjar - a Canadian citizen - has led to a diplomatic row with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declaring - without proof - that "agents" of India were involved in the murder.</p>

<p>Canada has refused earlier requests by India to hand over Dalla.</p>

<p>Dalla was arrested in Canada's Halton last month after they were injured in an attack by unknown shooters.&nbsp;Dalla was injured and sought treatment at a local hospital that alerted the cops. The police searched their vehicle - a grey Dodge Durango - and found bullet marks on the SUV, and also found two bullet casings on the floor of the passenger's seat, suggesting Dalla and Singh also fired back.</p>

<p>Dalla is from Moga in Punjab.</p>

<p>A known aide of Nijjar, Dalla is credited with orchestrating multiple targeted killings through a grid of sleeper cell assassins. Among the more high-profile victims of his murderous network was Manohar Lal, a member of the Gurmeet Ram Rahim-led Dera Sacha Sauda in November 2020.</p>

<p>Experts believe Dalla's sleeper cell network spans three continents - Canada and the United States in North America, parts of Europe, and Dubai, the Philippines and Thailand in Asia.</p>

<p>These are smuggled to Punjab via drone drops. There are also unconfirmed reports of terrorist acts in collaboration with another banned terrorist outfit, the Lashkar-e-Taiba.</p>

<h3><strong>Dalla-Bishnoi Rivalry</strong></h3>

<p>Dalla's criminal network is believed to have a long-standing rivalry with that led by gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, who, incredibly, runs his vast syndicate from a jail in Punjab.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Minnesota is preparing for a potential winter storm next week, with forecast models predicting a shift from rain to snow, especially in central and northern areas as colder air moves in.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Minnesota residents are advised to prepare for a major shift in weather next week, with multiple forecast models predicting a significant rain-to-snow event across the state. Late Monday or early Tuesday is when the system is predicted to arrive, initially bringing rain to a large portion of the state.</p>

<p>However, especially in the central and northern regions, the precipitation is expected to turn to snow as colder air moves in. According to several models, the storm may stall over Lake Superior, causing significant snowfall in these regions.</p>

<p>While the exact track and intensity of the storm are still uncertain, forecasters are urging residents to monitor weather updates closely. It's advisable to prepare for potential travel disruptions, power outages, and hazardous road conditions.</p>

<p><strong>How Frequently Does Snow Fall in Minnesota?</strong></p>

<p>While winter brings cold temperatures to Minnesota, snowfall days are relatively limited. On average, Minneapolis experiences around 15 snow days each year, while Rochester sees about 16 days. Duluth, known for its more intense winter weather, averages around 25 days of snow annually.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://krocnews.com/ixp/715/p/new-forecast-minnesota-snow/"><em>KROC News,</em></a> Minnesota's weather forecast for Thursday, November 21, predicts scattered snow showers in Rochester with highs of 37 fahrenheit, lows of 29 fahrenheit, and up to an inch of snow. Minneapolis expects a mix of rain and snow with a high of 43 fahrenheit and a low of 34 fahrenheit. In Duluth, rain and snow chances increase to 60% by evening, with similar mixed conditions continuing Friday and Saturday, reaching highs near 39 fahrenheit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

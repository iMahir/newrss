       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, a Hindu priest and a religious minority leader in Bangladesh, was arrested in Dhaka amid tensions over minority rights in the country that has seen widespread political violence since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The arrest follows protests led by the Hindu community in the city of Rangpur, located nearly 300 km north of Dhaka, demanding stronger legal protections and a ministry dedicated to minority affairs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I just received the shocking news that Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, a Hindu monk &amp; the face and leader of Bangladeshi minorities in these difficult times, has been arrested by the Dhaka police and taken to an undisclosed location. Kind attention," wrote&nbsp;Radharamn Das, ISKCON spokesperson, tagging External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and the Indian High Commission in Dhaka.</p>

<p>While the Bangladeshi authorities have not issued an official statement, reports suggest Brahmachari was detained at Dhaka airport earlier this week. His arrest comes after a sedition case was filed against him earlier this month, allegedly for his outspoken stance against violence targeting Hindus.</p>

<p>Hindus comprise approximately 8 per cent of Bangladesh's 170 million people. Since the ouster of former PM Sheikh Hasina, the new military-backed interim government led by Mohammed Yunus has faced criticism for failing to curb a spike in violence against minorities.</p>

<p>In recent months, Hindu businesses, homes, and temples have been vandalised, with the unrest worsening since Sheikh Hasina's departure. &nbsp;Earlier this month, sedition charges were filed against 19 people who participated in a minority rights rally in Chittagong.&nbsp;</p>

<p>BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari slammed the Yunus government in Bangladesh, adding that Chinmoy Brahmachari is leading a "fight for survival" of Hindu minorities.</p>

<p>"Renowned firebrand Hindu Leader; Shri Chinmoy Krishna Das Prabhu has been abducted by the Detective Branch at Dhaka Airport in Bangladesh. He is leading the fight for the survival &amp; dignity of the Hindu Minorities of Bangladesh. The Bangladeshi Sanatani Community fear that Md Yunus's 'Radical' Regime may stoop to any level, even eliminate 'perceived threats' to its authority. I urge&nbsp;<br />
@DrSJaishankar &nbsp;Ji to kindly take note of the matter and take urgent steps," Mr Adhikari posted on X.</p>

<p>Kanchan Gupta, senior advisor to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, described the arrest as "a targeted move to stifle voices of protest."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Hindu leader and ISKCON monk Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari is reported arrested in Dhaka by Yunus Regime Police. Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari was charged with sedition after he led a massive rally of Hindus protesting targeted hate attacks and demanding protection from Islamists. Tallest leader of the Hindu community, Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari is believed to have been taken to Detective Branch of Yunus Regime," Mr Gupta wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The interim regime in Bangladesh had announced plans to unveil an election roadmap, promising reforms in the electoral system. However, critics remain sceptical of its commitment to democracy, especially as reports of targeted attacks against minorities continue to emerge.</p>

<p>During a speech, Mohammed Yunus pointed to the government's security measures during Durga Puja, celebrated at over 32,000 venues nationwide, as evidence of its commitment to protecting minorities. Yet, activists argue these measures are inadequate.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One woman was killed by a partner or relative every 10 minutes worldwide in 2023, the United Nations warned Monday, stressing that femicides remained at "alarmingly high levels".</p>

<p>Almost 85,000 women and girls were murdered by people last year, according to a joint report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the UN Women agency published Monday.</p>

<p>About 60 percent - or more than 51,000 women and girls - died at the hands of their partner or relative, the report found.</p>

<p>This equates to 140 women killed per day or one every 10 minutes by those closest to them.</p>

<p>"The home remains the most dangerous place for women and girls in terms of the risk of lethal victimisation," the report said.</p>

<p>While men were four times more likely than women to fall victim to homicide - forming 80 percent of all murder victims last year - they more often than not died at the hands of a stranger.</p>

<p>Africa had the most severe toll with 21,700 women killed by someone close to them in 2023.</p>

<p>The lowest femicide rates were in Europe (2,300 murders in absolute numbers) and Asia.</p>

<p>Despite efforts in some countries to prevent femicides, they remain "at alarmingly high levels" due to deep-rooted gender inequality and damaging stereotypes.</p>

<p>"We must confront and dismantle the gender biases, power imbalances, and harmful norms that perpetuate violence against women," UNODC Executive Director Ghada Waly said in a statement accompanying the report.</p>

<p>Data from countries including France indicated that femicides are often the "culmination" of repeated episodes of violence and can be prevented by measures such as restraining orders.</p>

<p>UN Women Executive Director Sima Bahous said robust legislation, greater government accountability, and increased funding for women's rights organisations and institutional bodies are needed to stem violence against women.</p>

<p>Furthermore, improved data collection from different national sources - including media reports - and a "zero-tolerance culture" are essential in tackling femicides, she said.</p>

<p>The report is based on available data from 107 countries or territories, and information the UNODC has collected from responses submitted by member states.</p>

<p>Its release coincides with the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Monday social media firms would be required to destroy personal data used to verify ages of users, as part of what the government says is a world-leading ban on under-16s using the services.</p>

<p>Australia plans to trial an age-verification system that may include biometrics or government identification to enforce a social media age cut-off, some of the toughest controls imposed by any country to date.</p>

<p>"There will be very strong and strict privacy requirements to protect people's personal information, including an obligation to destroy information provided once age has been verified," Albanese told parliament on Monday.</p>

<p>The laws would impact Meta Platforms' Instagram and Facebook, Bytedance's TikTok and Elon Musk's X and Snapchat.</p>

<p>They have been criticised by figures including Musk, who said on Friday the legislation was a backdoor attempt to control access to the internet for all Australians.</p>

<p>The proposals are the highest age limit set by any country, and would have no exemption for parental consent and no exemption for pre-existing accounts. Platforms face fines of up to $32 million for failing to comply with the legislation.</p>

<p>The government has said it aims to pass the bill into law by the end of the parliamentary year on Thursday, fast-tracking it through the upper and lower houses of parliament.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Malaysian court ordered the government on Monday to return rainbow-coloured watches and accessories made by Swatch Group that were seized last year for designs celebrating LGBTQ rights, a prosecutor told Reuters.</p>

<p>Homosexuality is illegal in Muslim-majority Malaysia, and rights groups have warned of growing intolerance toward the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) community in the Southeast Asian country.</p>

<p>In May 2023, Malaysia confiscated 172 rainbow-coloured watches from the Swiss watchmaker's 'Pride collection' from 16 outlets due to the presence of the acronym 'LGBTQ' on the timepieces.</p>

<p>The government later prohibited any LGBTQ references on Swatch watches, boxes, wrappers, accessories or other items, saying such products may harm morality and public interest.</p>

<p>Swatch Group filed a lawsuit challenging the seizure, saying it was illegal and damaged its reputation.</p>

<p>On Monday, government prosecutor Mohammad Sallehuddin Md Ali said the Kuala Lumpur High Court had ruled the watches must be returned to Swatch Group within 14 days.</p>

<p>"No order (was given) as to costs," he said in a brief text message to Reuters.</p>

<p>A lawyer for Swatch Group declined to comment on the decision.</p>

<p>Home Minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail said the government respected the court's decision and would wait for the full judgement to be released before deciding whether to challenge the verdict.</p>

<p>The watches are unlikely to be sold in Malaysia due to the government's prohibition order.</p>

<p>In July 2023, the government halted a music festival in Kuala Lumpur after the frontman of British pop rock band The 1975 kissed a male bandmate onstage.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who came into power two years ago on a progressive campaign, has said LGBTQ rights will not be recognised by his administration.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The 2024 FIDE World Chess Championship kicked off today at the Equarius Hotel in Singapore. The 18-year-old Indian chess prodigy, Grandmaster D Gukesh, is set to face off against the reigning world champion, Ding Liren of China.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">​​​​​​After a decade-long wait, India is once again on the brink of chess history. Gukesh, a young Indian Grandmaster, is the first Indian, besides the legendary Viswanathan Anand, to compete for the prestigious World Chess Championship title.&nbsp;Anand, a five-time world champion, last contested for the title in 2014, losing to Magnus Carlsen. Carlsen, a dominant force in chess for nearly a decade, recently decided to step down from the championship cycle, opening the door for new challengers.&nbsp;Gukesh's participation in the World Championship marks a significant moment for Indian chess, as the country continues to produce world-class talent.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The 2024 FIDE World Chess Championship offers a lucrative prize pool of $2.5 million (approximately Rs 20.8 crore). Each victory in a classical game is rewarded with $200,000 (around Rs 1.67 crore). However, if the match progresses to tiebreaks, the stakes rise significantly. The eventual champion will claim a substantial $1.3 million (Rs 10.83 crore), while the runner-up will receive $1.2 million (Rs 10.1 crore).</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">At just 18 years old, Indian Grandmaster Gukesh Dommaraju has made history by qualifying for the 2024 FIDE World Chess Championship. This remarkable achievement makes him the youngest player ever to compete for the prestigious title. Gukesh's exceptional talent was evident early on. With unwavering support from his father, he became the second-youngest Grandmaster in history at 12 years, 7 months, and 17 days. His recent success in the 2024 FIDE Candidates Tournament, where he defeated top players like Alireza Firouzja and Hikaru Nakamura, further solidified his position as a rising star in the chess world. A victory over the reigning World Champion, Ding Liren, would make Gukesh the youngest Classical World Champion in history.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Ding Liren's victory over Ian Nepomniachtchi in the 2023 FIDE World Chess Championship was a historic moment, making him the first Chinese player to claim the coveted title. This achievement cemented his position as one of the world's top chess players. Liren has consistently ranked among the world's elite. He achieved a significant milestone in 2018 by breaking the 2800 Elo rating barrier. Additionally, he set a remarkable record by winning 100 consecutive classical chess games between 2017 and 2018. Currently, he holds the 23rd position in the FIDE world rankings.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Google is celebrating the World Chess Championship final between China's Ding Liren (the reigning champion) and India's D Gukesh with an animated doodle. Two chess pieces are swapped in the doodle, which has the colours yellow, red, blue and white.&nbsp; The alphabet G in Google is crowned the king while others have been given the shapes of different pieces of the game. This year's tournament marks the first time in 138 years that two Asian players are pitted against each other in the marquee clash, which is offering a prize of $2.5 million.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acclaimed Indian author Amitav Ghosh has won the coveted Dutch Erasmus Prize for his writings on climate change and its impact on humanity, especially on the Indian subcontinent.</p>

<p>Ghosh "has delved deeply into the question of how to do justice to this existential threat that defies our imagination," the prize committee said in a statement.</p>

<p>The Erasmus Prize, due to be presented by Dutch King Willem-Alexander on Tuesday, is awarded for an "exceptional contribution to the humanities, the social sciences or the arts, in Europe and beyond."</p>

<p>The winner receives a cash prize of 150,000 euros ($157,000).</p>

<p>The Praemium Erasmianum Foundation, which awards the prize, noted that Ghosh had described how the effects of climate change have been "inextricably linked" to human destiny on the Indian subcontinent.</p>

<p>It cited his work "The Hungry Tide", which portrayed how rising sea levels were devastating life in the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest.</p>

<p>The 68-year-old's work is also political, with "The Great Derangement" setting climate change in the context of war and trade.</p>

<p>"Through understanding and imagination he creates space for hope, a prerequisite for change," said the prize committee.</p>

<p>Born in Kolkata, Ghosh has won several literary prizes, including the 2018 Jnanpith Award, India's top award.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan has reported three new poliovirus cases from Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces taking the total number of infections this year to 55, according to a media report on Monday.</p>

<p>The Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health has confirmed the three wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases, The Dawn newspaper reported.</p>

<p>The victims were two girls aged eight and 20 months and a five-month-old boy. The new cases were reported from Dera Ismail Khan, Zhob and Jaffarabad districts, a lab official was quoted as saying. All three districts have already reported a case of poliovirus this year.</p>

<p>Dera Ismail Khan, which has now reported six polio cases this year, has been one of the seven polio-endemic districts in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Routine immunisation programmes have faced significant challenges in accessing all vulnerable children in the district during the last three years, the newspaper said.</p>

<p>Similar challenges are prevalent in Balochistan, where Zhob and Jaffarabad districts have reported three and two cases respectively, in 2024. Of the 55 cases reported so far, 26 have been reported from Balochistan, 14 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 13 from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Islamabad.</p>

<p>The new cases were reported days after a Global Polio Eradication Initiative delegation met with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to discuss "strategies to combat the poliovirus outbreak and to address emerging challenges".</p>

<p>There is no cure for polio. Only multiple doses of the oral polio vaccine and completion of the routine vaccination schedule for all children under the age of five can keep them protected.</p>

<p>Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries in the world where polio remains endemic, according to the World Health Organisation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">Ahead of Sunday's first election round, opinion surveys had shown 62-year-old Mr Georgescu, an independent candidate, polling in single digits. But in recent days, his popularity surged after his TikTok campaign calling for an end to aid for Ukraine went viral.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Mr Georgescu was a member of the hard-right opposition Alliance for Uniting Romanians (AUR), which touted him as their choice for prime minister.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">He left AUR in 2022 after senior party members said his pro-Russian and anti-NATO stance damaged the party's image. Mr Georgescu has sounded a sceptical note on Romania's North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) membership.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">In a 2021 interview, Mr Georgescu called NATO's ballistic missile defence shield in Romania's Deveselu a "shame of diplomacy" and said the alliance will not protect any of its members should they be attacked by Russia.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">He has also termed Ion Antonescu and Corneliu Zelea Codreanu as Romania's national heroes. Antonescu was Romania's de facto World War Two leader, who was sentenced to death for his part in Romania's Holocaust. Codreanu was the pre-World War Two leader of the Iron Guard- one of Europe's most violent anti-Semitic movements.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">In another public address, Mr Georgescu said Romania wasn't ready to handle anything diplomatically and strategically and that its best chance lay with "Russian wisdom." However, he has refused to explicitly say whether he supports Russia.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Russia on Monday said it did not know much about Mr Georgescu, who is in pole position to become the EU member's next president. "I can't say that we are very familiar with the worldview of this candidate, as far it concerns relations with our country," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">In an unexpected outcome that threatens Romania's staunchly pro-Ukraine stance, far-right Mr Georgescu will likely face centre-right contender Elena Lasconi in a December 8 presidential run-off vote.&nbsp;Sunday's results are one of the biggest surprises in Romanian post-communist elections, with the leaders of the two largest parties, the leftist Social Democrats and centre-right Liberals - which are in a coalition government - eliminated in the first round.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Outgoing two-term president Klaus Iohannis, 65, had cemented Romania's strong pro-Western stance but was accused of not doing enough to fight corruption.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Romania shares a 650-km (400-mile) border with Ukraine and since Russia attacked Kyiv in 2022, it has enabled the export of millions of tons of grain through its Black Sea port of Constanta and provided military aid, including the donation of a Patriot air defence battery.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The supreme leader of Iran, which backs the Hamas and Hezbollah militants fighting Israel in Gaza and Lebanon, said on Monday that death sentences should be issued for Israeli leaders, not arrest warrants.</p>

<p>Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was commenting on a decision by the International Criminal Court to issue arrest warrants on Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defence chief and a Hamas leader, Ibrahim Al-Masri.</p>

<p>"They issued an arrest warrant, that's not enough... Death sentence must be issued for these criminal leaders", Khamenei said, referring to the Israeli leaders.</p>

<p>In their decision, the ICC judges said there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant were criminally responsible for acts including murder, persecution and starvation as a weapon of war as part of a "widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Gaza".</p>

<p>The decision was met with outrage in Israel, which called it shameful and absurd. Gaza residents expressed hope it would help end the violence and bring those responsible for war crimes to justice.</p>

<p>Israel has rejected the jurisdiction of the Hague-based court and denies war crimes in Gaza.</p>

<p>The warrant for a Hamas leader, Ibrahim Al-Masri, lists charges of mass killings during the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on Israel that triggered the war on the long-blockaded Palestinian enclave, and also charges of rape and the taking of hostages.</p>

<p>Israel has said it killed Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, in an airstrike in July but Hamas has neither confirmed nor denied this.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iraq's population has risen to 45.4 million, according to preliminary results from a national census, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said on Monday.</p>

<p>The census, conducted on November 20, was Iraq's first nationwide survey in more than three decades, marking a crucial step for future planning and development.</p>

<p>Prior to the census, the planning ministry estimated the population at 43 million.</p>

<p>The last census, conducted in 1997, did not include the Iraqi Kurdistan region, which has been under Kurdish administration since the 1991 Gulf War.</p>

<p>It counted 19 million Iraqis and officials estimated there were another 3 million in the Kurdish north, according to official statistics.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bestselling British-American writer Barbara Taylor Bradford, whose first novel "A Woman of Substance" turned her into an overnight success, has died aged 91, a spokeswoman said on Monday.</p>

<p>Taylor Bradford, who wrote 40 novels and notched up 91 million book sales worldwide during her career, died peacefully at her home on Sunday following a short illness.</p>

<p>She "was surrounded by loved ones to the very end", the spokeswoman said, adding that a private funeral would be held in New York.</p>

<p>"A Woman of Substance" tells the story of servant Emma Harte who overcomes a humble start in Taylor Bradford's native Yorkshire in northern England to head of a business empire, navigating personal tragedy along the way.</p>

<p>Many of her subsequent novels were also set in Yorkshire and followed a similar theme of great success against the odds, powered by grit and hard work.</p>

<p>Her most recent novel "The Wonder of it All" was published last year.</p>

<p>Born in Leeds in northern England in May 1933, Taylor Bradford began her working life as a typist for her local newspaper The Yorkshire Evening Post before becoming a reporter.</p>

<p>She moved to London aged 20 where she continued working as a journalist while dipping her toe into the world of fiction.</p>

<p>She started and abandoned several novels before striking gold with "A Woman of Substance", which was an instant success when it was published in 1979.</p>

<h2><strong>POWERHOUSE</strong></h2>

<p>The novel was turned into a double Emmy-nominated miniseries in 1985 and starred Liam Neeson with British actress Jenny Seagrove in the role of Emma Harte.</p>

<p>Seagrove paid tribute to a "dear friend" and "powerhouse of glamour and warmth".</p>

<p>"Success never diluted her warmth and humour or her ability to relate to everyone she met, whether a cleaner or a princess. She never, ever forgot that she was just a girl from Yorkshire that worked hard and made good," she said.</p>

<p>Charlie Redmayne, chief executive of publisher HarperCollins, described Taylor Bradford as a "truly exceptional writer".</p>

<p>"'A Woman Of Substance' changed the lives of so many who read it -– and still does to this day," he said.</p>

<p>"She was a natural storyteller, deeply proud of her Yorkshire roots. For 45 years, she was a huge part of our company and a great, great friend –- we will miss her so much," he added.</p>

<p>Taylor Bradford had lived in the United States since 1964 following her marriage a the previous year to American film producer Robert Bradford.</p>

<p>The couple were married for 55 years until his death in 2019.</p>

<p>Taylor Bradford's spokeswoman said she would be buried alongside her late husband at New York's Westchester Hills Cemetery.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A three-year-old female golden tiger at a zoo in Thailand is making waves on the internet for its cuteness. The photo of the tigress, named Ava, was shared by Chiang Mai Night Safari in northern Thailand on its <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.facebook.com/chiangmainightsafarifanclub/posts/981401810694977?__cft__[0]=AZUiyd9cm0EmS7BFTFyCULWFnkvsc831V8ORCGYxZVB1vczM0ocui49g3nxZ6NKvb1N9FcbLKTPM8O2J-IM5ujp5XgbW-W2-df5LhRclqhlE-_1owWUsP_an4TXy9njMBLyNlATdF-q104ApbRqs8aU9ykdVzzUSe8BZFTmSjkcx9tWUQUvzE5VTSX0zBB67t9c&amp;__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R" rel="noindex,nofollow">Facebook page</a> on November 19, and it amassed thousands of likes and shares within days. Ava's photo was released three weeks after the online debut of its sister Luna. Both were born on February 16, 2021. The animals are giving tough fight to baby pygmy hippo Moo Deng.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3287670/goofy-golden-tiger-thai-zoo-captures-hearts-emerging-next-star-after-hippo-moo-deng"><em>South China Morning Post</em></a> (<em>SCMP</em>) said in a report that the parents of Ava and Luna were brought to the safari park from the Czech Republic and South Africa in July 2015.</p>

<p>Golden tigers are a rare variant of the Bengal tiger characterised by a recessive colour-changing gene.</p>

<p>The <em>SCMP</em> report said that only 30 golden tigers exist in captivity in the world, fewer than white tigers that number 200.</p>

<p>Zoo authorities describe Ava is playful and sociable and is friendly towards children, in stark contrast with its predator image.</p>

<p>The photos have attracted a lot of comments on social media.</p>

<p>"Her face is so sweet," one user posted on Facebook. "She looks so clean, as if she takes 10 baths a day," commented another.</p>

<p>"First Moo Deng, now Ava? Thailand is winning the cutest animals award," a third user said.</p>

<p>The Nation Thailand reported that the growing popularity of these tigers has doubled the number of visitors eager to witness their charm first-hand.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea is expanding a key weapons manufacturing complex that assembles a type of short-range missile used by Russia in Ukraine, researchers at a US-based think tank have concluded, based on satellite images.</p>

<p>The facility, known as the February 11 plant, is part of the Ryongsong Machine Complex in Hamhung, North Korea's second-largest city, on the country's east coast.</p>

<p>Sam Lair, a research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS), located at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, said the plant was the only one known to produce the Hwasong-11 class of solid-fuel ballistic missiles.</p>

<p>Ukrainian officials say these munitions - known as the KN-23 in the West - have been used by Russian forces in their assault on Ukraine.</p>

<p>The expansion of the complex has not been previously reported.</p>

<p>Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied that North Korea has transferred weapons for Russia to use against Ukraine, which it invaded in February 2022. Russia and North Korea signed a mutual defense treaty at a summit in June and have pledged to boost their military ties.</p>

<p>North Korea's mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment for this story.</p>

<p>The satellite images, taken in early October by the commercial satellite firm Planet Labs, show what appears to be an additional assembly building under construction as well as a new housing facility, likely intended for workers, according to the analysis by researchers at CNS.</p>

<p>It also appears that Pyongyang is improving the entrances for some of the underground facilities at the complex.</p>

<p>A disused bridge crane that was in front of a tunnel entrance, blocking easy access, was removed, suggesting they might be placing an emphasis on that part of the facility, Lair said.</p>

<p>"We see this as a suggestion that they're massively increasing, or they're trying to significantly increase, the throughput of this factory," Lair said.</p>

<p>The new assembly building is about 60 to 70 percent the size of the previous building used to assemble missiles.</p>

<p>In 2023, state media published images, which Reuters has reviewed, showing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un walking through new buildings at the complex in Hamhung, where workers were assembling tail kits and nose cones for what appeared to be the KN-23, according to analysts.</p>

<p>In the past, publicly released videos from North Korean state media show that the complex has produced everything from tank wheels to the casings for rocket motors, Lair said.</p>

<p><strong>Low-flying missiles</strong></p>

<p>The KN-23 was first tested in May 2019, and is designed to evade missile defenses by flying on a lower, "depressed" trajectory, experts have told Reuters, making them potentially useful for Russia as it seeks ways to penetrate Ukraine's air defenses.</p>

<p>Russia has fired thousands of missiles since the invasion. Leaning on North Korea for additional supplies could ease the strain on its own production facilities, Lair said.</p>

<p>North Korea's state news agency KCNA has reported that construction is underway at the Ryongsong Machine Complex.</p>

<p>This month, KCNA said the facility "is pushing ahead with the projects for attaining the goal for modernization planned for this year." The work includes rebuilding production facilities as well as assembling and installing equipment at machine workshops and a steel casting workshop, it said.</p>

<p>Researchers at SI Analytics, a South Korean satellite imagery firm that uses AI technology to scour images, also confirmed the new construction at the February 11 plant, saying in a report on Monday that some of the construction near the loading area would likely be used to conceal the future operations of the factory from satellites.</p>

<p>"Considering the presence of numerous construction materials, vehicles, and open-top freight cars loaded with materials around the site, the construction appears to be progressing rapidly," the firm said. The report said the facility was used to produce ballistic missiles, without naming the KN-23.</p>

<p>Michael Duitsman, also a research associate at CNS, said it was possible that the new construction revealed in the satellite images could be a storage facility, but he believed it was more likely a new assembly building.</p>

<p>North Korean missiles account for a fraction of Russia's strikes during its war on Ukraine, but their alleged use has caused alarm in Seoul and Washington because it suggests an end of nearly two-decade consensus among UN Security Council permanent members on preventing Pyongyang from expanding its ballistic missile programs.</p>

<p>SI Analytics said on Monday it had also identified new construction at the nearby February 8 Vinalon Complex, which is believed to produce fuel for ballistic missiles. The construction may be aimed at boosting production of solid propellants or UDMH, an important liquid rocket engine fuel, the report said.</p>

<p>Joseph Dempsey, a military analyst with London's International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that North Korea's expansion of short-range ballistic missile facilities would likely be motivated mainly by a desire to boost the country's own arsenal.</p>

<p>He said it was unclear to what extent Pyongyang may have expanded production capacity to meet the demands of its new cooperation with Moscow.</p>

<p>More than 10,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to the Russian region of Kursk, where Ukraine launched a major cross-border incursion in August, according to Washington, Kyiv and Seoul.</p>

<p>The troops will fight as part of Russia's airborne unit and marines, with some already participating in battles in the Ukraine war, a South Korean lawmaker who sits on the parliamentary intelligence committee said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Russia has not denied the involvement of North Korean troops in the war, which it has been waging in Ukraine since launching a full-scale invasion in February 2022.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Philippines justice department on Monday labelled Vice President Sara Duterte the "mastermind" of a plot to assassinate the country's president, giving her five days to respond to a subpoena.</p>

<p>Duterte is being asked to explain herself in the wake of a blistering weekend press conference where she said she had instructed that President Ferdinand Marcos be killed should an alleged plot to kill her succeed.</p>

<p>"The government is taking action to protect our duly elected president," Justice Undersecretary Jesse Andres said at a Monday press briefing.</p>

<p>"The premeditated plot to assassinate the president as declared by the self-confessed mastermind will now face legal consequences."</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters an hour later, Duterte said she planned to respond to the subpoena.</p>

<p>"I will gladly answer the questions they want to ask, but they must answer my questions as well," she said.</p>

<p>"We'll just talk there when I get the subpoena."</p>

<p>In his first public comments on the matter, Marcos earlier in the day vowed to "fight back" in the face of a threat he called "disturbing".</p>

<p>The Marcos-Duterte alliance that swept to power in 2022 has collapsed spectacularly in the lead-up to next year's mid-term elections, with both sides trading allegations of drug addiction.</p>

<p>Duterte, who is facing potential impeachment hearings, told reporters early Saturday that she herself was the subject of an assassination plot and had instructed that Marcos be killed should it succeed.</p>

<p>In the expletive-laced press conference, Duterte also singled out first lady Liza Araneta-Marcos and presidential cousin Martin Romualdez as potential targets.</p>

<p>"I said, if I die, don't stop until you have killed them," she claimed to have told a security team member regarding the trio.</p>

<p>Hours later, the presidential palace said it was treating the comments as an "active threat".</p>

<p>"That sort of criminal attempt must not go unchallenged," Marcos said Monday. "As a democratic country, we need to uphold the law."</p>

<p>"The vice president is not immune from suit. She can be the subject of any criminal or administrative case," Andres told reporters, adding the subpoena was in the process of being served.</p>

<p>He added that a manhunt was underway for the "assassin" allegedly engaged by Duterte.</p>

<p><strong>Alliance unravelled</strong></p>

<p>Duterte, daughter of former president Rodrigo Duterte, was Marcos' running mate in the 2022 presidential election that saw their ticket win in a landslide.</p>

<p>She remains his constitutional successor should he be unable to finish his six-year term.</p>

<p>But she is currently facing an investigation in the House of Representatives, led by Romualdez.</p>

<p>Both Romualdez and Duterte are widely expected to run for president in 2028.</p>

<p>Duterte's Saturday press briefing came shortly after House officials threatened to transfer her chief of staff Zuleika Lopez -- being held for contempt -- from the lower chamber's detention centre to a correctional facility.</p>

<p>Lopez has been detained since Wednesday, when she was cited for allegedly interfering in a probe into Duterte's finances.</p>

<p>Duterte stepped down from her cabinet post of education secretary in June as relations between the two families reached breaking point.</p>

<p>Months earlier, her father had accused Marcos of being a "drug addict", with the president the next day claiming his predecessor's health was failing due to long-term use of the powerful opioid fentanyl.</p>

<p>Neither have provided any evidence for their allegations.</p>

<p>In October, Duterte said she felt "used" after teaming with Marcos for the 2022 poll.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The trial in France of a man charged with enlisting dozens of strangers to rape his heavily-sedated wife has shaken French society and must fundamentally change relationships between men and women, a prosecutor said Monday.</p>

<p>"This trial is shaking up our society in our relationship with each other, in the most intimate relationships between human beings," Jean-Francois Mayet told the court in the southern city of Avignon.</p>

<p>The trial is making French society work "to understand our needs, our emotions, our desires and above all to take into account those of others," he said.</p>

<p>What is at stake, he added, "is not a conviction or an acquittal" but "to fundamentally change the relations between men and women," he added.</p>

<p>The prosecution is outlining its demands for the sentencing of the 51 men on trial, including the main accused Dominique Pelicot, the former husband of the victim Gisele Pelicot.</p>

<p>The men, aged between 26 and 74 years, are largely charged with aggravated rape and face up to 20 years of imprisonment if convicted.</p>

<p>"The facts, and the personality of each accused, were taken into account even in our sentencing demands", Mayet added, saying that "justice needs calm and peaceful debates."</p>

<p>He also praised the "courage" and "dignity" of Gisele Pelicot, the victim of some 200 repeated rapes, half of which were attributed to her ex-husband.</p>

<p>Mayet thanked her for allowing hearings to be open to the public and allowing some of the 20,000 or so photos and videos taken without her knowledge by Dominique Pelicot to be shown.</p>

<p>"You were right, madam: the past few weeks have shown the importance of showing this, so that shame changes sides," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>German carmaker Audi has dropped its iconic four rings logo in China, a move that has shocked social media. The logo has been a symbol of the luxury cars since the 1930s, but wasn't a part of a new E Concept electric sportback that was showcased in Shanghai earlier this month. The car just carried 'AUDI' in all caps on the front. This comes at a time when Jaguar's new logo has sparked a buzz on social media, with users criticising the move.</p>

<p>Internet is shocked by Audi's rebranding too - though it has so far only happened in China.</p>

<p>"Very confusing branding choice," commented one user. "Bad move. Everyone knows the Audi logo. This new one is lame," said another.</p>

<p>While explaining the reason behind Audi's move, another user expressed his disappointment by saying, "The Chinesification of foreign premium brands in China continues, one way to survive the bloodbath."</p>

<p>The new AUDI logo is part of a project with Chinese automaker SAIC to co-develop electric vehicles aimed at attracting younger customers in the world's largest auto market.</p>

<p>It marks an effort by both Audi and SAIC to win back market share in China, where legacy local players and foreign automakers have been losing ground to EV- and hybrid-focused rivals.</p>

<p>"The customers (here) are much younger than the rest of the world, 30 and 35 (years old) on average in the premium segment, while the rest of the world is 55," Fermin Soneira, CEO of the project, told news agency Reuters.</p>

<p>"The EV series aims to attract younger drivers who seek high-end technology features such as advanced driver-assistance systems," the CEO further said.</p>

<p>The new EV series uses automotive architecture co-developed with SAIC, and Audi says it will rely more on local suppliers and technologies.</p>

<p>Audi sold fewer than 15,000 EVs in China in the first nine months of 2024, according to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. In comparison, Chinese premium EV brands Nio and Xpeng sold roughly 10 and seven times more, respectively.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least one person died and three others were injured after a cargo plane crashed at Lithuania's Vilnius airport early on Monday. The Boeing 737-400, operated for DHL by the Spanish cargo airline Swiftair, was flying from Germany to Lithuania. While on its final approach for landing around 3:30 am GMT, the plane skidded ia nto house and burst into flames, a spokesperson for Lithuania's National Crisis Management Center said.</p>

<p>"The plane was due to land at Vilnius airport and crashed a few kilometres away," Renatas Pozela, the head of the firefighting and emergency services unit said, adding that one person in the four-member crew died.</p>

<p>Footage from a nearby security camera surfaced on social media, that shows the plane descending for landing before goes out of view behind a building. Moments later, a large explosion can be seen rising in the sky from behind the building, followed by plumes of black smoke.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">NEW: A DHL cargo plane flying from Germany to Lithuania crashed early Monday near the airport of the capital Vilnius killing one person, firefighters said <a href="https://t.co/mBzl6VGhJP">https://t.co/mBzl6VGhJP</a> <a href="https://t.co/jv6MHiS4pY">pic.twitter.com/jv6MHiS4pY</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>According to the Vilnius mayor, Valdas Benkunskas, the plane narrowly missed directly hitting the house and instead crashed into the nearby courtyard. Police have evacuated 12 people from the house hit that caught fire after the crash.</p>

<p>The three crew members – one German, one Lithuanian national, and one Spanish – remain in the hospital, CNN reported quoting&nbsp;the Lithuanian Fire and Rescue Department. There was no report of any casualty or anyone being hurt on the ground.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The police and prosecutors are reportedly investigating the incident but there is nothing to suggest an explosion preceded the crash. Lithuania's Counter-intelligence chief Darius Jauniskis, while talking to media, said the possibility of a terrorism angle in the crash has not been negated</p>

<p>"We cannot reject the possibility of terrorism...But at the moment we can't make attributions or point fingers, because we don't have such information," Mr Jauniskis said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lithuanian rescue services said the plane hit the ground, split into pieces and slid over 100 metres (110 yards) before crashing into the building. Firefighters poured water onto the smoking building some 1.3 km (0.8 mile) north of the airport runway and nearby streets were cordoned off.</p>

<p>DHL official Ausra Rutkauskien confirmed the plane belonged to the company. The flight departed from Leipzig in Germany at 2:08 am GMT, Flightradar24 said on X.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The 26-year-old was sentenced to a year in prison, suspended for two years, under the Military Service Act.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A South Korean man was sentenced to one year in jail for deliberately binge-eating to avoid mandatory military service. Ahead of his military physical exam, the 26-year-old, whose name has not been disclosed,&nbsp;intentionally gained significant weight, reaching over 102 kg (225 lbs), to be categorised as unfit for combat roles and assigned to a non-combat government position, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://news.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20241124050010">Korean Herald</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The man reportedly consumed large amounts of food, including instant noodles, pizza, and fried chicken, to rapidly gain weight. He allegedly gained 24 kg (52.8 lbs) in just three months, taking his body mass index (BMI) to 37.8, which is considered obese. The man planned to use his weight gain as a reason to be exempt from military service, which is mandatory for able-bodied Korean men between the ages of 18 and 35.</p>

<p>However, his scheme was discovered, and he was subsequently charged with attempting to evade military service.&nbsp;While the maximum penalty for draft evasion is three years, his sentence was reduced due to his lack of prior offences and a promise to serve faithfully. He&nbsp;received a one-year suspended sentence, while his friend, who helped him double his daily food intake, got six months in jail.</p>

<p>The man's friend testified in court that he had jokingly suggested the weight gain plan, never expecting his friend to take it seriously and actually go through with it.</p>

<p>All able-bodied men in South Korea over 18 must serve in the army for at least 18 months, as per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyve5l9j3go"><em>BBC</em>.&nbsp;</a>The&nbsp;policy is rooted in the country's ongoing tensions with North Korea. This universal conscription ensures a steady supply of personnel for the armed forces, which are vital for national defence. While exemptions exist for individuals with health issues or outstanding achievements in fields like sports or arts, avoiding service through deliberate means is heavily penalised.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a similar incident in 2018, a group of South Korean college graduates intentionally gained significant weight through excessive eating to avoid mandatory military service, essentially trying to classify themselves as too obese to serve in combat roles.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Mohammed bin Salman's rise to power had been marked by extravagant spending, bold cultural reforms and a devastating war in Yemen.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2020, Justin Scheck and I published Blood and Oil: Mohammed bin Salman's Brutal Quest for Global Power (Hachette). This Next Chapter looks at why the last four years of the crown prince's rule have been a marked departure from his first five, and what that means for his and Saudi Arabia's future. The image was striking: US President Joe Biden greeting Mohammed bin Salman with a fist bump at the entrance of Jeddah's Al Salam Royal Palace. It was July 2022 and just two years earlier, Biden had vowed to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah” over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But with oil prices surging, he could no longer afford having MBS as an enemy.</p>

<p>For the Crown Prince, the diplomatic reset couldn't have come at a better time. The war in Ukraine — which pushed up the price of oil — had given him the leverage he needed to position Saudi Arabia at the center of a rapidly shifting world order, and to present himself as both globally engaged and strategically patient. When Biden asked MBS to ease oil prices, he declined. American diplomats were shocked, but MBS needed oil revenues to keep flowing.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/a-look-at-saudi-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salmans-rise-to-power-6384434">MBS's rise to power</a> had been marked by extravagant spending, bold cultural reforms and a devastating war in Yemen. The cocksure young prince had shaken Saudi Arabia to its foundations. But the 2022 meeting with Biden showed that MBS, while no less ambitious, was increasingly attuned to his place on the world stage. Reforms that had once generated headlines — women driving, genders mixing in public, entertainment events — have become the new normal. New industries are taking root across the country and a brand new megacity, NEOM, is under construction. MBS has played the role of peacemaker in the Middle East and even forged a closer relationship with Turkey's Tayyip Erdoğan, whose intelligence services leaked a detailed account of the Khashoggi murder.</p>

<p>This older, evolved MBS may be further emboldened by the looming change in Washington. During Donald Trump's first term, the crown prince maintained close ties to the White House. With Trump's return, MBS's standing in the international arena will surely be solidified. His cultivation of Trump and his inner circle, once seen as a risky bet on an unconventional president, has proven prescient.</p>

<p>To understand how MBS has developed his style of leadership, it's worth considering both the aftermath of Khashoggi's murder as well as the social and economic changes MBS is bringing to Saudi Arabia through his 2030 Vision.</p>

<p>MBS took “full responsibility” for the 2018 killing inside the Saudi consulate Istanbul, although he also denied ordering it. The gruesome details that emerged gave him little choice but to pivot inward and focus on creating a new kind of Saudi Arabia. For that, MBS needed money. He took the controversial view that the country's future depends in large part on monetizing its oil today before demand begins to peter out. The 2019 IPO of Saudi Aramco — considered the crown jewel of the country's energy industry — was one way to achieve this goal. Although the share sale fell short of an initial $2 trillion valuation target, the process still raised $25.6 billion, making it the largest IPO in history at the time.</p>

<p>MBS has been using some of that money to rebrand Saudi Arabia as a major destination for international travelers. New hotels are opening and being constructed all along the coast in the hopes that millions of tourists can be diverted from Southeast Asia and elsewhere in the Gulf to Saudi Arabia. From Formula 1 races in Jeddah to the MDLBeast Soundstorm music festival attracting hundreds of thousands of attendees, Saudi Arabia is rebranding itself as a major destination. The rebuild also extends to a giant 400-meter cubic structure under construction in Riyadh that will be one of the world's largest buildings, including 100,000 residential units, 9,000 hotel rooms, 80 entertainment and cultural venues and 1.4 million square feet of office space.</p>

<p>For many Saudis, especially the youth who make up 70% of the population, these changes represent unprecedented opportunities. The burgeoning entertainment and tourism sectors are creating thousands of jobs, and young Saudis are embracing new freedoms in music, art and social interactions. The ancient city of Al-Ula, with its UNESCO World Heritage site Hegra, has become a centerpiece of Saudi Arabia's tourism push. The Winter at Tantora festival, launched in 2018, brings international artists and visitors to the region, showcasing Saudi Arabia's pre-Islamic history and natural beauty. In 2022, the kingdom introduced a new visa system, making it easier for tourists from 49 countries to visit.</p>

<p>NEOM, the $500 billion megacity project announced to skepticism in 2017, is taking shape because of the sheer willpower of MBS alone. This was not a project the market asked for, but in his eyes it is a crucial development for the future of the country. Nestled in the northwestern corner of the country, a largely undeveloped region near Jordan, Egypt and Israel, MBS is betting that by conjuring a huge city of the future, Saudi Arabia will ensure its relevance for decades to come.</p>

<p>With steel shipments coming from around the globe, construction on “The Line,” a 170 kilometer-long linear city within the NEOM project, is underway. The design embodies MBS's approach to development. The project seems impossible, perhaps unfeasible, yet it is happening nonetheless. There have been setbacks, delays and budget cuts. Some targets have been significantly pared back. The CEO of NEOM was also replaced earlier this month. But this incredibly ambitious project keeps moving ahead nonetheless.</p>

<p>The emerging challenge is finding enough cash to complete so many mega projects and make Saudi Arabia's economy sustainable. The country is on a cost-cutting and efficiency mission that includes paying some big vendors late to preserve cash. No matter how fast Saudi Arabia monetizes its oil, it also needs others to believe in the story and invest, too. That isn't happening fast enough and remains an existential risk to the MBS project over the next six years. MBS is betting a lot on uncertainty: If he builds it, will anyone come?</p>

<p><strong>Strategic Thinking</strong></p>

<p>At the center of all the biggest initiatives is the country's sovereign Public Investment Fund, which became one of the world's most aggressive financial players under MBS's direction. By 2022, its assets under management had grown to more than $600 billion, with plans to reach $2 trillion by 2030. The PIF's investments range from Silicon Valley startups to Premier League football clubs. In 2021, it acquired the football team Newcastle United. The 2022 launch of LIV Golf, a PIF-backed challenger to the established PGA Tour, epitomized the PIF's standard approach: big, bold and unafraid to ruffle feathers in pursuit of Saudi interests.</p>

<p>While critics labeled these investments as “sportswashing” — using sports to improve Saudi's international image and distract from ongoing human rights concerns — MBS sees them as part of a broader strategy. The 2034 FIFA World Cup bid, jointly submitted with Egypt, and the hosting of the 2030 World Expo aren't just about image rehabilitation; they are calculated moves to position Saudi Arabia as a global entertainment and sports hub.</p>

<p>Another powerful symbol of Saudi's financial clout is the annual Future Investment Initiative (FII) forum, dubbed “Davos in the Desert.” Many Western organizations initially boycotted the conference following the Khashoggi killing. But in October 2024, the forum drew its largest crowd ever, with global CEOs, tech leaders and politicians coming in the hopes of persuading PIF and MBS's advisers to give them access to its once-in-a-generation spending spree. “We are very, very excited and happy with what we have achieved in the Saudi Vision 2030, but we are not complacent,” said Mohammed al Jadaan, Saudi's finance minister. “We are doubling down, making sure that we are doing the right thing.”</p>

<p>The FII demonstrates that instead of direct confrontation, MBS has learned to wield Saudi Arabia's economic and cultural clout more strategically. When faced with international criticism, the kingdom increasingly applies pressure through business deals and visa policies rather than public statements.</p>

<p>That clout is impacting geopolitics as well. At a summit in Al-Ula in January 2021, MBS personally brokered an end to a rift between several Gulf States and Qatar over the latter's foreign policy and its media's role in fomenting regional differences. The Crown Prince also symbolically embraced Qatar's emir in a public gesture of reconciliation. This move stabilized the region and allowed Saudi Arabia to present a more united Gulf front on the world stage even as MBS's long-time partner, Mohammed bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates, appeared to struggle to embrace the change.</p>

<p>Even more remarkably, MBS has opened backchannel negotiations with Iran, Saudi Arabia's long-standing nemesis. These talks, mediated by Iraq and Oman, marked a dramatic shift from the confrontational stance of MBS's early years in power — particularly in Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has been fighting Iranian-backed Houthi rebels since 2015.</p>

<p><strong>Saudi First</strong></p>

<p>Most critically, none of these efforts were done in lockstep with the US. Saudi foreign policy is now definitively “Saudi first.” And domestically, MBS has maintained a firm grip on power. Rivals within the royal family remain sidelined or under house arrest, seemingly for life. Activists and critics continue to face harsh punishments, though with less of the brazen impunity that characterized the Khashoggi affair. The release of women's rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul in February 2021, while celebrated internationally, came with strict conditions including a travel ban.</p>

<p>Human rights organizations continue to criticize Saudi Arabia's treatment of dissidents and its lack of political freedoms, but the world that sought to isolate MBS now has no choice but to engage. The age of MBS has begun — an era where Saudi Arabia's influence extends far beyond oil markets. From Silicon Valley boardrooms to Premier League stadiums and gaming, from renewable energy projects to artificial intelligence research, the kingdom's fingerprints are increasingly visible on the global economy.</p>

<p>As Saudi Arabia prepares to host the World Expo in 2030 and the World Cup in 2034, it is clear that MBS has transformed his nation. His model of authoritarian modernization, combining social reforms with strict political control, has also inspired other leaders in the region and beyond. Whether this new paradigm proves sustainable remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: The implications of Saudi Arabia's transformation under MBS will reverberate far beyond the kingdom's borders for decades to come.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's King Charles III is reportedly planning an official visit to India early next year. Queen Camilla will accompany the King on the royal tour to the Indian subcontinent, which is part of a government-led charm offensive, and a personal health boost following a cancer diagnosis earlier this year, according to UK media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>King Charles will visit India, Pakistan and Bangladesh during the trip, GB news reported quoting sources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We're now working on a pretty normal-looking full overseas tour program for next year, which is a high for us to end on, to know that we can be thinking in those terms," the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gbnews.com/royal/king-charles-queen-camilla-india-cancer-recovery-latest-royal-news" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">report </a>quoted a senior palace official as saying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The British government is reportedly keen on a royal tour of the Commonwealth nations, with the UK trying to establish significant economic links outside of Europe in a post-Brexit world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The monarch's earlier planned visit to the Indian subcontinent had to be abandoned after the Queen's death in September 2022. However, the King and the Queen visited Bengaluru last month for a private tour, where they reportedly stayed at a sprawling integrative medical facility.&nbsp;</p>

<p>UK newspaper The Mirror reported that the British Foreign Office has authorised officials to begin discussions with India and other potential host nations for royal visits, and proposals are being drafted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per the report, after their previous visit was cancelled, Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his enthusiasm to welcome King Charles and Queen Camilla.</p>

<h2><strong>King Charles' Cancer Diagnosis</strong></h2>

<p>The 76-year-old monarch was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in January and stepped back from royal duties for around three months. He returned to work in April with a visit to a cancer centre in London where he met with fellow patients.</p>

<p>King Charles, who is still undergoing treatment, successfully completed a tour of Australia and Samoa in October.&nbsp;He reportedly felt lifted by his 11-day trip to the South Pacific, after which Buckingham Palace put in long-term plans for the King to resume a complete international travel programme next year, subject to medical advice.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Julian Assange's father, John Shipton, could breathe a massive sigh of relief on Wednesday after a decade-long campaign to free his son.</p>

<p>The WikiLeaks founder on Wednesday was released by a court on the U.S. Pacific island territory of Saipan after pleading guilty to violating U.S. espionage law.</p>

<p>Assange's family, including his father, children and wife, Stella, gathered in Australia's capital Canberra ahead of his expected evening arrival by private jet, marking the end of a long legal fight tied to WikiLeaks' release of hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. defence documents in 2010.</p>

<p>Shipton said he planned to ask his son in a low-key Australian way when he arrives: "Where have you been?"</p>

<p>"My faith has never, ever, ever died," he told Reuters in an interview at parliament.</p>

<p>"That Julian can come home to Australia and see his family regularly and do the ordinary things of life is a treasure. Life measured amongst the beauty of the ordinary is the essence of life," Shipton said.</p>

<p>He said he was "divided in two" on the deal that saw Assange plead guilty to one charge of espionage, saying his release meant he would have precious time with his sons.</p>

<p>He was nonetheless concerned about the "political and legal circumstances surrounding it".</p>

<p>"I think it is going to be a problem for journalists and publishers anywhere in the world to publish criticism of the United States government," he said.</p>

<p>Assange's release was cause for celebration in Canberra, where politicians who had campaigned for Assange gathered around Shipton in a hall outside the parliament chamber.</p>

<p>"We want to give you a hug," said lawmaker Sophie Scamps.</p>

<p>Assange will need time to recover from his "monastic life" in self-exile in the Ecuadorian embassy in London for seven years, and then prison for five years, Shipton said.</p>

<p>He looked forward to being involved in his son's "practical everyday human life, not the sweep of politics."</p>

<p>"The American Secret Service in 2011 published their review saying we must hound him and his family to the end of the earth and bankrupt them. Its been expensive but I've got no complaints - the results are there for everyone to see," he said.</p>

<p>He said the Australian government had been "nothing short of magnificent".</p>

<p>Assange has previously said he got his "rebel gene" from his father. Shipton said he considers his son to be personally conservative and polite.</p>

<p>"It is his understanding of the capacity of the internet to bring to us information that can be the foundation of knowledge that is revolutionary," he said.</p>

<p>"He is only 52 I imagine he will find something to do. He will be 53 next week. The momentum he has got ... he will conjure forth those things that he can do."</p>

<p>Shipton said the family had devoted the last decade to doing everything in its capacity to see Assange free.</p>

<p>"We Australians managed to turn around a superpower in its attempt to destroy an Australian citizen," he said.</p>

<p>Shipton learned of the plea deal from his son Gabriel.</p>

<p>Gabriel told Reuters on Wednesday he was "feeling extremely relieved that this ordeal is finally over and that Julian can move on with his life."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The death count from protests in Kenya has climbed to 13, an official from the main doctors' association told AFP Wednesday, after anti-tax hike rallies turned violent and police opened fire at demonstrators who ransacked parliament.</p>

<p>The unprecedented scenes that left parts of parliament ablaze and destroyed and injured scores of people on Tuesday have shocked Kenyans and prompted President William Ruto's government to deploy the military.</p>

<p>The mainly youth-led rallies began mostly peacefully last week, with thousands of demonstrators marching in the capital Nairobi, and across the country against the tax increases.</p>

<p>But tensions flared sharply on Tuesday afternoon, as police officers fired live rounds on crowds that later ransacked the parliament complex.</p>

<p>Hours later, Defence Minister Aden Bare Duale announced that the government had deployed the army to support the police in tackling "the security emergency" in the country.</p>

<p>"So far, we have at least 13 people killed, but this is not the final number," Simon Kigondu, president of the Kenya Medical Association said, adding that he had never seen "such level of violence against unarmed people."</p>

<p>"Deaths, mayhem", read the front-page headline on the Standard newspaper, while the Daily Nation described the situation as "Pandemonium", saying: "The foundations of the country have been shaken to the core."</p>

<p>An official at Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi said Wednesday that medics were treating "160 people... some of them with soft tissue injuries, some of them with bullet wounds".</p>

<p>In a late-night press briefing, Ruto warned that his government would take a tough line against "violence and anarchy", likening some of the demonstrators to "criminals".</p>

<p>"It is not in order or even conceivable that criminals pretending to be peaceful protesters can reign terror against the people, their elected representatives, and the institutions established under our constitution and expect to go scot-free," he said.</p>

<p>The government has been taken by surprise by the intensity of opposition to its tax proposals -- mostly led by young, Gen-Z Kenyans -- which culminated in the scenes at parliament that played out live on television.</p>

<p>Images shared on local TV stations after crowds broke through the barricades showed the building ransacked, with burnt furniture and smashed windows.</p>

<p>As police fired at the angry crowds, leaving several bodies strewn on the ground, protest organisers urged people to walk home together and "stay safe".</p>

<h3><strong>'Madness'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>A heavy police presence was deployed around parliament early on Wednesday, according to an AFP reporter, the smell of tear gas still in the air.</p>

<p>A policeman standing in front of the broken barricades to the complex told AFP he had watched the scenes unfold on TV.</p>

<p>"It was madness, we hope it will be calm today," he said.</p>

<p>Earlier on Tuesday, the rallies in various Kenyan cities had been largely peaceful.</p>

<p>However, tensions escalated in Nairobi later in the day, with some protesters hurling stones at police, who deployed tear gas and water cannons before firing live bullets.</p>

<p>AFP journalists saw three people bleeding heavily and lying motionless on the ground near parliament.</p>

<h3><strong>'Brute force'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The unrest has alarmed the international community, with the White House appealing for calm and more than 10 Western nations -- including Canada, Germany, and Britain -- saying they were "especially shocked by the scenes witnessed outside the Kenyan Parliament".</p>

<p>UN chief Antonio Guterres and the head of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, have also expressed deep concern.</p>

<p>Veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga, who heads the Azimio coalition, accused the government of unleashing "brute force on our country's children".</p>

<p>Rights watchdogs have also accused the authorities of abducting protesters.</p>

<p>The police have not responded to any AFP requests for comment.</p>

<h3><strong>Cost of living&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Long-running grievances over the rising cost of living spiraled last week as lawmakers began debating proposed tax hikes in the 2024 finance bill.</p>

<p>The cash-strapped government says the increases are needed to service the country's massive debt of some 10 trillion shillings ($78 billion), equal to roughly 70 percent of Kenya's GDP.</p>

<p>After rolling back some of the more controversial proposals -- which would have affected bread purchases, car ownership, and financial and mobile services -- the government now intends to increase fuel prices and export duties.</p>

<p>Kenya's treasury has warned of a gaping budget shortfall of 200 billion shillings, following Ruto's decision to roll back some of the tax hikes.</p>

<p>While Kenya is among East Africa's most dynamic economies, a third of its 52 million population live in poverty.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NATO allies on Wednesday selected Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte as NATO's next boss, as the war in Ukraine rages on its doorstep and uncertainty hangs over the United States' future attitude to the transatlantic alliance.</p>

<p>Rutte's appointment became a formality after his only rival for the post, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, announced last week that he had quit the race, having failed to gain traction.</p>

<p>"The North Atlantic Council decided to appoint Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte as the next Secretary General of NATO, succeeding Jens Stoltenberg," NATO said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Mr Rutte will assume his functions as Secretary General from 1 October 2024, when Mr Stoltenberg's term expires after ten years at the helm of the Alliance," it added.</p>

<p>After declaring his interest in the post last year, Rutte gained early support from key members of the alliance including the United States, Britain, France and Germany.</p>

<p>Others were more reticent, particularly Eastern European countries which argued the post should go to someone from their region for the first time.</p>

<p>But they ultimately rowed in behind Rutte, a fierce critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin and a staunch ally of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Stoltenberg said he warmly welcomed the selection of Rutte as his successor.</p>

<p>"Mark is a true transatlanticist, a strong leader, and a consensus-builder," he said. "I know I am leaving NATO in good hands."</p>

<p>NATO takes decisions by consensus so Rutte, who is bowing out of Dutch politics after nearly 14 years as prime minister, could only be confirmed once all 32 alliance members gave him their backing.</p>

<p>Rutte will face the challenge of sustaining allies' support for Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion while guarding against NATO's being drawn directly into a war with Moscow.</p>

<p>He will also have to contend with the possibility that NATO-sceptic Donald Trump may return to the White House after November's U.S. presidential election.</p>

<p>Trump's possible return has unnerved NATO leaders as the Republican former president called into question the U.S. willingness to support other members of the alliance if they were attacked.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US family whose home was hit by space debris earlier this year is seeking compensation from the American space agency NASA for property damage and mental anguish. The metallic cylinder slab punched a hole in the roof through two layers of ceiling in Alejandro Otero's home in Naples in March. Back then, NASA said that the object was part of a 2.9-ton pallet of used batteries jettisoned from the International Space Station in March 2021. Mr Otero said his son was nearly injured by the impact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, law firm Cranfill Summer said in a press release that it filed a claim on behalf of Mr Otero and his family. It listed damages including non-insured property damage loss, business interruption, emotional/mental anguish and the costs for assistance from third parties.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9www02e49zo"><em>BBC</em></a>, Attorney Mica Nguyen Worthy said <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/nasa-confirms-object-that-destroyed-florida-home-was-space-junk-5452204">space debris </a>"is a real serious issue because of the increase in space traffic in recent years". "My clients are seeking adequate compensation to account for the stress and impact that this event had on their lives," she added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Separately, speaking to <em>CBS</em> affiliate <em>Wink-TV </em>Mr Otero said that the space junk created a tremendous sound" as it blasted into his home. "I was shaking. I was completely in disbelief. What are the chances of something landing on my house with such force to cause so much damage," Mr Otero said.</p>

<p>The US space agency confirmed that the debris was from its flight support equipment. It was a metal support used to hold old batteries on a disposal pallet jettisoned from the station in 2021. While most of the pallet was expected to burn up in the atmosphere, this particular piece survived the fiery re-entry.</p>

<p>&nbsp;"The hardware was expected to fully burn up during entry through Earth's atmosphere on March 8, 2024. However, a piece of hardware survived and impacted a home in Naples, Florida," the agency said. The ISS will "perform a detailed investigation" on how the debris survived burn-up, according to Nasa.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>The BBC</em> reported that the agency now has 6 months to respond to Mr Otero's claims.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea test-fired what appeared to be a hypersonic missile off its east coast on Wednesday, but it exploded in midair, South Korea's military said.</p>

<p>The missile was launched from near the capital, Pyongyang, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said. Japan's Defence Ministry said the missile flew to an altitude of about 100 km (62 miles) and a range of more than 200 km.</p>

<p>Senior officials of South Korea, the United States and Japan held a phone call and condemned the launch as a violation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions and a serious threat to the peace and stability of the region and beyond.</p>

<p>South Korea's marine corps said its troops staged firing drills near the maritime border with the North for the first time since Seoul scrapped an inter-Korean military pact early this month. The drills were announced earlier in June.</p>

<p>U.S. Indo-Pacific Command also issued a condemnation and called on Pyongyang to refrain from further unlawful and destabilising acts.</p>

<p>"While we have assessed that this event does not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel, or territory, or to our allies, we continue to monitor the situation," it said in a statement.</p>

<p>North Korea's last missile launch was on May 30.</p>

<p>North Korea this week criticised the deployment of a U.S. aircraft carrier to joint drills with South Korea and Japan, and warned of an "overwhelming, new demonstration of deterrence".</p>

<p>The missile launch comes a day after the 74-year anniversary of the beginning of the Korean War.</p>

<p>Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a summit and signed a mutual defence pact. Seoul, Washington and Tokyo criticised the two countries' deepening military cooperation, with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol calling the pact "anachronistic".</p>

<p>North Korean state media KCNA said on Wednesday a mass rally in Pyongyang was held to commemorate the war anniversary, calling it a day of "struggle against U.S. imperialism" and calling the United States the archenemy.</p>

<p>Recently, North Korea has flown hundreds of balloons carrying trash toward the South, including on Tuesday, while Pyongyang deployed a large group of soldiers to build new fortifications within the heavily armed border between the two Koreas, according to the South's military, occasionally drawing warning shots from South Korean counterparts.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A union representing Hollywood film and television crew said on Tuesday it has reached a tentative three-year deal with major studios that includes agreed-on pay hikes and guardrails against the use of artificial intelligence (AI).</p>

<p>The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) members, which include lighting technicians and costume designers, are to ratify the deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents Disney, Netflix, and others.</p>

<p>The terms of the agreement include scale-rate increases of 7%, 4%, and 3.5% over the three-year term, the union said.</p>

<p>On the AI front, the deal includes "language that ensures no employee is required to provide Al prompts in any manner that would result in the displacement of any covered employee."</p>

<p>In late 2023, the SAG-AFTRA actors union and the studios reached a labor agreement which ended a near six-month dispute that had halted film and TV production.</p>

<p>That contract also provided for pay raises and streaming bonuses that union leaders said amounted to more than $1 billion over three years, and also included protection around the use of AI in filmmaking.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An online gaming rivalry turned violent when a 20-year-old man travelled from New Jersey to Florida and assaulted another player with a hammer. Despite never having met in person, Edward Kang reached Fernandina Beach on Sunday and allegedly attacked the victim, the police said.</p>

<p>Kang now faces serious charges, including attempted second-degree murder and armed burglary with a mask, according to court records from Nassau County.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a press conference, Nassau County Sheriff Bill Leeper said that Kang and the victim - also around the same age - played ArcheAge, a mediaeval fantasy multiplayer online role-playing game. The Sheriff called the case a “weird one.”</p>

<p>“Some things you just can't make up,” he added.</p>

<br />
Kang flew from New Jersey to Florida, telling his mom he was visiting a friend he met online, reported authorities. After landing, Kang purchased a hammer from a local hardware store before heading to the victim's house, which was reportedly left unlocked.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kang confronted the victim inside the home around 2 am and hit him on the head with the hammer. The victim suffered multiple head wounds but managed to call for help. As the victim struggled with Kang, his stepfather intervened and helped restrain the attacker until police arrived at the scene.<br />
<br />
The victim survived the assault and received medical treatment for his injuries, described as serious but not life-threatening, reported ABC News.<br />
<br />
In custody, Kang called the victim a "bad person online". He asked deputies how much jail time he would get for breaking and assault. An official replied, "It's going to be long before you play video games again."<br />
<br />
Kang is being held without bond and does not have an attorney listed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shocking visuals have surfaced online showing how&nbsp;a key dam in southern Minnesota built in the early 1900s, is at risk of failing after&nbsp;severe storms and flooding hit the region. Videos&nbsp;show strong water continuing to rush around the dam that has ''partially failed'' with officials saying the dam is in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=771440118493427&amp;id=100068823386285&amp;ref=embed_post">"imminent failure condition."</a></p>

<p>As per the<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/06/24/rapidan-dam-break-minnesota-flooding/"> Washington Post,</a></em> the alarming situation was brought on by days of torrential rains last week, triggering flooding that had killed at least two people.&nbsp;The floods have destroyed homes, swamped farmland, overtopped levees and caused a major railroad bridge to collapse.</p>

<p>One video shows a tremendous volume of water flowing around the dam, as it swallows a building.&nbsp; As the building falls into the fast-flowing river, it breaks into multiple pieces as it is washed away.&nbsp;Large trees are also seen breaking off at the side of the Blue Earth River and falling into the rapids.</p>

<p>An Xcel Energy substation, which supplies power to 600 customers, was also swept downriver during the overflow Monday, according to the company. Mankato Police and Fire posted on Facebook Monday afternoon that the water level at the dam was 28 feet. The levee system is built to withstand a river capacity of up to 39.5 feet.</p>

<p>However, as of Tuesday afternoon, the dam was still intact and there are no plans for a larger evacuation. Nearby residents who are in immediate danger have been notified, officials said.</p>

<p>"The Dam is currently intact and there is not an evacuation order in place for Blue Earth County residents. A portion of the river flow has diverted around the west side of the dam and water continues to flow. The situation is being monitored closely by BEC Public Works, Emergency Management, and the Sheriff's Office,'' officials said.</p>

Owned by the county, the dam is capable of generating 6 million watts of hydroelectric power. It&nbsp;is near the city of Mankato, about 90 minutes from Minneapolis, and home to some 45,000 people.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A six-foot-tall wax statue of former US President Abraham Lincoln in Washington melted as the capital city's temperatures soared over the weekend.</p>

<p>The temperatures, which reportedly touched 37 degrees Celsius, disfigured the wax structure at the site of Camp Barker, a Civil War-era refugee camp that housed formerly enslaved and freed African Americans.</p>

<p>The statue's head was the first to surrender to the scorching heat, followed by the legs, BBC reported. Authorities are now repairing the sculpture.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The indictment alleges that the children were forced to work on the couple's farmland because of their race and treated as slaves.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A wealthy white couple in West Virginia has been charged with human trafficking, forced labour and child neglect. The couple, Donald Ray Lantz (63) and Jeanne Kay Whitefeather (62), allegedly subjected their five adopted black children to forced labour and confinement, <a href="https://www.wvnews.com/news/wvnews/west-virginia-couple-accused-of-forced-labor-and-abuse-of-adopted-children/article_47603a5c-332f-11ef-99e4-37e6c030b9f5.html ">WNews</a>&nbsp;reported.<br />
<br />
The children, aged 6-16, were found living in deplorable conditions. Two teens were locked in a filthy shed without basic amenities, while another child was in a loft in the main house.<br />
<br />
The indictment alleges the children were forced to work on the couple's farmland because of their race and treated as slaves. The couple allegedly also prohibited them from entering the main house, reported the outlet.<br />
<br />
The couple faces multiple charges, including human trafficking, forced labour involving minors, and child neglect, creating a substantial risk of severe injury or death. They pleaded not guilty to the charges on Tuesday, <a href="https://m.wchstv.com/news/local/court-to-hold-400000-used-to-post-sissonville-couples-bond-until-case-resolved ">WCHSTV</a> reported.<br />
<br />
The investigation began after a neighbour reported concerns about the well-being of children.<br />
<br />
Police found two teenagers, a 14-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl, locked in a shed on the couple's property. The shed had no lights, running water, or mattresses, only an RV porta-potty. The teens told police they were forced to sleep on the concrete floor and were last fed 12 hours prior.<br />
<br />
The boy had open sores on his bare feet, and both children wore dirty clothes and smelled of body odour. A 9-year-old girl was found inside the residence, while an 11-year-old boy and a 6-year-old girl were brought to the property later by the couple.<br />
<br />
Kanawha County Circuit Judge Maryclaire Akers described the indictment as “one of the worst" she has ever seen, citing allegations of human trafficking and racial targeting. “It alleges human trafficking, human rights violations, the use of forced labour,” Judge Akers said, as per the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/25/us-news/wealthy-white-couple-allegedly-kept-their-black-adopted-children-as-slaves-locked-them-in-barn-report/ ">NY Post</a>. “These children were targeted because of their race, and they were used basically as slaves from what the indictment alleges.”&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Judge Akers increased the couple's bond from $200,000 to $500,000 each, citing the severe nature of the human trafficking and child neglect charges. She stated that the initial bond was insufficient due to the risk of bodily harm or death involved. The case will go to trial on September 9.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The city of Karachi is grappling with a mysterious and concerning trend as the number of unidentified bodies found in various areas of the metropolis has now reached 22, according to a Geo News report on Wednesday.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, five new bodies were discovered, adding to the growing list of unexplained deaths.</p>

<p>According to the Chhipa Welfare Association, a non-profit welfare organization in Pakistan, three of the latest victims appear to be drug addicts, as per Geo News.</p>

<p>Despite efforts by the organization's volunteers, none of the 22 bodies have been identified.</p>

<p>A spokesperson of the Chhipa Welfare Association said in a statement on Tuesday, that volunteers found five more bodies in different areas of Karachi on Tuesday. "Three of them were seemingly drug addicts, however, not a single body was identified so far," the spokesperson added.</p>

<p>According to Geo News, the non-government organisation, that runs a network of ambulances in the metropolis, confirmed that the number of unidentified bodies has reached 22 after today's recoveries.</p>

<p>It added that nearly two dozen of those bodies were still unclaimed as no relatives of the dead came to receive them.</p>

<p>The deaths were attributed to an ongoing heatwave in the port city which affected a vast number of citizens as many of them were admitted to different hospitals due to heatstroke.</p>

<p>An official of another humanitarian organisation in Karachi, Edhi Foundation's Azeem Khan told The News yesterday that most of the dead were drug addicts who died due to severe heat while being under the influence of drugs after over a dozen unidentified persons were found dead in different areas of Karachi.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, In Karachi a senior citizen was brutally assaulted by a group of drug users after confronting them about openly using drugs outside his residence, ARY News reported.</p>

<p>According to details, the victim attempted to stop the youths from engaging in drug activity in front of his home, which provoked the youths, resulting in severe violence against the elderly man.</p>

<p>This incident highlights the rising issue of drug abuse in Pakistan, particularly the increasing use of Ice, also known as crystal methamphetamine, in recent years.</p>

<p>Crystal meth is a highly addictive and potent stimulant that can have devastating effects on individuals and society as a whole. The usage of ice in Pakistan has been particularly prevalent among the younger generation.</p>

<p>The drug is often seen as a party drug that can enhance energy, alertness, and confidence, making it appealing to young people looking for a quick high. The ease of access to ice, as well as its relatively low cost compared to other drugs, has contributed to its popularity among young Pakistanis.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-06/9f8gj3p8_india-china_625x300_26_June_24.jpg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>

<p>London is known for its open intellectual climate, where no idea is off-limits. But even in this dynamic city - and indeed in Washington too - it's almost blasphemous to suggest that Russia and the West can be partners, or that the US and China can coexist as global powers. Recently, Nigel Farage, the Reform Party leader in the UK, faced a storm for urging the West to negotiate sensibly with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/russia-ukraine-live-updates">Russia over Ukraine</a>, calling the war a 'complete stalemate'. People accused him of "echoing Russian propaganda".</p>

<p>In India, we often hear that we don't cultivate a society where all ideas are welcome. But let's hope that suggesting a new chapter of "<em>Hindi-Cheeni bhai-bhai</em>" (<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/great-positive-progress-made-on-resolving-border-row-with-india-china-5427103">India-China</a> brotherhood) isn't seen as blasphemy. The strong anti-China sentiment after the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/india-china-clash-galwan-valley">Galwan Valley clash in 2020</a> seems to have subsided. We're buying more Chinese goods now than ever. In 2023, our bilateral trade hit over $136 billion. Hopefully, even those who burnt Chinese products in Gujarat and Delhi following the border skirmishes are more open to the idea now.</p>

<p><span>Sure, it might sound crazy to suggest that India and China should become trusted partners like the US and India, or Russia and China. But, it's not entirely out of the question.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Major Geopolitical Shifts</strong></h2>

<p>India's rise to become a global power is unstoppable; even China knows that. Talking to Chinese academics and journalists, you get the sense that they're open to establishing long-term ties based on mutual respect. They like India, they want more people-to-people interactions, and one of them even wondered recently why India does not try to cast its spell over the dragon through its soft power of Bollywood &nbsp;</p>

<p>Both countries have the responsibility to lift millions of their combined 2.8 billion people out of poverty. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged to make India a developed country by 2047, which is a huge task. There are challenges, but if India and China team up and leverage each other's strengths, it could be a major geopolitical shift, with far-reaching implications for global politics.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/modi-hasina-should-worry-about-china-but-not-too-much-5959266">Read | Modi-Hasina Should Worry About China, But Not Too Much</a></strong></p>

<p>The US and its allies might be shocked and deeply concerned by a close India-China partnership. The West has benefited from the rivalry between the two countries as it aligns with their strategy of counterbalancing China's rise. A partnership between these two Asian giants could undermine the West's strategic interests in the region. Kishore Mahbubani, former Singaporean ambassador to the UN, has often said that most of Asia would cheer if this were to happen.</p>

<p>So, can India and China find common ground despite tensions over their disputed border? Prof. Mahbubani believes that while the two may never be best friends, they can have a good working relationship. He even says the 21st century belongs to the CIA (China, India, and ASEAN) countries. With US power on the decline, these countries will drive the world's economic growth.</p>

<h2><strong>A Rollercoaster Ride</strong></h2>

<p>The idea of India and China being close friends isn't new. Historically, they've acted like quarrelsome neighbours who fight and make up repeatedly. They share a long history of cultural and economic exchange dating back over two millennia. The Silk Road facilitated trade, and Buddhism, which started in India, found a significant following in China. These ancient ties laid a foundation of mutual respect and cultural affinity. During the colonial era, both countries faced subjugation by Western powers, fostering a sense of shared struggle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After gaining independence from the British, India faced border issues with China, and they continue to strain their relationship. In the early 1950s, the relationship was marked by camaraderie, epitomised by the slogan "<em>Hindi-Chini Bhai-Bhai</em>". However, this period of cooperation was short-lived. The border dispute escalated into a full-scale war in 1962, leaving a lasting scar on bilateral relations. The disputed borders, particularly in the Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh regions, remain contentious issues.</p>

<p>Before the Galwan incident, Prime Minister Narendra Modi naturally leaned towards engaging with China. As Gujarat's Chief Minister, he made four trips to the country to attract investment. As Prime Minister, he has visited China twice, and President Xi Jinping reciprocated with two visits to India. Both countries have emerged as major global economic powers, engaging in significant economic competition and areas of cooperation within multilateral frameworks like BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).</p>

<h2><strong>Strategic Rivalry</strong></h2>

<p>Strategically, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/blog/blog-india-china-ties-through-the-eyes-of-a-student-4381793">India and China view each other with suspicion</a>. The latter's close ties with Pakistan, its infrastructure projects in South Asia under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and its military presence in the Indian Ocean have heightened India's security concerns.</p>

<p>Conversely, India's growing partnership with the US and its participation in the Quad (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue) is viewed warily by China. The 2020 Galwan Valley clash exacerbated tensions and highlighted the fragility of the relationship. Despite several rounds of military and diplomatic talks, a comprehensive resolution to the border disputes remains elusive.</p>

<h2><strong>Mumbai's Shanghai Dreams</strong></h2>

<p>Many youth in India might not know that not too long ago, India used to compare itself with Pakistan in all spheres. This attitude changed around the turn of the millennium, when the Maharashtra government launched a mega project to revamp Mumbai in 2004, based on the "Vision Mumbai" report by Bombay First, an organisation comprising some of Mumbai's super-rich stakeholders. The report outlined strategies for transforming Mumbai into "another Shanghai". While the project to transform Mumbai is still a "work in progress", it marked the beginning of India's comparisons with China. Today, China sees India as its great rival, at least in Asia.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/china-is-revamping-its-military-and-india-must-not-take-it-lightly-5571658">Read | China Is Revamping Its Military, And India Must Not Take It Lightly</a></strong></p>

<p>Projections show that the Indian economy will surpass Germany and Japan's to become the world's third-largest one by 2027. Currently, however, India's economy is only 19% the size of China's, even though it feeds nearly the same number of people. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), India's nominal GDP in 2023 stood at $3.5 trillion, compared to China's $18.2 trillion. India's per capita income was $2,411, while China's was $12,720. China's exports last year exceeded $3.38 trillion, while India's exports were $778 billion.</p>

<h2><strong>Collaboration Possibilities</strong></h2>

<p>Since China opened its economy in 1978, it has lifted 800 million people out of poverty - a feat that hasn't been matched by any regime in history. India has also succeeded in reducing poverty significantly. Both nations have many more millions to help. Collaborating in economic development, technology, infrastructure, environmental initiatives, healthcare, cultural exchange, and geopolitical stability can benefit both countries and the world. Overcoming historical tensions and building trust through consistent dialogue will be crucial.</p>

<p>The intense rivalry between the US and China will continue, and India will remain under pressure from the US to stay a reliable partner in its effort to manage China. However, India's strategic positioning between the US and China can work to its advantage. Ultimately, New Delhi's strategic interests are best served by a balanced approach that navigates the complex dynamics of US-China relations while advancing its own national objectives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>India knows that neighbours with shared borders may fight at times, but they can still continue to believe in the 'love thy neighbour' dictum.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Tyrese Haspil's scheme to steal from his former boss, Fahim Saleh, began in 2018, but it wasn't until July 2020 that his plan turned deadly.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tyrese Haspil, a former assistant of tech mogul Fahim Saleh, has been convicted of murdering his former boss in his Manhattan apartment back in 2020.&nbsp;Prosecutors said that Tyrese Haspil killed his former boss to cover up his theft of $400,000 from the 33-year-old businessman.</p>

<p>Mr Saleh was a successful tech entrepreneur and the CEO of Gokada, a Nigeria-based scooter startup.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The 25-year-old was found <a href="https://manhattanda.org/d-a-bragg-announces-all-count-trial-conviction-of-tyrese-haspil-in-murder-of-tech-ceo-fahim-saleh/ ">guilty of multiple charges</a>, including murder in the first degree, grand larceny, burglary, tampering with physical evidence and concealment of a human corpse. He faces up to 25 years to life in prison and will be sentenced on September 10.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said, “Tyrese Haspil tragically cut Mr Saleh's life short – a man who came from a close-knit immigrant family and followed his passions to become a successful entrepreneur. I hope the accountability delivered by today's verdict can provide a measure of comfort to Mr Saleh's loved ones as they continue to mourn his loss.”<br />
<br />
Mr Saleh was found murdered in his $2.4 million 7th-floor high-rise condo on East Houston Street, reported the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/24/us-news/tech-ceo-fahim-salehs-ex-assistant-convicted-in-grisly-dismemberment-murder/ ">NY Post</a>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Planning the murder</strong><br />
<br />
Tyrese Haspil's scheme to steal from his former boss, Fahim Saleh, began in 2018, but it wasn't until July 2020 that his plan turned deadly.&nbsp;He embezzled money from Mr Saleh's companies to purchase lavish gifts for his girlfriend, The NYT reported.<br />
<br />
Haspil created a bogus corporate entity and bank account to funnel the stolen money. When Mr Saleh discovered the theft in January 2020, Haspil agreed to a repayment plan but continued to steal more money through a fraudulent PayPal account.<br />
<br />
Concerned that Mr Saleh would discover the more lucrative theft, Haspil began plotting to kill him.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Tyrese Haspil's online activity showed that he searched for "Fahim Saleh" and "murder of tech CEO in New York", as well as "dismembered body" and "anatomy of the human neck". He also looked up building plans and searched for contractor-grade trash bags, weapons and cleaning supplies, as per the NYT.<br />
<br />
Haspil also tracked Mr Saleh's whereabouts on social media and purchased clothes to conceal his identity.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Execution of the murder</strong><br />
<br />
On July 13, 2020, Tyrese Haspil entered an elevator with Mr Saleh in the latter's apartment building wearing a dark plastic face shield, a baseball cap and sunglasses. Mr Saleh, unaware of the impending danger, joked with Haspil about taking Covid precautions seriously. However, as soon as the elevator doors opened, Haspil's demeanour turned deadly.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
According to his testimony, Tyrese Haspil tased Fahim Saleh in the back, rendering him immobile, and then pulled out a knife. With a targeted strike, Haspil aimed for Mr Saleh's neck, delivering a fatal blow, reported the NYT.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He then left the apartment and returned the next day to dismember Mr Saleh's body with an electric saw. He stuffed the body parts in plastic bags, which were later found strewn across the apartment.<br />
<br />
However, before completing the task, he left again to purchase a battery charger, and it was during this time that Fahim Saleh's cousin discovered the scene when he went to check up on him.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Tyrese Haspil was arrested four days later at an Airbnb he booked for his girlfriend's birthday celebration.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
His public defenders argued that he murdered his ex-boss due to “extreme emotional disturbance” and “unconditional love” for his girlfriend. He feared she would leave him if she found out he had been embezzling money from his boss, as per <a href="http://https://nypost.com/2024/06/24/us-news/tech-ceo-fahim-salehs-ex-assistant-convicted-in-grisly-dismemberment-murder/">reports</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New Zealand judge on Wednesday sentenced a woman to 18 years imprisonment for murdering her three young daughters in 2021.</p>

<p>Lauren Dickason will begin her sentence at a mental health hospital in the custody of the state, a court official at Christchurch High Court told AFP, for the triple killings.</p>

<p>In a statement to local media after her sentencing, Dickason said she had "failed" her children and her husband, who has since moved back to South Africa.</p>

<p>"I take responsibility for taking our three beautiful girls from this world," she said.</p>

<p>"I would like to take this opportunity to convey the deepest and most sincere remorse for the extreme pain and hurt caused to my children and my family by my actions."</p>

<p>Justice Cameron Mander did not impose a minimum non-parole period in sentencing Dickason, who escaped life imprisonment which is the usual penalty for murder in New Zealand.</p>

<p>Dickason was found guilty last August on three counts of murder having smothered her two-year-old twins Maya and Karla and first daughter Liane, six.</p>

<p>The killings took place in September 2021 at their home in Timaru while her husband was out to dinner with colleagues. He found the bodies of his children when he returned home.</p>

<p>The family had moved to New Zealand from South Africa just weeks before.</p>

<p>During last year's trial, Dickason admitted killing the girls but had argued a defence of insanity and infanticide, triggered by the stress of the move.</p>

<p>Under New Zealand law, infanticide is a defence for a mother who causes the death of her child when, "at the time of the offence, the balance of her mind was disturbed".</p>

<p>Dickason's lawyer had argued that a mental health unit was the most appropriate place for her, according to local media reports.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Takeoffs and landings at South Korea's Incheon International Airport were disrupted on Wednesday for about three hours before dawn because of balloons launched by North Korea filled with refuse, an airport spokesperson said.</p>

<p>One balloon landed on the tarmac near passenger Terminal 2 and the three runways at Incheon were temporarily shut down, the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>North Korea has flown balloons carrying trash into South Korea since late May, with hundreds landing in South Korea.</p>

<p>Several balloons were spotted in and around the airport boundaries, the spokesperson said, adding that this was not the first time operations at the airport - which is about 40km from the North Korean border - had been disrupted by balloons nearby.</p>

<p>The disruption to domestic and international flights occurred between 1:46 a.m. and 4:44 a.m., and the runways have re-opened since then, Incheon International Airport Corporation said.</p>

<p>Flight volume at that time of day is usually low. FlightRadar24 showed shows eight arriving cargo and passenger flights were diverted to South Korea's Cheongju or Jeju airports during that time, and one China Cargo freighter from Shanghai was diverted to Yantai, China.</p>

<p>Several more landings were delayed, and departures were delayed by several hours.</p>

<p>North Korea has said the balloons are retaliation for a propaganda campaign by North Korean defectors and activists in the South who regularly send over balloons carrying food, medicine, money and leaflets criticising the North's leaders.</p>

<p>Among the items carried by the North Korean balloons have been articles printed with Hello Kitty characters, badly worn clothing, and soil containing traces of human faeces and parasites, South Korea has said.</p>

<p>South Korea's military on Wednesday said about 100 balloons had fallen to the ground between Tuesday and Wednesday, mostly in the capital, Seoul, and the surrounding Gyeonggi province. Most of carried just scraps of paper.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An 18-year-old woman in the United States has been arrested for calling 911 to avoid going on a date with a man she met on a dating app. According to <em>The Independent</em>, the woman, identified as Sumaya Thomas, was arrested after cops said she told a dispatcher that her abusive ex-boyfriend of two years was outside her home and sending her threatening text messages. She told the police that the man told her that he wanted to hit, kick, punch and stab her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Thomas was arrested on June 16 on two false reporting charges, both of which were misdemeanour crimes, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/date-iowa-false-reporting-arrest-b2568044.html"><em>The Independent</em></a> reported. The 18-year-old even told the police that she was pregnant with her ex-boyfriend's baby. The majority of their conversations took place over Snapchat, she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, upon arriving at the scene, the cops spotted the man leaving the residence. He reportedly told the officers that he started speaking to the woman a week ago on a dating app. The two then moved their conversations off the platform and started to text. The man also showed the cops the text and dating app conversations, following which the officers confirmed that the messages were sent to the woman's phone number.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The man was detained for over an hour due to the false accusations. It was during a third interview that Ms Thomas admitted to making the false report because she got "cold feet on meeting him and no longer wanted to".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"She advised she didn't think officers would help so she made up this call and the events that she described," the police complaint stated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Thomas was arrested last week and later released from the Johnson County Jail in Iowa.&nbsp;<br />

       <description><![CDATA[WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was freed by a court on the U.S. Pacific island territory of Saipan on Wednesday after pleading guilty to violating U.S. espionage law, in a deal that will see him return home to Australia.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was freed by a court on the US Pacific island territory of Saipan on Wednesday after pleading guilty to violating US espionage law, in a deal that will see him return home to Australia.</p>

<p>During the three-hour hearing, Assange pled guilty to one criminal count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified U.S. national defence documents but said he had believed the Constitution's First Amendment, which protects free speech, shielded his activities.</p>

<p>"Working as a journalist I encouraged my source to provide information that was said to be classified in order to publish that information," he told the court.</p>

<p>"I believed the First Amendment protected that activity but I accept that it was ... a violation of the espionage statute."</p>

<p>Chief U.S. District Judge Ramona V. Manglona accepted his guilty plea and released him due to time already served in a British jail.</p>

<p>Assange, 52, has left Saipan on a private jet accompanied by Australia's ambassadors to the US and UK, according to flight logs. They will then travel to Canberra, landing just before 7 pm (0900 GMT).</p>

<p>Assange had agreed to plead guilty to a single criminal count, according to filings in the U.S. District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands.</p>

<p>The U.S. territory in the western Pacific was chosen due to his opposition to travelling to the mainland U.S. and for its proximity to Australia, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>Dozens of media from around the world attended the hearing, with more gathered outside the courtroom to cover the proceedings. Media were not allowed inside the courtroom to film the hearing.</p>

<p>"I watch this and think how overloaded his senses must be, walking through the press scrum after years of sensory depravation and the four walls of his high-security Belmarsh prison cell," Stella Assange, the wife of WikiLeaks founder said on social media platform X.</p>

<h3><strong>LONG SAGA</strong></h3>

<p>Australian-born Assange spent more than five years in a British high-security jail and seven holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London as he fought accusations of sex crimes in Sweden and battled extradition to the U.S., where he faced 18 criminal charges.</p>

<p>Assange's supporters view him as a victim because he exposed U.S. wrongdoing and potential crimes, including in conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Washington has said the release of the secret documents put lives in danger.</p>

<p>The Australian government has been advocating for his release and has raised the issue with the United States several times.</p>

<p>"This isn't something that has happened in the last 24 hours," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told a news conference on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"This is something that has been considered, patient, worked through in a calibrated way, which is how Australia conducts ourselves."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A controversial spiritual leader known as ''Buddha Boy''&nbsp;was convicted by a court in Nepal on charges of sexually assaulting a minor. The leader whose real name is Ram Bahadur Bomjan was <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/nepal-spiritual-leader-ram-bahadur-bomjan-buddha-boy-arrested-over-alleged-rape-of-a-minor-4836676">arrested in January </a>for the sexual assault of a minor as well as suspicion of involvement in the disappearance of at least four of his devotees.</p>

<p>A judge at the Sarlahi District Court found him guilty of sexually assaulting an underage girl and said sentencing would be on July 1. He could face at least 12 years in jail but can still appeal against his conviction.</p>

<p><a id="more-section-display-name"></a></p>

<aside>
<p>The 33-year-old guru, whom his followers believe to be the reincarnation of Gautam Buddha, became famous as a teenager after followers said he could meditate motionless for months without water, food, or sleep. However, some reporters filmed him eating, and he was also spotted sleeping when his followers said he was meditating in private.</p>
</aside>

<p>Accusations of abuse and misconduct against Bomjan stretch back more than a decade. Dozens of assault complaints were filed against him in 2010. At the time he said he had beaten followers because they had disturbed his meditation.</p>

<p>On the run for years, the 33-year-old was arrested by officials from Nepal's Central Investigation Bureau this January on the outskirts of Kathmandu in January this year. During the arrest, police also seized Nepalese banknotes worth $227,000 and other foreign currencies amounting to $23,000.</p>

<p>Before he went on the run, Bomjan still commanded a legion of followers as the allegations against him mounted. At one point tens of thousands of people had gathered to witness his reputed miracles of meditation deep in the jungle.</p>

<p>While aged 16, Bomjan disappeared for nine months to wander the wilderness of eastern Nepal, prompting a round-the-clock vigil by Buddhist monks who prayed for his safe return.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia's prime minister hailed WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's US plea deal hearing Wednesday as a "welcome development".</p>

<p>Assange, 52, pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy to obtain and disseminate US national defence information at a court in the US Pacific territory of the Northern Mariana Islands.</p>

<p>The plea is part of an agreement that is expected to free Assange to return to his native Australia within hours.</p>

<p>"This is a welcome development, but we recognise as well that these proceedings are sensitive and should be respected," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters in Canberra.</p>

<p>"Given those proceedings that are happening literally in real-time, it isn't appropriate to provide further commentary," Albanese said.</p>

<p>Australia had used "all appropriate channels" to support a "positive outcome" in the case, he said, noting that Australia's ambassador to the United States, Kevin Rudd, was accompanying Assange.</p>

<p>"Regardless of your views about Mr Assange, his case has dragged on for too long. There is nothing to be gained from his continued incarceration and we want him brought home to Australia," the Australian leader said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Diana married Britain's now-King Charles in 1981 in an opulent ceremony watched by tens of millions around the globe.</p>

<p>The fairy tale soured over the following years and their tempestuous relationship became fodder for newspapers and gossip magazines, feeding a growing celebrity culture that exploded in the 1990s.</p>

<p>The couple had two children -- Princes William and Harry -- but divorced in 1996 in a tabloid frenzy and amid mutual infidelities.</p>

<p>Diana died in a car crash in Paris the following year as she and her lover tried to outrun paparazzi.</p>

<p>More than a quarter of a century on, the woman dubbed "The People's Princess" remains unmatched as a celebrity and style icon, whose allure continues to fascinate millions.</p>

<p>A dress worn by the princess that was auctioned last year fetched a staggering $1.14 million.</p>

<p>The collection, which has toured the globe for months, is expected to generate huge interest by the time bidding closes on Thursday.</p>

<p>As well as items of high couture, the sale will also include shoes by Salvatore Ferragamo, Kurt Geiger and Rayne, as well as letters in Diana's own handwriting, along with a number of other items connected to the British royal family.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

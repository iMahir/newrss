       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The bodies of British tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and his daughter Hannah have been found in the yacht which sank off Sicily, the Daily Telegraph newspaper reported on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Scuba divers scouring the wreck of British tech magnate's family yacht, which sank two days ago, had earlier found two bodies inside it, a source close to rescue operations had said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Inspection of the wreck, lying sideways at a depth of around 50 metres, was a "long and complex" operation, the Italian fire department said, with inside spaces obstructed by furniture and debris, and scuba divers having just 8-10 minutes beneath the water before needing to resurface.</p>

<p>Separately, the coast guard deployed a remotely operated vehicle to scan the seabed and take underwater pictures and videos that it said may provide "useful and timely elements" for prosecutors looking into the disaster.</p>

<p>The coast guard has been questioning survivors, including the captain of the Bayesian, and passengers on the yacht that was moored next to it who witnessed the ship going down, judicial sources said.</p>

<p>No one is under investigation at the moment, sources added.</p>

<p>The British-flagged Bayesian, a 56-metre-long (184-ft) superyacht, was carrying 22 people, and was anchored off the port of Porticello, near Palermo, when it capsized during a fierce storm on Monday.</p>

<p>The Bayesian, which was owned by Lynch's wife, was built by Italian shipbuilder Perini in 2008 and last refitted in 2020. It had the world's tallest aluminium mast, measuring 72 metres, according to its makers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Pakistani man appeared in court Wednesday to face charges of cyber terrorism after allegedly spreading disinformation on his clickbait website thought to have fuelled anti-immigration riots in Britain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Farhan Asif was accused of publishing an article on his Channel3Now website falsely claiming that a Muslim asylum seeker was suspected in a deadly knife attack on children in the United Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>UK authorities have blamed online misinformation for sparking days of riots which targeted mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers as well as police officers and other properties.</p>

<p>"He is a 31-year-old software engineer with no journalism credentials, apart from running the Channel3Now website, which served as a source of income for him," a senior official at Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency told AFP on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>"Initial investigations indicate that his sole intent was to make money through clickbait content."</p>

<p>Asif appeared at a Lahore district court on Wednesday charged with cyber terrorism and was remanded to custody for one day, the official added.</p>

<p>The article with the false information was published on Channel3Now just hours after the attack and was widely cited in viral social media posts.</p>

<p>More than a dozen English towns and cities saw unrest and riots after the July 29 knife attack that killed three girls during a dance class in Southport.</p>

<p>The man charged with murder and attempted murder over the stabbing spree, Axel Rudakubana, was born in Britain to parents who hail from Rwanda, an overwhelmingly Christian country.</p>

<p>Officials have blamed far-right elements for helping to stir up the disorder.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scuba divers scouring the wreck of British tech magnate Mike Lynch's family yacht, which sank off Sicily two days ago, have found two bodies inside it, a source close to rescue operations said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>One of the bodies belonged to a heavily built man, the source said.</p>

<p>Rescue officials have been looking for six missing people, including Lynch, his 18-year-old daughter and Jonathan Bloomer, a non-executive chair of Morgan Stanley International.</p>

<p>The British-flagged Bayesian, a 56-metre-long (184-ft) superyacht, was carrying 22 people, and was anchored off the port of Porticello, near Palermo, when it capsized during a fierce storm on Monday.</p>

<p>Fifteen people survived, while the body of the onboard chef, Canadian-Antiguan national Recaldo Thomas, was found near the wreck hours after the disaster.</p>

<p>Inspection of the wreck, lying sideways at a depth of around 50 metres, was a "long and complex" operation, the Italian fire department said, with inside spaces obstructed by furniture and debris, and scuba divers having just 8-10 minutes beneath the water before needing to resurface.</p>

<p>Separately, the coast guard deployed a remotely operated vehicle to scan the seabed and take underwater pictures and videos that it said may provide "useful and timely elements" for prosecutors looking into the disaster.</p>

<p>The coast guard has been questioning survivors, including the captain of the Bayesian, and passengers on the yacht that was moored next to it who witnessed the ship going down, judicial sources said.</p>

<p>No one is under investigation at the moment, sources added.</p>

<h3><strong>MISSING PASSENGERS</strong></h3>

<p>Lynch, 59, is one of the UK's best-known tech entrepreneurs and has been referred to as the country's Bill Gates.</p>

<p>He built the UK's largest software firm, Autonomy, which was sold to HP for $11 billion in 2011, after which the deal spectacularly unravelled with the U.S. tech giant accusing him of fraud, resulting in a lengthy trial. Lynch was acquitted on all charges by a jury in San Francisco in June.</p>

<p>The other missing passengers were Bloomer's wife Judy, Clifford Chance lawyer Chris Morvillo and his wife, Neda Morvillo. Morvillo represented Lynch in the San Francisco trial, while Bloomer was a character witness on his behalf.</p>

<p>Experts have been at a loss to explain how a large luxury vessel, presumed to have top-class fittings and safety features, could have sunk within minutes, as recounted by witnesses. The yacht anchored next to it was unharmed by the tempest.</p>

<p>The Bayesian, which was owned by Lynch's wife, was built by Italian shipbuilder Perini in 2008 and last refitted in 2020. It had the world's tallest aluminium mast, measuring 72 metres, according to its makers.</p>

<h3><strong>BLACK SWAN EVENT</strong></h3>

<p>Its captain James Cutfield, a 51-year-old New Zealander who survived the shipwreck, was a "very good sailor" and "very well respected" in the Mediterranean, his brother Mark told The New Zealand Herald.</p>

<p>Matthew Schanck, chair of the Maritime Search and Rescue Council, a UK-based non-profit organisation that trains sea rescuers, said the Bayesian was the victim of a "high impact" weather-related incident.</p>

<p>"If it was a water spout, which it appears to be, it's what I would class as like a 'black swan' event," he told Reuters, referring to a rare and unpredictable phenomenon.</p>

<p>He said he was confident the authorities would "get to the bottom" of what caused the shipwreck, thanks to the accounts of survivors, witnesses and examination of the sunken hull, which did not show any apparent signs of damage.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Poland rolled out the red carpet for Prime Minister Narendra Modi today, hundreds of 'Indian Poles' are commemorating a historic facet of India-Poland relations which has been the bedrock of people-to-people ties between the two countries since the Second World War.</p>

<p>"One of the unique bonds between our countries relates to the time in the 1940s, during World War II, when more than 6,000 Polish women and children found refuge in two princely states in India, Jamnagar and Kolhapur. As you may be aware, Jam Sahib of Nawanagar had provided shelter to more than 1,000 Polish children, and others were offered refuge in Kolhapur," Tanmaya Lal, Secretary (West) at the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said earlier this week while announcing PM Modi's August 21-22 visit, the first by an Indian Prime Minister to Poland in the past 45 years.</p>

<p>While Digvijaysinhji Ranjitsinhji Jadeja, the Jam Sahib of Nawanagar who is known in Poland as the 'Good Maharaja', gave refuge to over 1,000 Polish children in the famous Balachadi camp, the royal family of Kolhapur provided safe haven to more than 5,000 Polish women and children in the equally-famous Valivade camp.</p>

<p>A monument, commemorating Jam Sahib Digvijaysinhji Ranjitsinhji Jadeja, was unveiled in October, 2014 at the Square of the Good Maharaja, Ochota District in Warsaw.</p>

<p>Another plaque commemorating the Valivade-Kolhapur camp near the Monte Casino War Memorial was inaugurated in November 2017 in Warsaw.</p>

<p>As many as eight Polish primary and secondary schools are also named after Jam Sahib.</p>

<p>During his historic visit, PM Modi is scheduled to visit these memorials that commemorate the very special episodes of Jamnagar and Kolhapur.</p>

<p>A large number of Polish refugees and their descendants have, over the last many decades, expressed their gratitude towards the two royal families of India by building memorials in Warsaw and organising annual events to keep the memories alive.</p>

<p>The Association of Poles in India, which reunites all the Polish people who lived between 1942 and 1948 in the two camps set up by the Maharajas of Jamnagar and Kolhapur, meets once in two years to recall and reiterate their gratitude and affection for the two royal families and the people of India.</p>

<p>During its last meeting held in Gdansk in September 2023, the first after the Covid pandemic, Jan Chendynski, the President of the Association, recounted "some of the happy childhood memories" that most of them had of the camps.</p>

<p>Nagma Mallick, India's Ambassador to Poland, who attended the meeting as a special invitee, acknowledged that the story of the Polish refugees was not as well-known in India as it deserved to be and also commended the Indian Poles for keeping this memory alive in Poland.</p>

<p>Commemorating the historic link, another event titled 'Remembering the Good Maharajas' was organised in the Old Orangery of the iconic Royal Lazienki park in July 2022 where 22 photographs from the camps of Valivade and Nawanagar depicting the lives of the Polish children in India during that period were exhibited for the guests.</p>

<p>Sambhaji Chhatrapati, the descendant of the Chhatrapati Shivaji and Piyushkumar Matalia, representative of the Jam Sahib of Nawanagar, especially flew from India to attend the event while former MP and President of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) Vinay Sahasrabuddhe and Ambassador Mallick, represented the Indian government at the event which was attended by a large number of Polish citizens who were in the camps as children.</p>

<p>According to the Indian Embassy in Poland, there is also a strong tradition of Indology studies in Poland, with Polish scholars having translated Sanskrit into Polish as early as in the 19th Century.</p>

<p>"Sanskrit was being studied at the 600-year-old Jagiellonian University in Krakow (the oldest in Poland) in 1860-61, with a Chair of Sanskrit having been established there in 1893.</p>

<p>The Indology Department of the Oriental Institute at the University of Warsaw (established in 1932) is the biggest centre for Indian studies in Central Europe," the MEA states.</p>

<p>Study of Indian languages, literature, culture and Indology is also pursued at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan and the University of Wroclaw.</p>

<p>ICCR sponsored the first Central &amp; Eastern European regional conference of Indology in Warsaw University in September 2005 in which 19 scholars from 11 countries participated.</p>

<p>An MoU for the establishment of an ICCR Chair of Indian studies at the Jagiellonian University was signed in February 2017 and two Indian professors have since been appointed as ICCR Chair Professors since the signing of the MoU.</p>

<p>"There are long-standing cultural ties between India and Poland, and Indology studies in Polish universities date back to the 19th century. There is respect and appreciation in Poland for Indian culture and spiritual ethos, including yoga and Ayurveda," said MEA's Secretary (West) Tanmaya Lal on Monday, ahead of the PM's visit to Poland.</p>

<p>In Warsaw, PM Modi will hold talks with the country's President Andrzej Duda on Thursday.</p>

<p>He is also scheduled to interact with members of the Indian community, select Polish business leaders and prominent Indologists.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In its latest beta release, WhatsApp is introducing a significant privacy feature designed to address one of the platform's most persistent issues--spam.</p>

<p>The new feature, available in the beta version 2.24.18.2 for Android, introduces a Username PIN system aimed at improving user security and curbing unwanted messages, according to GSM Arena.</p>

<p>This new functionality allows WhatsApp users to set a four-digit PIN in addition to their username.</p>

<p>The PIN serves as an extra layer of security, ensuring that users who have not interacted with you previously cannot send you messages solely by knowing your username.</p>

<p>This measure is expected to significantly reduce spam and enhance privacy for WhatsApp users, according to GSM Arena.</p>

<p>"Once implemented, this feature should greatly cut down on spam, which has been a prevalent issue on WhatsApp," said a spokesperson for the company, according to GSM Arena.</p>

<p>The PIN feature will require anyone who wishes to message you for the first time to know both your username and the PIN you have set.</p>

<p>Conversely, conversations with contacts you have previously interacted with will remain unaffected by the new username and PIN system.</p>

<p>The transition to using usernames will be seamless for these existing connections, allowing current chats to proceed as usual.</p>

<p>Despite the promising benefits of this new feature, it remains in the beta testing phase, and there is no confirmed timeline for its official release.</p>

<p>Given WhatsApp's typical development cycle, it may be some time before the username and PIN features are available to the general public, with a launch potentially not occurring before the end of the year, according to GSM Arena.</p>

<p>As WhatsApp continues to refine this feature, users are encouraged to stay updated on the progress through future beta releases.</p>

<p>The introduction of the Username PIN marks a proactive step by WhatsApp in addressing privacy concerns and improving the overall user experience on the platform.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities in central Iran executed a male fortune-teller for raping and sexually assaulting his clients, the judiciary said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"A fortuneteller, who assaulted women and girls was executed in Yazd prison," said Hossein Tahmasebi, chief justice of the central province, according to the Iranian judiciary's Mizan Online website.</p>

<p>"The sentence of this rapist fortune-teller was carried out after being issued by the Revolutionary Court of Yazd and confirmed by the supreme judicial authority".</p>

<p>According to Tahmasebi, the man had "assaulted and raped women and girls under false pretences", using his fortune-telling services to deceive his clients.</p>

<p>Mizan reported that the convict was arrested sometime between March 2020 and March 2021 and that his request for amnesty was rejected because of "the number of complaints" against him.</p>

<p>The Islamic republic maintains the death penalty for several crimes, including rape and sexual assault.</p>

<p>In July 2023, Iran executed three men after they were convicted of raping women they had lured to a fake cosmetic surgery clinic and injected with anaesthetic drugs.</p>

<p>They were found guilty of conspiring in 12 cases of sexual assault in late 2021 in the southern province of Hormozgan.</p>

<p>Iran executes more people per year than any other nation except China, according to human rights groups including Amnesty.</p>

<p>It generally carries out executions by hanging.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

</div>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be in Poland and Ukraine this week. Both visits are historic in their own ways: for Poland, this will be the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister in 45 years, while for Ukraine, Modi's will be the first-ever visit by an Indian Prime Minister. Where Modi has talked about India and Poland's "mutual commitment to democracy and pluralism" reinforcing the bilateral relationship, he has expressed "hope for an early return of peace and stability" in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Often, China and India are put in the same bracket when it comes to their response to the Ukraine war. But Modi's visit to the country, which follows his much-controversial trip to Russia last month, is why the world shouldn't compare them.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>India Is More Than Just A Mediator In Europe</strong></h2>

<p>Modi's visit to Russia last month raised a lot of eyebrows as it was also his first visit abroad in his third term. There is now talk of India becoming a potential peacemaker in the Russia-Ukraine war. But that is missing the woods for the trees. Modi will be in Ukraine to underline that New Delhi's position on the war remains consistent. Despite close ties with Russia and its decision not to publicly call out Russia as an aggressor, New Delhi has always maintained that the sanctity of territorial integrity and sovereignty remains inviolable in international affairs, and that dialogue and diplomacy is the only way to a sustainable outcome.</p>

<p>Unlike China, Modi publicly told Putin during his visit to Moscow that this was not the era of war, and expressed pain at the death of children after a lethal strike by Russia on Kyiv's main hospital for children. At that time, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had denounced Modi for visiting Russia, calling the trip a "devastating blow to peace efforts". But New Delhi has continued to maintain its ties with both Moscow and Kyiv throughout the course of the war over the last two and a half years, steadfast in its belief that both sides should be engaged if a lasting solution is to be found.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>A Renewed Vision For Europe</strong></h2>

<p>Europe is facing a moment of reckoning with growing internal challenges, a widening regional divide, a war that shows no signs of ending, a rising China, calls for isolationism in the US, and a fracturing of the post-Cold War security arrangement. The end of the Ukraine war will perhaps lay the foundations of a new security order in Europe, but that end is nowhere in sight as both sides search for favourable battlefield realities that they can potentially leverage at the negotiating table. It is at this critical juncture that Europe has started looking at India as a key partner.</p>

<p>And New Delhi has reciprocated. India now views Europe as central to its developmental and strategic priorities. This is borne by the extraordinary diplomatic investment the Modi government has made in imparting momentum to its ties with Europe. What has been an evolving feature of this outreach is India's attempts to engage with different sub-regions of Europe, allowing New Delhi to focus on their core strengths. It is Central Europe that is now the focus, with Modi visiting Austria last month followed by Poland and Ukraine now. The region has developed its own unique voice on European matters, and especially after the Russian invasion, it has been critical in shaping the larger European response to regional and global issues.</p>

<h2><strong>Why Poland Matters To New Delhi</strong></h2>

<p>As for Modi's visit to Poland, it is among the fastest-growing economies in Europe and has been vocal about its strategic aspirations to see Europe emerge as a key geopolitical actor on the global stage. Warsaw's role will also be critical in shaping the European security architecture once the embers of war in Ukraine cool down. Its location makes it a hub of connectivity across Europe, and India enjoys a lot of goodwill. If India is to move beyond France, Germany and the UK in its European imagination, then building strong economic ties with Poland will be critical. Modi's visit should lay the foundation for a long-term sustainable partnership with Warsaw.</p>

<p>It is in New Delhi's interest that a sustainable security architecture takes shape in Europe as European stability is critical for a globally engaged India with critical equities in that geography. New Delhi won't be playing the mediator. Its eyes are on the larger horizon, where India's emergence as a credible partner of Europe is seen as important for ensuring that its own developmental and strategic priorities remain insulated from wider disruption.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine fired 11 drones Wednesday at Moscow that Russia said were shot down during one of the largest strikes against the capital, while Ukrainian defences reported stopping 50 Russian drones and missiles.</p>

<p>The strikes on Moscow come amid a Ukrainian offensive in Russia's Kursk region -- which Kyiv has said is aimed at bringing the campaign launched by Russia in February 2022 closer to an end on "fair" terms.</p>

<p>"Eleven drones were destroyed" over Moscow and its surrounding region, the defence ministry said.</p>

<p>"This is one of the largest ever attempts to attack Moscow with drones," Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said.</p>

<p>In total, 45 drones from Ukraine were destroyed by the Russian air defense systems, according to the Russian defense ministry.</p>

<p>Sobyanin said in an earlier post that no damage or casualties had been reported.</p>

<p>Drone attacks on Moscow are rare, with Russia saying in May it had downed a drone outside the capital, forcing restrictions to be imposed at two major airports in the city for under an hour.</p>

<p>In the night from Tuesday to Wednesday, a total of 72 air targets were detected over Ukraine, according to Ukrainian Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk.</p>

<p>Fifty drones and a guided missile were shot down, he said in a post on Telegram.</p>

<p>Kyiv was one of the locations targeted.</p>

<p>"The enemy continues to attack our region with strike drones. The air raid lasted all night and into the morning for more than nine hours," Kyiv's military administration said on Telegram.</p>

<p>A private house was damaged as a result of falling debris from the downed targets, and power lines were cut, it added.</p>

<p>Since August 6, Ukraine has mounted an unprecedented cross-border assault into Russia's Kursk region, where it claims to control more than 80 settlements.</p>

<p>Kyiv has also repeatedly targeted oil and gas facilities in Russia since the conflict began in 2022, some hundreds of kilometres from its borders, in what it has called "fair" retaliation for massive attacks on its energy infrastructure.</p>

<p>Ukrainian drones attacked an oil storage facility in Russia's southern Rostov region on Sunday, sparking a large fire, the local governor said.</p>

<p>The blaze in the city of Proletarsk was still raging on Wednesday, Russian media reported.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised his forces for hitting oil facilities in Russia, saying the attacks would help bring a "just end" to the conflict.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 116-year-old Japanese woman who used to be a mountaineer is set to be named the world's oldest person by Guinness World Records, a research group said on Wednesday, following the death of a 117-year-old Spanish woman earlier this week.</p>

<p>Tomiko Itooka, who was born on May 23, 1908, lives in the western Japanese city of Ashiya, the US-based Gerontology Research Group said.</p>

<p>She is next in line for the title of world's oldest person after Maria Branyas Morera died in a Spanish nursing home on Monday, according to the group.</p>

<p>Ms Itooka, a mother-of-three, was born in the year when a long-distance radio message was sent from the Eiffel Tower for the first time, and when the Wright Brothers made their first public flights in Europe and America.</p>

<p>In her 70s, Ms Itooka often went climbing and twice scaled Japan's 3,067-metre (10,062-ft) Mount Ontake - surprising her guide by climbing the mountain in sneakers instead of hiking boots, the research group said.</p>

<p>At the age of 100, she walked up the lengthy stone steps of Japan's Ashiya Shrine without using a cane, the group added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ahead of his visit to Ukrainian capital Kyiv, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said he was looking forward to sharing perspectives with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two days ahead of his crucial visit to Ukrainian capital Kyiv, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said he was looking forward to sharing perspectives with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict.</p>

<p>The prime minister's comments came shortly before he embarked on a two-nation trip to Poland and Ukraine. In the first leg of the visit, PM Modi is visiting Polish capital city Warsaw on August 21 and 22.</p>

<p>PM Modi will be in Kyiv for around seven hours on August 23 in the first visit by an Indian prime minister to Ukraine since the country became independent in 1991.</p>

<p>In a departure statement, PM Modi, referring to the Ukraine conflict, said that as a "friend and partner", India hopes for an early return of peace and stability in the region.</p>

<p>"From Poland, I will be visiting Ukraine at the invitation of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This is the first-ever visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Ukraine," he said.</p>

<p>"I look forward to the opportunity to build upon earlier conversations with President Zelenskyy on strengthening bilateral cooperation and share perspectives on peaceful resolution of the ongoing Ukraine conflict," he said.</p>

<p>"As a friend and partner, we hope for an early return of peace and stability in the region," he added.</p>

<p>PM Modi said he was confident that his visit to Warsaw and Kyiv "will serve as a natural continuation of extensive contacts with the two countries and help create the foundation for stronger and more vibrant relations in the years ahead".</p>

<p>The prime minister will travel to Kyiv from Poland in a 'Rail Force One' train that will take around 10 hours. The return trip will also be of the same duration.</p>

<p>A number of world leaders including US President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited Kyiv by train after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>PM Modi's visit to Kyiv comes nearly six weeks after his high-profile trip to Moscow which triggered criticism from the US and some of its Western allies.</p>

<p>India has not yet condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and has been calling for resolution of the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy.</p>

<p>In his summit talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last month, PM Modi said that a solution to the Ukraine conflict is not possible on the battlefield and peace talks do not succeed amidst bombs and bullets.</p>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Monday said PM Modi's visit to Ukraine would be a "landmark and historic" one.</p>

<p>"Lasting peace can only be achieved through options that are acceptable to both parties. And it can only be a negotiated settlement," said Tanmaya Lal, Secretary (West) in the MEA.</p>

<p>"On our part, India continues to engage with all stakeholders," he said.</p>

<p>On his visit to Poland, PM Modi said he was looking forward to meeting Prime Minister Donald Tusk and President Andrzej Duda.</p>

<p>"My visit to Poland comes as we mark 70 years of our diplomatic relations. Poland is a key economic partner in Central Europe," he said.</p>

<p>"Our mutual commitment to democracy and pluralism further reinforces our relationship. I look forward to meeting my friend Prime Minister Donald Tusk and President Andrzej Duda to further advance our partnership," he said.</p>

<p>"I will also engage with the members of the vibrant Indian community in Poland," PM Modi said.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[The child gained access to a gun and unintentionally shot the man, leaving him in critical condition.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a shocking incident, a two-year-old child accidentally shot a man Monday morning in a Chesterfield County, Virginia home. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/man-critical-condition-after-shot-2-year/story?id=112995896">ABC News</a></em>, the child&nbsp;gained access to a gun and unintentionally shot the man, leaving him in critical condition.</p>

<p>The incident happened on August 19, when police responded to a reported shooting at a residence in the 4400 block of Butler Lane around 10 a.m. Upon arrival, officers found the victim with a gunshot wound and immediately provided medical attention. The man was subsequently airlifted to the hospital for further treatment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chesterfield Police later confirmed some details to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59vV8TxMaHY">CBS 6 News</a></em>.</p>

<p>''It appears that the following events occurred: The victim was preparing to leave the house and had placed his handgun on a nearby chair when a child, who is nearly 3 years old, retrieved the gun. The child accidentally discharged the firearm, shooting the victim. The child was not injured and no one else in the house was injured. Again, the investigation is ongoing,'' a Chesterfield Police spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Virginia ABC affiliate&nbsp;<em><a data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/chesterfield-county/police-say-2-year-old-accidentally-shoots-man-in-chesterfield-home/" target="_blank">WRIC</a>,</em> the victim is the boyfriend of the child's mother.</p>

<p>Neighbour Lisa Wood said she saw the child shortly after the shooting.</p>

<p>"After I went into the house, he was sitting there like a normal kid. It's not like, you know, he's worried, or, you know, anything like that. He still has a smile," she said.</p>

<p>Other neighbours who spoke with<em> CBS 6</em> expressed their wishes for the victim's full recovery and agreed that the incident serves as a stark reminder of the crucial importance of gun safety measures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''Bad things happen whenever you're not responsible with your stuff. And it, really, really sucks that it had to be a child. And, you know, hopefully, this adult will pull through because, like, this — this sucks. Today was just a day that, you know, that wasn't good,'' Ms Wood said.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[A 40-year-old Indian doctor was held in a US jail on a USD 2 million bond after being charged with multiple sex crimes for allegedly recording hundreds of nude images and videos of children and women over several years, according to media reports.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 40-year-old Indian doctor was held in a US jail on a USD 2 million bond after being charged with multiple sex crimes for allegedly recording hundreds of nude images and videos of children and women over several years, according to media reports.</p>

<p>Oumair Aejaz was arrested earlier on August 8 after he allegedly placed hidden cameras in a variety of settings from bathrooms, changing areas, hospital rooms, and even his own home where he would record children as young as 2 years old in varying states of undress, Fox News reported.</p>

<p>Authorities became aware of his offences after his wife came forward with disturbing materials. Before his arrest, he had no criminal history.</p>

<p>He also allegedly recorded sexual encounters with numerous women who were unconscious or asleep, the Oakland County Sheriff said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The magnitude of Aejaz's offences is not currently known, but Sheriff Mike Bouchard said it will take months to fully investigate. Authorities suspect there could be many more victims as investigators review thousands of videos found at his home in Rochester Hills, a city in Oakland County in the US state of Michigan.</p>

<p>"The victimisation is so broad and the perversion so great, we're just beginning to wrap our arms around it," he said. "Disturbing on so many levels." He equated the scale of criminality to Larry Nasser, the disgraced sports doctor convicted of abusing dozens of young women in his care.</p>

<p>Several search warrants have been served since Aejaz was arrested on August 8 at his home. They include computers, phones, and 15 external devices. Bouchard said a single hard drive had 13,000 videos on it.</p>

<p>He may have uploaded videos into cloud storage as well.</p>

<p>Aejaz was charged on August 13 with one count of child sexually abusive activity, four counts of capturing an image of an unclothed person and five counts of using a computer to commit a crime and is being held in the Oakland County Jail on a USD 2 million bond, Detroit Free Press reported.</p>

<p>Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald said Aejaz's wife produced materials earlier this month that were concerning and the sheriff's office immediately executed a search warrant and confiscated more devices. She said investigators have "sifted through really jarring, alarming images" and continue to do so.</p>

<p>McDonald said Aejaz also preyed on well-respected institutions and hospitals, which she said have been cooperative.</p>

<p>Many of the allegations stem from Aejaz allegedly recording a mother and her kids inside a changing room at the Goldfish Swimming Club in 2023. However, he is also believed to have assaulted patients inside hospital rooms.</p>

<p>"These are children and moms at a swim school," McDonald said. "They're there to teach their kids to swim. Because that brings their kids joy and because they want their kids to be safe around water. They were victimised by a person of trust in the community – a medical doctor." His work history shows he was employed at Henry Ford Macomb Hospital in Clinton Township and Ascension Genesys Hospital in Grand Blanc. His current employment was as a physician contracted with a company that would send him to different hospitals.</p>

<p>Before that, he moved to the US in 2011 on a work visa from India, where he is a citizen. His residency took place at Sinai Grace Hospital before spending time in Alabama. He returned to Michigan in 2018.</p>

<p>Due to the number of victims and the difficulty identifying them, police have provided an email that people can use to contact the authorities.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Romanian authorities on Wednesday searched the home of controversial influencer Andrew Tate, who is awaiting trial over human trafficking and rape charges, as part of a new investigation, officials said.</p>

<p>One of the world's best-known influencers known for misogynist and sometimes violent maxims, Andrew Tate has been accused of having formed an organised criminal network in early 2021 in Romania and Britain, along with his brother Tristan. They have denied the charges.</p>

<p>Prosecutors allege that 37-year-old Tate, his 36-year-old brother and two women set up a criminal organisation and sexually exploited several victims. A trial date has not yet been set.</p>

<p>On Wednesday prosecutors "conducted a raid this morning, on August 21, 2024, at the residence of the Tate brothers as part of a search related to a new investigation", prosecutors said in a statement.</p>

<p>The Office for Organised Crime (DIICOT), said that four search warrants were executed, in connection with "the crimes of forming an organised criminal group, trafficking in minors", "sexual relations with a minor" and "money laundering".</p>

<p>Neither of the statements indicated whether the new charges targeted the brothers.</p>

<p>They were detained in 2022 in Bucharest and spent three months in detention before being released under judicial supervision to await trial.</p>

<p>The brothers also face rape and assault allegations in separate cases in Britain, where they have also been accused of tax evasion.</p>

<p>In 2016, Tate appeared on the "Big Brother" reality television show in Britain but was removed after a video emerged showing him attacking a woman.</p>

<p>He then turned to social media platforms to promote his divisive views.</p>

<p>Giving tips on how to be successful, along with misogynistic and sometimes violent maxims, his videos have made him one of the world's best-known influencers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Though there are only a handful of them among thousands of delegates, the "Uncommitted Movement" delegates at the Democratic National Convention are among the most vocal.</p>

<p>The delegates plan to voice their discontent with the war in Gaza at the party's convention this week in Chicago, during which <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-2024-kamala-harris-arrives-in-chicago-ahead-of-democratic-convention-6367700" target="_blank">Vice President Kamala Harris</a> will formally accept the Democratic Party's nomination in the close race for the White House.</p>

<p>The 30 "Uncommitted Movement" delegates hail from eight different US states and claim to represent some 700,000 voters.</p>

<p>Though they welcomed the news of President Joe Biden dropping out of the race on July 21, they have met Harris's subsequent ascension with caution and skepticism.</p>

<p>"The party needed change," Minnesota delegate Asma Mohammed told AFP. "I don't feel sad about someone who has unapologetically supported a genocidal regime in Israel."</p>

<p>Mohammed came to Chicago hoping to see a renewed perspective within her party, but she said she is disappointed that the convention has no pro-Palestinian voices on the speaker list.</p>

<p>"I know she's (Harris) more empathetic than Joe Biden, I've seen that," Mohammed said. "But those words are not enough. That needs to be followed by policy."</p>

<p>The Uncommitted Movement advocated for adding Tanya Haj-Hassan to the speaker list, wanting the thousands of attendees to hear from a doctor who has treated victims of the conflict between Israel and operatives group Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>However, all that has been permitted at the event so far is a panel at the nearby McCormick Center, outside the main venue. During the panel, the pediatrician described the horrors of war, bringing the audience to tears.</p>

<h3><strong>Both sides</strong></h3>

<p>Among the speakers slated for the DNC are some relatives of the 251 hostages taken by Hamas on Oct. 7 when it sparked the conflict by attacking Israel, which also left 1,199 dead, according to an AFP tally based on official data.</p>

<p>"Why does it have to be one or the other?" asked Mohammed, who emphasized that more than 40,000 people have died in Gaza from Israel's retaliation, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.</p>

<p>For her, there is room to listen to both sides.</p>

<p>Jacob Schonberger, a 17-year-old delegate representing the state of Connecticut, is not part of the "Uncommitted Movement" but shares the sentiment. He arrived at the convention wearing buttons with slogans in support of Israel.</p>

<p>"I think it should be leadership's decision... I have my personal beliefs, but I think that it's important to have both sides," he said.</p>

<p>In addition to the "Uncommitted Movement," protests fomented outside the United Center, the venue for the convention, where hundreds of people chanted "Free Palestine!"</p>

<p>Inside the arena, some delegates covered their mouths as Biden gave his speech Monday night, a gesture made in protest of his response to the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>"We wanted to send the message that we don't agree with what Biden has been doing," said Sabrene Odeh, a delegate from Washington state.</p>

<p>While the DNC is underway, Biden's Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, is on a tour of the Middle East in a new attempt to secure a truce between Israel and Hamas.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Scientific discovery is one of the most sophisticated human activities. Can and should a complex process be automated?]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientific discovery is one of the most sophisticated human activities. First, scientists must understand the existing knowledge and identify a significant gap. Next, they must formulate a research question and design and conduct an experiment in pursuit of an answer. Then, they must analyse and interpret the results of the experiment, which may raise yet another research question.</p>

<p>Can a process this complex be automated? Last week, <a href="https://sakana.ai/ai-scientist/">Sakana AI Labs announced</a> the creation of an “AI scientist” – an artificial intelligence system they claim can make scientific discoveries in the area of machine learning in a fully automated way.</p>

<p>Using generative large language models (LLMs) like those behind ChatGPT and other AI chatbots, the system can brainstorm, select a promising idea, code new algorithms, plot results, and write a paper summarising the experiment and its findings, complete with references. Sakana claims the AI tool can undertake the complete lifecycle of a scientific experiment at a cost of just US$15 per paper – less than the cost of a scientist's lunch.</p>

<p>These are some big claims. Do they stack up? And even if they do, would an army of AI scientists churning out research papers with inhuman speed really be good news for science?</p>

<h2>How a computer can ‘do science'</h2>

<p>A lot of science is done in the open, and almost all scientific knowledge has been written down somewhere (or we wouldn't have a way to “know” it). Millions of scientific papers are freely available online in repositories such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubMed</a>.</p>

<p>LLMs trained with this data capture the language of science and its patterns. It is therefore perhaps not at all surprising that a generative LLM can produce something that looks like a good scientific paper – it has ingested many examples that it can copy.</p>

<p>What is less clear is whether an AI system can produce an <em>interesting</em> scientific paper. Crucially, good science requires novelty.</p>

<h2>But is it interesting?</h2>

<p>Scientists don't want to be told about things that are already known. Rather, they want to learn new things, especially new things that are significantly different from what is already known. This requires judgement about the scope and value of a contribution.</p>

<p>The Sakana system tries to address interestingness in two ways. First, it “scores” new paper ideas for similarity to existing research (indexed in the <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/">Semantic Scholar</a> repository). Anything too similar is discarded.</p>

<p>Second, Sakana's system introduces a “peer review” step – using another LLM to judge the quality and novelty of the generated paper. Here again, there are plenty of examples of peer review online on sites such as <a href="https://openreview.net">openreview.net</a> that can guide how to critique a paper. LLMs have ingested these, too.</p>

<h2>AI may be a poor judge of AI output</h2>

<p>Feedback is mixed on Sakana AI's output. Some have described it as producing “<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/research-ai-model-unexpectedly-modified-its-own-code-to-extend-runtime/">endless scientific slop</a>”.</p>

<p>Even the system's own review of its outputs judges the papers weak at best. This is likely to improve as the technology evolves, but the question of whether automated scientific papers are valuable remains.</p>

<p>The ability of LLMs to judge the quality of research is also an open question. My own work (soon to be published in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/17592887">Research Synthesis Methods</a>) shows LLMs are not great at judging the risk of bias in medical research studies, though this too may improve over time.</p>

<p>Sakana's system automates discoveries in computational research, which is much easier than in other types of science that require physical experiments. Sakana's experiments are done with code, which is also structured text that LLMs can be trained to generate.</p>

<h2>AI tools to support scientists, not replace them</h2>

<p>AI researchers have been developing systems to support science for decades. Given the huge volumes of published research, even finding publications relevant to a specific scientific question can be challenging.</p>

<p>Specialised search tools make use of AI to help scientists find and synthesise existing work. These include the above-mentioned Semantic Scholar, but also newer systems such as <a href="https://elicit.com/">Elicit</a>, <a href="https://www.researchrabbit.ai/">Research Rabbit</a>, <a href="https://scite.ai/">scite</a> and <a href="https://consensus.app/">Consensus</a>.</p>

<p>Text mining tools such as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator3/">PubTator</a> dig deeper into papers to identify key points of focus, such as specific genetic mutations and diseases, and their established relationships. This is especially useful for curating and organising scientific information.</p>

<p>Machine learning has also been used to support the synthesis and analysis of medical evidence, in tools such as <a href="https://www.robotreviewer.net/">Robot Reviewer</a>. Summaries that compare and contrast claims in papers from <a href="https://www.scholarcy.com/">Scholarcy</a> help to perform literature reviews.</p>

<p>All these tools aim to help scientists do their jobs more effectively, not to replace them.</p>

<h2>AI research may exacerbate existing problems</h2>

<p>While Sakana AI <a href="https://sakana.ai/ai-scientist/#limitations-and-challenges">states</a> it doesn't see the role of human scientists diminishing, the company's vision of “a fully AI-driven scientific ecosystem” would have major implications for science.</p>

<p>One concern is that, if AI-generated papers flood the scientific literature, future AI systems may be trained on AI output and undergo <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y">model collapse</a>. This means they may become increasingly ineffectual at innovating.</p>

<p>However, the implications for science go well beyond impacts on AI science systems themselves.</p>

<p>There are already bad actors in science, including “paper mills” churning out <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00159-9">fake papers</a>. This problem will only <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01780-w">get worse</a> when a scientific paper can be produced with US$15 and a vague initial prompt.</p>

<p>The need to check for errors in a mountain of automatically generated research could rapidly overwhelm the capacity of actual scientists. The peer review system is arguably <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-peer-review-system-is-broken-we-asked-academics-how-to-fix-it-187034">already broken</a>, and dumping more research of questionable quality into the system won't fix it.</p>

<p>Science is fundamentally based on trust. Scientists emphasise the integrity of the scientific process so we can be confident our understanding of the world (and now, the world's machines) is valid and improving.</p>

<p>A scientific ecosystem where AI systems are key players raises fundamental questions about the meaning and value of this process, and what level of trust we should have in AI scientists. Is this the kind of scientific ecosystem we want?<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the heart of the Middle East, where power and tradition are deeply intertwined, one man has risen to hold the reins of a nation known for its strict adherence to conservative values and immense wealth derived from oil. Mohammed bin Salman, commonly referred to as MBS, is the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia. As per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gz8934wrro">BBC insiders</a>, his rise to power has been nothing short of dramatic, marked by bold decisions, ruthless tactics and a vision for transforming his kingdom.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Midnight Plans</strong></h2>

<p>In the hushed corridors of power in Riyadh, as Saudi Arabia prepared for a significant transition in 2015, a young prince, then barely known beyond the borders of his kingdom, was already laying the groundwork for a seismic shift. But MBS, then only 29 years old, nurtured immense ambition. After the death of King Abdullah, his father, Salman, was poised to ascend the throne. And that's where MBS saw an opportunity to reshape Saudi Arabia - and his role in it.</p>

<p>Aware of the potential threats from within the family, MBS acted decisively. One night, he called a senior security official, Saad al-Jabri, to the palace for a secret meeting. Both men left their mobile phones outside the room, and MBS even disconnected the landline to ensure complete privacy.</p>

<h2><strong>Vision 2030</strong></h2>

<p>During this tense, late-night meeting, MBS laid out his ambitious vision (known as Vision 2030) for Saudi Arabia. He believed that the kingdom, long known for its conservative values and reliance on oil, needed to wake up from its "deep slumber" and claim its place on the global stage. His plan included selling a stake in Aramco, the world's most profitable company, to kickstart the country's economic transformation.</p>

<p>He also aimed to invest billions in technology startups like Uber and to bring millions of Saudi women into the workforce, creating six million new jobs. This plan also included bold initiatives such as the development of the futuristic city NEOM and investments in tourism. These reforms would later be widely praised as necessary steps to bring Saudi Arabia into the 21st century.</p>

<h2><strong>'Have You Heard Of Alexander The Great?'</strong></h2>

<p>When Jabri, amazed by MBS'&nbsp;grand vision, asked about the scope of his ambitions, the young prince responded simply, "Have you heard of Alexander the Great?" It was clear that MBS saw himself as a leader destined to make history.</p>

<p>What was supposed to be a short meeting lasted three hours, according to insiders. By the time Jabri left, he had missed several calls from concerned colleagues. This midnight conversation marked the beginning of a new era for Saudi Arabia, one that would be shaped by the rise of MBS.</p>

<h2><strong>Plot To Kill The King?</strong></h2>

<p>In 2014, MBS, was eager for his father to become king. He allegedly suggested killing his uncle using a poisoned ring from Russia. Saad al-Jabri, in an interview with the BBC, claims to have seen a secret video of MBS discussing this idea. It is unclear if MBS was serious or just joking. After this, MBS was not allowed to attend royal meetings and shake hands with the king for a while. Eventually, King Abdullah died of natural causes, and his brother Salman became king in 2015 and MBS was appointed Defense Minister and Deputy Crown Prince.</p>

<p>As MBS's father, King Salman, became increasingly frail, the crown prince assumed de facto control of Saudi Arabia. MBS has begun implementing ambitious plans, but his rule has also been marked by allegations of human rights abuses, including suppressing free speech, using the death penalty, and jailing women's rights activists, as per a BBC report.&nbsp;</p>

<p>MBS has a tendency to act impulsively, often ignoring advice from others, Saad-al Jabri revealed in the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gz8934wrro">exclusive BBC interview</a>. The senior official revealed that the ruler has a vision for Saudi Arabia, but his methods are often reckless and disregard traditional decision-making processes.</p>

<h2><strong>The Yemen War</strong></h2>

<p>One such example is the Yemen war. In 2015, MBS led a group of Gulf countries into war against the Houthi movement in Yemen. He saw the Houthis as supported by Iran, a rival of Saudi Arabia. The war caused a huge humanitarian crisis, with millions of people at risk of starvation. A former British ambassador, Sir John Jenkins, said it was not a clever decision. The US military only had 12 hours' notice of the war, which is very unusual.</p>

<h2><strong>MBS Forged His Father's Signature</strong></h2>

<p>Jabri also claims MBS forged his father's signature on a royal decree committing ground troops, despite warnings from the Americans. Saad al-Jabri claims he discussed the Yemen war with the White House before it started. He says Susan Rice, President Obama's advisor, warned him that the US would only support air strikes, not ground troops. But Jabri says MBS ignored the US and forged his father's signature to send ground troops. Jabri's source was someone he trusted, linked to the Ministry of Interior.</p>

<h2><strong>Jamal Khashoggi's Killing</strong></h2>

<p>One of the darkest chapters in MBS's rule is the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Khashoggi, a vocal critic of MBS, was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by a 15-member hit squad. The operatives travelled on diplomatic passports, and many were part of MBS' personal security detail, implicating the crown prince in the murder in ways that are difficult to dismiss. Khashoggi's body was never found and is believed to have been dismembered with a bone saw.</p>

<p>While MBS has always denied direct involvement, he acknowledged in 2019 that, as the country's leader, he bears "responsibility" for the crime. However, a declassified US intelligence report released in February 2021 stated that MBS was likely complicit in the killing. In the aftermath, those close to MBS observed a shift in his demeanour. The crown prince was reportedly shocked at the global reaction following the murder. A former US diplomat who met MBS after the incident noted that the prince described the murder as a "colossal blunder" and insisted he had not authorised it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2017, MBS spent $450m on a famous painting called the Salvator Mundi. The painting is of Jesus Christ and has been missing for almost seven years. Some say it's stored in Geneva, and MBS plans to display it in a future museum in Riyadh.</p>

<p>MBS' plans for sports are also ambitious, with Saudi Arabia bidding to host the FIFA World Cup and investing in tennis and golf tournaments. Some call this "sportswashing," but MBS wants to show his power and make Saudi Arabia great.</p>

<p>MBS' father, King Salman, is now 88 years old. Sooner or later, MBS will rule over Saudi Arabia for decades.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A crocodile killed a woman bathing in a river in eastern Indonesia, police and locals said Wednesday, with villagers later recovering parts of her body from the slaughtered animal.</p>

<p>Indonesia is home to several species of crocodiles that regularly attack and kill humans.</p>

<p>Halima Rahakbauw, 54, was swimming in a river in Wali village on the Maluku islands after spending Tuesday morning looking for clams when the reptile struck.</p>

<p>Rahakbauw's neighbour, Rustam Ilyas, said relatives and friends started a search when she failed to return home.</p>

<p>After spotting a sandal and a body part in the river, villagers reported the incident to police who killed the reptile.</p>

<p>"The villagers had to cut open the crocodile's belly to remove some of the victim's body parts," a local police officer, who requested anonymity as he was not authorised to speak on the matter, told AFP Wednesday.</p>

<p>"The crocodile was quite big, around four metres (12 feet)long," neighbour Ilyas told AFP.</p>

<p>Neither the police nor villagers could identify the species.</p>

<p>On Sunday, a 63-year-old tin miner was killed by a crocodile near a river on Bangka island in Sumatra.</p>

<p>In 2018, a mob in Indonesia's easternmost region of Papua butchered nearly 300 crocodiles in revenge after a local man was killed by one of the reptiles.</p>

<p>In 2019 a scientist was dragged by a huge captive crocodile into its enclosure and killed on the island of Sulawesi.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Defence Minister Rajnath Singh will be on a four-day visit to the US beginning Friday to further boost the comprehensive global strategic partnership between the two countries.</p>

<p>In Washington, Rajnath Singh will hold talks with Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan among others.</p>

<p>India's plan to procure 31 MQ-9B Predator drones, the proposed joint manufacturing of Stryker infantry combat vehicles and co-production of GE F414 engines in India are likely to figure prominently in Singh's talks with Austin, officials said today.</p>

<p>"The visit is expected to further deepen and broaden the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership," the defence ministry said announcing Singh's trip to the US from August 23 to 26.</p>

<p>"The visit comes in the backdrop of the growing momentum in India-US relations and defence engagements at multiple levels," it said.</p>

<p>Rajnath Singh will also chair a high-level round-table meeting with the US defence industry on the ongoing and future defence collaborations. He will also interact with the Indian community during the visit.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Daniela Larreal Chirinos, one of Venezuela's best-known athletes and five-time Olympian, has been found dead at her Las Vegas apartment. The retired cyclist reportedly choked on her food, police said.</p>

<p>When Ms&nbsp;Chirinos did not turn up at the Las Vegas hotel where she worked, she was checked on and her body was found at her apartment, according to FOX Sports. The 50-year-old is believed to have died on August 11.</p>

<h3><strong>Who Was Daniela&nbsp;Larreal Chirinos?</strong></h3>

<p>One of the finest athletes ever to represent Venezuela, Daniela Larreal Chirinos is a two-time gold medalist in the Pan American Games and the Pan American Championships. Ms&nbsp;Chirinos featured in five Olympics editions.</p>

<p>She made her Olympics debut in Barcelona way back in 1992 and participated in four Olympic events -- Atlanta (1996), Sydney (2000), Athens (2004) and London (2012). She also clinched two gold medals at the Central American and Caribbean Games in San Salvador, 2002.</p>

<p>Apart from a storied career in cycling, Ms&nbsp;Chirinos was also active in Venezuelan politics. A vocal critic of former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez, the Olympian accused the late president and his sports minister Hector Rodriguez of funneling money out of the country in the name of sponsoring a "non-existent" racing driver.</p>

<p>In 2013, upon Nicolás Maduro's arrival at the helm in Venezuela, Ms&nbsp;Chirinos called his presidency a dictatorship. She was forced into exile and banned from entering Venezuela. Before moving to Las Vegas where she worked as a food server, Ms&nbsp;Chirinos was an Uber driver in Miami.</p>

<h3><strong>How did she die?</strong></h3>

<p>While the “cause and method” of her death was still under investigation, police suspected she died from asphyxiation after they reportedly found solid food remains in her windpipe, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/20/daniela-larreal-chirinos-olympian-dead">The Guardian</a> reported.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the Clark County Coroner's Office said an official cause of death was still pending.</p>

<p>The Comité Olímpico Venezolano (Venezuelan Olympic Committee) shared on X a heartfelt tribute with a picture of Ms&nbsp;Chirinos holding a medal.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine attacked Moscow on Wednesday with at least 11 drones shot down by air defences in what Russian officials said was one of the biggest drone strikes on the capital since the war in Ukraine began in February 2022.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-were-set-for-ceasefire-talks-in-doha-then-a-shock-assault-6362125" target="_blank">The war</a>, largely a grinding artillery and drone battle across the fields, forests and villages of eastern Ukraine, escalated on Aug. 6 when Ukraine sent thousands of soldiers into Russia's western Kursk region.</p>

<p>For months, Ukraine has also fought an increasingly damaging drone war against the refineries and airfields of the world's second largest oil exporter, though major drone attacks on the Moscow region - with a population of over 21 million - are rarer.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry said it destroyed a total of 45 drones over Russian territory, including 11 over the Moscow region, 23 over the border region of Bryansk, six over the Belgorod region, three over the Kaluga region and two over the Kursk region.</p>

<p>Some of the drones were destroyed over the city of Podolsk, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said. The city in the Moscow region is some 38 kms (24 miles) south of the Kremlin.</p>

<p>"This is one of the largest attempts to attack Moscow using drones ever," Sobyanin said on the Telegram messaging app in the early hours of Wednesday.</p>

<p>"The layered defence of Moscow that was created made it possible to successfully repel all the attacks from the enemy UAVs."</p>

<p>The attack comes as Russia is advancing in eastern Ukraine, where it controls about 18% of the territory, and battling to repel Ukraine's incursion into the Kursk region, the biggest foreign attack on Russian territory since World War Two.</p>

<p>Russian media showed unverified footage of drones whirring over the dawn sky of the Moscow region and then being shot down in a ball of flame by air defences.</p>

<p>Moscow's airports Vnukovo, Domodedovo and Zhukovsky limited flights for four hours but were restarted normal operations from 0330 GMT, Russia's aviation watchdog said.</p>

<p>Sobyanin said that according to preliminary information, there were no injuries or damage reported in the aftermath of the attacks. There were also no casualties or damage reported in the aftermath of the attack on Bryansk in Russia's southwest, the governor of the region Alexander Bogomaz wrote on Telegram.</p>

<p>Russia's RIA state news agency reported that two drones were destroyed over the Tula region, which borders the Moscow region to its north. Vasily Golubev, governor of the Rostov region in Russia's southwest, said air defence forces destroyed a Ukraine-launched missile over the region, with no injuries reported.</p>

<p>The Russia defence ministry did not mention neither Tula nor Rostov in its statement listing destroyed Ukrainian air weapons. Ukraine's military said on Wednesday it overnight struck an S-300 anti-aircraft missile system based in Rostov region.</p>

<p>Reuters could not independently verify the reports.</p>

<p>The drone attack on Moscow is on a par with the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/russia-alleges-ukraine-attempted-to-assassinate-vladimir-putin-4001694" target="_blank">May 2023 attack</a> when at least eight drones were destroyed over the capital in an attack President Vladimir Putin said was Kyiv's attempt to scare and provoke Russia.</p>

<p>In Kursk, Russian war bloggers said that intense battles were ongoing along the front in the region where Ukraine has carved out at least 450 square km (175 square miles) of Russian territory.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sudan's priceless archaeological heritage is being stripped from museums, with looters loading statuettes and fragments of ancient palaces onto lorries, smuggling them out of the war-torn country, and selling them online.</p>

<p>More than a year of war between rival generals has killed tens of thousands of people, forced millions more to flee their homes, and left the country's prized antiquities at the mercy of pillagers.</p>

<p>On Thursday, UNESCO, the United Nations's cultural body, said the "threat to culture appears to have reached an unprecedented level, with reports of looting of museums, heritage and archaeological sites and private collections".</p>

<p>In the capital Khartoum, where fighting broke out in April 2023 between the army and paramilitary forces, the recently renovated Sudan National Museum has had prized artefacts stolen, archaeologists and officials say.</p>

<p>The museum houses prehistoric artefacts from the Palaeolithic era and items from the famed site of Kerma in northern Sudan, as well as Pharaonic and Nubian pieces.</p>

<p>First opened in 1971, the museum was founded in part to house objects rescued from an area due to be flooded by the construction of Egypt's massive Aswan dam.</p>

<p>Now, its artefacts are under threat from war.</p>

<p>"The Sudan National Museum has been the subject of major looting," said Ikhlas Abdel Latif, head of museums at the national antiquities authority.</p>

<p>"Archaeological objects stored there have been taken in big lorries and transferred to the west and to border areas, particularly near South Sudan," she told AFP.</p>

<h3><strong>'Refrain' from trade&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The extent of the looting is hard to determine because the museum is located in an area controlled by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).</p>

<p>Officials and experts have accused the RSF of looting the site. Contacted by AFP, a spokesman for the force did not comment.</p>

<p>In May, the RSF said it was being "vigilant" in "protecting and preserving the antiquities of the Sudanese people".</p>

<p>Throughout history, fighters have used plunder to fund their war efforts.</p>

<p>UNESCO said it was calling on "the public and the art market... in the region and worldwide to refrain" from trading in Sudanese items.</p>

<p>The agency also said it was planning training in the Egyptian capital Cairo for law enforcement and the judiciary from Sudan's neighbours.</p>

<p>"Because of the war, the museum and the artefacts are not being monitored," said Hassan Hussein, a researcher and former director of the National Antiquities Authority.</p>

<p>The army, led by Sudan's de facto ruler Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, is locked in conflict with the RSF, which is led by his former deputy, Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.</p>

<h3><strong>For sale&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The Island of Meroe, a UNESCO World Heritage site that is home to the capital of the ancient Kingdom of Kush and dozens of its pyramids, is also under threat.</p>

<p>Artefacts and exhibition accessories have been stolen from the museum in Nyala, the South Darfur state capital, said Abdel Latif.</p>

<p>In Omdurman, just across the River Nile from Khartoum, part of the Khalifa House museum was also destroyed, she said.</p>

<p>Last week, the Association of Friends of Sudanese Museums condemned "in the strongest terms" the looting that is taking place across the country.</p>

<p>Experts voiced alarm after finding looted artefacts offered for sale online.</p>

<p>On the auction site eBay, a user offered items presented as Egyptian antiquities that, according to Sudanese media, were looted from Sudan.</p>

<p>AFP saw the listings, with items offered for a few hundred dollars, but was not able to independently verify the authenticity or origin of the items.</p>

<p>A Sudanese archaeologist, speaking anonymously for security reasons, told AFP that pottery, gold objects and paintings listed for sale appeared to have come from the National Museum in Khartoum -- although at least one statuette was an imitation.</p>

<p>He said he feared for the larger statues, which "must be handled by specialists in a precise manner" and could be damaged if looters were to lay hands on them.</p>

<p>The issue is set to be discussed at an upcoming conference in Germany, which Hussein will attend.</p>

<p>"The current state of the collections is a concern for anyone who cares about humanity's heritage," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Colombia's President Gustavo Petro is facing criticism from press freedom groups after some comments made about female reporters, calling them "dolls of the mafia" in one of the most dangerous countries for journalists in South America.</p>

<p>Without a hint of irony, Petro made the statement at the August 30 inauguration of Colombia's new human rights ombud Iris Marin -- the first woman to hold the job.</p>

<p>Petro, the South American country's first-ever leftist president, has often bristled at criticism from the media, which he has accused of conspiring with armed groups, business tycoons or other powerful figures.</p>

<p>Some say he has now gone too far in a country where dozens of threats and attacks of various types are reported against women reporters every year.</p>

<p>In his address, Petro had railed against "the (women) journalists of power, the 'dolls of the mafia,'" who he said had pilloried 2019-2021 protests against the rightwing government that preceded him.</p>

<p>Petro, who was a lawmaker at the time, had supported those demonstrations.</p>

<p>It is not clear why he targeted women reporters specifically.</p>

<p>Criticism was swift, and Petro tried to explain that he had been speaking of "female journalists from the establishment... hired by dark powers" in a statement that did little to quell the outrage.</p>

<p>Marin later said "there is no room for stigmatization" of female journalists in Colombia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Nothing justifies it."</p>

<h3><strong>'Reinforces gender stereotypes'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Reporters Without Borders (RSF) describes Colombia as "one of the most dangerous countries on the continent for journalists," with two murdered so far this year.</p>

<p>The FLIP Press Freedom Foundation says Petro's statements were being used as a basis for online content "that is violent or reinforces gender stereotypes."</p>

<p>The foundation has reported 171 cases of threats and attacks -- the exact nature of which it did not specify -- against female reporters since last year.</p>

<p>Petro has on occasion singled out journalists with accusations that have included them allying with rightwing paramilitary groups to "unleash a genocide."</p>

<p>"We observe with concern a strained climate for journalistic work in Colombia, exacerbated... by Petro's excessive expressions," said Carlos Jornet of the Inter-American Press Association (IAPA).</p>

<p>Petro is not the only Latin American leader to have an antagonistic relationship with the press.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other notable examples include Mexico's Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, and past presidents such as Rafael Correa of Ecuador and Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil.</p>

<p>The "dolls" comment was, however, the Colombian leader's first attack on journalists based on their gender.</p>

<p>"Stigmatization kills, shortens lives, shortens dreams, shortens careers..." Colombian journalist and newscaster Claudia Palacios said in a video sent to AFP about Petro's comments.</p>

<p>Several other news figures have condemned the statements which sparked a furious online debate in the country.</p>

<p>Approached by AFP, the presidency insisted it "recognizes the key role women journalists play in strengthening democracy and building public debate."</p>

<p>On Monday, Petro signed a decree -- a first for the Americas -- that would prevent public servants &nbsp;-- including himself -- from "stigmatizing" journalists.</p>

<p>But what could have been a reconciliatory moment was upended when the president used the launch to once again take aim at none other than the media.</p>

<p>In his address, Petro accused journalists of vilifying him for defending himself against media "slander."</p>

<p>"A missed opportunity," reacted FLIP director Jonathan Bock after the event.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, a petition was filed with Colombia's Council of State -- the highest court for administrative matters -- for an order directing Petro to apologize for his "dolls of the mafia" statement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Illia 'Golem' Yefimchyk, widely recognised as the world's "most monstrous bodybuilder," died aged 36, reportedly due to a heart attack. He was admitted to a hospital on September 6, where he fell into a coma, and passed away on September 11.&nbsp;The Belarusian man&nbsp;earned the nickname "The Mutant" in bodybuilding circles due to his imposing 6-foot frame and 340-pound weight.</p>

<p>Yefimchyk's wife, Anna, performed chest compressions while waiting for an ambulance to arrive, The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/12/sports/bodybuilder-illia-golem-yefimchyk-dead-at-36/" rel="No follow, No Index">New York </a>Post reported.</p>

<p>"I spent every day with him, hoping for recovery. His heart started beating again for two days, but doctors informed me that his brain had stopped functioning," Anna shared with local media.</p>

<p>He maintained 25-inch biceps through a rigorous diet, consuming up to 16,500 calories a day, which reportedly included over five pounds of steak and more than 100 pieces of sushi across seven meals.</p>

<p>Although Yefimchyk never competed in professional bodybuilding events, he shared his training routines online, amassing many followers across social media platforms.</p>

<p>He claimed impressive lifting stats, including a 600-pound bench press, 700-pound deadlift, and 700-pound squats.</p>

<p>His death follows those of British bodybuilder Neil Currey, 34, and Brazilian competitor Antonio Souza, 26. Currey was found dead in September 2023, with his parents attributing it to prolonged steroid use, according to the BBC. Souza died from cardiac arrest on August 3 after placing in the top three at a competition.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The fierce presidential debate between US Vice President Kamala Harris, and former President Donald Trump took social media by storm, generating responses of all kinds ranging from netizens to Taylor Swift and Elon Musk.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The fierce US presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris, and former President Donald Trump took social media by storm, generating responses of all kinds ranging from netizens to Taylor Swift and Elon Musk. The debate attracted 67.1 million television viewers, according to Nielsen data.</p>

<p>What followed, is a conspiracy theory, mostly by Trump supporters, who claimed that Kamala Harris had clip-on audio headphones on her throughout the debate, under the guise of her pearl earrings. There were speculations that her earrings were actually Icebach Sound Solutions' Nova H1 Audio Earrings, a Bluetooth device designed to look like jewellery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a statement fuelling the speculation, Icebach's managing director, Malte Iversen, reportedly said to tech outlet Tom's Guide, "We do not know whether Mrs Harris wore one of our products. The resemblance is striking." He also humorously offered to create a male version of the device for Trump, suggesting that the colour orange posed a design challenge.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Despite the viral claims, experts and fact-checkers have pointed out that Harris's actual earrings are the Double Pearl Hinged Earrings from Tiffany &amp; Co. which retail for approximately $800. These earrings bear little resemblance to Icebach's Bluetooth devices, which are priced at around $625.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris has previously criticized the use of Bluetooth earpieces as a security risk and has been seen using wired earbuds during her campaign. The ongoing speculation surrounding her jewellery highlights the heightened scrutiny and mistrust that often accompany political debates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Similar conspiracy theories were spotted on social media during the 2020 and 2016 election cycles which claimed that Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton were using earpieces during their debates against Trump.</p>

<p>As reported by the New York Post, Icebach Sound Solutions has also announced plans to address the rumours during an upcoming appearance on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon." The company stated on its website that it has received numerous interview requests since the debate and chose Fallon as a "trusted Bavarian in heart" for a live interview.</p>

<p>However, it looks like Donald Trump might not need this offer of similar earpieces as he has already refused to have another debate with Kamala Harris. "THERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE!" the former president wrote on the social media site Truth Social.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli army said on Thursday that the head of an elite intelligence unit will resign over the failure to prevent Hamas's October 7 attack.</p>

<p>"The commander of the 8200 unit, (Brigadier General) Yossi Sariel, has informed his commanders and subordinates of his intention to end his position," the army said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The officer will conclude his role in the near future."</p>

<p>The prestigious and secretive Unit 8200 is in charge of decoding and analysing intercepts and other signals intelligence.</p>

<p>In the wake of October 7, Israel's Military Intelligence Directorate was thrown into a crisis that led to its commander, Major General Aharon Haliva, announcing his resignation in April 2024.</p>

<p>The army said then that Haliva had asked to be relieved of his duties for the directorate's failure to foil the October 7 attack.</p>

<p>Israeli media on Thursday broadcast a copy of Sariel's resignation letter in which he asked for "forgiveness" for "not fulfilling the mission we were entrusted with" on October 7.</p>

<p>In June, public broadcaster Kan disclosed the existence of an intelligence brief prepared by Unit 8200 in September 2023 that warned military officials of Hamas's preparations for the attack.</p>

<p>Kan said the Unit 8200 document included details of elite Hamas fighters training for hostage-taking and plans for raids on military positions and Israeli communities in southern Israel.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of more than 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Included in that count are hostages who were killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive against Hamas has killed at least 41,118 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry. The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.</p>

<p>Netanyahu has repeatedly refused to open an official inquiry into October 7 until the war in Gaza is over.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's estranged daughter Vivian Wilson, who came out as transgender in 2022, has attacked her father over his controversial post on X offering to give Taylor Swift a child after she endorsed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris for president.</p>

<p>"The timing for the Taylor Swift endorsement of Kamala Harris honestly could not have been better. Can't wait to see the Swifties at the polls! Vote blue,” the 20-year-old wrote on Instagram's Threads, in support of the pop star.</p>

<p>Wilson also addressed her father's post on X responding to Swift's endorsement where she described herself as a "childless cat lady", a term Donald Trump's running mate used to mock women without children.</p>

<p>"Fine Taylor … you win … I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life," the Tesla CEO had said in a post on X, which users in the comments described as "weird" and "creepy".</p>

<p>In a second post on Instagram Threads, she acknowledged seeing the post and labelled it <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.threads.net/@vivllainous/post/C_x7KKQS18u">"heinous incel nonsense".</a></p>

<p>“Also, yes, I saw "the tweet". Heinous incel nonsense is in fact heinous incel nonsense. I don't really have anything to add to it, it's just abhorrent. That much is obvious and if you don't see how then you're part of the problem. I would just like to say to my audience members, don't let people talk to you like that. It's disgusting, it's belittling and incredibly sexist. You deserve better,” she wrote.</p>

<p>The term incel, short for involuntary celibate, is often used to describe men who are hostile towards women who they think consider them unattractive and deny them sex.</p>

<p>“I really am not the biggest fan of this subject. I am my own person with my own name after all. However, I just feel like that had to be said even if it's incredibly self-evident. Cheers," she said.</p>

<p>Wilson is one of Musk's 12 children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tech billionaire's relationship strained with his daughter after she petitioned a US court to change her name and gender in June 2022, requesting to take her mother's last name.</p>

<p>Musk is known for his "anti-trans" views and claimed that Wilson, who was assigned male at birth, had been “killed by the woke-mind virus” and alleged that he was “tricked” into allowing her gender reassignment surgeries.</p>

<p>In her petition, Wilson had stated that she “no longer lives with or wishes to be related to [her] biological father in any way, shape or form.”<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk, owner of social media platform X, on Friday called Australia's centre-left government "fascists" over proposed legislation to slap fines on social media firms for failing to prevent the spread of misinformation online.</p>

<p>Australia's Labor government on Thursday unveiled legislation in Parliament which could fine internet platforms up to 5% of their global revenue for enabling misinformation, joining a worldwide push to rein in borderless tech giants.</p>

<p>The proposed law would require tech platforms to set codes of conduct to stop dangerous falsehoods spreading and be approved by a regulator. The regulator would set its own standard if a platform failed to do so and fine firms for non-compliance.</p>

<p>Musk, who views himself as a champion of free speech, responded to a post by an X user linking the Reuters story about the misinformation law with one word: "Fascists".</p>

<p>In a previous clash with the Australian government, X in April went to court to challenge a cyber regulator's order for the removal of some posts about the stabbing of a bishop in Sydney, prompting Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to call Musk an "arrogant billionaire".</p>

<p>Alaska Airlines 369, with 176 passengers and six crew on board, aborted takeoff due to a potential traffic conflict after it had received clearance for takeoff from air traffic control, the airline said.</p>

<p>The Federal Aviation Administration said Southwest Airlines Flight 2029 had been cleared to cross the end of the same runway and the agency is investigating the incident. The Alaska pilots immediately applied the brakes to prevent the incident from escalating, the carrier added. The plane had been scheduled to fly to Seattle and passengers are being moved to a new plane.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Thursday that he will end all taxes on overtime pay as part of a wider tax cut package, if he is elected in the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>"As part of our additional tax cuts, we will end all taxes on overtime," Trump said in remarks at a rally in Tucson, Arizona. "Your overtime hours will be tax-free."</p>

<p>Trump, who faces Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in what polls show to be a tight race, has previously said he would seek legislation to end the taxation of tips to aid service workers. Harris has made a similar pledge.</p>

<p>The subject of overtime has recently become a campaign issue between Trump and Harris.</p>

<p>At a campaign event this month with union workers, Harris accused Trump of "blocking" overtime from millions of workers during his 2017-2021 presidency.</p>

<p>In 2019, the Trump administration issued a rule increasing the eligibility of overtime pay to 1.3 million additional U.S. workers, replacing a more generous proposal that had been introduced by President Barack Obama, Trump's Democratic predecessor.</p>

<p>The Trump administration raised the salary level for exemption from overtime pay to $35,568 a year, up from the long-standing $23,660 threshold. Workers' rights groups criticized the move, saying it covered far fewer workers than the scheme introduced under Obama.</p>

<p>Under Obama, the Labor Department proposed raising the threshold to more than $47,000, which would have made nearly 5 million more workers eligible for overtime. That rule was later struck down in court.</p>

<p>Overtime pay at these income levels overwhelmingly benefits blue-collar workers, such as fast-food workers, nurses, store assistants and other low-income employees.</p>

<p>"The people who work overtime are among the hardest working citizens in our country and for too long no one in Washington has been looking out for them," Trump said on Thursday.</p>

<p>Under Labor Department rules, eligible workers must be paid at least time-and-a-half for hours worked above 40 hours in a single work-week.</p>

<p>As of last month, American factory workers in non-supervisory roles put in an average of 3.7 hours of overtime a week, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows.</p>

<p>Not taxing overtime would result in less government revenue, at a time when Trump's plan to permanently extend the tax cuts he passed as president would expand the U.S. deficit by $3.5 trillion through 2033, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. The U.S. budget deficit in the first 11 months of this fiscal year is $1.9 trillion.</p>

<p>It's unclear how much revenue the government receives from taxes on overtime pay.</p>

<p>Trump's proposal would be a first for the federal government. Alabama this year became the first state to exclude overtime wages for hourly workers from state taxes as a temporary measure that won legislative support in part to help employers fill jobs in a tight labor market. The exemption is for 18 months only.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Government buildings and an elementary school in Springfield, Ohio were evacuated Thursday after an emailed bomb threat, police said, rattling the small US city at the heart of an anti-migrant conspiracy theory amplified by Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Springfield has been thrust into the spotlight in recent days after an unfounded story of Haitian migrants eating pets went viral on social media, with the Republican ex-president and current White House candidate pushing the narrative despite it being debunked.</p>

<p>Democrats have accused Trump and his running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, of fanning racial tensions as they use the Springfield conspiracy theory to elevate immigration as a campaign issue ahead of November's election.</p>

<p>Trump doubled down on the rhetoric during a campaign rally in Tucson, Arizona on Thursday, saying that "migrants are walking off with the town's geese."</p>

<p>Immediately after mentioning Springfield in his speech, Trump added: "I'm angry about young American girls being raped and sodomized and murdered by savage criminal aliens," though provided no specific details.</p>

<p>Springfield authorities said there were no credible reports of pets being harmed by members of the immigrant community -- accusations that Trump also repeated in his Thursday debate against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>The White House condemned the claims on Thursday as "filth" and said they were endangering people's lives.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Springfield police said that City Hall and several other government buildings had been evacuated after a bomb threat sent by email at 8:24 am (1224 GMT).</p>

<p>"Authorities investigated and cleared all facilities listed in the threat with the assistance of explosive detecting canines," the force said in a statement.</p>

<p>Fulton Elementary School and Springfield Academy of Excellence were also listed in the threat and evacuated, according to the statement.</p>

<p>"We are currently partnering with the Dayton office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to identify the source of the email," it added.</p>

<p><strong>- Tensions in community -</strong></p>

<p>Arriving at the school to retrieve his child, Haitian immigrant Mackenso Roseme told AFP that the current tensions in the community were "worrying."</p>

<p>"I'm a little stressed. I think something might happen," he said.</p>

<p>A sign in English, Spanish and Haitian Creole informed Roseme and other parents that the students had been moved to a high school.</p>

<p>Mayor Rob Rue told the Springfield News-Sun that the person who sent the bomb threat claimed to be from the city and mentioned Haitian immigration issues.</p>

<p>Despite the bomb threats, Trump was still reposting memes related to the conspiracy theory hours later on his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>He claimed Ohio was being "inundated with illegal migrants, mostly from Haiti, who are taking over Towns and Villages at a level and rate never seen before."</p>

<p>Springfield, with a population of about 58,000, has seen an increase in Haitian immigrants in recent years -- 10,000 to 15,000 according to the Springfield News-Sun.</p>

<p>Social services, schools and housing have been stressed in the city for years, with some pointing to migration as a factor.</p>

<p>Ohio Governor Mike DeWine -- a Republican like Trump -- gave some context to the situation in Springfield during an interview Thursday.</p>

<p>DeWine said 15,000 immigrants from Haiti live in Springfield, "a dramatic change" for the city, and added they were there under Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which allows foreign nationals to live and work in the United States. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"Why did they come? They came for jobs," DeWine told Fox News reporters. "There's nothing wrong with us being welcoming."</p>

<p>A multiracial group of pastors called a press conference Thursday in Springfield, joining hands in prayer and calling on the community to come together.</p>

<p>"Today there were some things that happened, some threats of violence," Wes Babian, a former pastor of First Baptist Church, told AFP.</p>

<p>"That is part of what motivated the quick calling of clergy to come together to express our support for the Haitian community and our concern for the well-being of the entire community."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has called for increasing the number of centrifuges for uranium enrichment in order to increase its nuclear weapons for self-defence, the state media said on Friday.</p>

<p>Kim made the call during a visit to the Nuclear Weapons Institute and the "production base of weapon-grade nuclear materials", according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). The dispatch did not release the location of the facility or date of the visit.</p>

<p>"He went round the control room of the uranium enrichment base to learn about the overall operation of the production lines," the KCNA said, adding that Kim expressed great satisfaction after being briefed that the "base is dynamically producing nuclear materials."</p>

<p>It marks the first time North Korea has publicly revealed details of its uranium enrichment facility, Yonhap news agency reported.</p>

<p>Kim also "stressed the need to further augment the number of centrifuges in order to exponentially increase the nuclear weapons for self-defence true to the Party's line of building up nuclear-armed forces," the KCNA said.</p>

<p>A uranium enrichment facility is used to produce highly enriched uranium by placing uranium in centrifuges and spinning it at high speeds. Highly enriched uranium is essential for the manufacture of nuclear warheads.</p>

<p>South Korean and US intelligence agencies believe North Korea operates uranium enrichment facilities at the Kangson nuclear complex near Pyongyang and at the Yongbyon nuclear site.</p>

<p>In 2010, North Korea invited Siegfried Hecker, a renowned American nuclear scientist, to inspect its uranium enrichment facility at Yongbyon.</p>

<p>Additionally, Kim called for improving the separation capacity of the centrifuges and accelerating the development of a new type of centrifuge to "further solidify the foundation for producing weapons-grade nuclear materials."</p>

<p>The sudden public disclosure of the uranium enrichment facility is seen as a move to flaunt North Korea's nuclear capabilities ahead of the US presidential election in November.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, during a key deterrence dialogue between South Korea and the US, the allies warned of the possibility that North Korea could conduct significant provocations, such as a nuclear test or an intercontinental ballistic missile launch, close to the election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Former President Donald Trump on Thursday said he would not participate in another election debate against his rival Vice President Kamala Harris.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican nominee Donald Trump said on Thursday he would not participate in another presidential debate against Kamala Harris ahead of the Nov. 5 election, after several polls showed his Democratic rival won their debate earlier this week.</p>

<p>"THERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE!" the former president wrote on social media site Truth Social. Trump had participated in a debate against President Joe Biden in June before his debate against Harris on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Although Trump touted his performance on Tuesday against Harris, six Republican donors and three Trump advisers who spoke to Reuters earlier this week said they thought Harris had won the debate largely because Trump was unable to stay on message.</p>

<p>The debate attracted 67.1 million television viewers, according to Nielsen data.</p>

<p>Harris, speaking at a rally shortly after Trump's post went live, said: "I believe we owe it to the voters to have another debate."</p>

<p>While Trump said in his post that polls showed he won the debate, several surveys showed that respondents thought Harris did better.</p>

<p>Among voters who said they had heard at least something about Tuesday's debate, 53% said Harris won and 24% said Trump won, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday.</p>

<p>The poll showed that 54% of registered voters believed that the single debate between Trump and Harris was enough, while 46% had wanted a second debate.</p>

<p>A majority of debate watchers said Harris outperformed Trump, according to a CNN flash poll released shortly after the debate. YouGov showed 54% of those surveyed said Harris won while 31% said Trump was the victor.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>The World Health Organization said Thursday that at least a quarter of those hurt in the war raging in Gaza have suffered "life-changing injuries", many requiring amputations and other "huge" rehabilitation needs.</p>

<p>At least 22,500 of the people injured in Gaza in the 11 months since the war erupted will "requires rehabilitation services now and for years to come", the WHO said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The huge surge in rehabilitation needs occurs in parallel with the ongoing decimation of the health system," Rik Peeperkorn, the WHO's representative for the Palestinian territories, said in a statement.</p>

<p>According to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, at least 41,118 people have been killed in Israel's retaliatory offensive following the October 7 attack by Hamas militants, while over 95,000 have been wounded.</p>

<p>The Hamas attack inside Israel that sparked the war resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures, which also includes hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Pointing to a fresh analysis of the types of injuries resulting from the conflict, the UN health agency said "many thousands of women and children" figured among those badly injured and that many had suffered more than one injury.</p>

<p>It estimated there had overall been between 13,455 and 17,550 "severe limb injuries", which it said were the main driver of the need for rehabilitation.</p>

<p>The report showed that between 3,105 and 4,050 limb amputations had occurred.</p>

<p>Other life-altering injuries including spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury and major burn injuries, it said.</p>

<p>At the same time, WHO said only 17 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are currently even partially functional, while primary health care services are frequently suspended or inaccessible due to insecurity, attacks and repeated evacuation orders.</p>

<p>Gaza's only limb reconstruction and rehabilitation centre, located in Nasser Medical Complex and supported by WHO ceased functioning last December due to lack of supplies and specialised health workers.</p>

<p>"Tragically, much of the rehabilitation workforce in Gaza is now displaced," the statement said.</p>

<p>Peeperkorn said that "patients can't get the care they need".</p>

<p>"Acute rehabilitation services are severely disrupted and specialised care for complex injuries is not available, placing patients' lives at risk," he said.</p>

<p>"Immediate and long-term support is urgently needed to address the enormous rehabilitation needs."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A pioneering private crew made history Thursday by performing the first commercial spacewalk, with NASA hailing it as "a giant leap forward" for the space industry.</p>

<p>The SpaceX Polaris Dawn mission, led by fintech billionaire Jared Isaacman, launched Tuesday from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, journeying deeper into the cosmos than any humans in half a century, since the Apollo era.</p>

<p>With the four-member crew's Dragon spacecraft adjusted to an orbit with a high of 434 miles (700 kilometers), pure oxygen began flowing into their suits Thursday, marking the official start of their extravehicular activity (EVA) at 1012 GMT.</p>

<p>A short time later, Isaacman swung open the hatch and climbed through, gripping the hand and footholds of a structure known as "Skywalker," as a breathtaking view of Earth unfolded below him.</p>

<p>"SpaceX, back at home we all have a lot of work to do, but from here, Earth sure looks like a perfect world," he told mission control in Hawthorne, California, where teams erupted in applause.</p>

<p>It was yet another major milestone for SpaceX, the company founded by Elon Musk in 2002.</p>

<p>Since then, SpaceX has grown into a powerhouse that in 2020 beat aerospace giant Boeing in delivering a spaceship to provide rides for NASA astronauts to the International Space Station.</p>

<p>"Today's success represents a giant leap forward for the commercial space industry and NASA's long-term goal to build a vibrant US space economy," NASA chief Bill Nelson wrote on X.</p>

<p><strong>Suit tests</strong></p>

<p>Prior to the hatch opening, the crew underwent a "prebreathe" procedure to remove nitrogen from their bloodstream, preventing decompression sickness. Cabin pressure was then gradually lowered to align with the vacuum of space.</p>

<p>Isaacman and crewmate Sarah Gillis, a SpaceX engineer, took turns outside the vehicle, spending a few minutes performing mobility tests on SpaceX's next-generation suits that boast heads-up displays, helmet cameras and enhanced joint mobility systems -- before returning inside.</p>

<p>Extravehicular activity officially ended after an hour and 46 minutes, following cabin re-pressurization.</p>

<p>While it marked a first for the commercial sector, the spacewalk fell short of the daring feats from the early space era.</p>

<p>Early spacewalkers, including the first, Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov in 1965, floated tethered to their spacecraft, while a select few Space Shuttle astronauts used jetpacks to fly completely untethered.</p>

<p>Since Dragon doesn't have an airlock, the entire crew were exposed to the vacuum of space. Mission pilot Scott Poteet and SpaceX engineer Anna Menon remained strapped in throughout as they monitored vital support systems.</p>

<p>"The risk is greater than zero, that's for sure, and it's certainly higher than anything that has been accomplished on a commercial basis," former NASA administrator Sean O'Keefe told AFP.</p>

<p><strong>First of three Polaris missions</strong></p>

<p>The spacewalk followed an audacious first phase of the mission, during which the Dragon spacecraft reached a peak altitude of 870 miles -- three times higher than the International Space Station, in a region teeming with dangerous, high-energy particles.</p>

<p>All four underwent more than two years of training in preparation for the landmark mission, logging hundreds of hours on simulators as well as skydiving, scuba diving and summiting an Ecuadoran volcano.</p>

<p>Upcoming tasks include testing laser-based satellite communications between the spacecraft and the vast Starlink satellite constellation, and completing dozens of experiments, including tests on contact lenses with embedded microelectronics to monitor changes in eye pressure and shape in space.</p>

<p>Polaris Dawn is the first of three missions under the Polaris program, a collaboration between Isaacman and SpaceX.</p>

<p>Financial terms of the partnership remain under wraps, but Isaacman, the 41-year-old founder and CEO of Shift4Payments, reportedly poured $200 million of his fortune into leading the 2021 all-civilian SpaceX Inspiration4 orbital mission.</p>

<p>The final Polaris mission aims to be the first crewed flight of SpaceX's Starship, a prototype next-generation rocket that is key to founder Musk's ambitions of colonizing Mars.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Israel announced on Thursday it was revoking the press credentials of Al Jazeera journalists working in the country, four months after shutting down the Qatari television network.</p>

<p>"The Government Press Office (GPO) is revoking the (press) cards of Al Jazeera journalists working in Israel," the Israeli government press office said in a statement.</p>

<p>"This is a media outlet that disseminates false content, which includes incitement against Israelis and Jews, and constitutes a threat to (Israeli) soldiers", the statement quoted press office director Nitzan Chen as saying.</p>

<p>An Israeli official close to the case told AFP that at the moment, the decision is to be applied to four full-time Al Jazeera journalists with Israeli citizenship.</p>

<p>The remainder of Al Jazeera staff in the country, mainly video producers and photographers who the government considers not to be actively producing content, will retain their Israeli press cards.</p>

<p>The GPO press card is not mandatory for working as a journalist in Israel, but without it, it is virtually impossible to access parliament or government ministries, or gain access to military infrastructure.</p>

<p>When contacted by AFP, Al Jazeera's bureau chief for the Palestinian territories, Walid Omary, said the network had not been informed of the latest Israeli decision.</p>

<p>"When we receive (the notification officially), we will see," Omary said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military has repeatedly accused journalists from the Qatari network of being "terrorist agents" in Gaza affiliated with Hamas or its ally, Islamic Jihad.</p>

<p>Al Jazeera denies the Israeli government's accusations and claims that Israel systematically targets its employees in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>At least two of its journalists have been killed since the war in Gaza began on October 7 after Hamas militants attacked southern Israel.</p>

<p>Fourteen Al Jazeera members of staff, all Israeli citizens, currently have Israeli government press cards, Omary said in a text message on a journalists' WhatsApp group.</p>

<p>The Israeli parliament passed a law in early April allowing the banning of foreign media broadcasts deemed harmful to state security.</p>

<p>Based on this law, the Israeli government approved on May 5 the decision to ban the channel from broadcasting from Israel and close its offices for a renewable 45-day period, which was extended for a fourth time by a Tel Aviv court on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has had a long-running feud with Al Jazeera that has worsened since the Gaza war began.</p>

<p>"There will be no freedom of speech for the Hamas trumpets in Israel," Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi said in May.</p>

<p>"Al Jazeera will be closed immediately and the equipment will be confiscated."</p>

<p>The shutdown did not affect broadcasts from the Israeli-occupied West Bank or the Gaza Strip, from which Al Jazeera still covers Israel's war with Palestinian militants.</p>

<p>The GPO press card is not mandatory for working as a journalist in Israel, but without it, it is virtually impossible to access the Parliament, enter ministries, or gain access to military infrastructure.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine plans to change its war strategy with the use of long-range cruise missiles targeting deep inside Russian territory. Kyiv's use of missiles has so far been within its own territory where the Russian military has invaded.</p>

<p>Recent reports suggest that the United Kingdom, a key NATO member, has cleared Ukraine's use of the Storm Shadow cruise missile to target Russian territories. This may push Moscow's red lines in the conflict.</p>

<p>Anticipating a shift in Ukraine's strategy, backed by its NATO allies, Russia, earlier this month, said it has become necessary for Moscow to revise its nuclear doctrine because of the West's escalation of the war in Ukraine.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="UK has reportedly cleared Ukraines use of the Storm Shadow cruise missile to target Russian territories." id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/vfa1jgto_storm-shadow-missile_625x300_12_September_24.jpeg" title="UK has reportedly cleared Ukraines use of the Storm Shadow cruise missile to target Russian territories." /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">UK has reportedly cleared Ukraine's use of the Storm Shadow cruise missile to target Russian territories.</p>
</div>

<p>This new development emerges at a time when the war between Russia and Ukraine has greatly intensified. Russia has increased its missile attacks while Ukraine has responded with escalation in drone attacks.</p>

<p>So far, there are restriction on the use of advanced western weaponry on targets within Russian territory, but this is likely to change with such clearances reportedly being issued by the UK.</p>

<p>Ukraine already has the Storm Shadow missile, but uses it only within its territory to combat Russian forces.</p>

<h2><strong>THE STORM SHADOW MISSILE</strong></h2>

<p>The Storm Shadow is a low-observable, long-range air-launched cruise missile. It is jointly developed by the United Kingdom and France and has a range of around 500 km. It has already been integrated into Ukrainian fighter aircraft, including the Russia-built Su-24 bombers - a legacy of the past, from when Ukraine was part of the erstwhile Soviet Union.</p>

</div>

<p>Developed in 1994 and manufactured by Matra and British Aerospace, the Storm Shadow missile is now made by MBDA Systems. 'Storm Shadow' is the weapon's British name, while in France it is called the SCALP-EG.</p>

</div>

<p>How the export of such long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine were permitted is not clear yet as the Missile Technology Control Regime or MTCR, which UK is a founding member of, restricts the export of missiles which have a range greater than 300 km and a payload capacity of 500 kg. While the Storm Shadow missile has a warhead less than 500 kg, it breaches the MTCR regulations in terms of range exceeding the limit.</p>

<p>The MTCR, however, is an informal political understanding between member states and its regulations are not always binding.</p>

<h3><strong>THE FALLOUT</strong></h3>

<p>Should Ukraine get the green signal to use cruise missiles to attack Russian territory, a Russian response to this could be massive. The international worry is that Moscow may seriously consider the use of nuclear weapons in such a scenario.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">'Storm Shadow' is the weapon's British name, while in France it is called the SCALP-EG.</p>
</div>

<p>The Kremlin has blamed the "collective actions of the West" in Ukraine for Russia to revise its nuclear doctrine, spokesperson Dmitry Peskov had said earlier this month.</p>

<p>Without revealing what the changes will be to Russia's nuclear doctrine, Moscow has said that certain changes are required to be made on the policy over the circumstances for the use of its nukes.</p>

<p>President Vladimir Putin had set the current nuclear doctrine in place four years ago. According to that, Russia may use nuclear weapons in the scenario where it comes under a nuclear attack or if a conventional attack threatens the existence of the state.</p>

<p>An update to the Russian nuclear doctrine is now necessary "against the backdrop of the challenges and threats provoked by the countries of the so-called collective West", Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.</p>

<p>"Moscow foresees the likelihood of Ukraine using long-range missiles and other weapons supplied by the United States and its NATO allies to attack deep inside Russian territory," Mr Peskov had said, adding that "Ukraine will obviously do this, and we are taking that into account."</p>

<h3><strong>INDIA ATTEMPTS FOR PEACE</strong></h3>

<p>India, meanwhile, is trying to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine with National Security Adviser Ajit Doval currently in Moscow for a summit of NSAs. He met Vladimir Putin on Thursday and is reportedly carrying a peace plan sent by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/jk1t0l38_modi-russia-ukraine_625x300_31_August_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>PM Modi had visited Russia in July and followed that with a visit to Ukraine last month. He was received warmly both by Putin and Zelenskyy and is considered one of the very few leaders in the world to have a close bond with both leaders.</p>

<p>It is not known yet, if such a peace plan will be accepted by Russia, but India, which has friendly ties with both nations has offered to play its part in helping end the war.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, when asked about the need for BRICS while a grouping like G20 already existed, responded that if the G7 can exist when there is the G20, there is no reason why BRICS cannot.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, when asked about the need for BRICS while a grouping like G20 already existed, responded that if the G7 can exist when there is the G20, there is no reason why BRICS cannot.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said this during a conversation with Ambassador Jean-David Levitte at Geneva Centre for Security Policy, a think tank.</p>

<p>BRICS was founded as an intergovernmental organisation by Brazil, Russia, India and China in 2009, with South Africa joining in later. In January this year, five new countries - Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, UAE and Ethiopia - joined the bloc.</p>

<p>"Why the club? Because there was another club. It was called the G7 and you will not let anybody else into that club. So, we go and form our own club," the foreign minister said.</p>

<p>"I'm still struck by how insecure the (Global) North is when you speak about the BRICS. Somehow, something seems to get under people's skin," he said.</p>

<p>"Here's an observation. There is a G20, did the G7 disband? Has it stopped meeting? No, it still continues. So, the G20 exists, but the G7 still exists. Then, why can't the G20 be there and the BRICS also exist?" he said further.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar also talked about the Global South. "The countries of the Global South, most of them are decolonised countries. Most of them are developing countries," he explained. He termed it as "an intuitive gathering of countries who actually know why they are in that room and they have a feel for each other," he said.</p>

<p>The foreign minister is currently on the third and final leg of his three-nation tour. He started off in Saudi Arabia for the first India-Gulf Cooperation Council Ministerial Meeting and went on to visit Germany.</p>

<p>He held wide-ranging talks with his German counterpart, Annalena Baerbock, and called on German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York's top cop, head of the largest police department in the United States, resigned Thursday amid corruption probes swirling through the city's leadership.</p>

<p>The storied New York Police Department (NYPD) is a mammoth force including 35,000 uniformed officers and a budget of just under $6 billion.</p>

<p>Mayor Eric Adams announced the departure of Edward Caban, the New York City Police Department commissioner, in a brief televised statement.</p>

<p>"A short time ago, I accepted the resignation," he said, noting that he took ongoing federal probes into his administration "extremely seriously."</p>

<p>Adams said he was appointing veteran law enforcement officer Tom Donlon as the force's interim commissioner.</p>

<p>Caban, 57, had come under pressure to resign after federal agents seized his cellphone and those of other high-ranking members in the Adams administration.</p>

<p>No criminal charges have been filed and federal authorities have yet to clarify what they are probing. According to ABC News, one investigation is targeting city contracts and another enforcement of regulations on nightlife.</p>

<p>Adams, a former police officer and only the second Black mayor of the biggest US city, is increasingly weighed down by growing scandals, including a sexual assault allegation and claims of corruption.</p>

<p>Caban, appointed by Adams in 2023, is the first Latino NYPD commissioner.</p>

<p>In his statement, Adams addressed New Yorkers, telling them he "was as surprised as you" to hear of the federal probes.</p>

<p>"I spent more than 20 years in law enforcement, and so every member of the administration knows my expectations that we must follow the law," he said.</p>

<p>A prominent member of the city council, Robert Holden, said Caban had stepped down "for the greater good of the department and New York."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

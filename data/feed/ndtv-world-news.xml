       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has named Adam Boehler as his administration's lead hostage negotiator at a time when the United States is seeking to secure the release of prisoners trapped in Gaza and other parts around the world. A healthcare executive, Mr Boehle would be America's special presidential envoy for hostage affairs.</p>

<p>He will succeed Roger Carstens, who held the role since 2020 after Mr Trump appointed him as special presidential envoy for hostage affairs during his first term as President. He remained on the job for the duration of the Biden administration and is credited for bringing home several dozen Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained in countries including Russia. Some of the notable prisoner exchanges during his time in office include WNBA star Brittney Griner and Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich.</p>

<h2><strong>About Adam Boehler</strong></h2>

<p>Adam Boehler, founder and CEO of healthcare investment firm Rubicon Founders, served as the first CEO of the International Development Finance Corporation, a new federal agency created during Mr Trump's first administration ending in 2021.</p>

<p>Announcing his appointment, the incoming Presidnet said Mr Boehler was a lead negotiator for him on his team that worked on the Abraham Accords in 2020, a series of normalization and broader recognition agreements between Israel and Arab nations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"He has negotiated with some of the toughest people in the World, including the Taliban, but Adam knows that NO ONE is tougher than the United States of America, at least when President Trump is its Leader. Adam will work tirelessly to bring our Great American Citizens HOME," Mr Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.</p>

<p>In college, Mr Boehler reportedly shared a room with the president-elect's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, briefly, who was the lead negotiator on the Abraham Accords.</p>

<p>Mr Boehler's appointment came two days after the President-elect warned those holding hostages that there would be "all hell to pay" if the prisoners were not released by the time he took over office on January 20. Hamas continues to hold around 100 hostages, living and dead, in Gaza. The hostage includes seven Americans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Boehler has been a vocal critic of the Biden administration for its approach to the hostage issue in Gaza. In a radio interview last week, he said that "the next step for Israel, and for the United States, is to make sure that we get the hostages back." He also called for the elimination of Iran's nuclear facilities as well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/stmd/prizes-challenges-crowdsourcing-program/center-of-excellence-for-collaborative-innovation-coeci/south-pole-safety-designing-the-nasa-lunar-rescue-system/" rel="noindex,nofollow">NASA </a>invites innovators to develop a life-saving Lunar Rescue System to save astronauts stranded on the Moon. The space agency offers up to $20,000 for the most effective design to safely transport a fully suited astronaut across the Moon's rugged terrain. This initiative is part of NASA's Artemis missions, which face challenges like extreme temperatures, uneven surfaces, and bulky spacesuits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have a groundbreaking idea, now's your chance to make an impact and win big. Submissions for the South Pole Safety Challenge: Lunar Rescue System are open until January 23, 2025, via the HeroX portal. With a total prize pool of $45,000, the best proposal will help address critical concerns as NASA gears up for the Artemis mission, scheduled for September 2026.</p>

<p>NASA is preparing for the possibility of an astronaut becoming incapacitated on the Moon due to injury, medical emergencies, or mission-related accidents. In such scenarios, crewmates will need a reliable method to transport them back to the lunar lander.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The unforgiving lunar environment poses unique challenges that demand innovative solutions," said Sarah Duglas from NASA, as reported by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/32083351/nasa-moon-south-pole-safety-challenge-lunar-rescue-system/" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>The Sun</em></a>. Experts highlight that while the mission site was chosen partly for its water-ice reserves, the Moon's surface remains a significant hurdle. Covered with sharp rocks, deep craters, and steep slopes, it is difficult to navigate even under optimal conditions.</p>

<p>The competition calls for a design capable of moving a fully suited astronaut over two kilometres, up a 20-degree incline, without using a rover. While the Moon's lower gravity reduces the astronaut's weight, it's still too much for manual carrying, making a technological solution essential.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is your chance to help shape the future of lunar exploration and astronaut safety. "The solution must perform effectively in the Moon's extreme South Pole environment and operate independently of a lunar rover," NASA explained.</p>

<h3><strong>Here's how to apply</strong></h3>

<p>Interested candidates can apply or submit their applications via the HeroX portal, where the organisation usually posts its public challenge. Entries are open until January 25. NASA's experts and engineers will evaluate the submitted plan. Criteria such as the weight, ease, and impact on the astronaut's new Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Suit will be considered. Visit the official website for more information.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A pediatrician has raised alarms about "Granny's Purse Syndrome," a hidden danger during family holiday gatherings.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An emergency department doctor has warned parents about a lesser-known but potentially fatal risk to kids as families prepare for the holiday season. Known as "Granny's Purse Syndrome," this risk arises from the items in grandmothers' purses that may unintentionally endanger children.</p>

<p>During family get-togethers, the paediatrician emphasised the value of parental attention in a newly published<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.tiktok.com/notfound"> TikTok video.</a> She clarified that many grandparents carry common items in their purses, such as tiny objects, prescriptions, or even stray coins, which can provide serious choking or poisoning hazards to inquisitive young children.</p>

<p>With the holidays often involving frequent visits and larger family gatherings, she urged parents to be proactive in ensuring that such items are kept out of reach of children. The awareness comes at a crucial time, as emergency rooms often see a spike in accidental ingestions and related injuries during the festive season.</p>

<p>Parents are encouraged to educate grandparents about the risks and take simple precautions, like securing purses or placing them in inaccessible areas, to safeguard their children during the celebrations.</p>

<p>"If you are spending time with your family for the holidays, it's important to know about something called 'granny syndrome' or 'granny's purse syndrome,'" she said.</p>

<p>"This is when young kids get into their grandparents' medications that are not secured properly-for many reasons. One of them is that grandparents are not used to having kids around. Often their medications are on low shelves or in their purses or in medication containers that are not child resistant."</p>

<p>According to a 2006 study published <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6875947_Hang_Up_Your_Pocketbook_--_an_easy_intervention_for_the_granny_syndrome_grandparents_as_a_risk_factor_in_unintentional_pediatric_exposures_to_pharmaceuticals"><em>in the Journal of Osteopathic Medicine</em></a>, grandparents' medications account for 10% to 20% of unintentional paediatric intoxications in the United States. To characterise circumstances leading to and outcomes from paediatric pharmaceutical exposures. To identify preventable risk factors associated with this pattern of injury, referred to as the "granny syndrome."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The wife of the slain CEO of the largest US health insurance company has said that he had received death threats as police scrambled to find the man who brazenly shot him in mid-Manhattan.</p>

<p>The Wednesday morning shooting in front of a Hilton hotel as the city teemed with tourists visiting for the lighting of the iconic Rockefeller Centre Christmas tree nearby in the evening triggered shockwaves.</p>

<p>Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch tried to reassure the visitors, saying the killing was "a premeditated, preplanned, targeted attack" and "does not appear to be a random act of violence".</p>

<p>"Millions of people will be enjoying the tree lighting tonight, among other holiday events, and the NYPD will be out there with them, keeping them safe," she added.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/united-healthcare-ceo-brian-thompson-shot-dead-in-new-york-gunman-at-large-7172850">Brian&nbsp;Thompson's</a> wife Paulette Thompson told NBC News that he had told her "there were some people that had been threatening him".</p>

<p>She said that she did not know the details but it could have been motivated by a "lack of coverage" in the company's insurance programmes.</p>

<p>Thompson led UnitedHealthcare (UHC), the largest US health insurance company with an annual revenue of $281 billion and more than 140,000 employees, many stationed in India for backoffice, technology and strategy jobs.</p>

<p>The company provides private health insurance mostly through employers as well as offering plans under the government programmes for senior citizens and the poor.</p>

<p>Police described the shooter as a light-skinned man clad in a light brown or cream-coloured jacket, wearing a black facemask and carrying a grey backpack.</p>

<p>Tisch said that "it appears the suspect was lying in wait for several minutes" and shot Thompson as he walked to the hotel for his company's investment conference.</p>

<p>He was hit in the leg and chest as the gunman began firing from behind. After the gun, a .9 mm weapon, jams, he is seen on security videos quickly clearing it and resuming firing.</p>

<p>Police Department Chief Joseph Kenny said, "It does appear he is proficient in the use of firearms, as he was able to clear the malfunction pretty quickly."</p>

<p>The shooter is seen on videos calmly crossing the avenue, hopping on a for-hire electric bike available around the city, and riding away.</p>

<p>He was later spotted at Central Park before the trail went cold.</p>

<p>Police are working on clues from the bike rental to try to locate him.</p>

<p>In the video, Thompson turns around after being shot towards the shooter before falling to the ground.</p>

<p>Ambulance workers, who arrived within minutes with police, tried to resuscitate him before driving him to a nearby hospital where he was declared dead.</p>

<p>Thompson, 50, became the CEO of UHC after working his way up during his 20-year career with the company.</p>

<p>"Our hearts go out to Brian's family and all who were close to him," his company said in a statement.</p>

<p>Federal officials and lawmakers have criticised the company for allegedly denying coverage to customers or payments for health services rendered making policy-holders responsible for payments.</p>

<p>This has created controversies and animosity among some insured by it.</p>

<p>Several people who posted on social media X said unpleasant things about Thompson.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Scientists in New Zealand are conducting the first-ever dissection of a complete spade-toothed whale, one of the rarest whale species globally.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists in New Zealand are dissecting an entire spade-toothed whale, one of the rarest whale species in the world, for the first time, according to <em>The Guardian</em>. When the five-meter male whale came ashore in Otago, South Island, in July, it excited cetacean scientists.</p>

<p>The elusive beaked whale is known as a spade-toothed whale because of its teeth, which resemble spades. Since the 1800s, only seven specimens have been recorded, six of which were found in New Zealand. The only sources of information available to scientists about the species up to now have been bone and tissue samples taken from dispersed remains discovered over many years.</p>

<p>The groundbreaking examination began at the Invermay AgResearch Centre in Mosgiel, near Dunedin, on Monday. The event brought together local and international scientists, along with Maori representatives, to study the rare specimen. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Anton van Helden, a global expert on spade-toothed whales and science adviser at the Department of Conservation, described the atmosphere as one of "reverence" for the animal. This unique opportunity is expected to shed light on the biology and behavior of a species shrouded in mystery. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The dissection marks a pivotal moment for marine biology, offering insights into the anatomy and life of a whale species that has largely remained an enigma.</p>

<p>"We're working around a dead animal, but it's telling us about how it [lived], and also that's unpacking all of the life stories of the people involved around it," he told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/03/spade-tooth-rare-whale-new-zealand-scientists-dissect"><em>The Guardian.</em></a></p>

<p>Van Helden, the lead author on a paper that gave the species its name, said the opportunity to examine the whale is "an incredible moment".</p>

<p>"Beaked whales are the most enigmatic group of large mammals on the planet, they are deep divers that are rarely seen at sea."</p>

<p>"This one is the rarest of the rare, only the seventh specimen known from anywhere in the world, and the first opportunity we have had to undertake a dissection like this," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump nominated veteran Washington attorney Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a move cheered by the cryptocurrency industry.</p>

<p>Atkins, an SEC commissioner from 2002 to 2008, founded risk consultancy firm Patomak Global Partners in 2009, whose clients include companies in the banking, trading and cryptocurrency industries.</p>

<p>An announcement from the Trump transition noted that Atkins had been co-chairman of the Digital Chamber of Commerce, which promotes the use of digital assets, since 2017.</p>

<p>"Paul is a proven leader for common sense regulations," Trump said in a statement that emphasized Atkins' committment to "robust, innovative" capital markets.</p>

<p>"He also recognizes that digital assets and other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before," Trump added.</p>

<p>In a separate statement, Trump picked former senator Kelly Loeffler to head the Small Business Administration.</p>

<p>"Kelly will bring her experience in business and Washington to reduce red tape, and unleash opportunity for our Small Businesses to grow, innovate, and thrive," he said, adding that she would also co-chair his inauguration committee.</p>

<p>During the presidential campaign, Trump drew heavy financial support from cryptocurrency backers, some of whom are also close to the Republican's mega-donor, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.</p>

<p>The digital assets industry has been eager for a change at the SEC, with outgoing chair Gary Gensler having taken a hostile posture on the sector.</p>

<p>Gensler has referred to the cryptocurrency world as "the wild west" and launched lawsuits against major trading platforms including Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken, along with various smaller startups.</p>

<p>The SEC chair also backed controversial measures to require publicly traded companies to measure their exposure to climate change.</p>

<p>Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, cheered the nomination, calling Atkins an "excellent" choice.</p>

<p>"The past four years under Chair Gensler was a non-stop anti-crypto crusade, leading to an innovation stalemate and incalculable job, talent and economic losses," she said on X, the former Twitter.</p>

<p>But Senator Elizabeth Warren, incoming top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, expressed concern about his appointment, saying Atkins protested fines against major corporations despite their wrongdoing during the last financial crisis.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Amnesty International on Thursday accused Israel of "committing genocide" against Palestinians in Gaza since the start of the war last year, saying a new report was a "wake-up call" for the international community.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amnesty International on Thursday accused Israel of "committing genocide" against Palestinians in Gaza since the start of the war last year, saying a new report was a "wake-up call" for the international community.</p>

<p>The London-based rights organisation said its findings were based on "dehumanizing and genocidal statements by Israeli government and military officials", satellite images documenting devastation, fieldwork and ground reports from Gazans.</p>

<p>"Month after month, Israel has treated Palestinians in Gaza as a subhuman group unworthy of human rights and dignity, demonstrating its intent to physically destroy them," Amnesty chief Agnes Callamard said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Our damning findings must serve as a wake-up call to the international community: this is genocide. It must stop now," she added.</p>

<p>The Palestinian group Hamas launched an unprecedented attack inside southern Israel on October 7, 2023, triggering a deadly Israeli military offensive as Israeli officials vowed to crush the militants.</p>

<p>Israel has repeatedly and forcefully denied allegations of genocide, accusing Hamas of using the Palestinian people as human shields.</p>

<p>"There is absolutely no doubt that Israel has military objectives. But the existence of military objectives does not negate the possibility of a genocidal intent," Callamard told AFP at a press conference in The Hague.</p>

<p>The 300-page report points to incidents where there "was no Hamas presence or any other military objectives".</p>

<p>It cites 15 air strikes in Gaza between October 7, 2023 and April 20, which killed 334 civilians including 141 children, for which the group found "no evidence that any of these strikes were directed at a military objective".</p>

<p>In addition to tens of thousands of deaths and physical and psychological trauma, the report also points to the conditions on the ground, where it said Palestinians are subjected to "malnutrition, hunger and diseases" and exposed to a "slow, calculated death".</p>

<p>"States that transfer arms to Israel violate their obligations to prevent genocide under the convention and are at risk of becoming complicit", Callamard added during the press conference.</p>

<p>Since the start of the war, at least 44,532 people have been killed in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, deemed reliable by the UN.</p>

<p>Amnesty International has also announced that it will publish a report on the crimes committed by Hamas during the October 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,208 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures, which includes hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Hamas also seized 251 hostages during the attack, some of whom were already dead. Of those, 97 are still held in Gaza, including 35 the Israeli army says are dead.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A landmark defence pact between North Korea and Russia, signed by its leaders in June, has gone into effect after the two sides exchanged ratification documents, North Korea's official KCNA news agency said Thursday.</p>

<p>The formalization of the treaty comes as the United States and South Korea have accused the nuclear-armed North of sending more than 10,000 soldiers to help Russia fight Ukraine.</p>

<p>Experts say North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is keen to acquire advanced technology from Moscow and battle experience for his troops in return.</p>

<p>Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the strategic partnership deal during the Kremlin chief's visit to Pyongyang.</p>

<p>It obligates both states to provide military assistance "without delay" in the case of an attack on the other, and to jointly oppose Western sanctions.</p>

<p>It came into effect from Wednesday, when the ratification documents were exchanged in Moscow by the countries' vice foreign ministers Kim Jong Gyu and Andrei Rudenko, KCNA reported.</p>

<p>Lawmakers in Moscow last month voted unanimously for the deal and it was later signed by Putin. Pyongyang said it was ratified by a decree from Kim.</p>

<p>The treaty will serve "as a strong driving force accelerating the establishment of an independent and just multi-polarized world order without domination, subjugation and hegemony," KCNA said.</p>

<p>Analysts have suggested Pyongyang could be using Ukraine as a means of realigning its foreign policy.</p>

<p>By sending soldiers, North Korea is positioning itself within the Russian war economy as a supplier of weapons, military support and labour â€” potentially even bypassing traditional ally, neighbour and main trading partner China, they say.</p>

<p>North Korea and Russia have strengthened their military ties since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>

<p>Both countries are under rafts of UN sanctions -- the former for its nuclear weapons programme and the latter for the Ukraine conflict.</p>

<p>Kim said last week during a visit to Pyongyang by Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov that his government, army and people would "invariably support the policy of the Russian Federation to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity".</p>

<p>Putin hailed the deal in June as a "breakthrough document".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South&nbsp;Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has accepted the resignation of Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun and nominated the ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Choi Byung-hyuk, as new defence minister, the presidential office said on Thursday.</p>

<p>Kim, who offered his resignation on Wednesday, was seen as a central figure in Yoon's declaration of martial law on Tuesday. A senior military official and filings to impeach Yoon by opposition members said Kim made the recommendation to Yoon.</p>

<p>Yoon's chief of staff, Chung Jin-suk, called Choi "a person of principle who carries out his duties with dedication and adheres to regulations."</p>

<p>The nomination is the first official move by Yoon after he announced the withdrawal of the martial law declaration in the early hours of Wednesday, amid a storm of political turmoil and diplomatic fallout.</p>

<p>Parliament introduced a motion early on Thursday to impeach him over the botched attempt to impose martial law, but his party vowed to oppose the move, throwing the process into doubt.</p>

<p>The main opposition Democratic Party has called Yoon's martial law attempt a treasonous act, and its lawmakers could lead a vote for the bill as early as Friday.</p>

<p>U.S. officials said they were caught completely off guard by Yoon's martial law declaration, which Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said was "badly misjudged."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States will "speak out" to South Korea to safeguard democracy after President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived imposition of martial law, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Wednesday.</p>

<p>"South Korea's democracy is robust and resilient, and we're going to continue to speak out publicly and engage privately with South Korean counterparts to reinforce the importance of that continuing," Sullivan said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p>

<p>He said that Yoon's imposition of martial law "raised deep concern for us" and he praised the National Assembly for operating "according to constitutional processes and procedures" to rescind it.</p>

<p>"What we want to see is just the proper functioning of the democratic institutions of the ROK," he said, referring to the South by its official name, the Republic of Korea.</p>

<p>Sullivan said that President Joe Biden's administration first learned of Yoon's declaration of martial law via television, repeating that the United States was not consulted by its close ally.</p>

<p>His remarks follow a posting from the National Security Council that praised South Korea's "democratic resilience."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Around 700 Bangladeshi prison inmates were still on the run after mass jailbreaks over the summer during the student-led revolution that ousted autocratic ex-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, authorities said Wednesday.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina fled in August to India, where she remains, as her government collapsed at the peak of a popular revolt.</p>

<p>In the weeks before her departure, revolts or sieges by protesters at five prisons around the Muslim-majority nation saw roughly 2,200 inmates break out of their cells.</p>

<p>Prisons chief Syed Mohammad Motaher Hossain told reporters that around 1,500 of that number had since been captured, with the remainder still at large.</p>

<p>Hossain said that at least 70 fugitives were either "terrorists" or "death row convicts".</p>

<p>Hundreds of people marched on a jail in the city of Narsingdi east of the capital Dhaka on July 19, setting the facility on fire and setting hundreds of inmates free.</p>

<p>Four more prisons were also attacked in the following weeks including a high security facility at Kashimpur, home to some of the country's most notorious criminals.</p>

<p>Police spokesman Imam Hossain Sagar said efforts to track the remaining escapees were ongoing.</p>

<p>"We have instructed all the police stations to stay alert and arrest the escaped prisoners," he said.</p>

<p>Sagar added that police were also closely monitoring several "top terrorists" granted bail by courts following Hasina's ouster.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[French lawmakers on Wednesday voted to oust the government of Prime Minister Michel Barnier after just three months in office in a move which deepens a political crisis in the country.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French lawmakers on Wednesday voted to oust the government of Prime Minister Michel Barnier after just three months in office, a historic move which plunged the country further into political chaos.</p>

<p>For the first time in over sixty years, the National Assembly lower house toppled the incumbent government, approving a no-confidence motion that had been proposed by the hard left but which crucially was backed by the far-right headed by Marine Le Pen.</p>

<p>Barnier's rapid ejection from office comes after snap parliamentary elections this summer which resulted in a hung parliament with no party having an overall majority and the far-right holding the key to the government's survival.</p>

<p>President Emmanuel Macron now has the unenviable choice of picking a viable successor with over two years of his presidential term left.</p>

<p>The National Assembly debated a motion brought by the hard left in a standoff over next year's austerity budget, after the prime minister on Monday forced through a social security financing bill without a vote.</p>

<p>With the support of the far-right, a majority of 331 MPs in the 577-member chamber voted to oust the government.</p>

<p>Speaker Yael Braun-Pivet confirmed Barnier would now have to "submit his resignation" to Macron and declared the session closed.</p>

<p>Macron flew back into Paris just ahead of the vote after wrapping up his three-day state visit to Saudi Arabia, an apparent world away from the domestic crisis.</p>

<p>He strolled earlier Wednesday through the desert sands of the Al-Ula oasis, an iconic tourist project of the kingdom, marvelling at ancient landmarks. After landing, he headed direct to the Elysee Palace.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Macron accused Le Pen's far-right of "unbearable cynicism" in backing the motion.</p>

<p>No new elections can be called within a year of last summer's vote, narrowing Macron's options.</p>

<p>Laurent Wauquiez, the head of right-wing deputies in parliament, said the far-right and hard-left bore the responsibility for a no-confidence vote that will "plunge the country into instability".</p>

<p><strong>'His failure'</strong></p>

<p>Some have suggested Macron himself should resign to break the impasse.</p>

<p>But Macron rejected those calls, saying such a scenario amounted to "political fiction".</p>

<p>"It's frankly not up to scratch to say these things," Macron said during his trip to Saudi.</p>

<p>Eric Coquerel, a hard-left MP, said the motion against Barnier sounded the "death knell of Emmanuel Macron's mandate".</p>

<p>With markets nervous and France bracing for public-sector strikes over the threat of cutbacks that will shut schools and hit air and rail traffic, there is a growing sense of crisis.</p>

<p>The unions have called for civil servants, including teachers and air traffic controllers, to strike on Thursday over separate cost-cutting measures proposed by their respective ministries this autumn.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Macron is due to host a major international event Saturday with the reopening of the Notre-Dame cathedral after the 2019 fire, with guests including Donald Trump on his first foreign trip since he was elected to be the next US president.</p>

<p>"His failure," was left-wing daily Liberation's front-page headline, with a picture of Macron, whose term runs until 2027.</p>

<p><strong>'Shattered strategy'</strong></p>

<p>But in an editorial, Le Monde said Le Pen's move risked upsetting her own supporters, such as retirees and business leaders, by toppling the government.</p>

<p>"In the space of a few minutes, she shattered the strategy of normalisation she had consistently pursued," the daily said.</p>

<p>Some observers have suggested that Le Pen, 56, is seeking to bring down Macron before his term ends by ousting Barnier.</p>

<p>Le Pen is embroiled in a high-profile embezzlement trial. If found guilty in March, she could be blocked from participating in France's next presidential election.</p>

<p>But if Macron stepped down soon, an election would have to be called within a month, potentially ahead of the verdict in her trial.</p>

<p>Candidates for the post of premier are few and far between, but loyalist Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu and Macron's centrist ally Francois Bayrou are possible contenders.</p>

<p>On the left, Macron could turn to former Socialist premier and interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve, a contender in September.</p>

<p>Macron is minded to appoint the new premier rapidly, several sources told AFP.</p>

<p>It was the first successful no-confidence vote since a defeat for Georges Pompidou's government in 1962, when Charles de Gaulle was president. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The lifespan of Barnier's government is also the shortest of any administration since the Fifth Republic began in 1958.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Korean term for "martial law" was the most-searched word on Google in South Korea on Wednesday, following President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived declaration of martial law.</p>

<p>The word topped Google's trends chart with the search volume over the past 24 hours surpassing the 2 million mark, up more than a thousand percent from a day ago.</p>

<p>"Currency exchange rate" and "Kim Yong-hyun," the name of the South Korean defense minister who reportedly proposed declaring the martial law to the president, ranked second and third on the trends chart, respectively, reports Yonhap news agency.</p>

<p>Yoon declared martial law late on Tuesday night, accusing the opposition of paralyzing the government with "anti-state activities," but lifted it hours later after the National Assembly voted to call for its end.</p>

<p>With the nation in shock over the incident, the news page of South Korea's largest internet portal, Naver, saw all-time high traffic overnight, according to its operator.</p>

<p>The surge briefly disrupted some of its functions, but service was quickly normalised.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Yeol on Wednesday held a meeting with Prime Minister Han Duck-soo and leaders of the ruling People Power Party (PPP) to discuss follow-up measures after opposition parties submitted an impeachment motion in response to the short-lived martial law declaration.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Han, PPP leader Han Dong-hoon and floor leader Choo Kyung-ho convened at the presidential office just hours after the opposition submitted the motion, following the National Assembly's rejection of the martial law declaration earlier in the day.</p>

<p>"They seriously discussed the current situation, and there was no difference in opinions," a senior presidential official said, adding Yoon's potential departure from the party was not a topic of discussion during the meeting.</p>

<p>The main opposition Democratic Party and five other minor parties plan to report the motion to a parliamentary plenary session on Thursday and put it up for a vote as early as Friday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Calling India a "very important partner", Kuwait's Foreign Minister Abdullah Ali Al-Yahya on Wednesday heaped praise on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying that the West Asian nation believes that the Indian leader is one of the wisest persons in the world.</p>

<p>"I would like to thank you for the invitation and also for the opportunity of meeting Prime Minister Modi, who we believe is one of the wisest persons worldwide. I am sure that the Prime Minister puts India on a better level, and I am sure that he will continue that... India is a very important partner and we count on our relationship," the visiting Foreign Minister said in his opening remarks at the delegation-level meeting with External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar in New Delhi on Wednesday evening.</p>

<p>Abdullah Ali Al-Yahya arrived in India late Tuesday night for an official visit that aims at further strengthening the multifaceted relationship between the two countries.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, he made a courtesy call on PM Modi at his Lok Kalyan Marg residence before holding a meeting with EAM Jaishankar at the Hyderabad House.</p>

<p>"Glad to receive Foreign Minister of Kuwait Abdullah Ali Al-Yahya. I thank the Kuwaiti leadership for the welfare of the Indian nationals. India is committed to advance our deep-rooted and historical ties for the benefit of our people and the region," PM Modi posted on X after the meeting.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Glad to receive Foreign Minister of Kuwait H.E. Abdullah Ali Al-Yahya. I thank the Kuwaiti leadership for the welfare of the Indian nationals.

â€” Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) <a href="https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1864309806439518358?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>India and Kuwait share a historically strong bilateral relationship that has stood the test of time. Rooted in centuries of trade and cultural exchange, the partnership predates Kuwait's independence in 1961, during which the Indian Rupee served as its legal tender.</p>

<p>"I think the Joint Committee will solve many issues between Kuwait and India. I think we can draw a roadmap between Kuwait and India and proceed as fast as we can," said Abdullah Ali Al-Yahya.</p>

<p>Kuwait's economy, before the discovery of oil, thrived on maritime activities, including shipbuilding, pearl diving, and trading goods like Arabian horses, dates, and pearls with India in exchange for wood, spices, and textiles.</p>

<p>This legacy of cooperation was commemorated during the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 2021-22.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas said it had information that Israel intended to carry out a hostage rescue operation similar to one conducted in Gaza's Nuseirat camp in June and threatened to "neutralise" the captives if any such action took place, according to an internal statement seen by Reuters on Wednesday.</p>

<p>In the statement dated November 22, Hamas told its operatives not to consider what the repercussions of following the instructions might be and said it held Israel responsible for the fate of the hostages.</p>

<p>The statement, which a senior Hamas source told Reuters was circulated to its factions by the intelligence unit of the group's military wing Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, did not say when any Israeli operation was expected to take place.</p>

<p>There was no immediate Israeli response to the statement. On Wednesday, Israeli media cited Defence Minister Israel Katz as saying pressure on Hamas was increasing and this time "we will really be able to advance a hostage deal".</p>

<p>Israel's Nuseirat rescue operation on June 9 saw Israeli forces free four hostages, who had been held by Hamas since October 2023, in a raid Palestinian officials said killed more than 200 people, making it one of the bloodiest Israeli assaults of the war.</p>

<p>In the Hamas statement, the group told its operatives to "tighten" the living conditions of the captives and said this should be done in accordance with instructions issued after the Nuseirat operation.</p>

<p>In a section titled "recommendations", Hamas also instructed its operatives to "activate neutralisation orders ... as an immediate and swift response to any adventure by the enemy."</p>

<p>Israel launched its campaign in Gaza after Hamas-led fighters attacked Israeli communities across the border on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking over 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's military campaign has since killed more than 44,500 Palestinians and injured many others, according to Palestinian figures. The offensive has reduced much of Gaza to rubble.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Messaging app Telegram will deploy new tools to prevent the spread of images of child sexual abuse after teaming up with the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), the UK-based charity said Wednesday.</p>

<p>The social media platform, which claims to have more than 950 million active users per month, will use tools and data from the IWF "to detect, disrupt, remove and block child sexual abuse imagery," the charity said.</p>

<p>The move comes after Telegram's Russian-born founder and chief executive Pavel Durov was arrested in August at a Paris airport and later charged with several counts of failing to curb extremist and terrorist content on the app.</p>

<p>Prosecutors also claimed the platform had failed to take action against child sexual abuse imagery. Durov, who was released on a five-million-euro ($5.6 million) bail, later announced a crackdown on illegal content.</p>

<p>The IWF said previously it had found thousands of instances of child sexual abuse imagery on Telegram since 2022.</p>

<p>The charity is a global leader in tracking down and reporting images and videos of abuse, being one of the few non-law enforcement bodies worldwide with the legal power to search for such material.</p>

<p>It is hoped the new initiative will prevent the spread of illegal images on the public parts of Telegram's platform.</p>

<p>Derek Ray-Hill, interim CEO at the IWF, called the partnership "a transformational first step on a much longer journey".</p>

<p>"We look forward to seeing what further steps we can take together to create a world in which the spread of online sexual abuse material is virtually impossible," he added.</p>

<p>The app will now use the IWF's unique digital fingerprints of millions of known child sexual abuse images and videos to spot when criminal content is being shared.</p>

<p>IWF will also report directly to Telegram when child sexual abuse imagery is detected.</p>

<p>Remi Vaughn, head of Press and Media Relations at Telegram, said the datasets and tools "will strengthen the mechanisms Telegram has in place to protect its public platform".<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK government is banning daytime TV adverts for sugary foods like granola and muffins in its battle against child obesity, branding such popular items as junk food.</p>

<p>Under measures unveiled on Tuesday, ads showing "less healthy" food and drinks will only be allowed to be aired after the 9:00 pm watershed from October next year.</p>

<p>According to the National Health Service, obesity is rising among British kids with one in 10 four-year-olds now considered to be obese. And one in five five-year-olds suffers from tooth decay from eating too much sugar.</p>

<p>Also included on the government's list -- which uses a scoring system based on each item's sugar, fat and salt content -- are pre-packaged popular sugary breakfast foods such as croissants, pancakes and waffles.</p>

<p>"Breakfast cereals including ready-to-eat cereals, granola, muesli, porridge oats and other oat-based cereals" are included, the government said.</p>

<p>Also on the banned list are products such as chickpea or lentil-based crisps, seaweed-based snacks and Bombay mix as well as energy drinks, hamburgers and chicken nuggets.</p>

<p>But the new restrictions will not apply to healthier options such as natural porridge oats and unsweetened yoghurt.</p>

<p>The government hopes the new measures could help prevent some 20,000 cases of childhood obesity a year.</p>

<p>"Obesity robs our kids of the best possible start in life, sets them up for a lifetime of health problems, and costs the NHS billions," Health Secretary Wes Streeting said.</p>

<p>"This government is taking action now to end the targeting of junk food ads at kids, across both TV and online."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cuba said it had begun restoring power after the island's electrical grid collapsed, the latest in a string of nationwide blackouts that underscore the increasingly frail state of the country's power generation system.</p>

<p>Cuba's energy minister Vicente de la O'Levy said the government had prioritized hospitals and water pumping facilities as it began restoring electricity to scattered circuits around the country.</p>

<p>But millions of Cubans across the island remained without power by midmorning, according to official reports, forcing the communist-run government to close schools and order non-official workers to stay home until electricity is restored.</p>

<p>The energy minister said he expected the system to be back online by Thursday, but said he would not rush the process.</p>

<p>"We have very capable specialists and they are all involved. We're going step by step," de la O'Levy said.</p>

<p>Cuba's grid has fallen into near-total disarray amid fuel shortages, natural disaster and economic crisis.</p>

<p>The island's oil-fired power plants, already obsolete and struggling to keep the lights on, reached a full crisis this year as oil imports from Venezuela, Russia and Mexico dwindled, contributing to multiple nationwide blackouts over two months.</p>

<p>Shortages of food, medicine, water and electricity have made life increasingly unbearable for many Cubans, who have fled the island in record-breaking numbers in the past three years.</p>

<p>Cuba blames U.S. sanctions, which complicate financial transactions and the purchase of fuel, for the crisis.</p>

<p>PLANT FAIL</p>

<p>The Wednesday morning blackout was triggered by a failure at the Antonio Guiteras power plant in Matanzas, the island's top electricity producer, which shut down at around 2 a.m. local time.</p>

<p>Several other major power plants were undergoing maintenance and were offline when the Matanzas plant failed, starving the grid of electricity and leading to the nationwide collapse, the energy minister said.</p>

<p>Millions of people across Cuba were already seeing hours-long rolling blackouts daily before Wednesday's collapse.</p>

<p>Havana hotel worker Danielis Mora woke up frustrated and confused on Wednesday, like many Havana residents, who now experience regular blackouts throughout the week.</p>

<p>"I didn't know it was a total blackout again," Mora said. "Where I am living ... there is no gas either, if there is no electricity there is no way to make food, it has to be with firewood, or charcoal."</p>

<p>Scattered protests have erupted over the past two months over the repeated power failures as well as water, gas and food shortages.</p>

<p>The system failure on Wednesday morning had left the capital Havana almost completely in the dark.</p>

<p>Officials said floating power plants, contracted from Turkey's Karpowership, were generating electricity from offshore of Havana, providing power by midmorning to hospitals and a small number of the city's 2 million residents.</p>

<p>Cuba's obsolete grid collapsed multiple times in October as fuel supplies dwindled and Hurricane Oscar struck the far eastern end of the island, then again in November with the passage of Hurricane Rafael.</p>

<p>Cuba's government last week issued a decree ordering state and private businesses to generate more of their own electricity from renewable resources. The regulations also require businesses to limit their use of air conditioning, among other measures, as the country wrestles with the increasingly dire energy crisis.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

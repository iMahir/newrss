       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 170 Hongkongers have reported being splashed with substances they feared were bodily fluids in public over the past eight months, according to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3280318/173-hongkongers-allegedly-splashed-bodily-fluids-public-over-past-8-months" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>South China Morning Post</em></a>. This revelation came after a woman criticized the penalty imposed on a man who used a pipette to squirt a liquid containing semen on her.</p>

<p>While some male victims were included, the online group revealed on Friday that approximately 99 per cent of the 173 cases involved women.</p>

<p>The group noted that most victims were doused with suspicious liquids, and many reported feelings of depression and anxiety following the incidents.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, a court fined 26-year-old PhD student Lai Changwei HK$5,000 (US$642) for squirting a liquid containing his semen onto a woman's buttocks at a Hong Kong university. Lai blamed his actions on stress.</p>

<p>CCTV footage from the Kowloon Tong campus showed Lai following the woman after spotting her inside a university building at around 3:30 p.m. on June 6, before using a plastic pipette to squirt the liquid onto her, the court heard.</p>

<p>Earlier,&nbsp;Hong Kong police arrested 43 individuals, including 31 students, in a crackdown on four criminal syndicates that used money and free illicit drugs as incentives to lure teenagers into illegal activities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stood at the podium of the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Friday, holding two maps.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stood at the podium of the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Friday, holding two maps. &nbsp;In his right hand was a map of the Middle East with Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen painted in black and dubbed "The Curse" while in his left hand was a map showing countries painted green, including Egypt, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, and even India, termed "The Blessing."</p>

<p>However, what was most conspicuous about both maps was the complete erasure of Palestine. There was no reference to its existence in the green "blessing" map nor the black "curse" one.</p>

<p>Netanyahu drew a direct link between "The Curse" and Iranian influence, stressing that Iran and its allies were the source of the ongoing conflict in the region.</p>

<p><strong>READ</strong> | <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-nasrallah-as-israel-burns-lebanon-diplomats-walk-out-during-netanyahus-un-address-6667247#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll">Israel Pounds Beirut But No Sign Of Hezbollah Chief Hassan Nasrallah</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, the countries marked in green, which included Egypt, Sudan, and Saudi Arabia, represented allies or potential allies who had either normalised relations with Israel or were in the process of doing so.</p>

<p>In his UN address, he squarely blamed Iran for the violence that continues to unfold in Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen. He cited Tehran's financial and military support to Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, and the Houthis in Yemen as evidence of its destabilising influence. Israel, he argued, was defending itself on multiple fronts against Iranian-backed fighters across the region.</p>

<p><strong>Explained </strong>| <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hamas-palestine-gaza-explained-axis-of-resistance-and-irans-proxy-network-across-middle-east-4534061">Axis Of Resistance And Iran's Proxy Network Across Middle East</a></p>

<p>"If you strike us, we will strike you," Netanyahu warned Iran, adding that Israel's reach could extend throughout the Middle East if necessary. As Netanyahu addressed the UN General Assembly, scores of diplomats walked out in protest.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said that Israel's military actions, particularly in Lebanon and Gaza, were a necessary response to Iranian aggression. "As long as Hezbollah chooses the path of war, Israel has no choice but to remove this threat," he declared.</p>

<h2><strong>Who Are The Greens, And Why</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Saudi Arabia</strong></p>

<p>One of the more complex figures on Netanyahu's green "blessing" map was Saudi Arabia. Before the eruption of hostilities between Israel and Hamas in October 2023, the Biden administration had been working to broker a normalisation deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Such a deal, which many saw as potentially transformative for the region, appeared to be on the horizon. The deal included the US entering a defence treaty with Saudi Arabia. In return, Saudi Arabia had to normalise its ties with Israel and the latter would give concessions to Palestinians and reap the dividends of having one of the major players of the Middle East as one of its allies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia, however, has maintained that normalisation with Israel would not be possible without the establishment of a Palestinian state. The war between Hamas and Israel has further complicated these discussions, though Netanyahu's inclusion of Saudi Arabia in the green zone on his map suggests that he remains optimistic, or at least, publicly projects optimism about future ties with Riyadh.</p>

<p><strong>Egypt</strong></p>

<p>Egypt's presence on the green "blessing" map was hardly surprising. Since the 1979 peace treaty, Egypt has maintained a formal yet often strained relationship with Israel. Despite years of what many call a "cold peace," Egypt has continued to play a key role in regional stability, particularly regarding Gaza.</p>

<p>Energy and security cooperation between the two nations have strengthened in recent years, with Egypt importing Israeli gas and co-managing Gaza's security through the joint enforcement of a blockade. While Egypt may not publicly endorse Israel's aggressive tactics in Gaza, its vested interests in preventing the spread of Islamist extremism and managing border security ensure its continued cooperation with Israel.</p>

<p><strong>Sudan</strong></p>

<p>In 2021, Sudan signed the Abraham Accords, which were brokered by the US to facilitate diplomatic ties between Israel and Arab states. This was a big shift for a country that, under the leadership of former President Omar al-Bashir, had been hostile toward Israel for decades.</p>

<p>The transitional government in Sudan has used normalisation with Israel as a way to strengthen ties with the US and regional powers like the UAE, which have distanced themselves from Islamist movements.</p>

<p><strong>India</strong></p>

<p>India's presence in the green "blessing" map was a nod to its evolving relationship with Israel under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. India has moved closer to Israel in recent years, especially in the areas of defence and technology. While India has historically been a supporter of Palestinian self-determination, its ties with Israel have strengthened as part of its broader strategic recalibration.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel continued ferocious rounds of airstrikes on Hezbollah's key strongholds in southern Beirut in Lebanon today. These strikes, which began last night in the heart of the capital city, sent plumes of thick smoke billowing into the sky, sparking fear and chaos in densely populated civilian areas. The operations marked Israel's most intense strikes on Beirut since shifting its military focus from Gaza to Lebanon earlier this week.</p>

<p>The targets of these attacks were alleged Hezbollah strongholds scattered throughout Lebanon, with devastating consequences, including the deaths of hundreds of people. While Israeli television networks reported that Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was the primary target, a Hezbollah source, according to news agency AFP, later claimed Nasrallah was "fine," though he has remained in hiding for years to evade assassination attempts. Nasrallah, who holds immense power in Lebanon, particularly among his Shiite supporters, is widely seen as the only figure capable of waging war or brokering peace.</p>

<p>The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) claimed that the strikes resulted in the deaths of Muhammad Ali Ismail, the commander of Hezbollah's missile unit in southern Lebanon, his deputy, and other senior officials of the Iran-backed militia. Ahmad Ahmad, a local resident who fled from his home in southern Beirut during the strikes, described the attack as feeling "like an earthquake", as quoted by news agency AFP.</p>

<p>The strikes continued into a second bombing wave, during which Israel claimed to have targeted Hezbollah's weapons depots stored within buildings in southern Beirut. Hezbollah denied this claim, while reports emerged of six buildings being levelled and 91 people wounded, with six confirmed dead. Following the strikes, Hezbollah retaliated by launching rockets into Israel, which prompted warnings from the Israeli military for civilians in Hezbollah strongholds to evacuate immediately.</p>

<p>Benjamin Netanyahu's Warning</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Friday, vowing that Israel would continue its military campaign against Hezbollah until the northern border was fully secured. He claimed that Israel has the right to defend itself, declaring that no reprieve would be given to Hezbollah, and hinting at a possible ground offensive in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Netanyahu also issued a stern warning to Tehran, accusing Iran of fueling the violence through its support of Hezbollah. "If you strike us, we will strike you," Netanyahu warned, adding that Israel's reach could extend throughout the Middle East if necessary.</p>

<p>As Netanyahu addressed the UN General Assembly, scores of diplomats walked out in protest. The devastating toll of the ongoing war in Gaza has drawn widespread condemnation, with more than 42,000 people reported dead in the besieged enclave. Entire neighbourhoods in Gaza have been reduced to rubble, with hundreds of thousands displaced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nasrallah Targeted In Beirut&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Friday evening Israeli airstrikes on southern Beirut were unprecedented in scale, reportedly involving tens of tons of explosives. Hezbollah's top officials were thought to be present at the underground headquarters that were bombed, though reports from Hezbollah claimed that Nasrallah survived the strikes. Despite the extensive destruction, with entire buildings flattened, there was no immediate confirmation of Nasrallah's death, though speculation continued to swirl.</p>

<p>Israeli officials, however, expressed confidence that the strikes had seriously compromised Hezbollah's command structure. In a televised statement, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari claimed that the strike targeted Hezbollah's central headquarters in the Dahiyeh suburb of Beirut. The IDF also revealed it had notified the US about the airstrikes while the operation was underway, but the United States was not involved.</p>

<p>Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian in response to the Beirut strikes, condemned the attack as a "flagrant war crime," further intensifying the already volatile situation.</p>

<p>The United Nations and international humanitarian organisations have sounded alarms over the deadly situation in Lebanon. "We are witnessing the deadliest period in Lebanon in a generation, and many fear that this is only the beginning," said UN humanitarian coordinator Imran Riza, as quoted by news agency AFP.&nbsp;<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chants of several women hailing Gisele Pelicot as the emerging feminist icon filled the air as the 72-year-old walked into a courtroom for her mass rape trial in Avignon, France. She has been frequently seen in conventionally chic dresses with an auburn bob cut and dark glasses, adding to her decision to waiver off anonymity and make the mass rape trial public.</p>

<p>Pelicot walked into the courtroom for a trial which had shaken the country three weeks ago, when it was revealed that her husband, Dominique Pelicot, invited dozens of men over to rape her, after drugging her unconscious, for decades.</p>

<p>As reported by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/18/gisele-pelicot-tells-court-she-never-consented-to-mass" rel="No Follow, No Index">The Guardian</a>, Dominique Pelicot, 71, was caught by a security guard in November 2020 as he was filming up the skirts of women at a supermarket near their home. Soon after, his computer was investigated by the police disclosing details which would shatter Gisele's life. The report stated that while investigating the case, police saw a file, labelled "abuses" on the USB drive that was connected to Dominique Pelicot's computer. Officials found nearly 20,000 images and films of his wife getting raped nearly 100 times.</p>

<p>Gisele Pelicot referred to the moment when the investigators first showed her the visuals as "an explosion, a tsunami". "My world is falling apart. For me, everything is falling apart. Everything I have built up over 50 years... Frankly, these are scenes of horror for me," she said during the trial.</p>

<p>Police investigation revealed that her husband contacted the accused perpetrators through an online chatroom after sedating her with a fine mix of crushed sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication. This led to Gisele being convinced that she might be a victim of Alzheimer's disease which destroys one's memory gradually.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/drugged-and-raped-gisele-pelicot-has-become-frances-symbol-of-fight-against-sexual-violence/cid/2048025">Telegraph</a> reported, that upon being told by the judge that he would try his best to avoid asking "disturbing" questions, she said, "Given what I have been through, nothing disturbs me."</p>

<p>Out of the 50 men accused of raping her after being recruited by her husband, some had admitted to the crime while some had denied it was a 'rape'. "To those who deny this was rape, I say to them for once in your life, take responsibility for your acts," she said.</p>

<p>As the trial commenced, Gisele chose to waive her right to anonymity, stating her intention to raise awareness about drug-facilitated sexual violence. "Shame changes sides," she declared, emphasizing that it should be the perpetrators who bear the burden of shame, not the victims. In the past three weeks since the trial began, her face has been on the front pages of newspapers, graffitied walls, and television screens, making her an epitome of the French Feminist movement, which is often known for being instrumental in setting forth the core principles of feminist theory worldwide. France has witnessed the origin of seminal feminist works such as Simone de Beauvoir's "The Second Sex" to Helene Cixous' "The Laugh of the Medusa."</p>

<p>Gisele, during her testimony, displayed remarkable composure as she recounted the details of her abuse. She said, that she only had the courage to watch those visuals in May 2024, when she witnessed herself being treated "like a rag doll." Gisele's testimony further revealed that she had contracted multiple sexually transmitted diseases and faced exposure to HIV during the assaults. Responding to claims from some defendants that she had consented to these encounters, she stated unequivocally: "It's an insult to my intelligence. These individuals were totally aware of what state I was in."</p>

<p>The trial has ignited widespread public discourse on masculinity and consent in France. Thousands have rallied in support of Gisele, demanding accountability for sexual violence and challenging societal norms that allow such acts to persist. A letter in support of Gisele Pelicot signed by more than 200 high-profile men was published in the French daily Liberation.</p>

<p>"Let's stop viewing women's bodies as objects at our disposal," read a text signed by more than 170 men and published in the left-leaning Liberation newspaper on Saturday. "Let's stop thinking there exists a certain male nature that justifies our behaviour, let's stop perpetuating the boy's club and protecting our male peers" it read.</p>

<p>Ivan Jablonka, a social historian, said the trial was "historic" due to the number of defendants, as reported by the AFP. "It's a reminder, if one were necessary, that rapes are committed by our neighbours, our colleagues, our relatives in our homes," he said.</p>

<p>However, not all responses have been supportive.</p>

<p>Remarks made by local officials downplaying Gisele's ordeal have drawn ire on social media. The mayor of Mazan faced backlash after stating "After all, no one died" in this case, prompting an apology later, for his insensitivity.</p>

<p>As Gisele Pelicot continues to testify against her abusers, she remains steadfast in her mission: "I want it to be exemplary," she said, adding that her fight is not just for herself but for all women who suffer in silence from sexual abuse. Paying tribute to the policeman who initially arrested her husband and searched his phone and computer. "He no doubt saved my life," she said.</p>

<p>With each passing day in court, she demolishes the stigma surrounding victims of sexual violence and challenges societal norms that allow such atrocities to persist. While her husband now pleads guilty in the trial, the exact reason behind his atrocious act has not been explicitly stated yet. However, the presence of the over 20,000 visuals which brought out the shocking revelation points to an inclination towards voyeurism as well. The trial is expected to continue till December 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian condemned Israel's air strikes on the Lebanese capital's densely populated southern suburbs Friday as a "flagrant war crime."</p>

<p>"The attacks perpetrated ... by the Zionist regime in the Dahiya neighbourhood of Beirut constitute a flagrant war crime that has revealed once again the nature of this regime's state terrorism," Pezeshkian said in a statement carried by the official IRNA news agency early Saturday.</p>

<p>Israel said its strikes targeted the "central headquarters" of Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, an Iranian ally.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian vowed Iran "will stand with the Lebanese nation and the axis of resistance".</p>

<p>Friday's strikes were by far the fiercest to hit Beirut since Israel shifted its focus from the war in Gaza to Lebanon this week, pounding Hezbollah strongholds around the country and killing hundreds of people.</p>

<p>The Iranian embassy in Lebanon warned that they marked a "dangerous escalation" in the Middle East.</p>

<p>"This reprehensible crime... represents a dangerous escalation that changes the rules of the game," the embassy said in a post on X, adding that Israel "will receive the appropriate punishment".</p>

<p>The Iranian foreign ministry said that the "brutal" strike gave the lie to a US-led ceasefire call issued on the eve of the strike.</p>

<p>"The continuation of the Zionist regime's crimes shows clearly that the ceasefire call issued by the United States and some Western countries is a blatant trick aimed at winning time for the Zionist regime to continue its crimes against the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples," ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said in a statement</p>

<p>Hezbollah started fighting Israeli troops along the Lebanon border a day after its Palestinian ally Hamas staged its unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump on Friday accused Google of showing only "bad stories" about him and vowed to have the tech giant prosecuted if he gets back in the White House.</p>

<p>Trump provided no backing for his accusation in a post on his Truth Social platform, in which he added that the search engine displays only positive articles about his Democratic rival Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>"This is an ILLEGAL ACTIVITY, and hopefully the Justice Department will criminally prosecute them for this blatant Interference of Elections," he said in the post.</p>

<p>"If not, and subject to the Laws of our Country, I will request their prosecution, at the maximum levels, when I win the election."</p>

<p>The Trump post came after a conservative group reported on what it said it found when doing a search on "Donald Trump presidential race 2024."</p>

<p>"Both campaign websites consistently appear at the top of Search for relevant and common search queries," Google said in response to an AFP inquiry.</p>

<p>"This report looked at a single rare search term on a single day a few weeks ago, and even for that search, both candidates' websites ranked in the top results on Google."</p>

<p>Google has been adamant that it does not manipulate search results to favor any political candidate.</p>

<p>The company does not disclose the inner workings of the software that powers its ubiquitous search engine.</p>

<p>However, factors known to influence search results for news stories include the timeliness and popularity of topics.</p>

<p>Trump is at the center of numerous criminal and civil cases in which he faces accusations including sexual abuse, paying hush money to a porn star, interfering with the 2020 election and trying to thwart the peaceful transition of power after President Joe Biden defeated him.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Former CEO Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison earlier this year, after pleading guilty to violating U.S. laws against money laundering at the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.</p>

<p>Reuters could not immediately reach the Bureau of Prisons for comment.</p>

<p>Prosecutors had said that Binance adopted a model that welcomed criminals and failed to report more than 100,000 suspicious transactions with designated terrorist groups including Hamas, al-Qaeda and Islamic State.</p>

<p>They also said Zhao's exchange supported the sale of child sexual abuse materials and received a large portion of ransomware proceeds.</p>

<p>Binance agreed to a $4.32 billion penalty, and Zhao paid a $50 million criminal fine plus $50 million to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Federal prosecutors in the United States have today filed criminal charges in the case. The hackers had allegedly targeted members of former president Donald Trump's campaign.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The grand jury in the US has indicted three Iranians on charges related to hacking and cyber espionage of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign. The indictment comes in the wake of increased worries over election interference in the US by Iran, China and Russia.</p>

<p>Federal prosecutors in the United States have today filed criminal charges in the case. The hackers had allegedly targeted members of former president Donald Trump's campaign.</p>

<p>The three suspects allegedly conspired with several other hackers to carry out "a years-long, wide ranging hacking operation on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)," US Attorney General Merrick Garland said.</p>

<p>The charges pertain to an top secret Iranian cyber espionage operation that allegedly stole crucial documents related to Donald Trump's campaign. These hackers also allegedly sent these details to several journalists and key individuals associated with US President Joe Biden's re-election campaign. This was before President Joe Biden backed out and nominated his deputy - Kamala Harris - as the Democratic presidential candidate.</p>

<p>"The defendants' own words make clear that they were attempting to undermine former president Trump's campaign in advance of the 2024 US presidential election," Mr Garland said.</p>

<p>Court documents revealed that the hackers had "prepared for, and engaged in a wide-ranging hacking campaign". These include methods like spear-phishing and social engineering techniques to compromise accounts of several US government officials and individuals associated with political campaigns.</p>

<p>A Microsoft report last month said that "Iranian hackers had sent a spear phishing e-mail in June 2024 to a high-ranking official on Donald Trump's presidential campaign." In the same month Google's cybersecurity department said that "Hackers from Iran tried to breach President Joe Biden's campaign as well."</p>

<p>"The message of the US government is clear: The American people, not a foreign power, decide the outcome of our country's elections," Mr Garland said.</p>

<p>Details on how successful these hacking attempts were, which officials were targeted, and the level of breach have not been revealed by investigating agencies.</p>

<p>The United States Intelligence Community or IC had said earlier this month that "Foreign actors are increasing their election influence activities as we approach November. Our judgements on the activities of Russia, Iran, and China have not changed since our last update."</p>

<p>Today's indictment is the latest in a string of federal indictments against foreign hackers that have targeted government agencies and individuals.</p>

<p>Donald Trump's history with Iran goes far back. During his campaigns for the 2024 presidential election, Mr Trump claimed that US intelligence agencies have reportedly told him that Tehran has allegedly been plotting to assassinate him.</p>

<p>Top security officials in the United States believe Iran has been plotting for years to assassinate Donald Trump, seeking revenge for the 2020 killing of Iran's then top General, Qasem Sulemani, who was one of the most influential figures in the country.</p>

<h2><strong>HOW DANGEROUS IS "IRAN'S THREAT"</strong></h2>

<p>The Attorney General noted that "there are few actors in this world that pose as grave a threat to the national security of the United States as does Iran."</p>

<p>Court documents revealed that the planning for these hacking attempts were planned as far back as 2020. They further stated that in May this year, the hackers began targeting and gaining illegal access to personal accounts of individuals linked with the US presidential campaign.</p>

<p>The US Treasury Department also took strong action in the case by imposing sanctions on seven Iranians, including Masoud Jalili, who was among the three hackers who were charged today.</p>

<p>The United States Treasury "remains strongly committed to holding accountable those who see to undermine our institutions," said Bradley Smith, the current Treasury Under Secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.</p>

<p>Besides Jalili, the Treasury also sanctioned six staff members and executives of Iran's cybersecurity firm Emennet Pasargad. "Between approximately August and November 2020, Emennet Pasargad led an online operation to intimidate and influence American voters, and to undermine voter confidence and sow discord," the Treasury stated.</p>

<h3><strong>RUSSIAN AND CHINESE "INTERFERENCE"</strong></h3>

<p>The US has also accused Russia and China of interfering in the US presidential election, charges that both Russia and China have denied. While Donald Trump's campaign has alleged that Vladimir Putin is openly supporting Kamala Harris, based on his remarks at a televised interview, the US government has claimed that the Russian media trying to influence the US electorate.</p>

<p>China, it claims, is interfering too, based on who it feels would be more suitable for its own global agenda. Both Moscow and Beijing have denied these charges.</p>

<p>The US has accused the Chinese government of directly interfering in US's internal matters as Beijing has reportedly made repeated and ongoing attempts to polarise Americans based on domestic issues ahead of the US elections. Beijing is also accused of targeted attacks on candidates and parties.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had in April this year said that the US has got evidence of Chinese attempts to "influence and arguably interfere" with the US elections.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[At least 33 people are dead, US officials said Friday, after Hurricane Helene hit Florida and several other southeastern  states, leaving a trail of destruction with several areas still under flood alerts.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The death toll from Hurricane Helene rose Friday to at least 33 people across the southeastern United States, authorities said, as torrential flooding inundated communities and emergency responders launched massive rescue operations.</p>

<p>Roads, homes and businesses were underwater after the enormous storm made landfall near the Florida state capital Tallahassee overnight and surged north, knocking out power for millions of customers.</p>

<p>And while Helene, a Category 4 hurricane, weakened to a tropical storm and eventually a tropical depression it has continued to wreak havoc across multiple states, hammering them with heavy winds and rain that the National Hurricane Center described as "life-threatening conditions."</p>

<p>The Miami-based NHC reported the storm was "still producing historic and catastrophic flooding" and warned of flash floods in Georgia's largest city Atlanta, as well as in South Carolina, North Carolina and Tennessee.</p>

<p>Up to 12 inches (30 centimeters) of rain was forecast in the Appalachian mountains, with isolated spots even receiving 20 inches.</p>

<p>In South Carolina at least 14 people have died, including two firefighters, officials said. Four of the fatalities were related to "trees falling through the roof of the homes," said Darryl Ables, the coroner in Aiken County.</p>

<p>Georgia Governor Brian Kemp reported 11 killed in his state, including an emergency responder, and he warned that the city of Valdosta had identified 115 heavily damaged structures with multiple people trapped inside.</p>

<p>Florida's toll stood at seven. Governor Ron DeSantis said the damage from Helene exceeded that of hurricanes Idalia and Debby, which both hit the same Big Bend region southeast of Tallahasee in the last 13 months.</p>

<p>"It's a real gut-punch to those communities," DeSantis told Fox News.</p>

<p>In Perry, near where Helene slammed ashore bearing winds of 140 miles (225 kilometers) per hour, houses lost power and the gas station was flattened.</p>

<p>"I am Floridian, so I'm kind of used to it, but it was real scary at one point," said Larry Bailey, 32, who sheltered in his small wooden home all night with his two nephews and sister.</p>

<p>"It's like, was my house gonna get blown away or not?"</p>

<p>Four hundred miles to the north in the Tennessee town of Erwin, a dramatic rescue operation was unfolding as raging floodwaters left a hospital dangerously isolated and more than 50 patients and staff trapped on the roof, according to local television footage.</p>

<p><strong>- 'It looks bad' -</strong></p>

<p>With typhoon Yagi battering Asia, storm Boris drenching Europe and extreme flooding in the Sahel, September so far has been an unusually wet month around the world.</p>

<p>Scientists link some extreme weather events to human-caused global warming.</p>

<p>"Helene traveled over exceptionally warm ocean waters in the Gulf of Mexico," Andra Garner, a climate scientist at Rowan University in New Jersey, told AFP.</p>

<p>"It's likely that those extra warm ocean waters played a role in Helene's rapid intensification."</p>

<p>"Storm surges are getting worse," Garner said, "because our sea levels are rising as we warm the planet."</p>

<p>Curtis Drafton, a search and rescue volunteer in Steinhatchee, Florida, raised similar concerns as he tackled the storm's aftermath.</p>

<p>"We have got to start wondering: is this the new normal? Is it going to happen every year?" the 48-year-old told AFP.</p>

<p>"We have a lot of talk about once-in-a-lifetime storm, but we had one similar last year.</p>

<p>"We had a 9-foot (2.7-meter) storm surge, two feet over my head plus a little bit more. This dock here got shredded," Drafton said.</p>

<p>Some residents in Atlanta resorted to bailing water out of ground-floor windows with buckets, while near Tampa in Florida, boats were left stranded in gardens.</p>

<p>Five million homes and businesses were without power across a huge swath of the country: Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia, according to tracking site PowerOutage.us.</p>

<p>In the impact zone, residents had been warned of "unsurvivable" storm surge.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden and state authorities had urged people to heed official evacuation warnings before Helene hit, though some chose to stay in their homes to wait out the storm.</p>

<p>"It looks bad," Biden told reporters Friday.</p>

<p>DeSantis said "hundreds of search and rescue missions were conducted by state personnel," while the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Deanne Criswell, said "we've done over 600 rescues," many of them still ongoing.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah is the only man in Lebanon with the power to wage war or make peace, but he leads a life in hiding to avoid assassination by his movement's arch-enemy, Israel.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah is the only man in Lebanon with the power to wage war or make peace, but he leads a life in hiding to avoid assassination by his movement's arch-enemy, Israel.</p>

<p>A wave of Israeli strikes on Friday hit Hezbollah's main bastion in south Beirut, and Israeli broadcasters said Nasrallah was the target.</p>

<p>A source close to Hezbollah denied the reports, saying that he was "fine".</p>

<p>Nasrallah enjoys cult status among his Shiite Muslim supporters, is equipped with a formidable arsenal far bigger and more modern than the national army's, and holds sway over Lebanon's institutions.</p>

<p>Nasrallah has rarely been seen in public since his movement fought a devastating 2006 war with Israel.</p>

<p>In 2011, the leader showed up at a religious procession in Beirut's southern suburbs and briefly greeting supporters before addressing the crowd on video from an undisclosed location.</p>

<p>In a 2014 interview with Lebanon's pro-Hezbollah newspaper Al-Akhbar, Nasrallah said that "the Israelis are pushing the idea... that I live far from people, that I don't see them or communicate with them."</p>

<p>He said that he regularly switched sleeping places, but denied that he lived in a bunker.</p>

<p>"The point of security measures is that movement be kept secret, but that doesn't stop me from moving around and seeing what is happening," he said.</p>

<p>Nasrallah is still occasionally photographed alongside other leaders of Iran-backed armed groups in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Very few people are believed to know where he lives. Officials and journalists who met Nasrallah in recent years described tight security measures that prevented them from knowing where they were being taken.</p>

<p>The vast majority of his speeches in the past two decades have been recorded and broadcast from a secret location.</p>

<p><strong>- Supporting Hamas -</strong></p>

<p>A gifted public speaker, 64-year-old Nasrallah is a master of cadence, swinging from humour to belittle his enemies to rage to fire up his 100,000-man militia.</p>

<p>The bearded, bespectacled cleric is never seen without traditional robes and the black turban that marks him out as a descendant of the prophet Mohammed.</p>

<p>He is married and has four surviving children.</p>

<p>He was elected secretary general of Hezbollah in 1992, aged just 32, after an Israeli helicopter gunship killed his predecessor Abbas al-Musawi.</p>

<p>Hezbollah is the only group that refused to give up its weapons after Lebanon's 15-year civil war ended in 1990, and Nasrallah insists that Israel remains an existential threat.</p>

<p>Since Hezbollah's Palestinian ally Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, Hezbollah has battled Israeli troops almost daily along the Lebanon-Israel border.</p>

<p><strong>- Political force -</strong></p>

<p>Born in Beirut's impoverished northern suburb of Burj Hammud on August 31, 1960, he was one of nine children of a poor grocer hailing from the tiny southern village of Bazuriyeh.</p>

<p>Nasrallah studied politics and the Koran for three years at a seminary in Iraq's Shiite holy city of Najaf, before being expelled in 1978 when the Sunni-dominated government turned on Shiite activists.</p>

<p>He then became heavily involved in Lebanese politics and gained much of his early experience in the Shiite Amal militia during the civil war.</p>

<p>But he broke away from Amal when Israeli troops marched on Beirut in 1982 to become one of the founders of Hezbollah.</p>

<p>He acquired his cult status in Lebanon and across the Arab world after Israel withdrew its troops from south Lebanon under relentless Hezbollah attack in May 2000, ending 22 years of occupation of the border strip.</p>

<p>Nasrallah's years at the helm of Hezbollah, or Party of God, have seen the group expand from guerrilla faction into the country's most powerful political force.</p>

<p>Hezbollah is admired by many Shiites in Lebanon for supporting local charities, building up health and education services in its strongholds and assisting the needy among its supporters.</p>

<p>But in divided Lebanon, the movement is also widely hated, including by those who dream of a nation free from sectarianism and where the rule of law prevails.</p>

<p>Nasrallah's personal popularity soared across the Arab world after a UN-brokered ceasefire ended the 2006 conflict with Israel, before suffering a blow when he sent fighters to neighbouring Syria to prop up President Bashar al-Assad's regime in the war since 2011.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States had no advance warning of an Israeli strike in Beirut and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Israeli counterpart as it was ongoing, a Pentagon spokesperson said on Friday.</p>

<p>They were the U.S. government's first comments about an Israeli operation that defied Washington's calls for de-escalation and a ceasefire.</p>

<p>"The United States was not involved in this operation and we had no advanced warning," spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters.</p>

<p>Singh declined to say what Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Austin about the operation and whether it targeted the Iran-backed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The Pentagon declined to speculate on whether Nasrallah was still alive.</p>

<p>Austin and Gallant spoke as the Pentagon chief flew over the Atlantic after a visit to London.</p>

<p>The Biden administration has been seeking to contain the crisis from spiraling further. Austin has publicly warned that an all-out conflict between Israel and Hezbollah would be devastating. On Thursday, he warned that risk existed but added a diplomatic solution was still viable.</p>

<p>"We now face the risk of an all-out war. Another full-scale war (could) be devastating for both Israel and Lebanon," Austin told reporters on Thursday.</p>

<p>Asked what Austin may have communicated to Gallant given the Israeli strike's potential impact on U.S. efforts to secure a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, Singh declined to offer specifics, but she said the defense secretary is always frank in his conversations with his Israeli counterpart.</p>

<p>"Look at just the engagements that the secretary and Minister Gallant have had over the last two weeks, speaking regularly. I think if there was any type of fracture in trust, you wouldn't see those type of levels of calls and engagements occurring frequently," Singh said when asked if the lack of advance notification by Israel indicated a lack of trust.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it had targeted Hezbollah's central headquarters in Beirut's southern suburbs on Friday in an attack that shook the Lebanese capital and sent thick clouds of smoke over the city.</p>

<p>The news outlet Axios cited an Israeli source as saying Nasrallah was the target of the strike and that the Israeli military was checking if he was hit.</p>

<p>A source close to Hezbollah told Reuters that Nasrallah was alive, while Iran's Tasnim news agency also reported he was safe. A senior Iranian security official told Reuters that Tehran was checking his status.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu has denied having an "India Out" agenda, asserting that the island nation had a "serious problem" with the presence of foreign military on its soil.</p>

<p>Mohamed Muizzu, who is in the US to attend the 79th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, made the remarks on Thursday while responding to a question at Princeton University's "Dean's Leadership Series".</p>

<p>"We have never been against any one country at any point. It's not India Out. Maldives faced a serious problem with foreign military presence on this soil," Maldivian news portal adhadhu.com quoted him as saying.</p>

<p>"The people of Maldives do not want a single foreign soldier in the country," Mohamed Muizzu said.</p>

<p>The ties between India and the Maldives came under severe strain since November last year when Mohamed Muizzu, known for his pro-China leanings, took charge as Maldivian president.</p>

<p>Mohamed Muizzu had asked India to withdraw nearly 90 Indian military personnel operating three aviation platforms gifted by the country. India withdrew its military personnel by May 10 and replaced them with civilian personnel to operate a Dornier aircraft and two helicopters.</p>

<p>Mohamed Muizzu further stressed he had taken action against deputy ministers for insulting Prime Minister Narendra Modi on social media.</p>

<p>"No one should say such a thing. I took action against it. I will not accept insulting anyone like that, whether he is a leader or an ordinary person. Every human being has a reputation," the report quoted him as saying.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, deputy ministers in Maldives' youth ministry were suspended for derogatory social media posts against Prime Minister Modi following a backlash, with New Delhi strongly raising the matter with Male. The deputy ministers criticised Modi for his post on 'X' following his visit to Lakshadweep, inferring that it was an attempt to project the Union Territory as an alternative tourist destination to the Maldives.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi was in Lakshadweep on January 2 and 3 to inaugurate several projects.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[New York Mayor Eric Adams pleaded not guilty Friday to charges of fraud and bribery in a case that marks a stunning downfall for a man once touted as a future Democratic Party star.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York Mayor Eric Adams pleaded not guilty Friday to charges of fraud and bribery in a case that marks a stunning downfall for a man once touted as a future Democratic Party star.</p>

<p>Adams, who appeared before a judge in a Manhattan federal court, is the first sitting New York mayor to be criminally indicted.</p>

<p>He is accused of wire fraud, soliciting illegal campaign donations and a bribery conspiracy involving Turkish citizens and at least one Turkish official. Judge Katherine Parker set the next hearing for Wednesday.</p>

<p>The allegations prompted calls for his resignation, but Adams has remained defiant, saying on Thursday that he is looking "forward to defending myself" and urging New Yorkers to "wait to hear our side of the story."</p>

<p>Accompanied by aides, the 64-year-old mayor made no comments to waiting reporters Friday but gave a thumbs-up as he entered the courthouse. He wore a dark blue suit and a purple tie.</p>

<p>"I am not guilty, your honor," he said in court.</p>

<p>Presenting the charges on Thursday, US District Attorney Damian Williams said the mayor was "secretly being showered" with gifts for years.</p>

<p>"The conduct alleged in the indictment -- the foreign money, the corporate money, the years of concealment -- is a grave breach of the public's trust," Williams told journalists.</p>

<h3><strong>Luxury travel</strong></h3>

<p>The 57-page document accuses the mayor of America's biggest city of crimes going back a decade, when Adams, a Democrat, took office as Brooklyn's borough president.</p>

<p>According to the charges, he accepted luxury international flights, hotel suites and free high-end restaurant meals including from Turkish associates in return for favors.</p>

<p>In one example, prosecutors say Adams pressured the city's fire department to approve Turkey's new high-rise consulate in Manhattan despite safety concerns.</p>

<p>"The Turkish official got what he wanted, and as we explained in the indictment, just four days after Adams held up his end of the bargain, he went right back to soliciting more travel benefits," Williams said.</p>

<p>Scandal has swirled around Adams for months with several high-ranking allies resigning as others were indicted or raided by federal agents.</p>

<p>The drama escalated with a pre-dawn raid of his official residence early Thursday.</p>

<p>Some city and state officials have demanded he resign, including influential New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who said Adams must step down "for the good of the city."</p>

<p>The indictment risks embarrassing Democrats weeks before the presidential election between Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, who are polling neck and neck.</p>

<p>Adams, the second Black mayor in the city's history, won the 2021 Democratic primary vowing to reduce crime, which did fall after rising during the Covid pandemic.</p>

<p>But the city of 8.5 million people faces a housing crisis that has seen rents skyrocket. Adams is up for reelection next year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris will tackle the politically explosive issue of illegal immigration with a visit to the US-Mexican border Friday, in a bid to blunt one of Donald Trump's main attack lines in their fight for the White House.</p>

<p>The US vice president's trip to Arizona, her first to the border since replacing President Joe Biden as Democratic nominee in July, comes as polls show the subject remains one of her biggest vulnerabilities against the Republican.</p>

<p>Harris will call for tougher border security in a major speech in the border town of Douglas, and accuse Trump of killing off attempts to pass a bipartisan migration bill to boost his own election chances, her campaign said.</p>

<p>"The American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games," she plans to say, according to her campaign.</p>

<p>Arizona is also one of the half-dozen battleground states that are expected to decide the agonizingly close November 5 election, and the one where polls show Harris may have to do the most work.</p>

<p>Republican former president Trump has turbocharged the border issue in recent weeks as he seeks an edge against Harris, America's first female, Black and South Asian vice president.</p>

<p>He has called for mass deportations, amplified bogus claims about migrants eating pet cats and dogs, and stepped up his racist rhetoric about an "invasion" of illegal immigrants.</p>

<h3><strong>'Save her airfare'</strong></h3>

<p>On the eve of Harris's visit, which is just her second to the Mexican border as vice president, Trump accused his rival of having "completely destroyed" the frontier.</p>

<p>"She should save her airfare. She should go back to the White House and tell the president to close the border," he said in New York on Thursday.</p>

<p>Trump is set to hold a campaign event in Michigan, another key swing state, after a tense meeting in New York with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on US support for Kyiv.</p>

<p>Recent polls have seen Harris eating into Trump's lead on migration with voters, yet it still remains a weak spot for Harris, with record numbers of illegal border crossings under her and Biden's watch.</p>

<p>But Harris points to the fact that numbers have plummeted since Biden signed an executive order in June temporarily closing the border to asylum seekers -- to around 58,000 in August from a peak of 250,000 last December.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old will meet border agents during her visit, call for action to stop the flow of the deadly opioid fentanyl across the border, and talk up her former career as a prosecutor involved in tackling gangs smuggling drugs across the border, the campaign said.</p>

<p>Harris will also accuse Trump of lobbying Republicans in the US Congress to tank last year's bill on migration, which would have given more funding to border security, because he feared it would hurt him politically.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump doubles down</strong></h3>

<p>Republicans for their part have accused her of flip-flopping on whether to continue with the wall along the 1,900-mile (3,050-kilometer) border that Trump made one of his signature policies.</p>

<p>They have also focused on her role early in the Biden administration when the president tasked her with looking into the causes of illegal migration from Central America -- falsely calling her a "border czar" and implying that she had overall control over US border policy.</p>

<p>Harris has struggled with the subject in the past, including in a widely mocked interview in 2021 when she defensively claimed that "we've been to the border" when she personally had not, and added: "And I haven't been to Europe."</p>

<p>Trump has meanwhile doubled down on his divisive rhetoric targeting migrants, with the 78-year-old billionaire seeing it as appealing to his base of largely white, blue-collar voters.</p>

<p>In his remarks on Thursday, Trump also repeated his claim that migrants were "infecting our country," using language that Biden has previously compared to that used by Nazi Germany.</p>

<p>Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance have in recent weeks played up false stories about Haitian migrants eating pets in the town of Springfield, Ohio.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

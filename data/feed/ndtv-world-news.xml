       <description><![CDATA[The project, set to start in December, aims to attract tourists and boost revenue, sparking widespread debate on Chinese social media.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A unique tourism experience is being introduced in Heilongjiang province, China, where tourists can walk the back-breaking difficult routes of former exiles while wearing handcuffs and prisoner uniforms, according to <em>South China Morning Post.</em></p>

<p>In an effort to increase tourism and revenue, the project, which is scheduled to begin in December, has generated a lot of discussion on Chinese social media.It is hoped that this creative package will significantly boost tourism numbers and revenues.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3285391/china-city-offers-torturous-exile-routes-visitors-boost-tourism-sparking-debate"><em>SCMP, </em></a>Mudanjiang city, located in the southeast of Heilongjiang, was home to Ningguta, an ancient military town and one of the most renowned locations for exile.Historical records indicate that over 1.5 million people were banished to Ningguta for serious crimes during the Qing dynasty (1644-1911).</p>

<p>Many prisoners faced long, gruelling journeys, with many perishing along the way, while survivors were often enslaved by local officials.Ningguta gained modern notoriety through the hit historical drama Empresses in the Palace, in which Emperor Yongzheng exiles his consort's family there.</p>

<p>On mainland social media, this experience of ancient punishment has received a lot of attention.</p>

<p>"I can't wait to go to Ningguta this winter and do a 'prisoner' hike," one Weibo online observer wrote in anticipation. It sounds like a great way to relieve tension.</p>

<p>"It's a creative way to promote local history and culture that appeals to young people," said another.</p>

<p>There are conflicting views also: "Many intellectuals and patriots were forcibly exiled from Ningguta, which was a tragic location in ancient China." This behaviour is insensitive to that traumatic past.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American comic and talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, who usually shows his audience the funny side of things, could not find his smile on the day Donald Trump was elected President of the US for a second time. The renowned TV host teared and choked up during his opening monologue of his nightly hour-long show 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' on ABC.</p>

<p>Calling it "A terrible night, last night" Mr Kimmel, visibly disturbed and in despair over Donald Trump's electoral win, said he tried a lot, but couldn't see anything positive from the US election result.</p>

<p>"Let's be honest, it was a terrible night last night. It was a terrible night for women, for children, for the hundreds of thousands of hardworking immigrants who make this country great," he said, emotionally choking briefly, as the live audience applauded to help cheer him up.</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="400" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fSiP2v9aqKw?si=QF52eDnHHuyd8ff4" title="YouTube video player" width="650"></iframe></p>

<p><small><strong><em>(Video Courtesy: YouTube - Access Hollywood)</em></strong></small></p>

<p>Mr Kimmel went on to say that "...terrible for healthcare, for our climate, for science, for journalism, for justice, for free speech... a terrible night for poor people, for the middle-class, for senior citizens, for social security.... for our allies in Ukraine," choking up again, but still continuing "For NATO, for the truth... terrible night for democracy, and for decency, and for everyone who voted against him... but guess what, it was a bad night for anyone who voted for him too - you just don't realise it yet..." as the audience applauded him again.</p>

<p>Standing in front of a backdrop that showed a usual American cityscape in total darkness, Mr Kimmel finally found his humour amid the gloom when he said "...and most of all, it was an absolute disaster of a night for Melania," as the audience burst into a fit of laughter.</p>

<p>He then gathered steam to roast President-elect Trump from his stage, before ending his monologue with "the only positive thing I could find".</p>

<p>"Maybe in the long run we, the people will realise that maybe this is what we needed for us all to wake up. Maybe the people who care so much about him need to find out how little he cares about them...maybe the only positive from this is that he will not be able to run for President again in 2028."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, another renowned talk show host and comedian, Stephen Colbert, who hosts the Late Show on CBS, also spoke about Trump's victory. He addressed the remark most journalists face that Donald Trump is good for more news or comic material, with a witty comeback.</p>

<p>"As a late night host, people often say to me 'C'mon...part of you would want Trump to win, because he gives you so much material to work with'.... well, no," he said, adding that "Noone tells the guy who cleans the bathroom, 'Wow, you must love it when someone has explosive diarrhea coz there is so much material for you to work with'," as the audience laughed and sniggered.</p>

<p>He left the audience in splits when he concluded his monologue by saying, "The first time Donald Trump was elected, he started off as a joke and ended up as a tragedy.... this time he is starting off as a tragedy; who knows how he'll end up... maybe a limerick? 'There once was a man who was orange... damn it!"</p>

<p>While the laughter still echoed in sthe studio, Mr Colbert summed it all up by saying, "Who knows what the next four years are going to be like..."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Vietnamese father uncovered a long-buried truth after noticing his daughter's appearance bore no resemblance to either parent, according to<em> the South China Morning Post.</em> A DNA test revealed he was not her biological father. This revelation led to a journey uncovering a hospital mix-up, with the truth emerging when the daughter met another girl born on the same date at a new school.</p>

<p>However, as Lan grew into a teenager and became increasingly beautiful, he noticed she bore no resemblance to either him or his wife. Suspicion prompted him to conduct a DNA test, which confirmed that Lan was not his biological daughter.</p>

<p>The revelation led him to grow distant and cold towards his wife and daughter, and he often came home drunk.One night, after getting drunk, he confronted his wife with the DNA results and accused her of infidelity, reported <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3285560/vietnam-man-suspicious-too-pretty-daughter-not-his-shocked-birth-switch-accident"><em>SCMP.</em></a> However, Hong denied the allegations and eventually moved to the northern capital city of Hanoi with her daughter. The move forced Lan to transfer schools, a move that unexpectedly revealed the truth.</p>

<p>At a birthday party, a mother noticed Lan's striking resemblance to herself, suspecting a hospital mix-up. DNA tests confirmed Lan and her friend were switched at birth. The families now regularly spend time together and plan to reveal the truth to the girls, with legal action remaining undecided.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A section of women in the United States are "swearing off men". Reason? Donald Trump's win as the President.</p>

<p>With Donald Trump becoming the US President, fears have raised over the abortion rights of women, doubting if the Republican would make access to the procedure more uncertain. In 2022, Trump had celebrated the Supreme's Court's ruling that ended a nationwide right to abortion. However, over time, he has also said that he would leave the decision on abortion rights to the states rather than enact a federal ban.</p>

<p>Amid the rising fear, South Korea's '4B' movement has entered the US, with some women on social media saying that they are tired of awaiting what the future holds for their own bodily autonomy.</p>

<p>The '4B' movement - a radical feminism movement against patriarchy - origniated from South Korea around 2017-18, but gained recognition in 2019 on X (formerly known as Twitter). It began in response to high rates of violence against women.</p>

<p>The '4B' stands for four Koreans words beginning with "bi" (which translates to no). The words are: "bihon" means no heterosexual marriage, "bichulsan" (no childbirth), "biyeonae" (no dating), and "bisekseu" (no heterosexual sexual relationships).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The members of the movement refuse to date, marry, have sexual relations, or carry babies with men. By doing this, the women are pressing that if the violence or inequality against them does not stop, they will ensure that the birth rate will drop down.</p>

<p>The movement also functions as an online community where women engage in open discussion about navigating and envisioning a future without men. Women also use the platform to vent their frustrations and concerns about living in a conservative society.</p>

<p>"It's a new lifestyle focused on building safe communities, both online and in-person. What we want is not to be labeled simply as some man's wife or girlfriend, but to have the independence to be free from the societal expectations that often limit women's potential to be fully acknowledged as human beings," Haein Shim, a South Korean activist, told The Guardian.</p>

<h3><strong>What US women are saying on social media</strong></h3>

<p>The internet seems to be divided over the '4B' movement in US.</p>

<p>"Ladies, I'm being so fr when I say this, it's time to close off your wombs to males. This election proves now more than ever that they hate us and hate us proudly. do not reward them," a user wrote on X.</p>

<p>Another said, "Reminder that the 4B movement, and the separatist movement in general, isn't just about avoiding men-it's also about supporting and investing in women. Seek out relationships with women, women-owned businesses, women-made media, etc; surround yourself with women and our culture."</p>

<p>However, some people also claimed that the movement would never work in the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States has charged an Iranian man in connection with an alleged plot ordered by Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards Corps to assassinate President-elect Donald Trump, the Justice Department said on Friday.</p>

<p>In a statement, the department said that Farhad Shakeri had informed law enforcement "that he was tasked on October 7, 2024, with providing a plan to kill" Trump, the department said. Shakeri allegedly told law enforcement he had no plans to formulate a plan to kill Trump within the IRGC's timeline.</p>

<p>The department described Shakeri, 51, as an IRGC asset residing in Tehran. It said he immigrated to the US as a child and was deported in or about 2008 following a robbery conviction. Shakeri is at large and believed to be in Iran, the prosecutors said.</p>

<p>Two New York residents whom Shakeri had met in prison, Carlisle Rivera and Jonathan Loadholt, have also been charged for helping Shakeri plot to kill a US citizen of Iranian origin in New York, described as an outspoken critic of Iran's government who had previously been targeted for murder.</p>

<p>Prosecutors did not identify the target, but it matched the description of Masih Alinejad, a journalist and activist who has criticized Iran's head-covering laws for women. Four Iranians were charged in 2021 in connection with a plot to kidnap her, and in 2022 a man was arrested with a rifle outside her home.</p>

<p>Rivera and Loadholt have both been ordered detained pending trial. Their lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rescuers did not expect to find two-year-old Ali Khalifeh alive after an Israeli strike on southern Lebanon killed his entire family and left him trapped under the rubble for 14 hours.</p>

<p>Amputated, bandaged and hooked to a respirator in a hospital bed that was way too big for him, "Ali is the sole survivor of his family," said Hussein Khalifeh, his father's uncle.</p>

<p>The toddler's parents, sister and two grandmothers all perished in the strike on September 29, days after Israel intensified its attacks on Hezbollah militants.</p>

<p>The strike on Sarafand, some 15 kilometres (nine miles) south of the coastal city of Sidon, flattened an apartment complex and killed 15 people, many of them relatives, according to residents.</p>

<p>"Rescue workers had almost lost hope of finding anyone alive under the rubble," 45-year-old Khalifeh told AFP from the hospital in Sidon where his two-year-old relative was being treated.</p>

<p>But then "Ali appeared among debris in the shovel of the bulldozer, after we all thought he had died," he said.</p>

<p>"He emerged from the rubble, barely breathing, after 14 hours."</p>

<p>Israel has been at war with Hezbollah since late September, when it broadened its war focus from fighting Hamas militants in Gaza to securing its northern border with Lebanon.</p>

<p>An escalating Israeli air campaign, after nearly a year of low intensity cross-border fire, has killed more than 2,600 people across Lebanon since September 23, according to health ministry figures.</p>

<h3><strong>'Psychological scars'</strong></h3>

<p>Signs of the violence were apparent even at the hospital in Sidon where Ali was rushed to following the strike on Sarafand.</p>

<p>The toddler, under a medically induced coma after doctors amputated his right hand, has since been transferred to a medical facility in the capital Beirut where he is due to undergo pre-prosthetic surgery.</p>

<p>"Ali was sleeping on the couch at home when the strike hit. He is still asleep today... were are waiting to complete his surgeries before waking him up," said the relative Hussein Khalifeh.</p>

<p>Other family members were also fighting to stay alive after the Sarafand strike.</p>

<p>One of Khalifeh's nieces, 32-year-old Zainab, was trapped under the rubble for two hours before being rescued and transferred to the nearest hospital, said the man.</p>

<p>It was there that she was later informed that her parents, her husband and three children, aged between three and seven, had all been killed.</p>

<p>The strike left her with only one, severely injured eye.</p>

<p>Zainab said she "did not hear the sounds of the missiles that rained down on her family's home," according to Khalifeh.</p>

<p>"She only saw darkness and heard deafening screams," he said.</p>

<p>Ali Alaa El-Din, a doctor treating her, said that "the psychological scars that Zainab suffered are much greater than her physical injury".</p>

<p>He has also tended Zainab's sister Fatima, 30, who was wounded in the same strike.</p>

<p>Both had injuries "throughout their bodies, with fractures in the feet and damage to the lungs," said the doctor.</p>

<p>Medically, he added, "Zainab and Fatima's cases are not among the most difficult cases we have faced during the war, but they are the most severe from a psychological and human perspective."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The final state calls are coming in for the US presidential election, with President-elect Donald Trump at 301 electoral votes, well past the 270 needed for victory, and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris at 226, US networks said.</p>

<p>Nevada was the latest to be called Friday, with six electoral votes going to Trump -- yet another flip of a swing state that voted for Joe Biden in 2020.</p>

<p>The following is a list of the states won by each candidate and the corresponding number of electoral votes, based on the projections of US media including CNN, Fox News, MSNBC/NBC News, ABC and CBS.</p>

<p>The last state where a final call has yet to be made by two outlets is Arizona.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump and JD Vance's campaign promise has become a cause of major concern for immigrants, especially Indian-Americans, as it brings uncertainty about their children becoming naturalised US citizens.</p>

<p>A naturalised citizen is a person who becomes a citizens of a country by virtue of being born in that nation, should they wish to exercise that option. Should such a person keep the citizenship of the country of their ethnicity, they can choose to become the citizen of the country of birth any time they want during their lifetime.</p>

<p>Donald Trump had vowed to curb naturalised citizenship. It was a part of his campaign document and a pledge he and Vance promised would be done on "Day 1".</p>

<p>What is expected is that much of the focus on 'Day 1' for Donald Trump and his deputy JD Vance will be over the issue of immigration.</p>

<p>During his election campaign, at almost each of his rallies Mr Trump had said that "On Day 1, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history." Planning big changes to US's immigration policy, Mr Trump doesn't just intend on targeting illegal immigrants, but also go after the legal process.</p>

<p>As per the document available on Donald Trump's campaign website he will sign an executive order on the first day of his presidency to curb immigration. The order will "Direct federal agencies to require that at least one parent be a US citizen or lawful permanent resident for their future children to become automatic US citizens."</p>

<p>This means that in future, children who are born in the US but neither of their parents is a US citizen or permanent resident (PR), may not be eligible for automatic citizenship via naturalisation.</p>

<p>Though the official figures are not known, it is estimated that the employment-based green card backlog from India had crossed the 1 million mark in the first quarter of 2023. The average wait time for a green card (US Citizenship) is more than 50 years.</p>

<p>It suggests that more than half-a-million young immigrants who moved to the US for study or work will likely die before they get their citizenship. It also means that nearly a quarter-million children, awaiting their citizenship, will cross the legal, permissible age of 21, beyond which, they would become illegal immigrants should they stay beyond that without an alternate visa - like a student visa.</p>

<p>Donald Trump's decision to curb naturalised citizenship will certainly invite litigation to his executive order as legal experts believe it is unconstitutional as it violates the 14th Amendment.</p>

<p>Section 1 of the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution states that "All persons born or naturalised in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."</p>

<p>However, the draft of the executive order claims that it has interpreted the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution correctly.</p>

<p>According to Pew Research's analysis of the 2022 US census, there are an estimated 4.8 million Indian-Americans who have made the US their home. Of these, 1.6 million Indian-Americans were born and raised in America, making them naturalised citizens.</p>

<p>Should Donald Trump sign the executive order, the courts will have to decide if the move indeed would be unconstitutional.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[A powerful X-class solar flare erupted, causing shortwave radio blackouts over the Atlantic, South America, and Africa.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Parts of the Atlantic Ocean, South America, and Africa had a shortwave radio blackout yesterday at 8:40 am ET (7:10 pm) on November 6 due to a strong solar flare, according to NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory. High-frequency radio signals were interfered with by this solar flare, demonstrating the effect that such occurrences can have on international communications.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/sdo">NASA's SDO, </a>which watches the Sun constantly, captured an image of the event. Such solar flares have the potential to disrupt global navigation systems, electrical power grids, and radio transmissions. Due to increased radiation exposure, they also pose risks to spacecraft, high-altitude aircraft, and astronauts.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/solarcycle25/2024/11/06/strong-solar-flare-erupts-from-sun-26/"><em>NASA,</em></a> Solar flares are powerful bursts of energy. Flares and solar eruptions can impact radio communications, electric power grids, navigation signals, and pose risks to spacecraft and astronauts. This flare is classified as an X2.3 class flare. X-class denotes the most intense flares, while the number provides more information about its strength.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;day=05&amp;month=11&amp;year=2024"><em>Spaceweather.com, </em></a>the wait is on for scientists to receive data from the coronagraph on the joint NASA/European Space Agency Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft to determine if a coronal mass ejection (CME) will impact Earth. CMEs are made up of magnetic fields and plasma plumes, and if they reach our planet, they can lead to a geomagnetic storm that could possibly result in auroras, also called the aurora borealis or the northern lights.</p>

<p>According to<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.space.com/the-universe/sun/sun-erupts-with-powerful-x2-3-solar-flare-triggers-radio-blackouts-video"><em> Space.com,</em></a> solar flares are ranked on a 4-level classification scale, with each class ten times stronger than the one below it. X-class flares come in as the most powerful, with the class down being M-class. The number that accompanies the letter represents the strength of the individual flare, which in this case was a 2.3.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>World leaders are set to congregate in Baku, Azerbaijan, as it hosts the UN's 29th climate summit, COP29 (Conference of the Parties), from November 11 to 22. The key agenda before the Baku climate summit is to increase the scale of climate finance for developing countries. It is also being referred to as the 'climate finance COP', as its main goal is to decide how much funding should be allocated each year to help developing countries cope with climate-related costs.</p>

<p>This summit comes at a critical moment, as the world continues its multilateral efforts to address climate change. Since its first meeting in Berlin, Germany, in 1995, the goal of COP has been to curb global warming to below 1.5°C (2.7°F) above pre-industrial levels to avoid catastrophic damage to the planet. Sadly, the world continues to ignore this limit. There is an expectation that countries will explore more rigorous methods for emission reduction.</p>

<p>This dialogue is expected to be particularly challenging due to the leadership transition in the US. President-elect Donald Trump has a poor track record on climate action, having pushed for fossil fuel expansion and abandoned the Paris Agreement during his first term. He has promised to continue with the same policies during his election campaign. Let's examine the key themes on which COP29 is scheduled to deliberate at the Baku summit.</p>

<h2><strong>Meeting Financial Targets</strong></h2>

<p>The NCQG (New Collective Quantified Goal) is the main deliverable this year. It refers to the new annual climate financing target, which is intended to replace the current $100 billion pledge made in 2009, set to expire at the end of this year. This funding was provided by wealthy countries to support climate initiatives in poorer nations.</p>

<p>The US and other developed countries want to broaden the contributor base, but developing nations insist this is outside the NCQG's scope. Other issues include determining which countries should receive financial aid—should it be all developing nations, or only the most vulnerable—and what form that aid should take. Developing countries are keen to avoid debt financing, as this exposes them to further climate risks.</p>

<p>At Egypt's COP27, wealthy nations agreed to help poorer countries by bearing the costs of climate-driven disasters like extreme floods, storms, or droughts. About $660 million has been raised for the newly created Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage, based in the Philippines. Climate-vulnerable countries are expecting wealthier nations to contribute more to this fund. “The discussions on the NCQG, still debating who should receive funds, how much, and in what form—with hardly any progress in the lead-up to COP29—will make reaching an agreement a real uphill task. Hopefully, no new funds will be set up at this COP, and discussions will instead focus on mobilising the agreed funds,” says Santhosh Jayaram, Adjunct Professor of Practice at the Amrita School for Sustainable Futures, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.</p>

<p>The level of climate finance will directly impact the ambition reflected in the NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions) that countries are expected to submit early next year, particularly for developing nations. Developing countries are reluctant to commit to more ambitious targets without first securing clear financial support through the NCQG. “At COP28 in Dubai, it was evident that the world was off track from the targets set in Paris. COP29 is intended to secure the finance needed so that at COP30, negotiations can move forward with a new set of NDCs aligned with the agreements,” says Jayaram.</p>

<h2><strong>Reducing Emissions and Increasing Green Energy</strong></h2>

<p>As the host country, Azerbaijan has promised a range of commitments for investing in renewable energy, including a Global Energy Storage and Grids Pledge aimed at augmenting energy infrastructure and storage capabilities worldwide. The country has also made an ambitious Hydrogen Declaration and a Declaration on Reducing Methane Emissions from Organic Waste. Another initiative, the Green Digital Action Declaration, aims to reduce emissions in the information and communications sectors.</p>

<p>However, there is no direct reference in the agenda to a shift away from fossil fuels, which was a key issue in last year's COP28 in Dubai. The dilution of the agenda on fossil fuels is a cause for concern, particularly given Azerbaijan's vast oil resources. Other countries, including the US, Namibia, and Guyana, have also approved new areas for oil and gas production.</p>

<p>This is the second time that Azerbaijan, a major oil-producing nation where the world's first oil fields were developed, is hosting the summit and discussing a future without fossil fuels. Last year, Dubai's COP28 presidency saw another major petrostate host one of the largest climate conferences in the world. COP29 is also expected to formulate rules for international carbon trading, an issue that has been stalled for years. This would allow countries to trade carbon credits to meet their national climate targets. The business community will be looking for the establishment of rules that guarantee transparency and environmental integrity in projects registered under the PACM (Paris Agreement Crediting Mechanism).</p>

<h2><strong>Fallout of a Trump Victory</strong></h2>

<p>Trump has been openly critical of Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which supported the Biden administration's energy policies through tax incentives and investments in renewable energy. A second Trump presidency would likely signal a shift in US energy policy, favouring fossil fuels over renewables.<br />
The re-election of Trump, who has previously dismissed climate change as a ‘hoax', is unlikely to be good news for COP. During his campaign, Trump announced that he might cancel all mitigation measures the US had taken under President Joe Biden after rejoining the Paris Agreement in 2021. A US exit from the 2015 accord would be a major blow to global efforts to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.</p>

<p>Trump has also been vocal about climate finance, calling it a ‘one-sided deal' in which developed nations bear the cost while countries like China contribute little. The fear of the US— the world's second-largest emitter— withdrawing from global climate efforts is a real concern. As the world continues to suffer from the devastating impacts of climate change, the US must reconsider its stance and take a leadership role on climate and environmental issues.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indonesia's Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki erupted several times on Friday, belching volcanic ash that rose up to 10 km (32,800 ft) into the sky, officials said, following a big eruption on Sunday night that killed nine people.</p>

<p>The eruption on the island of Flores in the province of East Nusa Tenggara has damaged more than 2,000 houses and caused thousands to evacuate.</p>

<p>Abdul Muhari, spokesperson for the country's disaster mitigation agency, said the eruptions were "pretty significant" due to ash rains and sand-falls that reached far into the surrounding areas.</p>

<p>Hadi Wijaya, chief of Indonesia's volcanology agency, said one eruption on Friday produced a towering ash column that reached eight km to 10 km high, adding volcanic matter and hot gas travelled across all directions from the volcano.</p>

<p>Friday's eruption produced the highest column since the first eruption on Sunday, Abdul said.</p>

<p>About 6,000 of the more than 16,000 people living in areas nearest the volcano had been evacuated to other villages, said Heronimus Lamawuran, a Flores government official.</p>

<p>Abdul said supplies of food and masks for evacuees in several evacuation spots are enough and the situation is under control.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's dream of transporting humans to Mars will become a bigger national priority under the administration of US President-elect Donald Trump, sources said, signaling big changes for NASA's moon program and a boost for Musk's SpaceX.</p>

<p>NASA's Artemis program, which aims to use SpaceX's Starship rocket to put humans on the moon as a proving ground for later Mars missions, is expected to focus more on the Red Planet under Trump and target uncrewed missions there this decade, according to four people familiar with Trump's burgeoning space policy agenda.</p>

<p>Targeting Mars with spacecraft built for astronauts is not only more ambitious than focusing on the moon, but is also fraught with risk and potentially more expensive.</p>

<p>Musk, who danced onstage at a Trump rally wearing an "Occupy Mars" T-shirt in October, spent $119 million on Trump's White House bid and has successfully elevated space policy at an unusual time in a presidential transition.</p>

<p>In September, weeks after Musk endorsed Trump, the latter told reporters that the moon was a "launching pad" for his ultimate goal to reach Mars.</p>

<p>"At a minimum, we're going to get a more realistic Mars plan, you'll see Mars being set as an objective," said Doug Loverro, a space industry consultant who once led NASA's human exploration unit under Trump, who served as US president from 2017 to 2021.</p>

<p>SpaceX, Musk and the Trump campaign did not immediately return requests for comment. A NASA spokeswoman said it "wouldn't be appropriate to speculate on any changes with the new administration."</p>

<p>Plans could still change, the sources added, as the Trump transition team takes shape in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Trump launched the Artemis program in 2019 during his first term and it was one of the few initiatives maintained under the administration of President Joe Biden. Trump space advisers want to revamp a program they will argue has languished in their absence, the sources said.</p>

<p>Musk, who also owns electric-vehicle maker Tesla and brain-chip startup Neuralink, has made slashing government regulation and trimming down bureaucracy another core basis of his Trump support.</p>

<p>For space, the sources said, Musk's deregulation desires are likely to trigger changes at the Federal Aviation Administration's commercial space office, whose oversight of private rocket launches has frustrated Musk for slowing down SpaceX's Starship development.</p>

<p>The FAA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>NASA under Trump, the sources said, is likely to favor fixed-price space contracts that shift greater responsibility onto private companies and scale back over-budget programs that have strained the Artemis budget.</p>

<p>That could spell trouble for the only rocket NASA owns, the Space Launch System rocket (SLS), whose roughly $24 billion development since 2011 has been led by Boeing and Northrop Grumman. Cancelling the program, some say, would be difficult since it would cost thousands of jobs and leave the US even more dependent on SpaceX.</p>

<p>Boeing and Northrop did not immediately return a request for comment.</p>

<p>Musk, whose predictions have sometimes proven overly ambitious, said in September that SpaceX will land Starship on Mars in 2026 and a crewed mission will follow in four years' time. Trump has said at campaign rallies that he has discussed these ideas with Musk.</p>

<p>Many industry experts see this timeline as improbable.</p>

<p>"Is it possible for Elon to put a Starship on the surface of Mars in a one-way mission by the end of Trump's term? Absolutely, he certainly could do that," said Scott Pace, the top space policy official during Trump's first term.</p>

<p>"Is that a manned mission on Mars? No," Pace added. "You have to walk before you run."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian intelligence services were likely behind a series of parcels that exploded in courier depots across Europe, Polish prosecutors said on Friday, pointing the finger at Moscow in a case officials say could have caused an air disaster.</p>

<p>Western officials have previously said that Russia has tried to destabilise allies of Ukraine with acts of sabotage. The explosions in courier depots in Britain, Germany and Poland in July had the potential to mark a serious escalation by causing an explosion on an aircraft.</p>

<p>Security officials have said that the parcels were part of a plot that ultimately aimed to trigger explosions on cargo flights to the United States and Canada.</p>

<p>"The evidence collected in the case indicates a high probability that the discussed acts of sabotage... were inspired by Russian special services," Polish Prosecutor's Office spokesperson Przemyslaw Nowak said in an emailed statement.</p>

<p>The Russian embassy in Warsaw did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Russia has previously denied involvement.</p>

<p>Nowak said Polish authorities are searching for two Russians and have detained four Ukrainian citizens as part of the investigation.</p>

<p>Polish prosecutors said in October they had detained four people and were searching for two others in relation to the packages, but did not reveal the nationalities of those accused of involvement.</p>

<p>In October prosecutors said they were investigating the role of "foreign intelligence", without explicitly naming Russia.</p>

<p>"Intensive activities are being carried out to identify the remaining individuals involved in the above international group," Nowak said in the statement sent on Friday.</p>

<p>"These actions are undertaken in cooperation with law enforcement agencies of other European Union countries."</p>

<p>He said that the exploding parcels had been sent from the Lithuanian capital Vilnius.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Ministry on Friday termed as fake a 'secretly issued memo' that has surfaced on social media and that falsely attempts to link Indian diplomats abroad with violent crimes.</p>

<p>No such memo has been issued by the Government of India, the External Affairs Ministry said.</p>

<p>"The said GoI communication is fake," the External Publicity and Public Diplomacy Division (XP Division), of the Ministry of External Affairs said.</p>

<p>The April 2023 dated fake memo purportedly from former Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra asks Indian diplomats to "cultivate" Indian diaspora groups in Canada "as a vital force in the street confrontations with Sikh extremists".</p>

<p>It goes on to mention names of various groupings of the diaspora including the Indo-Canada Association (ICA), Indo-Canada Chamber of Commerce (ICCC), TiE Silicon Valley (TiE SV), and USIBC amongst others.</p>

<p>This comes amid the ongoing India-Canada standoff over India's allegations that Canada acts as a safe haven for Khalistani separatists. Last week devotees and other people were attacked at the premises of a Hindu temple in Brampton, Ontario. India has condemned the violence and urged Canada to provide security to Indian diplomats.</p>

<p>Last month, India "strongly" rejected a diplomatic communication from Canada suggesting that the Indian High Commissioner and other diplomats were "persons of interest" in Nijjar's killing and termed it as "preposterous imputations" and part of the political agenda of the Justin Trudeau government.</p>

<p>Following this, then High Commissioner Verma and five other diplomats were recalled by New Delhi.</p>

<p>Ties between India and Canada soured after Mr Trudeau alleged in the Canadian Parliament last year that he has "credible allegations" of India's hand in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.</p>

<p>India denied all the allegations, calling them "absurd" and "motivated" and has accused Canada of giving space to extremist and anti-India elements in their country.</p>

<p>Nijjar, who was designated a terrorist by India's National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed outside a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prince William has described the past year in which his wife Catherine and his father, Britain's head of state King Charles III, each battled cancer as "brutal" and probably the "hardest" of his life.</p>

<p>The heir to the British throne was speaking to reporters on Thursday at the end of a four-day visit to South Africa for his Earthshot prize initiative.</p>

<p>Buckingham Palace in February announced that Charles, 75, had been diagnosed with an undisclosed cancer and would withdraw from public life to undergo treatment.</p>

<p>The following month his daughter-in-law Catherine, Princess of Wales, 42, revealed that she too had been diagnosed with cancer and was undergoing chemotherapy.</p>

<p>"Honestly, it's been dreadful. It's probably been the hardest year in my life," William said.</p>

<p>"So, trying to get through everything else and keep everything on track has been really difficult."</p>

<p>Both Charles and Catherine have since made limited returns to public duties, although Charles is still undergoing treatment.</p>

<p>Catherine said in September that she had completed her chemotherapy and was looking forward to undertaking more engagements "when I can".</p>

<p>"I'm so proud of my wife, I'm proud of my father, for handling the things that they have done," William added.</p>

<p>"But from a personal family point of view, it's been, yeah, it's been brutal," he said.</p>

<p>This year's awards ceremony for William's Earthshot prize was held in Cape Town on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The initiative honours projects seeking novel solutions to the challenges facing the world's nature and climate.</p>

<p>William is also committed to a five-year programme, Homewards, launched by his philanthropic foundation to tackle homelessness in the UK.</p>

<p>When told he appeared relaxed, William said he "couldn't be less relaxed this year".</p>

<p>"It's more a case of just crack on and you've got to keep going," he said.</p>

<p>"I enjoy my work and I enjoy pacing myself, and keeping sure that I have got time for my family too," he added.</p>

<p>In addition to health problems, the royal family has this year faced continuing tensions surrounding William's estranged brother Harry.</p>

<p>Harry's ties with his family have been increasingly fraught since he and wife Meghan quit royal life and moved to California in 2020.</p>

<p>William and Harry used to be close -- a bond that was forged with the death of their mother Princess Diana in 1997. But according to British media reports, they have not spoken to each other in two years.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's Punjab banned entry to many public spaces from Friday, including parks and zoos, as it sought to protect people from severe air pollution in parts of the eastern province.</p>

<p>The provincial capital Lahore has been engulfed in a thick, smoky haze this week and was consistently rated the world's most polluted city by Swiss group IQAir in its live rankings, prompting the closure of schools and work-from-home mandates.</p>

<p>The Punjab government's Friday order placed a "complete ban on public entry in all parks ... zoos, playgrounds, historical places, monuments, museums and joy/playlands" until November 17 in areas including Lahore.</p>

<p>Many parts of South Asia suffer severe pollution as temperatures drop each winter and cold, heavy air traps dust, emissions, and smoke from stubble burning - the illegal practice of burning crop waste to quickly clear fields.</p>

<p>Punjab last week blamed toxic air wafting in from neighbouring India - where air quality has also reached hazardous levels - for the particularly high pollution this year.</p>

<p>IQAir rated Delhi the world's second most polluted city on Friday, with government data indicating that farm fires in the neighbouring farming states of Punjab and Haryana were among the major contributors.</p>

<p>To discourage the practice which has been lower this year, India's federal government doubled fines imposed on violators on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Farmers with less than two acres of land will now have to pay 5,000 rupees ($60) for violations. Those owning between two and five acres will pay 10,000 rupees and farmers with more than five acres will pay 30,000 rupees, the environment ministry said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Republican candidate Donald Trump has clocked a significant victory in the US elections, setting up his mandate to drive into power by January. Hours after his victory was clear, the Taliban-led interim government in Kabul released a carefully worded statement online that reflected its attempts to formalise its diplomatic presence on the regional and global stage, and, by extension, market its political reality as the sole source of power and governance in Kabul. The biggest goal for the Taliban right now is to achieve international legitimacy. To some extent, it has managed to do so. While the drama of the US elections was still unfolding, Indian officials were already in Kabul to continue what is a contested, difficult, yet critical engagement with the Taliban. This visit included a first meeting with the acting defence minister of the Islamic Emirate, Mullah Yaqoob, who is also Taliban founder Mullah Omar's eldest son. India has a strong history of people-to-people ties with Afghanistan and maintenance of the same remains a top priority despite initial hiccups over visa allocations and allowing access to Afghans after 2021.</p>

<h2><strong>A Complex Statement</strong></h2>

<p>The Taliban's statement stopped short of congratulating Trump on his victory (ideologically, as per their interpretation of Sharia, democracy is not recognised by the group), but it did express hope that a pragmatic approach would be taken towards Afghanistan. It further reminded the world about the success of the Doha agreement between the Taliban and the Trump administration which had ended a two-decade-long war. Interestingly, in the statement's finale, the Taliban expressed hope that the Trump administration would work to end the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. Like many in the region, the Taliban has also taken a strong stance against Israel, putting its weight behind the Palestinian cause but without expressing overt support for either Hamas or Hezbollah, both of which have been designated as terror groups in multiple countries since the mid-1990s.</p>

<p>For the Taliban, its political survival today is of paramount importance, and its fragility as a political system palpable. The Taliban hierarchy had a relationship with the Trump administration—especially with former US special envoy for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad. Trump has also previously criticised the way the Biden administration conducted the exit from the country. The President-elect in September said that the US should have retained control of the Bagram Airfield, the biggest military installation the US operated 60 km outside Kabul. He based this argument not on counter-terrorism or on the suggestion to deal with the Taliban directly, but on Afghanistan's proximity to China and the swathes of natural resources there that remain untapped. True, during his campaign, Trump did promise to “get back” Bagram. But it is still highly unlikely that the US under him will actually return to the country in any formalised capacity. It also remains to be seen how Republicans under Trump will view anti-Taliban groups, and whether support for them will find renewed interest within the party.</p>

<h2><strong>Taliban's Growing Engagement</strong></h2>

<p>Naturally, with the US out of Afghanistan now and Trump back in power at the White House, the Taliban will have to dig in deep to remain politically engaged with the US. The group has in fact made notable strides in engaging regional and international communities. It has re-marketed itself as a palatably extremist group that can take on more nefarious, violent and globally expanding groups, such as the Islamic State Khorasan (ISKP). In the Middle East, it has operationalised embassies in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman, while maintaining its political anchoring in Qatar. Taliban's key ideologue, Sirajuddin Haqqani, even got a travel exemption from the United Nations Security Council and flew to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj pilgrimage. He also visited the UAE, which the Taliban has long had relations with.</p>

<p>The larger anxiety for the Taliban regarding a Trump presidency will come from his erratic decision-making. This is particularly important in the sense that multiple Islamist groups have taken part in the Taliban's wars over the decades, including Al Qaeda. There's a view that Al Qaeda did not announce a chief after the assassination of Ayman al-Zawahiri in Kabul due to the Taliban's pressure on the group.</p>

<p>Trump is expected to take a hard stand on Iran too in the coming years. This is based not only on predictions, but facts. His administration unilaterally withdrew the US from the nuclear agreement of 2015. In the Gulf as well, despite normalisation between Saudi Arabia and Iran, a harder position by Washington would be welcomed. “Bad news for Tehran and its proxies. Netanyahu is the big winner. It is time to go after Iran's nuclear facilities,” said noted UAE public intellectual Abdulkhaleq Abdulla on social media shortly after Trump's victory.</p>

<h2><strong>The Iran Question</strong></h2>

<p>One of the core gains that Iran has seen over the past few years has been the exit of the US in Afghanistan. Even though Tehran does not particularly agree with or enjoy the Taliban as a neighbour, it sees functional relations with them as more palatable than American military presence on both sides of its eastern and western borders. With its ‘forward defence' strategy involving proxies in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen, and a relatively calm border with Afghanistan, Tehran hopes to put enough distance between itself and US forces in the region. Taliban, whether it likes it or not, is part of this design. In February, much to the Taliban's concern, Iran's special envoy to Afghanistan, Hassan Kazemi Qom, had alluded to Afghanistan being part of Iran's ‘Axis of Resistance'. Under the now-slain Quds Force chief, Qassem Soleimani, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) even recruited Shias from Afghanistan for the Fatemiyoun Brigade fighting across Syria and Iraq.</p>

<p>The Taliban's options are limited. If there is a broader conflict between Israel and Iran, it will have little choice but to cosy up to, if not fully join, Tehran's positions. The group's ideological underpinnings will make it hard for the movement to have a rational or diplomatic position. Groups residing in Afghanistan may mobilise on their own merit or make the state a staging ground, as has happened before. This would be a direct challenge to the Taliban's efforts to project political neutrality.</p>

<h2><strong>A Period Of Uncertainty</strong></h2>

<p>Afghanistan remains a state in flux even if it has been able to engage with several countries, including India. It continues to deal with internal ideological battles between power centres in Kabul and Kandahar, border clashes with its former patron Pakistan, and economic vows. But the fact that it has managed to strike a deal with the US and regain control and power is also a success story, one that has been celebrated widely from Al Qaeda to Hamas.</p>

<p>While Trump's gaze is not expected to land in this part of geography anytime soon—including on Bagram—his presidency will be a test for the Taliban's political and diplomatic acumen, just as it will be for the rest of the world.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The bells of Notre Dame in Paris rang out together on Friday for the first time since a 2019 fire that devastated the historic cathedral, AFP reporters said.</p>

<p>The sound of the eight bells in Notre Dame's northern belfry came a month before the cathedral is to reopen following five years of painstaking restoration work in the wake of the blaze.</p>

<p>"This is a beautiful, important and symbolic step," said Philippe Jost, who runs the public body tasked with restoring the cathedral under challenging circumstances.</p>

<p>On the evening of April 19, 2019 Parisians and the world watched in horror as flames ravaged the world heritage landmark and then toppled its spire.</p>

<p>President Emmanuel Macron quickly set the ambitious goal to rebuild Notre Dame within five years and make it "even more beautiful" than before.</p>

<p>Some 250 companies and hundreds of experts were mobilised for a restoration costing hundreds of millions of euros.</p>

<p>Friday shortly before 10:30 am (0930 GMT), the bells sounded one by one until all eight chimed in harmony.</p>

<p>"It's not perfect yet, but we will make it perfect," said Alexandre Gougeon who is in charge of the re-installation of the bells. "This first test was a success."</p>

<p>The 2019 fire destroyed part of the northern belfry, requiring it to be restored and the bells to be removed, cleaned of dust and lead, and then returned to their space.</p>

<p>The heaviest bell, called "Gabriel", weighs over four tonnes, and the lightest, "Jean-Marie", 800 kilogrammes.</p>

<p>A weekend of ceremonies is to mark Notre-Dame's reopening on December 7 and 8.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered the dispatch of two planes to Amsterdam to evacuate Israeli soccer fans who were attacked by an alleged Pro-Palestinian mob on Thursday night.</p>

<p>The fans had travelled to the Netherlands to watch the Europa League match between Maccabi Tel Aviv vs Ajax Amsterdam.</p>

<p>The assault began after Maccabi Tel Aviv's loss to Ajax, with attackers targeting Israelis at various locations across the city, chanting "Free Palestine" and throwing insults in Arabic.</p>

<p>At least 10 Israelis were injured in the violence, with some reports suggesting that two individuals are still unaccounted for. Additionally, attackers stole passports from some of the targeted individuals.</p>

<p>Israel Foreign Ministry has advised its citizens in the Netherlands to remain indoors and avoid going out, while Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar has asked Dutch authorities to help Israelis safely reach the airport.</p>

<p>Israeli Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir condemned the attacks, describing them as an act of anti-Semitism with Israelis being beaten, kicked, run-over, and even being thrown into the river.</p>

<p>Former Israeli special envoy Noa Tishby claimed one fan was forced to say "Free Palestine" before being released.</p>

<p>In response to the violence, Israel PM Netanyahu called for Dutch authorities to act swiftly to ensure the safety of Israelis, calling the incident "serious."</p>

<p>Former Israel PM Naftali Bennett also called for immediate action, urging authorities to act immediately to prevent further harm.</p>

<p>The Israeli Embassy in the United States stated that Maccabi Tel Aviv fans were attacked as they left the stadium.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the mighty Notre Dame cathedral prepares to reopen its doors in a month's time after a devastating fire in 2019, a look back at five key dates in the Paris landmark's colourful history:</p>

<p><strong>1160: first stones laid</strong></p>

<p>Building the world-famous cathedral in the heart of the French capital began in 1160 and was not completed until almost a century later.</p>

<p>The project was spearheaded by the ambitious Bishop of Paris Maurice de Sully and had several striking features including vaults that reached up to 32 metres (105 feet), according to a study published in the journal PLOS ONE in 2023.</p>

<p>But some elements of the gothic building's construction remain unknown, centuries later.</p>

<p>It is not clear, for example, how the builders "dared -- and succeeded -- in putting up such thin walls to such a height," Maxime L'Heritier, an archaeologist at University Paris 8 told AFP in an interview in 2023.</p>

<p><strong>1455: Joan of Arc</strong></p>

<p>Burnt on a stake in a public square after being accused of heresy, the case of Joan of Arc has become legend in France.</p>

<p>In 1455, 24 years after her dramatic death at the age of around 19, a fresh trial opened to reconsider her case, taking place at Notre Dame.</p>

<p>It concluded the verdict of Joan as a heretic had been arbitrary, paving the way for a second trial in Rouen, the original site of her public execution.</p>

<p>In 1456 her sentence was ruled null and void, elevating her to the status of French heroine -- and centuries later, a saint.</p>

<p><strong>1790s: one-time wine cellar</strong></p>

<p>During the French Revolution, the cathedral was plundered and seized as public property.</p>

<p>Anti-clerical radicals attacked the facade, removing biblical statues and decapitating them in the cathedral's square, in acts reminiscent of the guillotining of King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette.</p>

<p>Over a few years in the 1790s, Notre Dame was used for a variety of purposes, including storing barrels of wine for the Revolutionary Army.</p>

<p><strong>1831: Victor Hugo novel</strong></p>

<p>Published in 1831, Victor Hugo's novel "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" featured a host of colourful characters from the gypsy Esmeralda to Quasimodo, but at the centre was the cathedral.</p>

<p>The book was a huge hit and triggered an outpouring of emotion among Parisians over the state of disrepair into which the cathedral had fallen.</p>

<p>This popular enthusiasm contributed to an ambitious restoration project launched in 1844 and led by the architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc.</p>

<p>Lasting till 1865, it included the construction of a new spire, which had been dismantled during the Revolution.</p>

<p><strong>2019: Inferno on the Seine</strong></p>

<p>The spire was among the features of the cathedral that collapsed in the blaze that shocked the world on April 15, 2019.</p>

<p>Onlookers on the banks of the Seine watched in horror as the fire ravaged not only the spire, which crashed down, but also caused the central frame to collapse, engulfed the clock and part of the vault.</p>

<p>The cause of the blaze is not known, with an electrical fault or a cigarette among the theories.</p>

<p>It took 400 firefighters several hours to control the flames; stained glass windows, towers, bells and most artworks and relics survived.</p>

<p>The renovated Notre-Dame is set to reopen on December 8, 2024.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

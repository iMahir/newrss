       <description><![CDATA[The lawmakers of South Korea's opposition coalition on Wednesday moved a motion in the Asian country's Parliament to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol after his shocking imposition of martial law that brought thousands of protesters to the streets.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">The opposition parties in South Korea, whose lawmakers tussled with security forces to vote down the controversial martial law, filed a motion on Wednesday to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol. "We've submitted an impeachment motion prepared urgently," said Kim Yong-min of the opposition Democratic Party (DP).</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Lawmakers are yet to decide when the impeachment motion will be put to a vote, but it could come as soon as Friday. South Korea's opposition controls the National Assembly. The opposition has threatened to impeach President Yoon if he does not resign voluntarily, following his ill-fated move to impose martial law. In case Mr Yoon quits or is removed from office then, the South Korean constitution mandates that Prime Minister Han Duck-soo steps in to perform presidential duties.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Earlier the DP in a statement said it would file charges of "insurrection," against Yoon, his defence and interior ministers and "key military and police figures involved, such as the martial law commander and the police chief." The National Assembly can impeach the president if more than two-thirds of lawmakers vote for it. A trial is then held by the constitutional court, which can confirm it with a vote by six of the nine justices.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The opposition in South Korea holds a large majority in the 300-member parliament and needs only a handful of defections from the president's party to secure the two-thirds majority needed to pass the motion. Earlier, even the leader of Yoon's own ruling party, which controls 108 seats in the 300-member legislature, described the attempt to bring the martial law as "tragic" while calling for those involved to be held accountable.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">South Korean stocks sank on Wednesday while the currency won dipping multi-year lows only to rebound later after the shocking announcement on Tuesday night. The hours of martial rule in the country sent shivers through the trading floor in Seoul, with investors keeping a close eye on developments in the country.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The Kospi index ended down more than one per cent, having shed as much as 2.3 per cent at the open, as traders fretted over the impact of Yoon declaring the Asian country's first martial law in more than four decades. Analysts pointed out that the upheaval comes as authorities steeled for the second US presidency of Donald Trump who has vowed to reignite his hardball trade policy.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The South Korean finance ministry and central bank looked to provide stability and reassure markets by promising to pour in money if needed to prop up volatile financial markets. "As announced together with the government, it has been decided to temporarily supply sufficient liquidity until the financial and foreign exchange markets stabilise," the Bank of Korea said. It added that "the range of securities eligible for (repo) transactions and the target institutions will be expanded". Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, who also holds the economy portfolio, said financial authorities will keep international partners informed about developments.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">South Koreans continued with their lives on Wednesday, with people going to offices, businesses and schools as usual. There were scarcely any visible signs in the capital Seoul that six hours of surprise martial law and high political drama overnight had spilled into everyday life. The city of 9 million started the day normally with the usual morning rush hour in trains and on the streets. "At first, I was scared and very confused. I kept thinking, 'What is going on? Is this something that could actually happen in this era?' I couldn't sleep until the martial law was lifted because I was so frightened," Seoul resident Gang He-Soo, 50, told Reuters.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">President Yoon declared martial law in a live TV address at around 10:30 pm (13:30 GMT) on Tuesday, only to reverse the decree after lawmakers defied police and special forces condoning the National Assembly to vote, forcing him to lift the order. The president's office said the declaration of martial law was done at night to "minimize damage to the national economy and people's lives". South Korean soldiers, equipped with rifles, body armour and night-vision equipment, were seen entering the parliament building in Seoul through smashed windows, while helicopters hovered in the night sky above the building.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Soon after the news broke of the martial law broke, thousands of protesters stepped out on the streets, asking for the decree's reversal and removal of the President. Flag-waving protesters kept vigil outside parliament braving freezing temperatures through the night in defiance of Mr Yoon's martial law order. Several senior aides working for Mr Yoon also offered Wednesday to resign en masse over the martial law declaration.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aliya Fakhri, who was arrested for allegedly killing her ex-boyfriend and his friend, was a "good person", her friends said as they expressed disbelief over the brutal crime. According to them, the alleged murder committed by Aliya was a crime of "jealousy".</p>

<p>Sade Jean-Baptiste and Jewels Boatwright (name changed) told NDTV that Aliya, who they call 'Athena' (as per her stage name) used to work as a stripper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"She was a good person...passionate. But she lost it that night. This feels like a crime of jealousy," they said, adding that they still "love her".</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-aliya-fakhri-actor-nargis-fakhris-sister-arrested-for-killing-ex-boyfriend-7160117" target="_blank">Aliya Fakhri</a> was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly setting a two-storey garage on fire in Queens, New York, when her former boyfriend Edward Jacobs (35), and his friend, Anastasia Ettienne (33), were asleep.</p>

<p>According to the Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz, Aliya Fakhri arrived at the garage early morning on November 2 and yelled "you are all going to die today" at Jacobs, who lived upstairs. A witness came out hearing her voice and found that the building had been set on fire. Ettienne, who was alerted of the fire, went back upstairs to save Jacobs. But neither of them made it out of the burning building as they died from smoke inhalation and thermal injuries, officials said.</p>

<p>According to Aliya's friends, her former boyfriend, Jacobs, used to live in the garage and worked as a plumber.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jacobs and Aliya were a part of the same friends' group, they told NDTV, adding that the two were seeing each other "on and off" but it was a "turbulent" relationship.</p>

<p>The victims, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/nargis-fakhris-sister-aliya-fakhri-arrested-for-double-murder-in-queens-new-york-7159276" target="_blank">Jacobs </a>and Ettienne lived in the same rented house in Queens, along with Jewels and several other people. At the time of the incident, all the other people had managed to escape.</p>

<p>Presently, the New York police are not allowing Jewels to live in the house as it is a crime scene, he said.</p>

<p>Aliya's friends told NDTV that she spoke "affectionately" about her elder sister and rockstar-fame actor <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/nargis-fakhri-not-in-touch-with-murder-accused-sister-for-20-years-sources-7164273" target="_blank">Nargis Fakhri</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, sources have claimed that Nargis has not been in touch with Aliya for more than 20 years.</p>

<p>NDTV also reached out to Nargis and Aliya's mother Marie Fakhri in Queens but found her apartment locked. According to her neighbour, he saw Marie two days ago. He also called her but she declined to speak.</p>

<p>"I saw her last two days ago...She is a very friendly, beautiful woman," the neighbour said.</p>

<p>Marie has reportedly denied charges against her daughter saying, "I don't think she would be killing someone. She was a person who was caring for everybody. She tried to help everybody."</p>

<p>Aliya, who has been charged with four counts of murder in the first degree, four counts of murder in the second degree, and accused of arson by a grand jury, is scheduled to appear before a court on December 9. If convicted of a top charge, she can face a maximum of life in prison, the Queens District Attorney said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Koreans went to offices, businesses and schools as usual on Wednesday with scarcely any visible signs in the capital Seoul that six hours of surprise martial law and high political drama overnight had spilled into everyday life.</p>

<p>The city of 9 million started the day normally with the usual morning rush hour in trains and on the streets after President Yoon Suk Yeol lifted his abortive attempt at banning political activities and censoring news media just before dawn.</p>

<p>But many were in shock at such a sudden turn of events, which pushed stocks down and South Korea's currency to multi-year lows during a time of already faltering economic growth.</p>

<p>There have been more than a dozen instances of martial law being declared in South Korea since it became a republic in 1948, but the last time was more than four decades ago when Gen. Chun Doo-hwan staged a coup and ruled from 1980 to 1988.</p>

<p>Seoul resident Gang He-Soo, 50, said she woke from sleep by chance and saw the news.</p>

<p>"At first, I was scared and very confused. I kept thinking, 'What is going on? Is this something that could actually happen in this era?' I couldn't sleep until the martial law was lifted because I was so frightened," Gang said, walking in Seoul's main commercial and tourist district Gwanghwamun.</p>

<p>Yoon declared martial law in a live TV address at around 10:30 pm (1330 GMT) on Tuesday, only to reverse course after parliament defied police and special forces cordons around the National Assembly to vote, forcing him to lift the declaration.</p>

<p>The president's office said the declaration of martial law was done at night to "minimize damage to the national economy and people's lives".</p>

<p>South Korean soldiers, equipped with rifles, body armour and night-vision equipment, were seen entering the parliament building in Seoul through smashed windows.</p>

<p>Helicopters hovered in the night sky above the building.</p>

<p>"It was an experience that I've only seen in movies, and I realised how much more serious it is than I had imagined," said 39-year-old Seoul resident Kim Byeong-In, who said he was concerned about the impact on the economy.</p>

<p>"I'm deeply disturbed by this kind of situation, and I'm very concerned about the future of the country," Kim said.</p>

<p>Many people said they stayed up late following the news, which stations continued to report despite Yoon declaring that media subject to martial law.</p>

<p>Just after the news broke, the usually quiet passengers on a Seoul subway train started talking to each other. A man read a news story out to a companion, a Reuters witness said.</p>

<h2><strong>PROTESTS, PANIC BUYING</strong></h2>

<p>Thousands of people streamed to the riverside National Assembly late on Tuesday and into Wednesday calling for Yoon's order to be blocked and then his arrest and resignation.</p>

<p>Almost two-thirds of parliament's 300 members scrambled to the National Assembly at night for a vote to reject the martial law.</p>

<p>A major South Korean convenience store chain, which declined to be identified to avoid association with the current political situation, said sales of canned goods from its stores jumped 337% between 11:00 pm and midnight on Tuesday, compared to the same period a week earlier.</p>

<p>Sales of instant noodle packets jumped 254% and bottled water jumped 141%, a spokesperson told Reuters.</p>

<p>Some companies overnight advised employees to work from home, but business outlets were open and the morning rush hour was as normal.</p>

<p>South Korea's largest union coalition, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, said on Wednesday that tens of thousands of its members would strike until Yoon resigns, and will hold a rally in the evening in downtown Seoul.</p>

<p>Several other protests were expected on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"I only knew that martial law had been declared for some reason, but it ended without anything significant, making the reason seem meaningless. It just felt a bit strange to me," said Seoul resident Park Jun-Yeop.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA astronaut Sunita Williams, aboard the International Space Station (ISS), is leading an innovative agricultural experiment.&nbsp;She is growing "Outredgeous" romaine lettuce in microgravity, a study that promises significant benefits for space missions and Earth-based agriculture.</p>

<p>The experiment, known as Plant Habitat-07, is designed to explore how varying levels of water availability influence plant growth in space.</p>

<p>Its primary objectives are optimising plant cultivation techniques for deep-space missions and developing sustainable farming solutions for water-scarce regions on Earth.</p>

<p>This study involves analysing growth rates, nutritional content, and the overall health of lettuce grown in microgravity. By addressing these parameters, the research aims to support NASA's goal of establishing self-sustaining life-support systems for space exploration.</p>

<p>As the lead scientist, Ms Williams has set up the experiment by collecting baseline water samples from the Advanced Plant Habitat's distribution reservoir and installing the Plant Habitat-07 science carrier, which serves as the cultivation chamber for the lettuce.</p>

<p>The implications of this lettuce experiment extend beyond space exploration. For space missions, the research helps reduce reliance on costly resupply missions, ensures astronauts have access to fresh food, and boosts their psychological well-being by allowing them to grow and eat fresh produce. On Earth, the findings could inform water-efficient farming practices in drought-prone areas, improve crop yields with fewer resources, and promote sustainable food production worldwide.</p>

<p>NASA's plant experiments in space have evolved over time, and the Advanced Plant Habitat aboard the ISS provides an advanced platform for these studies. Ms Williams' work builds on past successes, helpful for future innovations that can benefit both space exploration and Earth-based agriculture.</p>

<p>Apart from her agricultural work, Ms Williams contributes to various health studies aboard the ISS. Recently, she supported fellow astronaut Tyler Hague with vascular health monitoring, showcasing the diverse responsibilities astronauts manage during long missions.</p>

<p>The data gathered from this experiment will contribute to NASA's mission of creating self-sustaining habitats for future long-term space missions. It will also provide valuable insights that can help address global food security challenges.</p>

<p>Ms Williams' ongoing mission began on June 5 alongside astronaut Butch Wilmore on Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. She is engaged in routine maintenance tasks and scientific experiments aboard the ISS. Originally planned for an eight-day stay, the mission was extended due to technical issues with the spacecraft's service module.</p>

<p>She will now remain on the ISS until February 2025 and return to Earth aboard the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft. She has taken command of the ISS for the second time in her career.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France's government on Wednesday faces no-confidence votes that could spell the end of the short-lived administration of Prime Minister Michel Barnier, plunging the country into uncharted waters of political chaos.</p>

<p>The toppling of the Barnier government after just three months in office would present President Emmanuel Macron with the unenviable choice of picking a viable successor.</p>

<p>The National Assembly is due to debate two motions brought by the hard-left and far-right in a standoff with Barnier over next year's budget, which saw the premier force through a social security financing bill without a vote.</p>

<p>The far-right National Rally (RN) of three-time presidential candidate Marine Le Pen is expected to vote for the motion put forwards by the left, giving it enough numbers to pass.</p>

<p>Asked on French television if there was a chance his government could survive Wednesday's vote, Barnier replied: "I want this and it is possible...I think it is possible that there is this reflex of responsibility where -- beyond political differences, divergences, the normal contradictions in a democracy -- we tell ourselves that there is a higher interest."</p>

<p>But most analysts believe the government is doomed with the far-right teaming up with the left in an unholy alliance.</p>

<p><strong>'Political fiction'</strong></p>

<p>The turmoil follows a snap election called by Macron in the summer which aimed, without success, to halt the march of the far right, and left no party or faction in parliament with a majority.</p>

<p>Barnier took office with the far right under Le Pen holding a sword of Damocles over his head thanks to its ability to topple the administration at any point of its choosing.</p>

<p>No new elections can be called within a year of the previous legislative polls, narrowing Macron's options.</p>

<p>Some have suggested the president, who is wrapping up a state visit to Saudi Arabia, should resign to break the political impasse.</p>

<p>But Macron rejected those calls, saying such a scenario amounted to "political fiction".</p>

<p>"It's frankly not up to scratch to say these things," Macron told reporters on the sidelines of the Saudi Arabia visit.</p>

<p>"I was elected twice by the French people. I am extremely proud of this and I will honour this trust with all the energy that is mine until the last second to be useful to the country," added Macron, who is due to serve until 2027.</p>

<p>Several prominent opposition figures and even some voices closer to the presidential faction have suggested resignation could be Macron's only viable option.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>'Uncertainty just before Christmas'</strong></p>

<p>The head of the Socialist party, Olivier Faure, called on Macron to make his intentions clear should the Barnier government fall.</p>

<p>"Rather than dropping little remarks during a visit to Saudi Arabia, Emmanuel Macron now needs to speak to the French people," Faure told Le Monde daily in remarks published on Wednesday. "How can he leave the French people in this uncertainty just before Christmas?"</p>

<p>Macron, meanwhile, accused Le Pen's RN of "unbearable cynicism" in backing the no confidence motion.</p>

<p>"We must not scare people with these things," he said.</p>

<p>Macron appeared to hold out some hope that the government will survive, saying he could "not believe" that the motion would pass.</p>

<p>Candidates for the hot seat as premier are few and far between, with loyalist Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu and Macron's centrist ally Francois Bayrou possible contenders.</p>

<p>If the government falls, it would be the first successful no-confidence vote since a defeat for Georges Pompidou's government in 1962, when Charles de Gaulle was president.</p>

<p>The lifespan of Barnier's government would also be the shortest of any administration of France's Fifth Republic, which began in 1958.</p>

<p>Some observers have suggested that Le Pen, 56, is seeking to bring down Macron before his term ends by ousting Barnier.</p>

<p>Le Pen is embroiled in a high-profile embezzlement trial. If found guilty in March, she could be blocked from participating in France's next presidential election.</p>

<p>She has insisted, however, that the standoff is entirely about a budget that she said would make the French poorer.</p>

<p>By following the "catastrophic continuity of Emmanuel Macron", the prime minister "could only fail", she wrote on social media.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/property-tycoon-faces-death-penalty-over-biggest-fraud-in-vietnam-5417298">Truong My Lan</a>, a 68-year-old influential Vietnamese property magnate, has lost the appeal against her death sentence for orchestrating the world's largest bank fraud. The 68-year-old has been battling to avoid execution. Vietnam law stipulated repaying 75 per cent&nbsp;of the stolen amount could reduce her sentence to life imprisonment. Despite her recent plea for leniency, Lan is racing against time to repay $9 billion, three-quarters of the $12 billion she was found to have embezzled.</p>

<p><strong>Where it all began for Truong My Lan</strong></p>

<p>Truong My Lan's journey from a market vendor to one of Vietnam's most powerful figures began in Ho Chi Minh City, where she sold cosmetics with her mother, as per <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd753r47815o" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">the BBC</a>. Capitalising on the economic reforms of 1986, she expanded her business, amassing a substantial property portfolio that included hotels and restaurants by the 1990s. By the time she became the chairwoman of Van Thinh Phat Group, her real estate empire was vast, and she had significant influence in the sector.</p>

<p><strong>The fraud</strong></p>

<p>Truong My Lan's fraudulent activities were exposed following her arrest in October 2022. Prosecutors revealed she secretly controlled Saigon Commercial Bank (SCB), the country's fifth-largest lender. Between 2012 and 2022, Lan used numerous shell companies and third parties to orchestrate a vast financial scheme involving fake loan applications. This scheme allowed her to siphon off an estimated $12.5 billion. Prosecutors estimated that the total damages from the fraud could have reached US$27 billion, which, in 2022, represented nearly 3% of Vietnam's GDP. This fraud left thousands of ordinary citizens without their life savings, tied up in the bank and their real estate ventures.</p>

<p>To mask the fraud, Lan and her co-conspirators, including former bank executives and government officials, allegedly paid bribes of $5.2 million to state officials — an amount that was the largest recorded bribe in Vietnam's history.<br />
<br />
<strong>The trial</strong></p>

<p>The trial involved 85 defendants, including Lan's husband, a Hong Kong businessman, and her niece. The authorities had to secure 105 boxes of evidence, weighing over six tonnes, and installed security cameras to safeguard the information. In April 2024, Lan was sentenced to death for embezzlement, bribery, and breaches of banking regulations.</p>

<p><strong>The road ahead</strong></p>

<p>Truong My Lan's legal team has been working to raise the $9 billion needed to avoid execution, as she continues to sell assets and seek loans from friends. Despite these efforts, liquidating her holdings, which include luxury real estate and stakes in various ventures, has proven challenging. Her lawyers argue that her death sentence hinders her ability to negotiate the best prices for her assets and claim she would have better prospects if her sentence were reduced to life imprisonment.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) has confirmed that its engineers have successfully restored contact with Voyager 1. The dwindling power supply in the spacecraft caused a blackout for several weeks, but it's operating normally now, the agency said.</p>

<p>The issue first came up in October 2024 when Voyager 1 automatically switched from the primary X-band radio transmitter to a much weaker S-band radio transmitter to communicate with its mission team back on Earth, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/03/science/voyager-1-radio-transmitter-power-supply/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">CNN</a> reported.</p>

<p>Voyager 1, called the farthest spacecraft from Earth, is at present exploring uncharted territory nearly 15.4 billion miles (24.9 billion km) away.</p>

<p>The transmitter swap was made autonomously after it was determined that Voyager I had little power left as the mission team sent a command to turn on one of the heaters onboard.</p>

<p>However, this unexpected swap prevented NASA engineers from getting information about the status of the spacecraft along with the scientific data collected by its instruments for nearly a month.</p>

<p>Later, once the team was able to resolve the issue, they switched the spacecraft back to its X-band radio transmitter and started receiving its daily stream of data in mid-November.</p>

<p>Kareem Badaruddin, Voyager mission manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said the probes were "never really designed to be operated like this and the team is learning new things day by day".</p>

<p>"Thankfully they were able to recover from this issue and learned some things," the official added.</p>

<p>This was only one of the many challenges the mission team faced in recent years as Voyager 1, as well as its twin probe Voyager 2, continued to explore more regions in space more than 47 years after the lift-off.</p>

<p>Launched weeks apart in 1977, the two of them have long outlasted their original missions. For now, they are in interstellar space and are the only spacecraft to operate beyond the heliosphere, the bubble of magnetic fields and particles of the Sun extending beyond the orbit of Pluto.</p>

<p>These spacecraft have been powered by the heat from decaying plutonium, which is converted into electricity. The probes lose around four watts of power every year, NASA said, adding this is just equivalent to a small, energy-efficient light bulb.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[President Emmanuel Macron called on French lawmakers to set aside their personal ambition and reject a vote that would topple the government and throw the country into political turmoil.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Emmanuel Macron called on French lawmakers to set aside their personal ambition and reject a vote that would topple the government and throw the country into political turmoil.</p>

<p>Far-right leader Marine Le Pen and her National Rally party have vowed to support a no-confidence motion on Wednesday submitted by a left-wing coalition, a motion that will pass if backed by both groups.</p>

<p>The National Rally became the largest single party in the lower house of parliament in a June snap election, transforming Le Pen into Paris's most influential power broker. But Macron expressed confidence that politicians would step back from the brink.</p>

<p>"The only question that politicians today need to ask themselves is how they can be useful to the country and to the French people," Macron told reporters on Tuesday during a trip to Saudi Arabia. "Not how they can be useful to their own ambitions or their own interests."</p>

<p>The president said in Riyadh that for Le Pen's party to support the no-confidence motion "would be a vote of unbearable cynicism," adding that "I can't believe that they'd vote for the" motion.</p>

<p>Lawmakers in Paris will begin debating the motions at 4 p.m. in Paris Wednesday, with the voting to start shortly thereafter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prime Minister Michel Barnier also spoke of the potential that the no-confidence motion wouldn't pass.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I think it's possible there will be a reflex of responsibility," Barnier said on French TV Tuesday. "I think that the country's higher interest, the common good, the national interest, mean something."</p>

<p>The political difficulties began after Macron called snap elections after getting trounced in European elections. That left the lower house split into three fiercely opposed blocs: a diminished center supporting the president, a leftist alliance and a strengthened far right led by Le Pen. With no coalition possible, Macron appointed Barnier prime minister in September with a core mission to get France's messy finances in order.</p>

<p>Barnier used a constitutional mechanism on Monday to force through an unpopular budget bill, leading the National Rally and the leftist coalition to call for votes of no confidence. Le Pen moved forward with the motion even after Barnier submitted to nearly all of the National Rally's demands to change the budget legislation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the government were to collapse on Wednesday, it would underscore the power acquired by Le Pen since Macron called the surprise election in June. It would also mark the shortest tenure for a premier since France's Fifth Republic was founded in 1958.</p>

<p>The political chaos has driven bond investors to punish France's sovereign debt relative to its peers, pushing borrowing costs at one point last week to match Greece's and leading Barnier to warn of a "storm" in financial markets if he is dismissed from power.</p>

<p>Investors have fretted for months over France's political difficulties, just as the government has been trying to push measures that will reduce its unwieldy deficit. The budget bill initially presented by Barnier's government contained &amp;#8364;60 billion ($63.1 billion) of tax increases and spending cuts that aimed for a sharp adjustment in the deficit to 5% of economic output in 2025 from an estimated 6.1% this year.</p>

<p>A government collapse so close to the end of the year would take France into unchartered territory. The outgoing administration, acting in a caretaker capacity, could use emergency laws to collect taxes and guarantee a minimal level of spending, but the economic and financial impact is hard to predict.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The current finance minister, Antoine Armand, warned earlier Tuesday that stopgap legislation would raise taxes for millions of households and block planned spending increases for some priorities, including security and farming.</p>

<p><strong>What Happens If the Government Falls?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Barnier would tender the resignation of the government</li>
	<li>His outgoing cabinet would remain in place with limited powers to manage current affairs</li>
	<li>The French president is solely responsible for appointing a new premier, but there is no constitutional time limit for his decision</li>
	<li>It took Macron nearly two months to select Barnier with no obvious candidate capable of commanding a majority in a hung parliament</li>
	<li>The caretaker government will likely rely on untested emergency legislation to collect taxes and deliver minimal spending it considers vital</li>
	<li>Once named, a new prime minister would have to propose a cabinet to be appointed by the president</li>
	<li>The new government would need to propose a 2025 budget to parliament</li>
	<li>A new legislative election is not possible until July</li>
</ul>

<p>But Macron expressed confidence that politicians voting on Wednesday would step back from the brink.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The only question that politicians today need to ask themselves is how they can be useful to the country and to the French people," Macron said in Riyadh. "Not how they can be useful to their own ambitions or their own interests."</p>

<p>If the government is voted down, ministers remain in place with a caretaker status to manage current affairs, potentially including emergency legislation to avoid a shutdown. It would then be up to Macron to appoint a new prime minister, although there is no constitutional deadline for his decision.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The president, meantime, said he wouldn't resign until his full term had ended. While the left has called on Macron to step down, he can't be forced out of his job. The next presidential election is set for 2027 and Le Pen remains the frontrunner, according to polls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I've been elected twice by the French people, and I'm extremely proud of that," Macron said. "I'll honor that trust with all my energy, right up to the last second, to be useful to the country."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[American investor and financial commentator Jim Rogers founded Quantum Fund with US billionaire George Soros.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ace American investor and financial commentator Jim Rogers has revealed that he has not seen US billionaire George Soros -- with whom he founded Quantum Fund long back -- in about 50 years and does not talk to him anymore.</p>

<p>In 1970, Rogers joined New York-based investment bank Arnhold and S Bleichroeder, where he worked with Soros. In 1973, Soros and Rogers left and founded the Quantum Fund, which was one of the first truly global funds.</p>

<p>Rogers told IANS during an interaction that he had not seen Soros in nearly 50 years.</p>

<p>On a question, if he is still in touch with Hungarian-American billionaire businessman and philanthropist Soros, who has generated several controversies -- including trying hard to destabilise the Indian economy while funding Democrats millions of dollars in the recent US presidential election -- Rogers flatly denied speaking or seeing him in decades.</p>

<p>"I don't have any thoughts (on Soros). I haven't seen Soros in nearly 50 years," he said.</p>

<p>Singapore-based Rogers is now the chairman of Beeland Interests Inc. and the creator of the Rogers International Commodities Index (RICI).</p>

<p>From 1973 to 1980, the Quantum Fund portfolio gained a whopping 4,200 per cent while the S&amp;P advanced about 47 per cent.</p>

<p>In later years, the Fund lost billions of dollars in its global investments and in July 2011, the Quantum Fund announced it would be turning the fund into a family investment group.</p>

<p>The Quantum Group of Funds is now reportedly managing Soros' family money as well as working with retail investors.</p>

<p>According to Rogers, the Quantum Fund saga was "decades ago".</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about Mr. Soros. I don't see him. I don't talk to him. I don't know what he's doing," 82-year-old Rogers told IANS.</p>

<p>Soros and his billion-dollar network have tried hard in the past to destabilise India while launching several attacks on wealth creators in the country but to no avail.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Namibia has elected its first female President, with Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah declared the winner of last week's disputed elections. Defying predictions of a runoff election, Ms Nandi-Ndaitwah, the current Vice President of the Southern African country, won with 57 per cent of the vote. With this, Namibia's ruling South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO) party extended its 34-year hold on power.</p>

<p>“The Namibian nation has voted for peace and stability,” the 72-year-old leader said after the final results were announced late on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The November 27 election was a test of SWAPO's grip on power, with the main opposition Independent Patriots for Change (IPC) attracting some support from younger generations, which are more concerned by unemployment and inequality than loyalty to liberation-era parties.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>About Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah</strong></h2>

<p>Ms Nandi-Ndaitwah, a SWAPO stalwart known by her initials NNN, will be among the few women leaders on the continent. The conservative daughter of an Anglican pastor, she became vice president in February this year.</p>

<p>Recognisable by her gold-framed glasses, NN joined SWAPO in the 1960s when it was fighting for independence and has served in numerous senior roles including foreign minister in the democratic era.</p>

<p>Among her election promises, NNN said she intends to "create jobs by attracting investments using economic diplomacy."</p>

<p>She received roughly 57 per cent of valid votes in the presidential race, according to a breakdown given by the Electoral Commission of Namibia. 50 per cent votes are needed to secure a victory.</p>

<h2><strong>Disputed Election</strong></h2>

<p>The November 27 presidential election was marred by technical difficulties and ballot paper shortages, leading to a delay in results as voting was extended in some places till November 30. This led to long queues, with some voters giving up on the first day of voting after waiting for up to 12 hours, according to a report by AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The IPC called it a deliberate attempt to frustrate voters and it would not accept the results. Its presidential candidate Panduleni Itula, 67, said last week there were a "multitude of irregularities".</p>

<p>The IPC candidate received 25.5 per cent votes in the November 27 polls, the election authority said, even as the main opposition said it does not recognise the results.</p>

<p>The "IPC shall not recognise the outcome of that election", he said on Saturday, the last day of the extended vote. The party would "fight... to nullify the elections through the processes that are established within our electoral process", Me Itula said.</p>

<p>Itula last week called on his party's supporters to be calm but also "stand firm to ensure that we shall not be robbed neither denied our democratic right to choose our leaders."</p>

<p>Reacting to the announcement of the SWAPO victory, IPC spokesperson Imms Nashinge said the party maintained this position.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>SWAPO's Undisputed Rule</strong></h2>

<p>SWAPO has ruled the mineral-rich southern African country since independence from apartheid South Africa in 1990. The party also had a clean sweep of the concurrent national assembly election, securing 51 of the 96 elected seats. The IPC won 20 seats and will be the official opposition. Namibians voted separately for the National Assembly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, SWAPO's tally was down from its 63 seats in the previous assembly. The presidential election was seen as a key test for the ruling party after other liberation-era movements in the region have lost favour with young voters including with the Botswana Democratic Party which was ousted from power in that country last month after almost six decades.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Political analysts had said that SWAPO victory was uncertain due to growing frustration with high levels of unemployment and inequality, but that the party retained strong roots in rural areas and loyalty among older voters due to the national liberation struggle.</p>

<p>Namibia is a major uranium and diamond exporter but analysts say not many of its nearly three million people have benefited from that wealth in terms of improved infrastructure and job opportunities. Unemployment among 15- to 34-year-olds is estimated at 46 per cent, according to the latest official figures from 2018, which is almost triple the national average.</p>

<p>But, Ms Nandi-Ndaitwah had managed to unite different factions within SWAPO, Analyst Rakkel Andreas told Reuters, adding that her reputation had not been tarnished by corruption allegations, unlike other party members.</p>

<p>"She is a stateswoman. She has been in some form of leadership since we gained independence...She understands the system," Andreas said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The presidential pardon applies to federal crimes committed between January 1, 2014, and December 1, 2024. Hunter Biden had previously faced federal charges for tax offences and accusations of lying about his substance abuse history on a firearm background check form.<br />
<br />
According to the Fox News report, the unpaid rent allegations are a civil matter and not covered by a presidential pardon.<br />
<br />
Joe Biden had earlier maintained that he would not pardon his son but changed his stance months before leaving the White House.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the GenZ population strives to become wealthy in a jiffy, ace global investor Mark Mobius has an advice for them: Take care of your health first.</p>

<p>Speaking to IANS, 88-year-old Mobius said that in his new work titled 'The Book of Wealth: A Young Investor's Guide to Wealth and Happiness', he stressed that the first thing you should look at is staying healthy.</p>

<p>"Take care of your health. Because you can be wealthy, but if you are not healthy, it's not going to be a good game. At the end of the day, you are need to be patient," said Mobius, who runs the Mobius EM Opportunities Fund for emerging markets.</p>

<p>He added that "there are some people that can get rich quick, as a result of either their abilities or luck or a combination of both. But most people are not able to do that, so you better off taking your time investing in good stocks, holding them and then waiting for the returns to come in."</p>

<p>The fact is that "good stocks will always perform well", he added.</p>

<p>On investing in gold and silver keeping the geo-political situation in mind, the global investor said that the portfolio should always have physical gold.</p>

<p>"I recommend maybe 10 per cent, or maybe even 20 per cent of gold in your portfolio. But 10 per cent would be just good. But at the end of the day, you're better off with stocks, with equities as well," he suggested.</p>

<p>According to him, all stock markets are currently booming and things are going to change very fast and there's no question that the markets will go down eventually.</p>

<p>"The question is when, and the good news is that bull markets last longer than bear markets. And bull markets go up more in percentage terms as bear markets go down. So you're better off being optimistic than being pessimistic," Mobius told IANS.</p>

<p>"I believe the bull market in India, with corrections along the way, will continue to do very well because the country is on the track to a higher and higher economy and high growth rates," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"Never say never" rings true for 102-year-old Dorothy Smith, who recently achieved a remarkable milestone: visiting all seven continents. This adventurous centenarian had long dreamed of exploring the globe, and with the help of Ammar Kandil and Staffan Taylor, creators of the YouTube channel "Yes Theory," her dream became reality.</p>

<p>Mr Kandil and Mr Taylor, while filming a story at the Redwoods Retirement Village in California, encountered Ms Smith and were immediately captivated by her zest for life. Upon learning of her desire to visit Australia, the final continent on her travel bucket list, they were determined to help her make it happen.</p>

<p>"Travel is important to me because it's a big world, and each country is different and has something different to offer. I want to see them all and I don't want to miss anything," Smith said during an interview with Destination NSW.</p>

<p>Mr Kandil and Mr Taylor stepped in to offer their assistance, working together with Destination NSW and Qantas to create an itinerary for Ms Smith's visit to Australia. Last week, Ms Smith's dream became a reality as she and her daughter Adrienne flew to Sydney, with Kandil and Taylor joining them on the journey.</p>

<p>"It's never too late for an adventure, just try and see and I think you will be surprised how well you do. You either rust out or wear out. I chose to wear out," Ms Smith said in a video shared by Yes Theory on YouTube.</p>

<p>The 102-year-old travelled in business class on a Qantas flight, where she was honoured by the pilots and crew before takeoff. Upon arriving in Australia, Smith enjoyed a Sydney Harbour cruise, visited WILD LIFE Sydney Zoo to see koalas and kangaroos, and explored iconic sites like the Sydney Opera House and Bondi Beach. She also spent time at the Botanic Gardens and the Museum of Contemporary Art.</p>

<p>About her Sydney trip, Ms Smith said, "The people are charming, the food is good, the scenery is just wonderful, and even the weather is nice. However, I was expecting more wild plains with grasses growing on them."</p>

<p>Yes Theory's Kandil and Taylor captured every moment of Smith's journey. They uploaded a video on YouTube, which has already amassed over 470,000 views and nearly 30,000 likes.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The city of Janakpur in Nepal prepares itself for the 'Sita Ram Vivah Mahotsav' amid tight security. Janakpur, which is the maternal house of Goddess Sita, also got a facelift for the occasion with artists painting murals on the walls around the city depicting the scenes from the holy scripture of Ramayana, giving a fresher and new look to the ancient city.</p>

<p>On November 26, Lord Ram's 'Baraat Yatra' (wedding procession) began from Ayodhya's Ramsevak Puram and reached Janakpur on Tuesday evening.</p>

<p>The wedding rituals will take place on December 4 and 5 as per the culture of Mithila, and on December 6 is Lord Ram's Vivaah Panchami.</p>

<p>On December 7, following the conclusion of the wedding, 'Kalevar' will be organised, and on December 8, 'baraat' will depart from Janakpur and reach Ayodhya on the night of December 9.</p>

<p>Speaking on the security arrangements on the occasion, Dhanusa District Sub Inspector Bhuvaneshwar Tiwari said that the district had prepared a comprehensive security plan for the Ram Janaki Vivaah Panchami.</p>

<p>He stated that the district police office, along with the district security committee, local government, and other security agencies, has coordinated efforts to ensure safety during the event.</p>

<p>A total of 1461 police personnel from Nepal Police, more than 750 personnel from the armed police forces, and other security agencies had been deployed, and reinforcements had also been provided by the Madhesh Pradesh Police Office.</p>

<p>"Dhanusa District Police office, along with the district security committee and other security agencies and in collaboration with the local government, we have prepared an extensive and comprehensive security plan for the Ram Janaki Vivaah Panchami... We have deployed police from the district police office. We have reinforcement from the Madhesh Pradesh Police Office," Tiwari said.</p>

<p>"We have deployed 1461 police personnel from Nepal Police and more than 750 police personnel from armed police forces and other security agencies. The Nepal Army and the National Investigation Division will also be deployed. We are in close cooperation with local youth clubs... We have separate traffic management plans and evacuation plans. We have a stampede prevention plan. We have also planned for emergencies and such unexpected events," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As Ukraine's military struggles to find enough troops, particularly infantry, to hold off Russia's much larger army, some units are giving a second chance to those who have absconded from service.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Ukraine's military struggles to find enough troops, particularly infantry, to hold off Russia's much larger army, some units are giving a second chance to those who have absconded from service.</p>

<p>Data from the prosecutor's office shows nearly 95,000 criminal cases have been opened since 2022 against soldiers going "absent without leave" (AWOL) and for the more serious crime of battlefield desertion.</p>

<p>The number of cases has risen steeply with each year of the war: almost two-thirds of the total are from 2024. With many tens of thousands of troops killed or wounded, it is a depletion that Ukraine can ill afford.</p>

<p>Now, some units are replenishing their ranks by accepting soldiers previously declared AWOL.</p>

<p>One of them is Ukraine's elite 47th Brigade, which published a social media post last month inviting soldiers who had absconded to join.</p>

<p>"Our aim is to give every soldier the opportunity to come back into the fold and realise his potential," the post announced. In the first two days, the brigade said, over a hundred applications came in.</p>

<p>"There was a tsunami of applications; so many that we still aren't able to process them all before new ones come in," Viacheslav Smirnov, the 47th's head of recruitment, said two weeks after the announcement.</p>

<p>Two military units Reuters spoke to said they were only recruiting soldiers who had gone AWOL from their bases, rather than those who had deserted from combat.</p>

<p>The former is seen within the Ukrainian military as a lesser offence. A bill recently signed into law has in effect decriminalised a soldier's first disappearance, allowing them to return to service.</p>

<p><strong>Thousands Of Ukrainian Soldiers Rejoin After Absconding</strong></p>

<p>Colonel Oleksandr Hrynchuk, deputy head of Ukraine's military police, told reporters on Tuesday that 6,000 AWOL soldiers had returned to service in the last month, including 3,000 in the 72 hours since the law was signed.</p>

<p>Mykhailo Perets, an officer from the K-2 battalion of Ukraine's 54th Brigade, said his battalion had already hired over 30 men who had gone AWOL from other units.</p>

<p>"The reasons [for absconding] are very different: for some people it was too tough a transition straight from civilian life, others served for a year or two as qualified [drone] pilots but were then sent to the front line because there wasn't enough infantry."</p>

<p>Perets said those who had applied also included men who had become exhausted and run away after being at war for seven or eight years, having fought Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine before 2022.</p>

<p>Gil Barndollar, a non-resident fellow at the U.S.-based Defense Priorities think tank, said the increase in unauthorised absences was most likely driven by exhaustion.</p>

<p>Ukrainian service personnel have previously said how the lack of replacements for lost soldiers puts an unbearable strain on those remaining, exhausting them physically and mentally.</p>

<p>Barndollar also highlighted their average age as an additional strain.</p>

<p>"An army of men, often in poor health, in their 40s, all else being equal, is going to get exhausted sooner and is going to have morale problems faster than a reasonably fit army of 20- or 25-year-olds."</p>

<p>Zelenskiy has responded to questions about the manpower problem by arguing that Ukraine lacks weapons rather than people, and pushed back against U.S. pressure to lower the minimum draft age to 18 from 25.</p>

<p>He said in an interview with Sky News last week that Kyiv's allies had been able to provide the necessary equipment for only a quarter of the 10 new brigades Ukraine had formed over the past year.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Famous Indian American photographer Pervez Taufiq is speaking out about a distressing event that he recorded on camera, where a woman on a United Airlines shuttle bus used a racist slur to verbally harass his family.</p>

<p>Just before Thanksgiving, Taufiq, 50, was flying from Mexico to Los Angeles with his wife and three kids when the woman attacked them, calling them "un-American" and using derogatory names like "tandoori" and "stinky" against them.</p>

<p>Taufiq, a well-known wedding photographer whose work has appeared in high-end magazines, posted the footage on his Instagram page to draw attention to the incident.</p>

<p>The argument apparently started between the woman and Taufiq's son aboard the aeroplane bus. On the shuttle bus, things got out of hand.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Croatian police arrested on Tuesday a couple suspected of fatal neglect and abuse of their two toddlers whose bodies were found buried next to their house, a minister said.</p>

<p>The spouses are suspected of "grossly neglecting" their three children due to which two, most likely around 12 months old, have died, Interior Minister Davor Bozinovic told reporters.</p>

<p>The parents, aged 38 and 34, buried the bodies of the toddlers at the family property in the region of the northwestern town of Varazdin, he said.</p>

<p>Local media reported that the remains were buried at the family house yard.</p>

<p>Police were "deeply shocked and horrified" with results of their investigation that had been launched into possible neglect and abuse of the three children by their parents, the minister added.</p>

<p>The bodies of the two toddlers were exhumed earlier Tuesday and the cause of their death will be determinated by an autopsy.</p>

<p>Due to suspicion of neglect and abuse the couple's third child was taken over by social services, the minister said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Biden administration appointee has agreed to lock in hybrid work protections for tens of thousands of Social Security staff, part of a slew of organized labor efforts that complicate President-elect Donald Trump's efforts to reshape the federal workforce.</p>

<p>The American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing 42,000 Social Security Administration workers, reached an agreement with the agency last week that will protect telework until 2029 in an updated contract, according to a message to its members viewed by Bloomberg.</p>

<p>The new deal, signed by President Joe Biden's just-departed SSA Commissioner Martin O'Malley, will let workers "maintain current levels of telework," AFGE chapter president Rich Couture wrote.</p>

<p>Under those current arrangements, in-office requirements range from two to five days per week, varying by job, according to people familiar who spoke on condition of anonymity because the new agreement has not been publicized.</p>

<p>"This deal will secure not just telework for SSA employees, but will secure staffing levels through prevention of higher attrition, which in turn will secure the ability of the Agency to serve the public," Couture wrote.</p>

<p>An AFGE spokesperson declined to elaborate on the message. A SSA spokesperson confirmed the independent agency "memorialized its preexisting telework policy in its contract with AFGE," and noted that managers can still make temporary changes based on operational needs or performance issues.</p>

<p>Unions have been pushing the outgoing Biden administration to extend existing collective bargaining agreements with federal workers in advance of Trump's inauguration next month, according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Some union leaders are urging the current White House team to issue an executive order calling for such moves.</p>

<p>A federal Office of Management and Budget spokesperson declined to comment.</p>

<p>Trump has asked billionaire Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new task force aimed at cutting government spending and streamlining operations called the "Department of Government Efficiency." Musk and Ramaswamy have said they plan to cull the federal workforce and eliminate work-from-home policies.</p>

<p>"Requiring federal employees to come to the office five days a week would result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome," they wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed last month.</p>

<p>The Trump transition team declined to comment directly on the union contracts.</p>

<p>"Under President Trump's leadership, the Government Efficiency effort led by Vivek and Elon will target waste and fraud throughout our massive federal bureaucracy," spokesperson Brian Hughes said. "They will work together slashing excess regulations, cutting wasteful expenditures, and restructuring Federal Agencies."</p>

<p>Organized labor represents over a million federal government employees, and AFGE is the largest federal worker union. Legally-binding union contracts, which dictate terms on working conditions, can be amended during, or extended beyond, their existing timeframes.</p>

<p>While they don't supersede federal law, contract terms can restrict agencies' discretion over how to manage their staff.</p>

<p>AFGE members at the Environmental Protection Agency in May ratified a contract with management that includes new "scientific integrity" safeguards meant to protect their ability to discuss their work with the media and report alleged scientific misconduct without suffering from retaliation. Attorneys at the Department of Justice have been organizing with another group, the National Treasury Employees Union, trying to secure union recognition before Biden leaves office.</p>

<p>Collective bargaining agreements may not deter Trump, Musk or Ramaswamy, who have signaled they plan to challenge precedents limiting executive authority. But reneging on a contract could lead to protracted legal disputes, as well as protests and pushback from lawmakers.</p>

<p>A US president "can't just set aside lawfully signed collective bargaining agreements, without the unions' agreement," Indiana University law professor Kenneth G. Dau-Schmidt said via email. "The US government has to live up to its agreements, too."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[After Japan's defeat in World War II, Korea, previously under Japanese control, faced an uncertain future.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was six hours of uncertainty, chaos and political turmoil in South Korea when President Yoon Suk Yeol declared <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/south-korea-under-martial-law-heres-what-it-means-for-its-citizens-7165007">martial law</a> on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>The military imposed restrictions on political activities and Korean troops secured the country's national assembly. And while Mr Yeol withdrew his decision within hours, he cited threats from North Korea and accused opposition forces of undermining the state.<br />
<br />
All this came after weeks of rising political tensions and public dissatisfaction with Yoon's administration.<br />
<br />
The imposition and withdrawal of martial law followed ongoing tensions on the Korean Peninsula, which remains divided along ideological and political lines. The Korean Peninsula has been divided for over 70 years, with North and South Korea taking drastically different paths. The split traces its roots to the end of World War II in 1945 when global powers divided the region into two zones.<br />
<br />
<strong>Why the split</strong><br />
<br />
After Japan's defeat in World War II, Korea, previously under Japanese control, faced an uncertain future. The US and the Soviet Union stepped in, dividing Korea along the 38th parallel. The Soviet Union occupied the North, while the US controlled the South. This division happened without consulting Koreans.<br />
<br />
Attempts to reunify Korea failed as the Cold War deepened. The Soviets and Americans refused to relinquish control, preventing negotiations for a middle ground.<br />
<br />
In the North, the Soviets supported a communist government under Kim Il-sung while the US backed an anti-communist regime led by Syngman Rhee in the South. In 1948, South Korea officially formed a government in Seoul, followed by the North declaring its own state in Pyongyang. Both claimed to represent all of Korea.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Korean war</strong><br />
<br />
Tensions erupted into the Korean War in 1950 when North Korea, backed by the Soviet Union and China, invaded the South. The US intervened, urging its member states to send military aid to South Korea. The US, Great Britain, Australia, and Canada joined the efforts, contributing troops to counter the invasion.<br />
<br />
Peace negotiators began talks in July 1951, but progress remained slow. For two years, opposing forces fought intensely while diplomatic efforts continued. On July 27, 1953, representatives from the US, China, North Korea, and South Korea signed an armistice (not a peace treaty) at Panmunjom. This agreement ended active hostilities but maintained Korea's division.<br />
<br />
The Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) was established along the 38th parallel, creating one of the most heavily fortified borders in the world.<br />
<br />
Often referred to as the "Forgotten War," the Korean conflict left a devastating toll. It killed over three million and displaced countless people, making it one of the most tragic episodes of the Cold War era.<br />
<br />
<strong>What keeps them apart?</strong><br />
<br />
Since the split, North Korea has remained an isolated communist regime under the Kim dynasty, focusing on military strength and nuclear weapons. South Korea, on the contrary, developed into a democratic, economically advanced nation with strong ties to the West.<br />
<br />
Efforts at reunification, including talks and summits, have made little progress. The ideological divide and mutual mistrust have kept the two Koreas apart, with tensions occasionally escalating due to military provocations from the North.</p>]]></content:encoded>

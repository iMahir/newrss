       <description><![CDATA[Many Democratic leaders have backed Kamala Harris as the party's new US Presidential candidate, but ex-president Barack Obama has held off so far.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many Democratic leaders have backed <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joe-biden-praises-kamala-harris-shes-experienced-shes-tough-shes-capable-6182671" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a> as the party's new US Presidential candidate, but ex-president Barack Obama has held off so far.</p>

<p>According to the New York Post, Obama hasn't endorsed Harris - who US President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joe-biden-says-us-is-more-powerful-than-any-dictator-or-tyrant-6182537#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">Joe Biden</a> supported after he dropped out of the race on Sunday, as he doesn't think she can beat Republican candidate <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/at-campaign-rally-donald-trump-calls-kamala-harris-a-radical-left-lunatic-6182225" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a>.</p>

<p>"Obama is very upset because he knows she can't win," a Biden family source told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/24/us-news/obama-doesnt-believe-kamala-harris-can-beat-trump-sources/" target="_blank">The New York Post</a>.</p>

<p>"Obama knows she's just incompetent - the border czar who never visited the border, saying that all migrants should have health insurance. She cannot navigate the landmines that are ahead of her," the source said. "When you are running for president there are things you can and can't say."</p>

<p>The source said that Obama's hope was to get Biden out of the way and an article written by actor <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joe-biden-supporter-george-clooney-requests-him-to-leave-presidential-race-6077438" target="_blank">George Clooney</a>, asking him to step aside, was a part of that plan.</p>

<p>Obama wanted Arizona Senator Mark Kelly "at the top of the ticket" when the Democratic National Convention is held next month, the source told The New York Post.</p>

<p>"Obama is furious, things haven't gone his way, which is why he is not joining in the Democratic Party's support of Harris," the source added.</p>

<h3><strong>Michelle Obama To Replace Joe Biden?</strong></h3>

<p>Earlier last month, before Joe Biden bowed out, US Senator Ted Cruz predicted that former First Lady <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/michelle-obama-to-replace-joe-biden-us-senators-bold-prediction-5994892" target="_blank">Michelle Obama</a> would replace him.</p>

<p>His prediction came after Biden's presidential debate against Donald Trump, which was widely criticised by political analysts.</p>

<p>"The odds are north of 80% that the Democratic Party will remove Joe Biden from the ticket and replace him with Michelle Obama because Biden did so disastrously badly tonight that Democrats across the country are in utter freefall and complete panic," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Paris Olympic Games will be one of the most high-risk in history owing to a combination of internal strife within France and heightened global geopolitical tensions.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Paris Olympic Games will be one of the most high-risk in history owing to a combination of internal strife within France and heightened global geopolitical tensions.</p>

<p>France is grappling with deep internal divisions: the country's volatile political climate and the potential for demonstrations or violence pose significant challenges for organisers.</p>

<p>The current global geopolitical landscape, marked by heightened tensions between major powers, further amplifies the security threats. These Olympics could serve as a potential target for state-sponsored actors seeking to exploit the event for their own agendas.</p>

<p>In response to these elevated threats, organisers are implementing unprecedented security measures, including deploying a record number of security personnel.</p>

<p>About 30,000 police, increasing to a record 45,000 at peak times, will work on the four-week Olympics and Paralympics across the Ile-de-France region covering Paris. They will be supplemented with police forces from across Europe to bolster security efforts.</p>

<p><strong>Islamist Terror</strong></p>

<p>A significant concern is the threat posed by Islamist terrorist networks.</p>

<p>Previous attacks on sporting and cultural events, combined with reports of foiled attempts by French authorities, underline this risk.</p>

<p>The escalation of the Israeli-Hamas conflict following the October 7, 2023, terror attack exacerbates this danger. Islamist terrorists may exploit the situation to position themselves as defenders of Palestinians and Muslims, targeting not just Israel but also Western countries that support Israel.</p>

<p>Daesh (ISIS) emerges as a primary suspect, especially since it operates as an umbrella network offering justification, inspiration and identity to lone actors and small cells operating in its name.</p>

<p>The possibility of Hamas conducting operations on European soil, as evidenced by arrests in Denmark and Germany, complicates the landscape.</p>

<p>Historically, Hamas has distanced itself from international Islamist terrorist networks such as Daesh and Al Qaeda, focusing on Israel. However, the dynamics have shifted post-October 7, with the conflict being framed as a broader Arab and Muslim cause against a morally corrupt West supporting Israel.</p>

<p>This alignment could potentially lead to cooperation between Hamas and Daesh.The Munich 1972 Olympics serve as a tragic reminder of the vulnerability of such events. The infiltration of the Olympic Village, the killing of Israeli athletes, and the taking of hostages by Black September highlight the dangers.</p>

<p>The anti-Semitic atmosphere in Europe, coupled with past rhetoric justifying attacks on Israelis, suggests Israeli athletes and fans could be at heightened risk during the Paris Games.</p>

<p><strong>Deadly Threats</strong></p>

<p>Hostage-taking, suicide bombings, and planted explosives are among the potential threats.</p>

<p>Although suicide bombings have become less common in Europe, they remain a possibility. The complexity of monitoring and gathering intelligence requires international cooperation to thwart such attacks.</p>

<p>The recent attacks by ISIS-affiliated militants in Moscow demonstrate the deadly potential of shooting sprees in crowded areas, while France's experience with knife and vehicle attacks adds another layer of concern.</p>

<p>The worst-case scenario involves multiple, simultaneous attacks across various locations, employing diverse methods and targets, extending beyond athletic venues to include churches and synagogues.</p>

<p><strong>What Motivates A Terrorist?</strong></p>

<p>The threat landscape is further complicated by the diverse pathways to radicalisation and the varied motivations that drive individuals to violence.</p>

<p>Extremists draw inspiration from a range of ideologies, and their motivations may be personal, social, or political. That's also because the Olympics provide an attractive high-profile platform for extremist groups and individuals seeking to carry out attacks.</p>

<p>Alt-right extremism is another significant threat. On July 17, French anti-terror police detained an alleged neo-Nazi sympathiser suspected of wanting to target the Olympic torch relay.</p>

<p><strong>Beyond Paris</strong></p>

<p>Social media plays a crucial role in amplifying extremist narratives and providing a platform for radicalisation.</p>

<p>The interconnectedness of the digital world means that even attacks far from Paris, such as at a public viewing event, could have a significant impact on the Games.</p>

<p>But security considerations extend beyond the immediate vicinity of Olympic venues, encompassing all media-related and public events associated with the games. The global reach of the Olympics means that any security breach, regardless of location, could have far-reaching consequences.</p>

<p>The spirit of the Olympics lies in peaceful competition, reminiscent of their ancient Greek origins. The 2024 Paris Olympics present a unique set of security challenges, requiring a comprehensive and multifaceted approach that addresses both internal and external threats.</p>

<p>International cooperation, intelligence gathering, and a thorough understanding of the evolving threat landscape are crucial for safeguarding athletes, spectators, and the public.</p>

<p>Marco Lombardi, director of ITSTIME research centre, is full professor at the Catholic University of Sacred Heart, where he teaches crisis management and risk communication, mass communication theory, sociology, intelligence and counter terrorism and security policies. He is member of the Governmental Commission on Counter Radicalisation and of the Strategic Policy Committee of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation.</p>

<p>Maria Alvanou is a Criminologist (International Research Doctorate in Criminology-University of Trento) with the Italian Team for Security, Terroristic Issues &amp; Managing Emergencies (ITSTIME) at the Catholic University of Sacred Heart. Her doctoral research on Palestinian female suicide bombers during the second Intifada included fieldwork in Israel. She has been a member of the RAN and has taught at several law enforcement and military schools.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American and Canadian warplanes intercepted two Russian and two Chinese bombers in international airspace near the state of Alaska on Wednesday, the joint US-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) said.</p>

<p>"NORAD detected, tracked, and intercepted two Russian TU-95 and two PRC H-6 military aircraft operating in the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone," it said.</p>

<p>The zone is a perimeter in which air traffic is monitored beyond the border of national airspace to provide additional reaction time in case of hostile actions.</p>

<p>Intercepts of Russian aircraft -- in which they are contacted visually or electronically by US or Canadian planes -- are relatively common in the area.</p>

<p>"Fighter jets from the United States and Canada conducted the intercept," NORAD said, adding that the bombers "remained in international airspace and did not enter American or Canadian sovereign airspace," and that their activity "is not seen as a threat."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bike ride took a deadly turn for a 38-year-old Russian social media influencer in Turkey after she crashed into a truck while riding her red BMW motorcycle. According to Turkish media outlet <em>Turkiye Today</em>, Tatyana Ozolina, who goes by "MotoTanya" on social media, was travelling between Mugla and Bodrum when the fatal crash occurred. She lost control of her red BMW S1000RR 2015 and collided with a truck near Milas. Despite the immediate arrival of emergency services, Ms Ozolina was pronounced dead at the scene.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Turkish biker accompanying her, Onur Obut, survived but suffered serious injuries and is in hospital. A third biker present at the scene was uninjured, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.turkiyetoday.com/lifestyle/russias-most-beautiful-biker-tatyana-dies-in-motorcycle-crash-in-turkiye-32287/">outlet </a>reported. The authorities are still investigating the circumstances surrounding the fatal accident that occurred.</p>

<p>Ms Ozolina, widely recognized as MotoTanya, was a popular Moto vlogger with over 1 million followers on Instagram and 2 million on YouTube. The influencer dubbed "Russia's most beautiful biker" is known for her global motorcycle adventures. In her last Instagram post, Ms Ozolina shared that she wasn't allowed to enter Europe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"4000 km from home. Greece missed me but didn't miss my motorcycle. I was in Greece on foot. I bought a magnet and returned it to Turkey. I was upset that I didn't manage to ride around Europe, but not much because I knew that the situation could be like this... therefore, I moved on. Conquer beautiful, hot and hospitable Turkey," she wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/29407600/influencer-russias-most-beautiful-biker-killed-horror-crash/amp/"><em>The Sun</em></a>, Ms Ozolina's bike was struck by another rider group, causing her to brake abruptly. She was unable to avoid a collision and ploughed into a truck, losing control and suffering fatal injuries. She died before the ambulance arrived. Her family including her son, 13, is "in a state of shock," the outlet reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a tribute, Andrei Ivanov, head of the MotoMoscow Association, said, "MotoTanya is not with us anymore...she had a bright and beautiful life.... Millions of people followed her. Perhaps there is not a single motorcyclist in the country who was indifferent to Tatyana. She was adored, envied, admired, copied, awarded as a top blogger and, at the same time, discussed and slandered. Now all that remains is her memory. Sleep well."&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to a joint session of the US Congress on Wednesday sparked controversy and division among lawmakers and US citizens. Representative Rashida Tlaib, the sole Palestinian-American member of Congress, held up a sign labeling Netanyahu a "war criminal" and "guilty of genocide" during his speech today.</p>

<p>Tlaib, a vocal critic of Israel's actions in Gaza, was joined by Hani Almadhoun, a Palestinian who has lost numerous family members in the conflict.</p>

<p>Tlaib was accompanied by an invited guest, Hani Almadhoun, a Palestinian who has lost more than 150 members of his extended family since Israel launched its war with the aim of destroying Hamas.</p>

<p>"After witnessing his sister forced to eat animal feed, he and his family were determined to start a soup kitchen to feed their starving neighbors,” Tlaib wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I will never back down in speaking truth to power.<br />
<br />
The apartheid government of Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians. Palestinians will not be erased. Solidarity with all those outside of these walls in the streets protesting and exercising their right to dissent. <a href="https://t.co/TSbbXdv13U">pic.twitter.com/TSbbXdv13U</a></p>
— Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) <a href="https://twitter.com/RashidaTlaib/status/1816200931848950184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Outside the Capitol, thousands of protesters demonstrated against Netanyahu's visit, with some being kept back by police using pepper spray. Six protesters were arrested inside the House of Representatives before Netanyahu began speaking. While some lawmakers gave Netanyahu a standing ovation, others chose to stay away.</p>

<p>Netanyahu's US&nbsp; visit comes amid growing concerns over the humanitarian toll of Israel's nine-month ground invasion in Gaza, with Americans deeply divided on the issue. Netanyahu's speech highlighted the sharp divisions within the US Congress and the country at large on Israel's actions in the region.</p>

<p>In his address, Netanyahu said only military pressure can free the hostages and defeat Hamas, which launched a shock attack on October 7 that resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said he was "confident" in efforts to secure the release of the 114 hostages still in Gaza, where Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 39,145 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.</p>

<p>He also used his address to call for a global alliance against Iran, which he accuses of funding anti-Israel protests. He also slammed ceasefire demonstrators and praised President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump for their efforts towards Middle East peace.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Soon after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, local law enforcement officers and a U.S. Secret Service agent discussed how pictures of the shooter were shared among officers by a sniper who lost sight of him before he opened fire, a newly released video showed.</p>

<p>The three-minute video was recorded on the body-worn camera of an officer from the Beaver County Emergency Services Unit who was at the Trump campaign rally on July 13 in the rural western Pennsylvania town of Butler, and released on Tuesday by U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley.</p>

<p>The video shows local law enforcement officers and the Secret Service agent on a roof near the shooter's body about an hour after the attack discussing how photos of the gunman, 20-year-old nursing-home aide Thomas Crooks, were shared among law enforcement officers by a sniper who lost sight of Crooks before the shooting.</p>

<p>It was unclear from the video how long before the shooting the pictures of Crooks were circulated.</p>

<p>Crooks' bleeding body can be seen a few steps away from the officers on the roof. One of the officers gestures to a semi-automatic rifle near the body.</p>

<p>Crooks was able to crawl across the roof overlooking Trump's rally and fire eight bullets from a semi-automatic rifle before he was fatally shot by a Secret Service sniper on top of another building, according to law enforcement accounts. Crooks killed one man in the crowd and seriously wounded two others. Trump was wounded in his right ear.</p>

<p>Crooks' motive remains unclear. He registered as a Republican soon after turning 18. Before the attack, his internet search history shows him researching how Lee Harvey Oswald killed President John F. Kennedy in 1963, FBI Director Christopher Wray told a congressional hearing on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, whose agency is responsible for the safety of U.S. presidents and other senior officials, resigned on Tuesday after her own congressional hearing.</p>

<p>Trump, who served as president from 2016 to 2020, is seeking to be returned to the White House in November's election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>White House Press Secretary, Karine Jean Pierre emphasised that no one is more qualified to step in as the Democratic Party's presidential nominee than US Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Jean-Pierre on Wednesday (local time) noted that Kamala Harris has been vice president for more than four years now.</p>

<p>"The vice president (Kamala Harris) has been vice president for more than four years. I do not see anyone more qualified to step in at this moment. She was a senator. She was an attorney general...," she said while addressing the White House briefing.</p>

<p>Jean-Pierre noted that Kamala Harris was a partner in that to the president, adding that President Joe Biden is proud to make this decision.</p>

<p>"I've listed out what we've been able to accomplish in the last three and a half, almost four years, an unprecedented record. She was a partner in that with the president. This is a decision that this president made, and I think he (US President Joe Biden) is proud to have made that decision...," she added.</p>

<p>Harris, over the past 3.5 years as vice president, has visited more than 19 countries and met with more than 150 foreign leaders, according to the White House website.</p>

<p>She has visited over 19 countries and met with more than 150 foreign leaders, according to information available on the White House website.</p>

<p>The US presidential election will take place on November 5, and Biden was seeking re-election to the post as the Democratic Party nominee. After his June 27 debate with Republican candidate Donald Trump, Democrats put pressure on him to withdraw from the race.</p>

<p>Following this, on July 21, Biden formally announced that he was abandoning plans for a second term in office and endorsed his running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris for the election.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Harris has quickly consolidated support among Democrats and has already secured the backing of enough delegates to be the likely Democratic nominee. Democrats adopted the rules the party will use to choose their presidential nominee, with voting to officially nominate Harris likely to begin on August 1.</p>

<p>Harris will have to secure the support of the majority of delegates at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago in August.</p>

<p>Under the rules approved by the Democratic National Convention's rules panel Wednesday, presidential hopefuls have until Saturday evening to formally declare their candidatures and until Tuesday, July 30, to submit signatures from at least 300 delegates, with not more than 50 from a single state counting towards the threshold, reported CNN.</p>

<p>Voting will be conducted by electronic ballots sent to convention delegates. If only one candidate meets the petition requirements, which is likely considering how quickly the party has coalesced around Harris, voting is expected to begin on August 1, although it will be up to party leaders to set the times for voting to begin and end.</p>

<p>If more than one candidate were to meet the requirements, party leaders can set a period of no more than five days for candidates to make their case to delegates, reported CNN.</p>

<p>The party has said its goal is to nominate its presidential and vice presidential candidates by August 7 to avoid the possibility of litigation over ballot access in Ohio.</p>

<p>While the state has pushed its deadline for political parties to submit their official nominees to September 1, the new law won't take effect until the end of August.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden told Americans Wednesday that he had dropped out of the 2024 election to unite his party and his country, saying in a historic Oval Office speech that it was time to pass the torch to "younger voices."</p>

<p>In his first televised address since his stunning decision, the 81-year-old hailed his "tough" and "capable" Vice President Kamala Harris, 59, who is set to be the new Democratic presidential nominee.</p>

<p>Biden bowed out of the race later than any other president in US history on Sunday, giving in to weeks of pressure from Democrats after a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump raised concerns about his age and mental acuity.</p>

<p>Using the powerfully symbolic setting of the Resolute Desk, Biden's speech called for an end to the divisions in US politics and said the country was more powerful than "any dictator or tyrant."</p>

<p>The veteran Democrat said there was a "time and a place for new voices, fresh voices. Yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now."</p>

<h3><strong>'Never wavered'</strong></h3>

<p>In a poignant sign of support for Biden after the toughest decision of his political life, most of his family sat watching him in the Oval Office as he spoke.</p>

<p>They included his wife Jill and daughter Ashley -- who held hands near the end of his remarks -- Biden's troubled son Hunter and a number of Biden's grandchildren.</p>

<p>Jill Biden later posted a letter on X thanking "those who never wavered" -- an apparent backhanded dig at the Democrats who called on Biden to quit -- and said it was "time to put that trust in Kamala."</p>

<p>Biden's withdrawal has upended Trump's campaign, which had previously focused on the president's age and mental acuity. Now it is Trump, 78, who is the oldest candidate in US history.</p>

<p>Trump, who had initially called for unity after surviving an assassination attempt on July 13, was in no mood for magnanimity after Biden's speech.</p>

<p>"Crooked Joe Biden's Oval Office speech was barely understandable, and sooo bad!" Trump said on social media.</p>

<p>Republicans have called for Biden to step down altogether, saying that if he is not fit to stand for reelection then he is not fit to serve as president.</p>

<p>Biden however insisted that he was no lame duck and that he would continue to work on the economy and key foreign policy issues for the rest of his time in office.</p>

<p>"Over the next six months I will be focused on doing my job as president," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>'Lunatic'</strong></h3>

<p>One key goal is a peace deal in the Middle East -- a legacy-defining dream that many US presidents before Biden have chased.</p>

<p>Biden, who has been increasingly critical over Israel's military campaign in Gaza, meets Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But in a sign of how quickly things are changing, Netanyahu will sit down separately that day with Harris as well, as well as meeting Trump in Florida on Friday.</p>

<p>The US election campaign meanwhile is moving ahead at full speed without Biden.</p>

<p>In his first rally since Harris secured enough delegates to become the de facto Democratic nominee, Trump hit out at Harris as his "new victim."</p>

<p>"She is a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country," he said, accusing Harris of hiding Biden's "mental unfitness."</p>

<p>Earlier, the White House denied there was any "cover up" over Biden's condition.</p>

<p>Harris was also on the campaign trail Wednesday, telling a Black college sorority in Indianapolis that "I am fighting for our nation's future."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Negotiations on a ceasefire-for-hostages deal in the Gaza conflict appear to be in their closing stages and U.S. President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will discuss remaining gaps on Thursday, a senior U.S. official said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The official, briefing reporters ahead of their talks, said the remaining obstacles are bridgeable and there will be more meetings aimed at reaching a deal between Israel and Hamas over the next week.</p>

<p>Hamas-led fighters stormed into southern Israel on Oct.7, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 captives, according to Israeli tallies, triggering a war in which more than 38,000 people in Gaza have been killed.</p>

<p>Hamas and other militants are still holding 120 hostages; Israel believes around a third of them are dead.</p>

<p>Months of stop-and-start talks have failed to produce a deal to gain release of some of the remaining hostages.</p>

<p>The senior U.S. official said both Israel and Hamas still have some issues to resolve but that a deal is close in which a six-week ceasefire would take place in exchange for the release of women, elderly men and wounded hostages over a 42-day period.</p>

<p>"It's a very different negotiation now than just a month ago when we had some fundamentally unbridgeable issues," the official said.</p>

<p>Biden will hold talks with Netanyahu and then later in the day Vice President Kamala Harris will have a separate meeting with the Israeli leader.</p>

<p>Harris has taken over as the presumed Democratic choice for the November presidential election against Republican Donald Trump, after Biden opted not to seek reelection again under pressure from Democrats concerned about his mental acuity.</p>

<p>The senior U.S. official said both Biden and Harris are "completely aligned" on U.S. policy toward Israel and Gaza.</p>

<p>"The Israelis will hear full alignment," the official said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The gunman who attempted to assassinate Donald Trump at a campaign rally searched online for details about the November 1963 shooting of US president John F. Kennedy in the days before the attack, the FBI director said Wednesday.</p>

<p>FBI chief Christopher Wray, testifying before a congressional committee, said the gunman flew a drone over the venue where the former president was scheduled to speak about two hours before he took the stage in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13.</p>

<p>Wray told members of the House Judiciary Committee that investigators have not established a motive for the shooting but "we are digging hard because this is one of the central questions for us."</p>

<p>Trump survived the assassination bid, suffering a wound to his right ear, and a Secret Service sniper shot dead the suspected gunman -- named as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks -- less than 30 seconds after he had fired eight shots.</p>

<p>"With respect to former president Trump, there's some question about whether or not it's a bullet or shrapnel that, you know, that hit his ear," FBI chief Wray said.</p>

<p>Two rally attendees were seriously injured and a 50-year-old Pennsylvania firefighter was shot dead.</p>

<p>Wray said Crooks "appears to have done a lot of searches of public figures, in general" but that there was no clear pattern to the research.</p>

<p>"A lot of the usual repositories of information have not yielded anything notable in terms of motive or ideology," he said.</p>

<p>"Starting somewhere around July 6 or so, he became very focused on former president Trump and this rally," the FBI chief said, and he registered that same day to attend the campaign event in Butler, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>"On July 6, he did a Google search for, quote, 'How far away was Oswald from Kennedy?'" he said, a reference to Kennedy's assassination by Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>"That obviously is significant in terms of his state of mind."</p>

<p>The FBI director said no evidence has emerged so far that Crooks had any accomplices or co-conspirators and he seems to have been a "loner."</p>

<p>Crooks was perched on the roof of a nearby building and opened fire on Trump with an AR-style assault rifle shortly after 6:00 pm, as the Republican White House candidate was addressing the rally in Butler.</p>

<p><strong>- Drone flight -</strong></p>

<p>US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned on Tuesday, a day after acknowledging the agency had failed in its mission to prevent the assassination attempt.</p>

<p>Wray said Crooks flew a drone over the rally area for around 11 minutes -- sometime between 3:50 pm and 4:00 pm -- on the day of the attack.</p>

<p>He said it was not flown directly over the stage but about 200 yards (meters) away.</p>

<p>The drone and its controller were recovered in the gunman's car along with two "relatively crude" explosive devices, Wray said.</p>

<p>Another explosive device was found in Crooks's residence.</p>

<p>Wray said the gunman purchased a ladder on the day of the shooting but appears not to have used it. Instead, he climbed onto the roof using some mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping.</p>

<p>Wray also said Crooks's AR-style gun had a collapsible stock which may explain why he was not seen by rally-goers or members of law enforcement with the weapon before the shooting.</p>

<p>He said Crooks visited the rally site on at least three occasions: about a week before the shooting, for about 70 minutes on the morning of the rally and again that afternoon.</p>

<p>He purchased 50 rounds of ammunition on the day of the attack and visited a shooting range the previous day.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump accused US Vice President Kamala Harris of being a "radical left lunatic" Wednesday, in his first rally since she became the de facto Democratic Party nominee in the White House race.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump launched a volley of attacks against US Vice President Kamala Harris Wednesday, calling her a "radical left lunatic" in his first rally since she became the de facto Democratic Party nominee for November's election.</p>

<p>In a speech claiming she was in favor of the "execution" of babies due to her stance on abortions, the former president and Republican nominee said: "She is a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country."</p>

<p>"We're not going to let that happen," he told the crowd in North Carolina.</p>

<p>Trump's speech comes as Harris, 59, hits the campaign trail armed with President Joe Biden's endorsement -- after his historic decision over the weekend not to seek reelection.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old Republican repeatedly attacked Biden over his age but has been forced to pivot as he has now become the oldest nominee in history.</p>

<p>Trump called Harris "the ultra liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe."</p>

<p>He claimed that she wanted "abortions in the eighth and ninth month of pregnancy" as well as "right up until birth and even after birth, the execution of a baby."</p>

<p>Saying Democratic Party bosses were behind Biden's decision to step down, he accused Harris of covering up Biden's "mental unfitness."</p>

<p>Earlier Wednesday, the White House denied it had covered up any possible decline in Biden's health prior to his decision to drop out of the election race.</p>

<p>Harris's candidacy has stirred enthusiasm among Democrats after weeks of turmoil over Biden, who came under pressure after a disastrous debate performance against Trump last month.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The man accused of trying to kill the author Salman Rushdie has been charged with terrorism for allegedly acting on behalf of Hezbollah, according to documents unsealed Wednesday.</p>

<p>Hadi Matar, a 26-year-old American of Lebanese descent who was already charged by the state of New York for the 2022 stabbing attack, has now been indicted by a grand jury on three counts that include attempting to provide material to support a foreign terrorist organization, said the indictment dated July 17 but not unsealed until now.</p>

<p>That organization is Lebanon's Iran-backed movement Hezbollah, the US Justice Department said.</p>

<p>In August 2022 Rushdie, now 77, lost his sight in his right eye after the attack by a knife-wielding assailant, who jumped on stage at an arts gathering in New York state. Rushdie was stabbed about 10 times.</p>

<p>The Indian-born author, a naturalized American based in New York, had faced death threats since his 1988 novel "The Satanic Verses" was declared blasphemous by Iran's supreme leader.</p>

<p>In 1989, that leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, issued a fatwa, or religious edict, calling on Muslims anywhere in the world to kill Rushdie.</p>

<p>Hezbollah endorsed the fatwa, the FBI said in a statement Wednesday.</p>

<p>"We allege that in attempting to murder Salman Rushdie in New York in 2022, Hadi Matar committed an act of terrorism in the name of Hezbollah, a designated terrorist organization aligned with the Iranian regime," Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a separate statement.</p>

<p>"The defendant attempted to carry out a fatwa endorsed by Hezbollah that called for the death of Salman Rushdie," said FBI Director Christopher Wray.</p>

<p>Between September 2020 and the summer of the attack Matar sought to provide material support to Hezbollah by trying to carry out the fatwa against Rushie, the Justice Department said.</p>

<p>The other two counts in the indictment charge Matar with engaging in an act of terrorism transcending national boundaries and providing material support to terrorists.</p>

<p>- Life after fatwa -</p>

<p>The award-winning author was stabbed multiple times in the neck and abdomen at the New York literary conference before attendees and guards subdued the assailant.</p>

<p>Matar has told the New York Post newspaper that he had only read two pages of Rushdie's novel but believed he had "attacked Islam."</p>

<p>Rushdie lived in seclusion in London for the first decade after the fatwa but for the past 20 years lived a relatively normal life in New York.</p>

<p>This year Rushdie published a memoir called "Knife" in which he recounted the near death experience.</p>

<p>In an interview with CBS's "60 Minutes" program in April, Rushdie recounted how one of the surgeons who saved his life had said: "First you were really unlucky and then you were really lucky."</p>

<p>"I said, 'What's the lucky part?' and he said, 'Well, the lucky part is that the man who attacked you had no idea how to kill a man with a knife,'" Rushdie said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris called on a rally of more than 6,000 Black women on Wednesday to help her revitalize the Democratic presidential campaign, ahead of her Republican rival Donald Trump's return to the campaign trail.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris called on a rally of more than 6,000 Black women on Wednesday to help her revitalize the Democratic presidential campaign, ahead of her Republican rival Donald Trump's return to the campaign trail.</p>

<p>Harris has emerged as the Democratic presidential candidate in the Nov. 5 election after President Joe Biden, 81, ended his re-election bid on Sunday in the face of intense opposition from fellow Democrats who questioned his ability to win or to serve for another four years were he to do so.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old vice president, the first Black woman and Asian American to serve as vice president -- who would also be a historic first as president if she prevails over former President Trump, 78 -- has shaken up a staid race and sparked new energy among Democrats.</p>

<p>That surge will not go unanswered on Wednesday, when Trump holds his first rally since Biden ended his campaign -- in the battleground state of North Carolina.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign has insisted it is prepared for Harris' candidacy, arguing she serves as a proxy for Biden on the economic and immigration policies that contributed to his sinking popularity with voters.</p>

<p>Harris spoke at an event in Indianapolis hosted by the Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, which was founded at Howard University, the historically Black college she attended. She hopes to tap sororities' multi-generational network of Black women -- who played an important role in Biden's 2020 victory -- to deliver strong voter turnout for Democrats again in November.</p>

<p>"I thank you. And now, in this moment, our nation needs your leadership once again," Harris said.</p>

<p>Harris and Trump are closely competitive, public opinion polls showed this week.</p>

<p>A Reuters/Ipsos poll completed on Tuesday showed Harris with a marginal two-percentage-point lead over Trump, 44% to 42%. A CNN poll conducted by SSRS showed Trump leading Harris, 49% to 46%. Both findings were within the polls' margins of error.</p>

<p>BIDEN TO SPEAK</p>

<p>Biden, who came back to Washington after isolating at his home in Delaware with COVID, will address the nation from the Oval Office on Wednesday night to explain his decision to drop out after a disastrous June debate with Trump raised questions about his ability to win the election, or to serve another four years if he succeeded.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Trump took the unusual step of speaking to reporters on a conference call to underscore his campaign's line of attack on the border, saying Harris was partially responsible for a record flow of migrants.</p>

<p>Biden put Harris in charge of working with countries in Central America to help stem the tide of migration, but she was not made responsible for border security.</p>

<p>"She's a radical left person, and this country doesn't want a radical left person to destroy it," Trump said on the call. "She wants open borders. She wants things that nobody wants."</p>

<p>Harris has not called for the removal of border controls.</p>

<p>Trump, coming off a triumphant week in which his party unified around his presidential bid after a failed assassination attempt two weekends ago, has had to watch as Biden's sudden departure from the race dramatically shifted the narrative and sparked a surge of attention toward Harris at his expense.</p>

<p>Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said in a memo made public on Wednesday that Democrats would aim to compete in the swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, opening up a map that in the final weeks of Biden's campaign had appeared to be more focused on the Midwest.</p>

<p>"This race is more fluid now - the vice president is well-known but less well-known than both Trump and President Biden, particularly among Dem-leaning constituencies," O'Malley Dillon wrote.</p>

<p>Democrats will formally nominate their new ticket at next month's convention in Chicago after an Aug. 7 virtual vote. Roy Cooper, North Carolina's Democratic governor, is considered to be on the short list to serve as Harris' running mate.</p>

<p>Harris and her campaign have worked at breakneck pace to consolidate support among Democrats in Congress and delegates across the country. Candidates who could have been potential rivals for the nomination have fallen in line and endorsed her.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign on Wednesday said it has raised $126 million since Sunday, with 64% of donors making their first contribution of the 2024 campaign.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity company that caused a global computer outage last week, on Wednesday said that the breakdown stemmed from a flaw in its test software.</p>

<p>In an incident report, the company said the glitch was pushed out to millions of Windows computers and that the company will change the way it handles such updates in the future.</p>

<p>"Due to a bug in the content validator, one of two (updates) passed validation despite containing problematic content data," said CrowdStrike.</p>

<p>CrowdStrike's Falcon software is used by businesses around the world to better identify and handle malware and security breaches.</p>

<p>The type of update that caused the crash, which is frequently deployed by the company, will from now on be sent out gradually, so that problems can be detected before they are released at scale.</p>

<p>"A full-blown rollout from a security vendor to every customer within minutes is very dangerous," Dave DeWalt, the former chief executive of cybersecurity company McAfee, told the Wall Street Journal.</p>

<p>CrowdStrike said on Monday that about 8.5 million devices were impacted by the outage, and warned customers that malicious actors were trying to take advantage of the situation.</p>

<p>A wide range of industries were hit by the outage, with users confronted with "blue screens of death" that made rebooting impossible.</p>

<p>The airline industry was hit most visibly by the crash, with US carrier Delta Airlines particularly affected.</p>

<p>The company said on Tuesday that it only expected a full return to normal on Thursday.</p>

<p>CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz has been summoned by the US Congress to explain the incident.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Nine months pregnant, Ola Al-Kurd could not wait to hold her baby and bring new life to Gaza during a war which has killed over 39,000 fellow Palestinians and razed much of the enclave.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nine months pregnant, Ola Al-Kurd could not wait to hold her baby and bring new life to Gaza during a war which has killed over 39,000 fellow Palestinians and razed much of the enclave.</p>

<p>That special moment never came.</p>

<p>An Israeli airstrike smashed into the family home in Al-Nuseirat in central Gaza on July 19, according to her father Adnan Al-Kurd. The blast threw Ola down several floors to her death in the house, whose inhabitants included women, children and the elderly, he said.</p>

<p>Somehow, her baby survived, as did her husband, who was hospitalised.</p>

<p>"It's a miracle that the fetus stayed alive inside of her when she was martyred (died)," Adnan Al-Kurd said, contemplating a photo of his daughter's graduation.</p>

<p>The explosion, like many others, killed several members of a single family, a daily tragedy across Gaza since Israel began its offensive in Gaza in response to a devastating cross-border attack by Palestinian Hamas militants on Oct. 7 last year.</p>

<p>Mediators from the United States, Qatar and Egypt have failed in multiple attempts to secure a ceasefire. So it is highly unlikely that Israeli airstrikes and shelling will end anytime soon.</p>

<p>"She wanted to hold her child and fill our home with his presence," Al-Kurd said. "She would say, 'Mom, hopefully, this will make up for the loss of my martyred brothers and bring life back to our home'."</p>

<p>Entirely against the odds, surgeons at Al Awda hospital in Nuseirat - where Ola was first taken after the strike - managed to deliver the newborn, Malek Yassin. He was then transferred to Al Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah, where an aunt touched the baby's face as he lay in an incubator.</p>

<p>"Thank God, this baby's life was saved and he is now alive and well," doctor Khalil Al-Dakran said at the hospital, where many medical facilities have been destroyed in over nine months of war.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Al-Kurd gazes at photos of his three late children killed in the Gaza war. He said baby Yassin is blond like his dead uncle Omar. "I go visit him everyday. He is a part of me," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Babies who survive frequent Israeli bombardment get no relief as the conflict inflicts more destruction in the heavily built-up, densely populated Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>"We are in fact facing very great difficulties in the nursery department," said Al-Dakran, due to a lack of sufficient medication and supplies and fears that the hospital generator could stop at any moment due to fuel shortages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hospitals across impoverished Gaza have been demolished or seriously damaged during the war, which began when Hamas-led fighters attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking over 250 hostages according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel responded with an air and ground offensive that has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, and levelled much of the coastal territory.</p>

<p>"What is the fault of this child to start his life under difficult and very bad circumstances, deprived of the most basic necessities of life?" said Dakran.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

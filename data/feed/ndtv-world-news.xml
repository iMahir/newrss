       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JD Vance, who has been named former US President Donald Trump's running mate, stirred a controversy after he said that that UK under Labour might be the first "truly Islamist" country with nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Vance said he had been discussing with a friend which country would be the first "truly Islamist country that will get a nuclear weapon".</p>

<p>"Maybe it's Iran, maybe Pakistan kind of counts, and then we sort of decided maybe it's actually the UK since Labour just took over," he said last week at a conference for UK Conservatives last week.</p>

<p>Britain's Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, meanwhile, played down Vance's comments, saying he had a history of making "fruity" remarks.</p>

<p>Britain would work with whoever won November's US presidential election, Angela Rayner said, adding that "I don't recognise that characterisation".</p>

<p>"We're interested in governing on behalf of Britain, and also working with our international allies," she said.</p>

<p>In one of his first interviews after being named the Vice Presidential pick, Vance also branded China the biggest threat to America, underscoring the likely hawkish stance of their administration toward Beijing if elected.</p>

<p>The Ohio Senator made the remarks in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity on Monday. When asked about the war in Ukraine, Vance said Trump would negotiate with Moscow and Kyiv to "bring this thing to a rapid close so America can focus on the real issue, which is China."</p>

<p>"That's the biggest threat to our country and we are completely distracted from it," he said</p>

<p>Vance, 39, was tapped by Trump days after a failed assassination attempt on the former president upended what had already been a chaotic presidential contest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The significant electricity consumption of these companies calls for ongoing discussions around sustainability and renewable energy adoption.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tech giants Google and Microsoft each consumed 24 TWh of electricity in 2023, surpassing the consumption of more than 100 countries, new research claims.</p>

<p>Analysis by Michael Thomas, shared on X, states that both Google and Microsoft used the same amount of energy as Azerbaijan, which has a GDP of $78.7 billion. In 2023, Google's revenue was $307.4 billion, and Microsoft's was $211.9 billion, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/google-and-microsoft-now-each-consume-more-power-than-some-fairly-big-countries"><em>Tech Radar </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This massive energy usage underscores the significant environmental impact of these companies but also highlights their potential to lead more sustainable initiatives.</p>

<p>For comparison, Iceland, Ghana, the Dominican Republic, and Tunisia each consumed 19 TWh, while Jordan consumed 20 TWh. Libya (25 TWh) and Slovakia (26 TWh) used slightly more power.</p>

<p>The comparison between entire countries and two single companies emphasizes the colossal energy demands of Big Tech. It also points to the environmental impacts of data centers that power cloud services and the new generation of artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>The significant electricity consumption of these companies calls for ongoing discussions around sustainability and renewable energy adoption. Both Google and Microsoft have pledged to be carbon-free or carbon-negative by the end of the decade and have significantly scaled up investments in cleaner energies and energy matching.</p>

<p>With market caps of $2.294 trillion and $3.372 trillion respectively, Google and Microsoft are currently the world's fourth and second-most valuable companies. Given the scale of their operations, comparable to entire nations, their actions in preventing and reversing environmental damage are closely watched.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Taking to his X handle, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday that he is moving the headquarters of both SpaceX and the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, to Texas]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taking to his X handle, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday that he is moving the headquarters of both SpaceX and the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, to Texas, citing several criticisms he has of California and doing business in San Francisco, Los Angeles Times reported.</p>

<p>Pointing to a new state law that bans teachers from telling families about student gender identity changes, Musk tweeted that he is moving the headquarters of SpaceX from Hawthorne to the company's launch test site in Texas, the Los Angeles Times reported.</p>

<p>The move would be a blow to Southern California, where SpaceX has helped to anchor a burgeoning space economy, the Los Angeles Times reported.</p>

<p>"This is the final straw," posted Musk shortly after noon. "Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas."</p>

<p>The law the SpaceX founder cited was signed by Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday after a contentious battle between conservative school boards concerned about parental rights and LGBTQ activists worried about vulnerable youths.</p>

<p>Shortly after his post about moving SpaceX, Musk posted that he would also move X, formerly known as Twitter, from San Francisco to Austin, saying that he has "had enough of dodging gangs of violent drug addicts just to get in and out of the building."</p>

<p>The announcement is the latest salvo in Musk's long-running feud with California and comes nearly three years after he announced the move of Tesla's headquarters to Austin from Palo Alto, citing the high cost of housing and long commutes for employees. The electric vehicle company maintains a manufacturing operation in Fremont.</p>

<p>It comes amid the highly charged presidential campaign during which the libertarian Musk has increasingly moved to the right. Musk was one of the first entrepreneurs to openly endorse Donald Trump as President ahead of the elections.</p>

<p>Musk also drew a comment from the other side of the political spectrum, with Democratic State Senior Scott Wiener, who represents San Francisco, posting that Musk hugely benefitted from California subsidies. "Will this be a fake temper tantrum move just like Tesla's fake "move" to Texas?"</p>

<p>Weiner added, "I'm not confident that whatever he's going to do has anything to do with a law that we passed to protect the safety of trans kids," he said. "He has a history of saying one thing and it not being true."</p>

       <description><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden is weighing proposals to reform the Supreme Court, US media reported Tuesday, including possible term limits and a new ethics code for the conservative-dominated bench.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden is weighing proposals to reform the Supreme Court, US media reported Tuesday, including possible term limits and a new ethics code for the conservative-dominated bench.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, has dealt several major blows to Democratic priorities in recent years -- most notably by repealing the nationwide right to abortion -- with Biden increasingly voicing disagreement.</p>

<p>This year the court significantly rolled back the power of federal agencies, while also partially ruling in early July in favor of ex-president Donald Trump's immunity claims.</p>

<p>Biden, seeking reelection in November against Trump, has previously resisted calls to overhaul or reform the court of nine lifetime-appointed justices, which includes three nominated by his Republican predecessor.</p>

<p>But that may be changing, according to several US media reports, which cited unnamed sources familiar with the planning.</p>

<p>It was unclear whether Biden would come out in support of the measures in the near future or in his second term if he wins the presidential election in November, the New York Times reported.</p>

<p>However, the measures Biden is reportedly considering -- including backing a constitutional amendment that would overturn the court's ruling on presidential immunity -- would require bipartisan congressional support that is almost certainly out of reach.</p>

<p>Amid the legal setbacks the Supreme Court has handed down to Democrats, it has also recently been engulfed in ethics scandals.</p>

<p>Conservative justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas refused to step aside on cases related to the 2020 election, even as flags linked to Trump's false election claims were discovered to be flown outside Alito's home, and Thomas's wife was part of Trump's effort to overturn the vote result.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump's former leading rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, offered full-throated endorsements of his candidacy at the party's convention on Tuesday, in a display of unity.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former rivals of Donald Trump, including Indian-Americans Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy, endorsed him at the Republican National Convention held in Milwaukee on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>Taking the stage during prime time, Nikki Haley stated that agreeing with Trump on every issue is not necessary for supporting him. "Take it from me: I haven't always agreed with President Trump. But we agree more often than not," she said.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Haley criticised Trump for his age and described his comments about Black people as 'disgusting'.</p>

<p>The former UN Ambassador and South Carolina governor, once a significant rival of Trump, surprised many by appearing at the Convention. She joined other endorsers after Trump survived an assassination attempt at a rally on Saturday.</p>

<p>Following her endorsement, Haley used the social media platform X to highlight what she sees as failures in the Biden-Harris administration. "If we have four more years of Biden... or even a single day of Harris... our country will be worse off. For the sake of our nation, we must choose Donald Trump," she wrote.</p>

<p>Haley faced criticism for her endorsement of Trump, with some users on social media expressing disapproval. "Congratulations on completely losing respect from both sides," one user commented. Another wrote, "You should be ashamed of yourself."</p>

<p>The 52-year-old also pointed out Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and contrasted it with what she described as inaction by Vladimir Putin during Trump's presidency.</p>

<p>Another former Trump rival, entrepreneur and politician Vivek Ramaswamy, addressed the Convention for the first time, stating, "Donald Trump is the president who will unite this country through action, not just words."</p>

<p>Ramaswamy also condemned the recent attack on Trump, which left the 78-year-old former president with a bandaged ear. The Convention marked Trump's first public appearance since the incident.</p>

<p>Ron DeSantis, conservative governor of Florida and another of Trump's challengers, also spoke at the convention, criticising President Joe Biden as unfit for the job due to his age.</p>

<p>Despite being the first former US president to be impeached twice, Trump received a loud ovation as he was officially announced as the Republican presidential candidate. He did not make any formal remarks but acknowledged and thanked his endorsers for their support.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Joe Biden faces pressure to withdraw from the presidential race due to concerns over his age, exacerbated by his poor performance in the first presidential debate against Donald Trump.</p>

<p>As Trump gains endorsements from former rivals, Biden is facing potential setbacks, including the possible loss of key labour endorsement from the Teamsters union. The recent assassination attempt on Trump has also added to the tension leading up to the November presidential elections.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A homeless black man, armed with two knives near a Republican Party Convention site in Wisconsin, was shot dead by police officers from Ohio on Tuesday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A homeless black man, armed with two knives near a Republican Party National Convention site in Wisconsin, was shot dead by police officers from Ohio on Tuesday.</p>

<p>According to the police, the man, identified by relatives as 43-year-old Samuel Sharpe, was armed with a knife in each hand. The situation escalated when Sharpe charged at an unarmed individual, prompting the officers to open fire. Two knives were recovered from the scene.</p>

<p>"Someone's life was in danger," Milwaukee police chief Jeffrey Norman said during a press conference. "These officers, who were not from this area, took it upon themselves to act and save someone's life today."</p>

<p>The incident occurred amidst heightened security in Milwaukee, with thousands of officers from various jurisdictions present to ensure the safety of the Republican National Convention, which started on Monday and is set to conclude on Thursday.</p>

<p>The shooting, however, has sparked outrage among Milwaukee residents, who questioned the necessity of out-of-state officers patrolling their neighbourhood, which is located over a kilometre away from the convention site. Many locals gathered at the scene, voicing their anger and planning a nighttime vigil to honour Sharpe.</p>

<p>"They came into our community and shot down our family right here at a public park," said Linda Sharpe, Samuel's cousin. "What are you doing in our city, shooting people down?"</p>

<p>Linda Sharpe described her cousin Samuel as a long-time resident of a tent encampment situated across the street from King Park, where the shooting took place. This encampment is a known fixture in the neighbourhood, which hosts several social service clinics and a shelter. Residents believe that Milwaukee police officers, familiar with the local homeless population, might have been able to de-escalate the situation more effectively.</p>

<p>Norman explained that a group of 13 Columbus officers, part of a bicycle patrol, were in their designated area when they noticed the altercation involving Sharpe. They approached the scene and repeatedly commanded Sharpe to drop his weapons, but he ignored their orders and moved towards the unarmed individual, prompting the officers to fire.</p>

<p>The Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Office has scheduled an autopsy for Wednesday and further investigation into the shooting is underway.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Conspiracy theories about the assassination attempt on Donald Trump received tens of millions of views on X, researchers said Tuesday, highlighting the potential for extreme falsehoods to go viral on the Elon Musk-owned platform.</p>

<p>The social media site, formerly named Twitter, was flooded with unsubstantiated claims soon after the shooting Saturday at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, which left one spectator dead and a bloodied Trump injured in the ear.</p>

<p>Those included unfounded assertions that the assassination attempt had been "staged" or an "inside job," while fingers were pointed at imaginary culprits such as Jews and the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad.</p>

<p>The conspiracy theories were viewed over 215 million times on X, the watchdog Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) said after analyzing a sample of 100 popular posts.</p>

<p>A majority of the posts did not carry a "Community Note," a crowd-sourced moderation tool that Musk has promoted as the way for users to add context to the tweets, CCDH added.</p>

<p>In the first 24 hours alone, unsubstantiated narratives around the incident amassed more than 100 million views on X, according to the nonprofit research group Institute for Strategic Dialogue.</p>

<p>X did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Internet hoaxers also falsely identified several people as the shooter -- including Italian sports journalist Marco Violi, anti-Trump protester Maxwell Yearick and comedian Sam Hyde, AFP's fact-checkers reported.</p>

<p>Federal investigators have identified the shooter, who was killed on the scene, as Thomas Matthew Crooks of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, several social media users voiced confusion as they scrambled to obtain accurate information in what appeared to be a sea of false or misleading posts, which rapidly gained traction.</p>

<p>The trend illustrates the ability of falsehoods to mutate into viral political discourse on tech platforms including X, which now offer fewer guardrails as they scale back content moderation.</p>

<p>Researchers say some clout-chasing accounts on the platform have a financial motive to post sensational falsehoods, as X's ad revenue-sharing program incentivizes extreme content designed to boost engagement.</p>

<p>"In the marketplace of disinformation -- which is effectively what a lot of social media platforms have now been reduced to, a marketplace for lies -- extreme content is your currency," said Imran Ahmed, chief executive and founder of CCDH.</p>

<p>"The algorithms take the most outlandish content and amplify it exponentially until the entire digital world is flooded with conspiracism, disinformation and hate."</p>

<p>Researchers have warned about a possible firehose of disinformation in the run up to the November election, which will take place in a deeply polarized political climate in the United States.</p>

<p>"Already, at an early stage in the US electoral cycle, we can see flashing warning signs that social media in the weeks and months ahead will be increasingly chaotic and rife with disinformation," Ahmed said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just days after a failed assassination bid against former US President Donald Trump, an armed man wearing a ski mask was arrested in the area where the Republican National Convention is being held, reports said.</p>

<p>The man was carrying a concealed AK-47 rifle in his tactical backpack, the Fox News reported. Officials also found a full magazine of ammunition inside the bag.</p>

<p>Prominent Republican politicians and officials are gathered at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee for the Republican convention this week.</p>

<p>"United States Capitol Police initially observed the suspect looking suspicious, wearing a ski mask and a large tactical backpack in the street," the CNN reported quoting Milwaukee Police Department.</p>

<p>In a separate incident, a man - who was wielding two knives near the convention - was shot dead by the cops.&nbsp;According to the police, the man, identified by relatives as 43-year-old Samuel Sharpe, was armed with a knife in each hand. The situation escalated when Sharpe charged at an unarmed individual, prompting the officers to open fire. Two knives were recovered from the scene.</p>

<p>This comes days after a 20-year-old man was gunned down for trying to assassinate the 78-year-old former president at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Trump survived with a nicked ear during his rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday after Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire at him. The attack left him with a bloodied face as the former president said the bullet pierced his "upper part of right ear".</p>

<p>Donald Trump won formal nomination Monday as the Republican presidential candidate and picked 39-year-old Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his running mate.</p>

<p>While Trump is increasingly confident of a shock return to the White House -- despite multiple legal problems and two impeachments during his first term -- President Joe Biden is reeling from weak polls and Democratic concerns over his health.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States had received intelligence from a human source about an Iranian plot to kill Donald Trump weeks before the assassination attempt against the former US president on Saturday, according to national security officials. This led to increased security measures for Trump.</p>

<p>Officials, however, said that there is no known connection between this Iranian plot and the 20-year-old who attempted to assassinate Trump on Saturday.</p>

<p>The US Secret Service and the Trump campaign were notified of the Iranian threat, and security was boosted as a result, as confirmed by a US national security official.</p>

<p>Trump and his former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, have faced threats from Tehran since the 2020 drone strike that killed Qassim Soleimani, the leader of Iran's Quds force, in Iraq.</p>

<p>Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for the US Secret Service, said that it and other agencies were "constantly receiving new potential threat information and taking action to adjust resources as needed." He added, "We cannot comment on any specific threat stream, other than to say that the Secret Service takes threats seriously and responds accordingly."</p>

<p>Adrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, said that US security officials had been "tracking Iranian threats against former Trump administration officials for years."</p>

<p>The Iranian mission at the United Nations dismissed the report as "unsubstantiated and malicious," adding that Trump "is a criminal who must be prosecuted and punished in a court of law."</p>

<p>Former President Donald Trump made his first public appearance at the Republican National Convention on Monday (local time) since surviving the assassination attempt on Saturday.</p>

<p>Wearing a white bandage on his right ear, Trump waved at supporters and received a standing ovation from the audience. He made no remarks during the convention and stood alongside his newly announced running mate, Senator JD Vance.</p>

<p>Trump was on stage at a campaign rally on Saturday when gunshots rang out and Secret Service agents stormed the stage. Hours after the shooting, Trump said that the bullet pierced the upper part of his right ear. One of the rally attendees was killed, while two more were critically injured in the shooting.</p>

<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. The case remains under investigation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Indian Americans and former presidential candidates Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy will address the Republican National Convention here.</p>

<p>Haley, the former governor of South Carolina and former US Ambassador to the United Nations, was a presidential candidate in the Republican primary and was the last one to suspend her campaign.</p>

<p>Millionaire entrepreneur-turned-politician Ramaswamy has seen a meteoric rise in the Republican party. He is now considered as one of the close confidant of the former president Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee.</p>

<p>This would be the first time that Ramaswamy would be speaking at the Republican National Convention, while Haley has addressed the RNC multiple times including in 2016, 2020.</p>

<p>Sources familiar with the RNC said that Ramaswamy is scheduled to speak first on Tuesday night in the 7:30-8:00 pm local time slot in the list of two other speakers. Haley has been placed third in the list of four speakers in the next slot of 8-8.30 pm local time.</p>

<p>The evening would conclude with remarks by Senator Marco Rubio and Lara Trump, the co-chair of the Republican National Committee.</p>

<p>Donald Trump is expected to make another appearance Tuesday night before and is expected to stay in the last one hour of the RNC events.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic Party Senator Bob Menendez, who headed the powerful US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has been convicted of acting as a "foreign agent" for Egypt, and of a slew of corruption charges.</p>

<p>After a trial that featured 13 gold bars and stacks of $480,000 in currency notes found in the New Jersey senator's home and a Mercedes Benz gifted to his wife, a jury gave the verdict on Tuesday at a federal court in New York.</p>

<p>Prosecutors said that Menendez had met with Egyptian intelligence officials and had tried to speed up millions of dollars of military aid to that country.</p>

<p>The conviction capped the 70-year-old senator's political career of 50 years, which saw the son of Cuban immigrants rise to leadership positions in the Senate where he has served for 18 years.</p>

<p>Chuck Schumer, the leader of the majority Democratic Party in the Senate demanded his immediate resignation, before his term ends on the last day of December.</p>

<p>Menendez is planning to run for re-election as an independent.</p>

<p>Protesting his innocence while leaving the courthouse, he said, "I've never been anything but a patriot of my country and for my country."</p>

<p>An appointee of President Joe Biden, the prosecutor, Damian Williams, said, "Now that the jury has convicted Bob Menendez, his years of selling his office to the highest bidder have finally come to an end."</p>

<p>Menendez was convicted on 16 charges that included wire fraud (using telecommunications for fraudulent activities), bribery, and extortion.</p>

<p>Two businessmen were also convicted of bribing him.</p>

<p>His second wife, Nadine Menendez, was charged in connection with the case but her trial has been delayed because she is undergoing treatment for cancer.</p>

<p>During Menendez's trial, lawyers tried to shift blame to his wife asserting that the gold bars found at their home were in her bedroom and were hers and that she had money problems that she hid from the senator while trying to amass assets.</p>

<p>But the prosecution countered that there were communications between them showing that he was in on the schemes.</p>

<p>In one melodramatic moment during the trial, Menendez's sister Caridad Gonzalez testified that as Cuban refugees it was tradition in the family to keep cash in their homes because of the insecurity they had faced.</p>

<p>One of the strange stories to emerge at the trial involved a businessman who bribed Menendez for getting a monopoly to certify as halal US beef exports to Egypt after the senator intervened on his behalf.</p>

<p>Menendez was also charged with using his power to try to get New Jersey prosecutors to scuttle an insurance fraud case against two businessmen, one of whom had admitted guilt on a bribery charge and said that he gave the Mercedes Benz to the senator's wife.</p>

<p>In another corruption case involving a member of Congress, Democratic Party Representative Henry Cuellar and his wife have been charged by the Justice Department in Texas with bribery and money laundering involving a Mexican bank and an Azerbaijan-controlled oil and gas company.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin has ordered an investigation after six foreign nationals were found dead at a hotel in downtown Bangkok.</p>

<p>Police have dismissed earlier reports that they were killed following a shooting.</p>

<p>Metropolitan Police Bureau Commissioner Thiti Saengsawang said the bodies of three men and three women were found in a single hotel room on Tuesday and the cause of the deaths has not been confirmed, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>He said initial investigations suggest that the incident may have been linked to poisoning, as suspicious substances were discovered in the hotel room and no signs of struggle were found at the scene.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Thavisin has ordered the investigation into the incident to "prevent any impact on the public".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Pentagon Press Secretary Pat Ryder made the remarks at a press conference in Washington on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"India is a strategic partner, and we look forward to continuing to develop that partnership," he told reporters in response to a question.</p>

<p>Responding to a question on Ukraine-Russia conflict, Ryder said, "When it comes to Ukraine and Russia's illegal occupation and invasion of Ukraine. Ultimately, at the end of the day, it's up to Ukraine to decide when they are ready to negotiate for peace." "Right now, our focus continues to be on working with Ukraine to provide them with what they need to defend their country and defend their sovereignty and take back territory.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden promised Black voters on Tuesday that he was "all in" to seek reelection on Nov. 5 and assailed Donald Trump's record as president, in his first political speech since his Republican rival's attempted assassination.</p>

<p>Biden was greeted by chants of "four more years" as he spoke to the NAACP's annual convention in Las Vegas, a major gathering of Black voters.</p>

<p>Biden said he was grateful that Trump was not seriously hurt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday but roundly criticized him on a variety of fronts including his handling of the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>"Let me say it again because Trump is lying like hell about it - Black unemployment hit a record low under the Biden-Harris administration," Biden said.</p>

<p>He scolded Trump for initially contending that former President Barack Obama was not an American citizen and for his reference to "Black jobs" at the Trump-Biden debate on June 27.</p>

<p>"I am all in," said Biden.</p>

<p>The attempt on Trump's life on Saturday prompted the Biden campaign to pull its television ads, call off verbal attacks on the former president and focus instead on a message of unity.</p>

<p>"Our politics got too heated," said Biden.</p>

<p>The campaign's strategy previously was to focus on tough criticism of Trump as a threat to U.S. democracy and to highlight his failure to admit his 2020 election loss and his felony convictions.</p>

<p>Now, it is trying to calibrate a less pugilistic message that still strikes a stark comparison between the two candidates.</p>

<p>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the oldest and largest U.S. civil rights organization, represents a key constituency for the Democratic Party. While Black voters turned out heavily for Biden in 2020, polls have shown waning support for him from the constituency in this election.</p>

<p>"People are concerned about the price of gas, price of bread, but they're also concerned with their growing knowledge around Project 2025," Derrick Johnson, the NAACP president, told Reuters on Monday, referring to a set of conservative policy proposals that have become a lighting rod for Trump critics.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Biden used the formal setting of the White House Oval Office to ask Americans to lower the political temperature, recommit themselves to resolving their differences peacefully. He said the Nov. 5 presidential election will be a "time of testing."</p>

<p>In an interview with NBC News, Biden said on Monday it was a mistake for him to use the term "bullseye" in reference to Trump during a recent donor campaign call.</p>

<p>The president postponed a trip to Texas on Monday, where he was expected to speak on the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act at the Lyndon B. Johnson presidential library.</p>

<p>White House officials hope the Trump assassination attempt will ease pressure on Biden to step aside as his Democratic Party's candidate in response to concerns about his mental acuity and stamina to govern for another four-year term.</p>

<p>At the end of his remarks in Las Vegas, Biden addressed the criticism that he is too old for the job.</p>

<p>"Hopefully today I've demonstrated a little bit of wisdom. Here's what I do know. I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. I know how to do this job. And I know the good Lord hasn't brought us this far to leave us now. We have more work to do," he said.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Biden is scheduled to speak to Latino leaders at the UnidosUS Annual Conference also in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Trump and Republicans are gathered in Milwaukee for the party's nominating convention that kicked off Monday with the selection of U.S. Senator J.D. Vance as Trump's running mate.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Six people including four Pakistanis were killed and nearly 30 wounded in a shooting near a Shiite mosque in the Omani capital Muscat, officials said Tuesday, a rare attack in the country that was claimed by Islamic State.</p>

<p>Monday's mosque attack came as Shiites this week mark Ashura, an annual day of mourning that commemorates the seventh-century death in battle of Imam Hussein, regarded by the branch as the rightful successor to the Prophet Mohammed.</p>

<p>"The Royal Oman Police have responded to a shooting incident that occurred in the vicinity of a mosque in the Al-Wadi Al-Kabir area" of the capital, a police statement said.</p>

<p>The three gunmen behind the attack were killed and police officers have "concluded the procedures for dealing with the shooting," it added.</p>

<p>The force gave a toll of six killed, including a police officer. It said 28 people "from various nationalities" were wounded, including rescuers and paramedics.</p>

<p>The Islamic State jihadist group claimed the attack, saying three of its fighters were behind the shootings that targeted "Shiites practising their annual rituals" on the occasion of the holy mourning period of Ashura.</p>

<p>The group's propaganda channel Aamaq said on its Telegram channels that IS fighters "opened fire with machine guns on Shiite" worshippers, before clashing with Omani security forces.</p>

<p>The foreign ministry in Islamabad said at least "four Pakistanis were martyred as a result of gunshots in the dastardly terrorist attack on the Ali bin Abi Talib mosque."</p>

<p>Another 30 Pakistanis were wounded, it added.</p>

<p>One Indian was killed and another was wounded, India's embassy in Oman said on social media platform X.</p>

<p>Footage verified by AFP shows people fleeing the Imam Ali Mosque, its minaret visible, as gunshots ring out.</p>

<p>A voice can be heard saying "oh God" and repeating "oh Hussein".</p>

<p>Speaking to AFP, Pakistan's ambassador to Oman Imran Ali said the Shiite mosque was mostly frequented by south Asian expatriates. Oman is home to at least 400,000 Pakistanis, he said.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Terrorist attack' -</strong></p>

<p>Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was "deeply saddened by the terrorist attack".</p>

<p>In a statement on X, he said: "Pakistan stands in solidarity with the Sultanate of Oman and offers full assistance in the investigation."</p>

<p>Iran's foreign ministry spokesman, Nasser Kanani, condemned the shooting as a "divisive" act.</p>

<p>Pakistan's ambassador said the attack started with gunfire from a building adjacent to the mosque as hundreds of people gathered for prayers.</p>

<p>The worshippers were held "hostage" by militants before "they were later freed by Omani forces", Ali told AFP.</p>

<p>He said there was little information on the perpetrators or their possible motive.</p>

<p>"Everyone is being tight-lipped about this," he said, adding that the attack created a "difficult situation".</p>

<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Ali toured hospitals that were treating the wounded.</p>

<p>In a video message on X, he urged Pakistanis in Oman to cooperate with the authorities and avoid the area around the mosque.</p>

<p>"Our officers are on standby for emergency blood donations in the embassy," he said, adding that a hotline has been set up to assist the wounded and their relatives.</p>

<p>The American embassy in Muscat issued a security alert following the shooting and cancelled all visa appointments for Tuesday.</p>

<p>"US citizens should remain vigilant, monitor local news and heed directions of local authorities," it posted on X.</p>

<p><strong>- Investigations underway -</strong></p>

<p>Police said "all necessary security measures and procedures have been taken to handle the situation" following the attack.</p>

<p>"The authorities are continuing to gather evidence and conduct investigations to uncover the circumstances surrounding the incident," police added on X.</p>

<p>The area remained cordoned off on Tuesday, with journalists unable to access the mosque, an AFP photographer reported.</p>

<p>Oman has a population of more than four million, of whom upwards of 40 percent are expat workers, mostly from south Asia, according to government figures.</p>

<p>Shiites make up a small minority of Oman's overwhelmingly Muslim population. Most Omanis follow the Sunni or Ibadi branches of the faith.</p>

<p>Several attacks on Shiite mosques have roiled the Gulf in recent years, but this was the first in Oman.</p>

<p>A 2015 suicide attack on a Shiite mosque in Kuwait killed at least 27 worshippers and wounded more than 200. It was claimed by the Sunni extremist Islamic State group.</p>

<p>The same year, Saudi Arabia saw two attacks on Shiite mosques in the space of a week, with at least 25 people killed. The attacks were again claimed by IS, which regards Shiites as heretics.</p>

<p>In 2005, a former teacher opened fire inside a government building in Muscat, killing two people and wounding several others, before shooting himself.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bus plummeted into a ravine in southern Peru Tuesday, killing at least 26 people, according to police in the Andean country plagued by deadly road accidents.</p>

<p>Another 14 people were injured in the early-morning crash, highway safety official Jhonny Valderrama told AFP, updating an earlier toll of 21 dead and 20 wounded.</p>

<p>The bus with more than 40 occupants was headed from Lima to the Andean region of Ayacucho when it veered off a cliff about 200 meters (656 feet) high.</p>

<p>Injured people, including the two co-drivers of the bus, were taken to hospitals as rescue teams worked to recover bodies from the wreckage in a hard-to-reach area.</p>

<p>Next-of-kin waited desperate for news outside the Mariscal Hospital in Ayacucho, where some of the injured were taken.</p>

<p>"We don't know if my brother is in the hospital or dead. All the roads are full of holes, the government does not do any maintenance," one of them, Juan Ayquipa, told RPP radio.</p>

<p>Accidents are frequent on Peru's often winding, mountainous roads due to speeding, poor road upkeep, a lack of traffic signs and lax enforcement of driving rules.</p>

<p>Last year, the country of 34 million people registered more than 3,100 deaths from more than 87,000 traffic accidents.</p>

<p>Seventeen people died in a similar bus crash on the same road in May.</p>

<p>"I would like to express my sincere condolences to the families who lost their loved ones," Transport Minister Raul Perez told reporters.</p>

<p>The cause of the latest accident has not been established.</p>

<p>Seventy percent of road accidents in Peru are due to human factors such as driver incompetence or fatigue, according to official data.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Secret Service increased security for Donald Trump weeks ago after authorities learned of an Iranian plot to kill him, although it was not linked to the recent attempt on his life, US media reported Tuesday.</p>

<p>CNN reported that US authorities received intelligence from a "human source" on a plan by Tehran targeting the former president, causing protection to be boosted for Trump. Other US outlets also reported the plot.</p>

<p>But it was not connected to the shooting at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in which gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire at Trump, leaving the Republican wounded and killing a rally attendee, they said.</p>

<p>The US National Security Council said it had been "tracking Iranian threats against former Trump administration officials for years" as Tehran sought revenge for the 2020 killing of Revolutionary Guards commander Qasem Soleimani.</p>

<p>"We consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority," spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said in a statement.</p>

<p>The investigation into the Trump shooting on Saturday "has not identified ties between the shooter and any accomplice or co-conspirator, foreign or domestic," she added.</p>

<p>Watson referred questions on "additional measures that have been implemented in recent weeks" to the Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security.</p>

<p>Top Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said they and other agencies were "constantly receiving new potential threat information and taking action to adjust resources as needed."</p>

<p>"We cannot comment on any specific threat stream other than to say that the Secret Service takes threats seriously and responds accordingly," Guglielmi added in a statement.</p>

<p>There was no immediate reaction from the Department of Homeland Security.</p>

<p>The report comes as the Secret Service faces intense scrutiny over the Butler shooting, with questions over how a gunman was able to open fire at Trump from an exposed rooftop some 150 meters (500 feet) away.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden has ordered an independent review of the agency's handling of the incident.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk on Tuesday said he will move the headquarters of SpaceX and X to Texas after a California law blocked schools from forcing teachers to notify parents about changes to a student's gender identity.</p>

<p>"This is the final straw," Musk said on X.</p>

<p>"Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas."</p>

<p>The multi-billionaire also said that he is transferring X from its art-deco headquarters in San Francisco to Austin, a threat he has made before but never saw to completion.</p>

<p>Musk has already moved Tesla's headquarters from Palo Alto in Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas.</p>

<p>"I did make it clear to Governor Newsom about a year ago that laws of this nature would force families and companies to leave California to protect their children," Musk wrote.</p>

<p>Musk has expressed deep disdain about the use of preferred pronouns, often mocking the practice on social media and dismissing it as part of a "woke" agenda that was dangerous for society.</p>

<p>Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday signed the bill after a contentious legislative process that pitted a handful of school boards fighting for parental rights against LGBTQ activists concerned about the welfare of vulnerable students.</p>

<p>The law reversed decisions in conservative school districts that ordered teachers to notify parents if a student changed their name or pronouns or requested to use facilities or participate in programs that didn't match their official gender.</p>

<p>Newsom, who is seen as a potential alternative to President Joe Biden as candidate for the White House, has often exchanged fire with conservatives over gender issues at state schools.</p>

<p>Last year, he signed a law that sets fines for school districts that ban textbooks portraying LGBTQ people and other marginalized groups.</p>

<p>The latest law came after Newsom fought bitterly with a conservative school board over its opposition to the study of gay rights figure Harvey Milk, a San Francisco public official who was assassinated.</p>

<p>Musk has previously sparred with Newsom, who is a former San Francisco mayor, during the deadliest stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when he challenged the decisions of city and state health officials.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military said on Friday it was carrying out fresh strikes against Hezbollah targets in south Lebanon, minutes after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the UN that operations against the Lebanese armed group will continue.</p>

<p>Israel's military "is currently striking terror targets belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist organisation in southern Lebanon," the military said in a statement.</p>

<p>The strikes came soon after Netanyahu vowed to continue targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

<p>"We will continue degrading Hezbollah until all our objectives are met," he told world leaders at the UN.</p>

<p>In a separate statement, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant also vowed to defeat Israel's "enemies near and far".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pope Francis said Friday that the Catholic Church must "seek forgiveness" over the "scourge" of child sexual abuse, during a visit to Belgium where the Church's dark past looms large.</p>

<p>In a speech before political and civil society leaders that opened his three-day visit to the country, Francis denounced the "tragic instances of child abuse" as a stain on the Church's legacy.</p>

<p>"It is our shame and our humiliation," Francis told the gathering at the Laeken Palace royal residency.</p>

<p>"The Church must be ashamed and must seek forgiveness," he said.</p>

<p>The 87-year-old pontiff is due to meet with a group of clerical sexual assault victims in Brussels in the afternoon, as part of a three-day stay in the European nation tarred by decades of scandals and cover-ups.</p>

<p>The meeting with around 15 victims, taking place at 6:30 pm (1630 GMT) at the Vatican's diplomatic mission, was being held with the "utmost discretion", according to the Belgian church.</p>

<p>It was arranged after a hard-hitting documentary last year put Belgium's abuse scandal back on the front pages, prompting many new victims to come forward.</p>

<p>In an open letter published by Le Soir newspaper this month, some demanded the pope address paedophilia and set up a process for financial reparations.</p>

<p>"Words alone are not enough. Concrete measures must also be taken," Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said in a preamble to the pope's speech.</p>

<p>The pontiff said the abuse scandal was "a scourge that the Church is addressing firmly and decisively by listening to and accompanying those who have been wounded, and by implementing a prevention programme throughout the world".</p>

<h3><strong>Forced adoptions</strong></h3>

<p>Francis has made combating sexual assault in the Church a main mission of his papacy, and insisted on a "zero tolerance" policy in the wake of wide-reaching abuse scandals around the world.</p>

<p>During his speech, Francis also said he was "saddened" to learn about a forced adoptions scandal in Belgium that saw institutions run by nuns give up the babies of thousands of underage girls and unmarried women.</p>

<p>"We see how the bitter fruit of wrongdoing and criminality was mixed in with what was unfortunately the prevailing view in all parts of society at that time," he said.</p>

<p>Belgium's HLN news site estimates that up to 30,000 children were taken from their mothers in Belgium between 1945 and the 1980s.</p>

<p>Bishops in Belgium apologised in 2023 and requested an independent investigation after fresh testimonies emerged from women and people claiming to have been "sold" by the Catholic Church to their adoptive family.</p>

<p>Child sexual abuse and forced adoptions have "badly damaged trust" between the Church and society, De Croo said.</p>

<p>In a sign of the work yet to be done, the program of an open-air mass concluding Francis's trip on Sunday had to be changed at the last minute after it emerged that the closing hymn was composed by a priest accused of sexual abuse.</p>

<p>The blunder prompted the head of the Belgian bishops' conference, Archbishop Luc Terlinden, to admit that the Church needed to get better at keeping a tab on cases and perpetrators.</p>

<p>"This represents a great challenge for us, but we must think about it seriously with the help of lawyers and psychologists," he told a local broadcaster. The composer, who died this month, reportedly settled a sexual abuse case in 2002.</p>

<h3><strong>On the wane</strong></h3>

<p>The Argentinian pope arrived in Belgium on Thursday evening after spending the day in neighbouring Luxembourg, where he made a plea for international diplomacy amid flaring conflicts across the globe.</p>

<p>He was welcomed by King Philippe and Queen Mathilde, who hosted him on Friday morning, and he will head on to meet with academics at the Catholic university of Leuven in Dutch-speaking Flanders -- whose 600th anniversary next year is the official reason for Francis's visit.</p>

<p>On Saturday, during what is his 46th trip abroad, Francis will meet the clergy at the vast Basilica of the Sacred Heart before holding discussions with students at Louvain-la-Neuve in French-speaking Wallonia, notably on climate issues.</p>

<p>The last papal visit to Brussels was in 1995, when John Paul II attended the beatification of Saint Damien, who dedicated his life to lepers.</p>

<p>Nearly 65 percent of Belgium's population is Christian, including 58 percent who are Catholic, according to figures from Louvain university.</p>

<p>But their numbers are on the wane, reflecting a decline across Europe.</p>

<p>During his weekly general audience, Francis said he hoped his visit could be "the opportunity for a new impetus of faith".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Iran on Friday that Israel will strike if it is hit first and warned that his country can reach any part of the cleric-run state as he vowed to fight on in Gaza.</p>

<p>"I have a message for the tyrants of Tehran. If you strike us, we will strike you," Netanyahu told the UN General Assembly.</p>

<p>"There is no place in Iran that the long arm of Israel cannot reach, and that's true of the entire Middle East."</p>

<p>Delegates, including from Lebanon and the Palestinian territories, exited the room as Netanyahu took the rostrum for his address amid a mix of cheers and angry yells.</p>

<p>"After I heard the lies and slanders leveled at my country by many of the speakers at this podium, I decided to come here and set the record straight," Netanyahu said at the start of his speech.</p>

<p>Ahead of his speech, protesters gathered outside Netanyahu's hotel in New York to demand an end to the violence in Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

<h3><strong>'Deadliest period'</strong></h3>

<p>On Wednesday, the United States, France and other allies unveiled a 21-day truce proposal, after President Joe Biden and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, met on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York.</p>

<p>The White House has said that the call for a ceasefire had been "coordinated" with Israel, but Netanyahu's office on Thursday said that the prime minister has not responded to the proposal.</p>

<p>"It is an American-French proposal, which the prime minister has not even responded to," said a statement from Netanyahu's office, adding that he had ordered the army "to continue the fighting with full force."</p>

<p>Hezbollah and Israel have been locked in a deadly exchange of cross-border fire since the Iran-backed group's Palestinian ally, Hamas, attacked Israel on October 7.</p>

<p>Netanyahu vowed Friday that "Hamas has got to go" and would have no role in the reconstruction of Gaza as he vowed to fight until "total victory."</p>

<p>Since Monday, Israel has shifted its focus from Gaza to its northern front with Lebanon where heavy bombing has killed 700 people and sparked an exodus of around 118,000 people.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said Israel would continue Lebanon strikes "until we meet our objectives."</p>

<p>The UN said Friday that a "catastrophic" intensification of Israeli attacks targeting Hezbollah militants had left Lebanon facing its "deadliest period... in a generation."</p>

<p>The Israeli strikes have brought the overall death count in Lebanon to more than 1,500 people killed in nearly a year of clashes, according to Lebanese authorities.</p>

<p>That count surpasses the 1,200 mostly civilians killed during the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, which also killed around 160 people in Israel, most of them soldiers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"As long as Hezbollah chooses the path of war, Israel has no choice, and Israel has every right to remove this threat and return our citizens to their home safe," Netanyahu told the UN General Assembly, adding that operations against the militant group will "continue until we meet our objectives."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkey on Friday handed 865 years in prison to a man behind the construction of a building which collapsed during a powerful 2023 earthquake, killing 96, state media said.</p>

<p>The 14-storey apartment block in the southern Turkish city of Adana was destroyed by a massive 7.8-magnitude quake in February 2023 that killed more than 53,500 people in Turkey and nearly 6,000 in neighbouring Syria. Only one of the building's residents survived.</p>

<p>Built in 1975, the building's collapse immediately aroused suspicions as Adana, located less than 200 kilometres (about 120 miles) from the earthquake's epicentre, was largely spared from the violent tremors.</p>

<p>The man in the dock, Hasan Alpargun, was convicted on Friday of "having caused the death and injury of more than one person with possible intent", according to the official Anadolu news agency.</p>

<p>Alpargun is reported to have fled to Turkish-backed Northern Cyprus on the day of the quake, before turning himself over to police a week later.</p>

<p>During the trial experts pointed to serious deficiencies in the construction of the building's support columns, as well as the quality of concrete used.</p>

<p>Alpargun defended himself by stating that the construction was approved by the authorities.</p>

<p>More than 260 people involved in the construction of buildings that collapsed during the February 2023 earthquake were arrested in the aftermath, some while trying to flee Turkey.</p>

<p>The trials of several of these entrepreneurs have opened this year.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A UK judge on Friday jailed two climate activists who threw soup at Vincent van Gogh's "Sunflowers" at London's National Gallery in 2022 for terms of two years and 20 months respectively.</p>

<p>Just Stop Oil protesters Phoebe Plummer, 23, and Anna Holland, 22, were convicted at London's Southwark Crown Court of criminal damage in July.</p>

<p>Greenpeace UK's co-executive director, Will McCallum, called the sentence "a draconian and disproportionate punishment for a protest that caused minor damage to a picture frame".</p>

<p>Plummer and Holland had pleaded not guilty over the incident in October 2022.</p>

<p>Sentencing the pair, Judge Christopher Hehir said the painting could have been "seriously damaged or even destroyed".</p>

<p>"Soup might have seeped through the glass. You couldn't have cared less if the painting was damaged or not," he added.</p>

<p>"You had no right to do what you did to 'Sunflowers'."</p>

<p>The gallery, located in Trafalgar Square, said the protesters caused "minor damage to the frame" but the painting itself was protected by a screen and was unharmed.</p>

<p>Holland, who received the 20-month term, and Plummer, who was jailed for two years, also glued themselves to the gallery wall during their protest.</p>

<h3><strong>'What matters most?'</strong></h3>

<p>"What is worth more -- art or life?" Plummer had shouted.</p>

<p>"It's another grim milestone in the ongoing crackdown on peaceful protest waged by the last government," Greenpeace UK's McCallum said.</p>

<p>"Protest is by its nature inconvenient and occasionally messy. These defendants do not deserve to spend years behind bars for standing up for a liveable planet."</p>

<p>Just Stop Oil wants an end to the extraction and burning of fossil fuels like oil, coal and gas, because the greenhouse gas emissions they create are "driving us towards climate collapse... (that) spells disaster for human societies globally".</p>

<p>It has staged a number of high-profile stunts in recent years to draw attention to their plea to "end fossil fuels before they end us".</p>

<p>The group has targeted the Wimbledon tennis tournament and British Open golf tournament, as well as art galleries and museums and a performance of "Les Miserables".</p>

<p>Five activists, including the climate group's founder, were given between four and five years in jail in June for conspiring to plan protests that blocked the M25 orbital motorway around London.</p>

<p>Just Stop Oil says climate change poses an existential crisis for humanity and that its direct tactics are justified.</p>

<p>In July 2022, Just Stop Oil protesters glued themselves to John Constable's pastoral masterpiece "The Hay Wain", also in the National Gallery.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British actress Maggie Smith, an award winning Shakespearian actress and double Oscar winner who later appeared in the Harry Potter films, has died aged 89, the BBC reported on Friday.</p>

<p>One of the few actors to win the treble of an Oscar (two), Emmy (four), and Tony, Smith's long career started on the stage in the 1950s.</p>

<p>But for many younger fans in the 21st century, she was best-known as Professor McGonagall in all seven "Harry Potter" movies, and the Dowager Countess in the hit TV series and movie spin-offs of "Downton Abbey," a role that seemed tailor-made for an actress known for purse-lipped asides and malicious cracks.</p>

<p>Her first Academy Award nomination was for her turn playing Desdemona opposite Laurence Olivier's "Othello" in 1965, before winning the Oscar for her role as an Edinburgh schoolmistress in 1969's ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie."</p>

<p>She won her second Oscar for her supporting role in the 1978 comedy ""California Suite," a performance that prompted co-star Michael Caine to say: ""Maggie didn't just steal the film, she committed grand larceny."</p>

<p>Other critically acclaimed roles included Lady Bracknell in Wilde's ""The Importance of Being Earnest" on the West End stage, a 92-year-old bitterly fighting senility in Edward Albee's play ""Three Tall Women," and her part in 2001 black comedy movie "Gosford Park."</p>

<p>In 1990 Smith was knighted by Queen Elizabeth and became a Dame.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Russian drone attack Friday on Ukraine's port town of Izmail killed three, while a strike on a police office in the central city of Krivyi Rig killed one, officials said.</p>

<p>Two elderly women and a 73-year-old man were killed in Izmail, a strategic port on the River Danube, and 11 were wounded including one child, Odesa regional governor Oleg Kiper said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Private and apartment buildings, outbuildings, buildings and cars were damaged," he wrote, adding that several fires broke out but were quickly extinguished.</p>

<p>While far from the front, the southwestern city of Izmail and nearby areas are often targeted by Russian forces trying to disrupt port infrastructure crucial for Ukraine's shipping.</p>

<p>Romania's defence ministry said it scrambled four jets after detecting the approaching drones, adding that one drone might have entered its airspace for "less than three minutes".</p>

<p>"According to the data available at the moment, there was no reported impact zone on national territory," it said.</p>

<p>On Friday morning in the central city of Krivyi Rig, a missile attack on a police office killed one woman and wounded five, regional governor Sergiy Lysak said.</p>

<p>A missile gutted a police district headquarters in the city and "a woman's body was found under the rubble of the administrative building", Lysak said, with search operations still ongoing.</p>

<p>The strike caused damage to 23 private houses and three multi-storey blocks of flats and an educational facility, the governor said,</p>

<p>An overnight missile attack also struck the central-eastern city of Dnipro, damaging an "industrial facility" but without causing injuries, Lysak said.</p>

<p>Russia on Friday claimed the capture of another village in the eastern Donetsk region, Marynivka, as it advances towards the strategic city of Pokrovsk.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's "youngest knife murderers" were on Friday sentenced to a minimum of eight-and-a-half years' detention for killing a stranger in a machete attack when they were aged just 12.</p>

<p>The sentence was ordered as a nationwide ban on "zombie" style knives and machetes with blades of over 20 centimetres (eight inches) came into force this week to curb a wave of horrifying killings by young people.</p>

<p>The two boys, who are now aged 13 and cannot be identified legally because they are under 18, killed Shawn Seesahai, 19, in a park in Wolverhampton, central England, last November.</p>

<p>They were described in court as "the youngest knife murderers" and are also believed to be the youngest convicted of murder in Britain since 1993, when 11-year-old, Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, were found guilty of killing a toddler, James Bulger.</p>

<p>Sentencing the pair, judge Amanda Tipples told them: "What you did is horrific and shocking. When you killed Shawn he was 19, starting out in his adult life with everything to live for.</p>

<p>"His parents have lost their son. His sister has lost her brother."</p>

<p>The court heard that the victim was not known to the pair but that they set upon him after he asked them to move from a bench.</p>

<p>Relatives of Seesahai, who was born in the British Overseas Territory of Anguilla in the Caribbean, described his murder as unexpected, senseless and committed "for no reason at all".</p>

<p>Due to their age, the boys will not be jailed but held in secure accommodation. Once they are deemed fit for release they will be monitored for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>There is mounting public concern about knife crime. In July, three girls aged six, seven and nine were killed in Southport, northwest England, in a mass stabbing that shocked the country.</p>

<p>Official figures lay bare the scale of the problem.</p>

<p>In London alone, the number of knife or sharp instrument offences recorded by the police rose to more than 15,016 in 2023/24 -- from 12,786 in previous year.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer this month launched an initiative to stop young people getting involved in knife crime, which he called a "national crisis".</p>

<p>He has enlisted the support of actor Idris Elba, who is pushing for government intervention to reverse drastic funding cuts to youth services as a way to end violence.</p>

<p>Even as the ban on "zombie" style weapons came into force on Monday a 15-year-old boy died hours earlier after being stabbed in London.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan's defence ministry said on Friday that it has spotted Chinese Navy aircraft carrier "Liaoning" in the Pacific Ocean for the past seven days.</p>

<p>Liaoning and a few accompanying Chinese Navy vessels were spotted sailing and conducting aircraft landing drills in the waters about 280 to 1,020 km (174 to 634 miles) southwest of Japan's Okinotori island, the ministry said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Soundarya Balasubramani, a two-time author and co-founder of Greencard Inc, recently claimed that she was assaulted on the street in broad daylight in London. Ms Balasubramani shared her horrifying experience a few days back on Instagram. She said that the incident took place on September 18, when she was walking the streets of London to find a co-working space. At around 2 in the afternoon, a tall man approached her and asked for money. However, when she refused, the man punched her in the face, she claimed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"For a few seconds I was completely disoriented, unable to understand what the f**k just happened," Ms Balasubramani said in the video. "I look down and all I see in my hands and shirt and on the road is just blood. There's just blood dripping from my nose so fast, I mean I've never seen so much blood before," she continued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I immediately dropped to my knees because I was feeling faint," Ms Balasubramani shared. She also went on to say that when she looked back, the man was still standing there and smiling at her. Within the next few minutes, a bunch of people surrounded her, including first responders, police and the public. She rushed to the hospital, where she waited for 8 hours for a doctor to see her, she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The entire time I just had one thought: Please don't let this take away my eyesight," Ms Balasubramani recalled. She claimed that after the incident, she couldn't open her eyes at all the entire day. "I was so scared for my eyes," she said. After the CT scan, the doctors told her that she had several fractures in her nose, however, her eyes seemed fine for now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Balasubramani said she was relieved to know that the incident didn't take away her eyesight. However, she added that after the incident she decided to return back to India.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In another post, Ms Balasubramani said that the police caught the attacker the next day. "Apparently he had also attacked two other people before me. Fortunately, he's now detained and will soon be tried in court!" she wrote in the caption.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shigeru Ishiba, the newly elected Liberal Democratic Party leader poised to become Japan's new prime minister, often appears in photos with a furrowed brow, but his expression immediately clears when he talks about one of his true loves - plastic models.</p>

<p>His office is stacked ceiling-high with books on politics and history, but the 67-year-old is often referred to in Japanese media as an "otaku", or someone obsessive about the mundane. In his case, trains, plastic miniature models, and ramen noodles.</p>

<p>"It's like bringing a dream to reality," Ishiba said of the process of making plastic models in a TV interview during his brief stint as defence minister in 2007-2008.</p>

<p>He insists that the plastic figurines and models he adores and which fill the nooks and crannies of his office are also instrumental to his diplomacy.</p>

<p>He showed a plastic model of a United States P3 patrol plane when he met a U.S. ambassador and stayed up all night assembling a Russian aircraft carrier when the Russian Minister of Defense visited Japan, according to an interview in 2017.</p>

<p>"Whenever an American ambassador, minister, or fleet commander comes to Japan, I find out what ship he was on and leave that (plastic model) with him. Then he would say, 'That's the ship I was on,' and it would make him really happy," he said in a separate interview with Abema Times.</p>

<p>Ishiba's passion also extends to trains - the full-size versions - which he has gushed about on his Instagram account.</p>

<p>He claims to have taken a sleeper train between Tokyo and his constituency in Tottori in western Japan more than 1,000 times.</p>

<p>"The super express! Their shining interior...and unprecedented style..." he said as he reminisced about the first time he got on the Hikari bullet train in a separate video on Instagram. "The excitement I had will never fade. It was wonderful."</p>

<p>Now tasked with quelling public anger over rising living costs and a scandal-plagued party, while navigating security tensions in East Asia, Ishiba may not have much time for another organisation he leads - the "Ramen Parliamentary Group" set up by more than 50 LDP members in 2022.</p>

<p>In a recent video on his YouTube channel, Ishiba mused about the percentage of imported ingredients that make ramen and spoke at length about how noodles made with imported and home-grown wheat tastes different.</p>

<p>He was a big fan of Chicken Ramen before moving on to Nissin Foods' Demae Iccho. He remembers eating Demae Iccho around the time he was studying for his high school entrance exams.</p>

<p>"These instant noodles and cup noodles, it just overlaps with key moments in my life," Ishiba said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Around 60 women have now come forward to allege they were sexually abused by former Harrods owner Mohamed Al-Fayed, lawyers representing them said on Friday.</p>

<p>A BBC documentary last week aired claims by women that Fayed, who died last year aged 94, raped and sexually abused them during his ownership of the luxury department store.</p>

<p>The accusations make the Egyptian billionaire the latest high-profile figure to join a list of rich and powerful men, such as Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, disgraced by sexual abuse allegations.</p>

<p>"The response has simply been enormous," the lawyers said in a statement.</p>

<p>"We can confirm that we now represent 60 survivors as part of our claim, with more to come."</p>

<p>The legal team said that since going public following the television expose, they had been contacted by people from all over the world.</p>

<p>"Our claim is becoming increasingly global in scope... We expected that anywhere Mohamed Al-Fayed went, abuse would follow," the statement read.</p>

<p>"Sadly this has proven to be true.</p>

<p>"We are now in possession of credible evidence of abuse at other Al-Fayed properties and businesses, including Fulham Football Club."</p>

<p>British prosecutors have said they twice received evidence against Fayed.</p>

<h3><strong>Pattern of abuse</strong></h3>

<p>In 2008, Fayed was accused of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) reviewed evidence in 2009.</p>

<p>In 2013, he was accused of raping a woman, a claim investigated in 2015.</p>

<p>In both instances, the CPS, which decides on prosecutions in England and Wales, said there was no "realistic prospect of conviction" and did not bring charges against the Harrods chairman.</p>

<p>The lawyers said they would continue to respond to inquiries from potential victims or witnesses and called for an "independent and transparent process to evaluate and adjudicate these claims".</p>

<p>The women they represented, they said, had "lost all faith in Harrods and their processes".</p>

<p>Harrods' managing director, Michael Ward, said this week his former boss presided over a "toxic culture of secrecy, intimidation, fear of repercussion and sexual misconduct".</p>

<p>But he said he had not been "aware of his criminality and abuse" and expressed his "personal horror at the revelations".</p>

<p>Fayed's accusers say the assaults took place in his apartments in London and his properties in Paris, including the Ritz hotel.</p>

<p>Allegations include a repeated pattern of women who underwent a selection process for positions close to Fayed.</p>

<p>Once selected, they were subjected to an "invasive" gynaecological examination, the results of which were shared with Fayed.</p>

<p>The women said that when they tried to complain about their abuse, were threatened by senior security staff, demoted and subject to false allegations until they had "no choice" but to leave Harrods.</p>

<p>Fayed sold Harrods to the investment arm of Qatar's sovereign wealth fund for a reported £1.5 billion ($2.2 billion).</p>

<p>He also owned Fulham Football Club.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Afghanistan's embassy in London closed on Friday after Taliban authorities cut ties with diplomatic missions set up by the previous government in Kabul and fired its UK staff.</p>

<p>An AFP reporter saw a notice hung on the gate to the consular section reading: "The embassy of the Republic of Afghanistan is closed."</p>

<p>No one answered the door but the country's flag was still flying.</p>

<p>Afghan ambassador to the UK Zalmai Rassoul announced on social media earlier this month that the embassy would close "at the official request of the host country" on September 27.</p>

<p>The UK Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) denied that it was behind the closure.</p>

<p>"This decision was not made by the UK government," a spokesperson said. "The State of Afghanistan decided to close the Afghan Embassy in London and dismiss its staff.</p>

<p>"We continue to support the people of Afghanistan and provide humanitarian assistance to those most in need."</p>

<p>The FCDO has not indicated whether a new Afghan ambassador would be accredited in London.</p>

<p>The UK does not recognise the Taliban government as legitimate and does not have formal diplomatic relations with the country.</p>

<p>But in line with the United States and the European Union, London acknowledges that there is "no alternative to engaging pragmatically with the current administration of Afghanistan".</p>

<p>The UK mission to Afghanistan is currently based in Doha.</p>

<p>The Afghan embassy's consular section in London closed on September 20, according to its website.</p>

<p>On Friday, Rassoul reposted an X post in which the German ambassador to the UK said it was a "pleasure" to work with his Afghan counterpart over the years and condemned the "appalling situation for women and girls under the Taliban".</p>

<p>Over the past three years, the Taliban has imposed an austere interpretation of Islam and progressively driven women out of public spaces.</p>

<p>Despite the Taliban's return to power in August 2021, embassies continued to operate with diplomatic staff loyal to the previous foreign-backed government.</p>

<p>At the end of July, the Taliban foreign affairs ministry said it "bears no responsibility" for credentials including passports and visas issued by missions out of step with Kabul's new rulers.</p>

<p>These include Afghan embassies in France, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Canada and Australia.</p>

<p>The Taliban government has said Afghans living abroad should deal instead with missions affiliated with the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan -- its self-styled name for the country since taking over.</p>

<p>The authorities have not been officially recognised by any country, but Pakistan, China and Russia are hosting Afghan embassies working on order from the Taliban government.</p>

<p>Diplomats at the UK embassy have reportedly been advised to leave the UK or apply for political asylum, according to the BBC.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States has returned to Iran more than 1,000 clay tablets dating from the Achaemenid-era, official media said, reporting the sixth such handover of its kind.</p>

<p>Iran's official IRNA news agency said Thursday evening that the tablets, 1,100 in all, were returned with President Masoud Pezeshkian who had attended the United Nations General Assembly in New York.</p>

<p>Found at the ruins of Persepolis, the capital of the Persian Achaemenid Empire which ruled from the 6th to 4th centuries BC in southern Iran, the repatriated tablets reflect how the ancient society was organised and its economy managed.</p>

<p>The tablets constitute records of "the rituals and the way of life of our ancestors", said Ali Darabi, vice-minister of cultural heritage, cited by IRNA.</p>

<p>The tablets were returned to Iran by the University of Chicago's Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures, West Asia &amp; North Africa, formerly known as the Oriental Institute.</p>

<p>A large portion of the tablets were returned in three batches between 1948 and 2004 before the rest were blocked by legal action until 2018.</p>

<p>More than 3,500 tablets were repatriated in September, 2023.</p>

<p>"The American side undertook to return the rest," Darabi said, cited by Iran's ISNA news agency.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 30-year-old factory worker in Thailand collapsed and died a day after her manager allegedly refused her sick leave request. According to the <em>Bangkok Post</em>, the woman, identified only as May, was an employee at an electronics plant in the Samut Prakan province in Thailand. The 30-year-old had first taken leave with a medical certificate from September 5 to September 9, after she was diagnosed with an inflamed large intestine. She spent four days at the hospital while receiving treatment for her condition. &nbsp;</p>

<p>After being discharged, Ms May took two more days of sick leave as she was not feeling better, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2867201/worker-dies-after-boss-allegedly-refused-her-sick-leave" rel="noindex, nofollow">outlet </a>reported. On September 12, she asked her manager for another day of sick leave, saying her condition had deteriorated further. However, her manager refused her sick leave, saying that she had to come to work and submit another medical certificate since she had already taken many sick days off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Worried about losing her job, the 30-year-old went to work on September 13 despite still feeling very ill. However, she collapsed after working for just 20 minutes, her friend claimed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms May was rushed to the hospital and sent immediately for emergency surgery, per <em>Bangkok Post</em>. But unfortunately, she was pronounced dead from necrotising enterocolitis on the evening of the following day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms May's employer, Delta Electronics Thailand, announced her death on its Facebook page and offered condolences. "We are deeply saddened by the loss of our colleague. Our thoughts and heartfelt condolences go out to her family and loved ones during this difficult time," the company said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"At this moment, we are still in the process of establishing the facts surrounding her passing and have initiated a thorough investigation.

<p>Notably, the incident comes amid a nationwide debate over workplace pressure after an Ernst and Young worker allegedly died of "overwork". Anna Sebastian, who worked at EY's Pune office for around four months, died in July. Earlier this month, her mother Anita Augustine wrote to EY India Chairman Rajiv Memani and flagged the "glorification" of overwork at the consulting firm. Her father claimed that the 26-year-old raised concerns over work pressure with her seniors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The trial of a man who drugged his wife to have her raped by dozens of strangers for almost a decade has ignited a quiet discussion around masculinity in France.</p>

<p>During court hearings, Dominique Pelicot, 71, has admitted to administering sedatives to his wife to rape her while unconscious and inviting strangers into their home to join in the abuse from 2011 to 2020.</p>

<p>The trial, which began in early September, has horrified people in France, particularly because Pelicot's 50 co-defendants include seemingly normal men with families and ordinary jobs.</p>

<p>His then wife, 71-year-old Gisele Pelicot, has become an overnight feminist icon by refusing to be ashamed and demanding the trial be open to the public to raise awareness about the use of drugs to commit sexual abuse.</p>

<p>Thousands of people, including some men, took to the streets in mid-September to support her and demand an end to "rape culture".</p>

<p>Several high-profile men have also publicly suggested it is in fact masculinity that is on trial and urged their peers to help stem the violence.</p>

<p>"Let's stop viewing women's bodies as objects at our disposal," read a text signed by more than 170 men and published in the left-leaning Liberation newspaper on Saturday.</p>

<p>"Let's stop thinking there exists a certain male nature that justifies our behaviour," it read.</p>

<p>"Let's stop perpetuating the boy's club and protecting our male peers."</p>

<p>French-Rwandan writer and rapper Gael Faye and French humourist Guillaume Meurice were among those to sign the so-called roadmap to "end masculine domination".</p>

<h3><strong>'Everyday men'</strong></h3>

<p>The petition's author -- therapist and activist Morgan N. Lucas -- said it was necessary to stop ignoring systemic violence, alluding to the hashtag #notallmen.</p>

<p>"The Pelicot case has proved that male violence is not about monsters but men -- everyday men," he wrote.</p>

<p>"All men, without exception, benefit from a system that dominates women. And since we are all the problem, we can all be part of the solution."</p>

<p>During a protest in the central city of Clermont-Ferrand on September 14, agricultural worker Stephane Boufferet said he hoped Gisele Pelicot would find justice.</p>

<p>"When I read the story, I was disgusted, even disgusted to be a man," the 26-year-old said.</p>

<p>Political journalist Karim Rissouli said a day earlier on Instagram that he felt "sick to the stomach as a man" after filming a programme about the trials.</p>

<p>French singer Renaud, 72, said last week he hoped the public nature of the trial would "finally force this patriarchal society, and us men, to take action over violence against women and children".</p>

<p>The co-defendants on trial in Avignon until December are aged 26 to 74.</p>

<p>Apart from Pelicot, they include 49 men accused of raping or attempting to rape his wife, and another who has admitted to sedating his own spouse so that he and Pelicot could sexually assault her.</p>

<p>The defendants include a fireman, a nurse and a journalist.</p>

<p>Many have said they believed they were taking part in the sexual fantasy of a couple.</p>

<p>But in hearings in recent days, several have reluctantly admitted that Gisele Pelicot had not given her consent.</p>

<h3><strong>'Men are not interested'</strong></h3>

<p>Ivan Jablonka, a social historian who has written about masculinity, said the trial was historic, including because of the sheer number of defendants.</p>

<p>"It's a reminder, if one were necessary, that rapes are committed by our neighbours, our colleagues, our relatives in our homes," he said.</p>

<p>The case has also called into question certain "patterns of masculinity", such as "moral collusion" between men.</p>

<p>But Jablonka was not overly optimistic.</p>

<p>"There is growing awareness but I think it is limited to a very small minority" of men, he said.</p>

<p>"In the street, in discussions, on social media -- everywhere really -- I still see a lot of indifference, contempt and silence. Complicit silence.</p>

<p>"Overall men are not interested."</p>

<p>He said there were still a "massive" number of gender-based crimes and much work remained to be done.</p>

<p>The author recalled touring with a 2019 book on how men could contribute to gender justice, whose English translation is entitled "A History of Masculinity".</p>

<p>"I'd say 90 percent of my audience were women," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel will continue to discuss ceasefire proposals for Lebanon in the days ahead, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday, as Washington warned that further escalation would only make it harder for civilians on both sides to return home.</p>

<p>Israel's foreign minister on Thursday rejected global calls for a ceasefire with the Iran-backed Hezbollah group and pressed ahead with airstrikes that have killed hundreds in Lebanon and heightened fears of a regional war.</p>

<p>An Israeli strike on Friday killed nine members of a family, including four children, in the Lebanese border town of Shebaa, mayor Mohammad Saab told Reuters. Israeli attacks have killed more than 600 people in Lebanon since Monday, the health ministry says.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it had fired rockets into Israel on Friday at Kiryat Ata near the city of Haifa some 30 km (20 miles) from the border, and the city of Tiberias, declaring the attacks a response to Israel strikes on villages, cities and civilians.</p>

<p>Though Israeli air defences have shot down many of Hezbollah's rockets, limiting the damage they've done, the group's attacks have shut down normal life across much of northern Israel as more areas fall into its crosshairs.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it had intercepted four unmanned aircraft that crossed from Lebanese territory into the maritime space off the coast of Rosh Hanikra at the Lebanese border.</p>

<p>The conflict between Israeli forces and the heavily armed Hezbollah is their worst in more than 18 years and part of the regional spillover of the Gaza war.</p>

<p>The United States and France proposed an immediate 21-day truce on Wednesday, and said negotiations continued, including on the sidelines of a United Nations meeting in New York.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said on Friday that Israeli teams had meetings to discuss the U.S. ceasefire proposals on Thursday and would continue discussions in the days ahead, adding that he appreciated the U.S. efforts.</p>

<p>"Our teams met (Sept. 26) to discuss the U.S. initiative and how we can advance the shared goal of returning people safely to their homes. We will continue those discussions in the coming days," he said in a statement.</p>

<p>On Thursday, after Netanyahu left for New York where he is attending the United Nations General Assembly, his office issued a statement saying the prime minister had ordered Israeli troops to continue fighting with full force in Lebanon.</p>

<p>His statement made no reference to the comments of Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who on Thursday rejected ceasefire proposals, or other Israeli politicians who have echoed that position, saying only that there had been "a lot of misreporting around the U.S.-led ceasefire initiative".</p>

<h3><strong>Blinken Stresses Importance Of Ceasefire</strong></h3>

<p>Israel says its campaign aims to secure the return home of tens of thousands of Israelis who have been forced to evacuate areas near the Lebanese border over the last year of hostilities with Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Hezbollah began firing at Israel on Oct. 8 as the Gaza war began, declaring solidarity with the Palestinians. Hezbollah has said it will only cease fire when Israel's Gaza offensive ends.</p>

<p>In Lebanon, more than 90,000 people have been reported as newly displaced this week, according to the U.N. International Organisation for Migration (IOM), adding to more than 111,000 already uprooted by the conflict.</p>

<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Israel on Thursday that further escalation to the conflict will only make it harder for civilians to return home on both sides of the border, the State Department said.</p>

<p>"The Secretary discussed the importance of reaching an agreement on the 21 day ceasefire across the Israel-Lebanon border," the State Department said in a statement referring to talks between Blinken and Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer.</p>

<p>"He underscored that further escalation of the conflict will only make that objective (of civilian return) more difficult."</p>

<p>The State Department added that Blinken also discussed efforts to reach a ceasefire in Gaza and steps that Israel needs to take to improve delivery of humanitarian assistance in the enclave where nearly the entire 2.3 million population is displaced and faces a hunger crisis.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan's next prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, says he reads three books a day and would rather do that than mingle with the ruling party colleagues who picked him as their new leader today</p>

<p>The 67-year-old's successful leadership bid after four failed attempts puts the self-professed lone wolf at the helm of a Liberal Democratic Party that has ruled Japan for most of the past seven decades.</p>

<p>Ishiba takes over with the party in crisis, having seen its public support ebb away over the past two years with revelations of links to a church branded a cult by critics and a scandal over unrecorded donations.</p>

<p>A former defence minister who entered parliament in 1986 after a short banking career, Ishiba was sidelined by previous premiers including outgoing Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, becoming instead a dissenting voice in the party.</p>

<p>He has rebelled on policies including the increased use of nuclear energy and has criticised his party for not allowing married couples to use separate surnames.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>"I have undoubtedly hurt many people's feelings, caused unpleasant experiences and made many suffer. I sincerely apologise for all of my shortcomings," he told LDP lawmakers who gathered at party headquarters for the election, before his narrow triumph over hard-line nationalist Sanae Takaichi.</p>

<p>Launching his campaign at a Shinto shrine in rural Tottori prefecture, where his father was governor and where Ishiba began his political career at the height of Japan's fast growing bubble economy, he told supporters this was his "final battle".</p>

<p>Ishiba, who has also served as agriculture minister, promised to move some ministries and government agencies out of Tokyo to help revive Japan's moribund regions. He has also proposed establishing an agency to oversee the construction of emergency shelters across disaster-prone Japan.</p>

<h2><strong>FRICTION</strong></h2>

<p>Ishiba's outspoken views, including calls for Kishida to step down, have earned him enemies in the LDP.</p>

<p>That enmity, which also stems from a four-year defection to an opposition group in 1993, made it difficult for Ishiba to win the 20 nominations he needed from fellow lawmakers to qualify as a candidate in the election on Friday.</p>

<p>His lack of popularity among lawmakers means that Ishiba has had to rely on the support he has nurtured among rank-and-file members over his four decades in politics.</p>

<p>He has stayed in the public eye during his time away from government with media appearances, social media posts and on YouTube, where he muses on topics ranging from Japan's falling birthrate to ramen noodles.</p>

<p>He also pokes fun at himself, including his sometimes-awkward manner and hobbies including plastic models of ships and military aircraft, some of which he displays on the bookshelves that line his parliamentary office in Tokyo.</p>

<h3><strong>US DIPLOMACY</strong></h3>

<p>Seen as an LDP intellectual heavyweight and expert on national security policy, he advocates for a more assertive Japan that can reduce its reliance on longtime ally, the U.S., for its defence.</p>

<p>That position, analysts say, could complicate relations with Washington.</p>

<p>During the LDP leadership campaign, he called for Japan to lead the creation of an "Asian NATO", an idea quickly rejected by Washington as too hasty.</p>

<p>In Okinawa where most of the U.S. troops in Japan are concentrated, he said he would seek greater oversight of the bases they use. He also wants Washington to give Japan a say in how it would use nuclear weapons in Asia.</p>

<p>In an interview with Reuters, Ishiba also criticised the U.S. political backlash to Nippon Steel's bid for U.S. Steel, saying it unfairly cast Japan as a national security risk. Kishida has avoided making comments on the issue ahead of the U.S. presidential election.</p>

<h3><strong>POLICY SHIFTS</strong></h3>

<p>Ishiba has, however, softened some policy positions that have put him at odds with party colleagues, most notably saying he would keep some reactors operating in Japan, despite his past opposition to nuclear power and support for renewable energy sources.</p>

<p>A fiscal conservative who has promised to respect the independence of the Bank of Japan to set monetary policy, he has more recently said it is unclear whether conditions were right for a fresh hike in interest rates.</p>

<p>"Politicians don't need to be best friends, as long as their policies and political positions match," Ishiba said in a video posted on YouTube this week.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A mother of three in the US state of Atlanta has been sentenced to life in prison without parole for killing two of her sons by "placing them in an oven and turning it on", according to a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://lawandcrime.com/crime/it-was-friday-the-13th-mother-who-killed-her-2-toddler-boys-by-placing-them-in-an-oven-and-turning-it-on-will-spend-the-rest-of-her-life-in-prison/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Law &amp; Crime</em>.</a> Lamora Williams, 24, was convicted of the death of Ja'Karter Penn, 1, and Ke'Yaunte Penn, 2, who were killed roughly an hour apart. Ms Willimas has been convicted of 14 counts against her and will serve an additional 35 years in prison on top of the life sentence.</p>

<p>The incident transpired in 2017 when Ms Willimas called emergency services to report she had found her sons dead in the home after leaving them with a caregiver. "When I came in, the stove was laying on my son, on my youngest son's head, and my other son was laid out on the floor with his brains laid out on the floor," she told the 911 dispatchers.</p>

<p>"Can you please help me? Like, can you please tell me, like, I don't want to get locked up because this is not my fault. I had just came home from work," she added.</p>

<p>Around the same time, the children's father, Jameel Penn also called 911 and reported the incident stating he had received a video call from his wife.</p>

<p>“I just received a call from my child's mother that…my…two dead babies, my sons are dead in an apartment. She video-called me and I seen it. I really think they are dead.”</p>

<p>After police officers arrived on the scene, they discovered the toddler and the baby, reporting they both had burn marks. However, a medical examiner disagreed with the preliminary findings, stating that their heads were likely placed inside a tipped-over oven. The autopsy report added that the two boys suffered "thermal changes" due to "dry heat and changes from prolonged exposure to heat".</p>

<p>"It would require an extensive amount of time to get to this degree," it added.</p>

<h3><strong>Williams indicted</strong></h3>

<p>According to the arrest warrant issued by the Atlanta Police Department, sometime between midnight on October 12, 2017, and 11 pm the next day, Ms Williams "knowingly and intentionally" placed her two little children in the oven and turned it on.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ms Williams maintained her innocence by pleading not guilty. According to Ms Williams' mother, Brenda, her daughter struggled with mental health issues and she needed to be placed on suicide watch while in jail.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scrim, the scruffy white terrier mix who captured New Orleans' heart earlier this year with his escapades, is on the run again after a dramatic escape Friday morning. The notorious canine managed to jump 13 feet from a second-floor window at his owner's home, leaving rescuers scrambling.</p>

<p>Michelle Cheramie, owner of Zeus' Rescues, an animal rescue shelter, explained in a post on Instagram, “He chewed through the screen of an open window and escaped. Surveillance footage shows him leaping from the window to the ground before running off.”</p>

<p>Surveillance footage shows him landing in the yard, barking briefly, and bolting through the fence to vanish down the street.</p>

<p>“He's wearing a black collar, was recently shaved, and is extremely fast,” Ms Cheramie told <a href="https://www.nola.com/news/scrim-mid-citys-runaway-dog-escapes/article_4ef52bc0-a430-11ef-aa09-0fee607d4048.html#tncms-source=featured-2 " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">Nola News</a>. “We've put up flyers and are going door-to-door in Carrollton, where he was last seen.”<br />
<br />
Scrim, originally adopted from Zeus' Rescues, made headlines last month after fleeing his adoptive home, sparking a six-month search involving tranquilliser darts, net guns, and countless social media alerts. He was finally caught in October, thin and injured, and was treated at Metairie Small Animal Hospital.<br />
<br />
On Friday morning, Scrim stunned his new caretakers by escaping again. “I shut every window except one in my daughter's room. Scrim found it,” Ms Cheramie admitted. “He's clever and determined – there's nothing I haven't already blamed myself for.”<br />
<br />
Equipped with a GPS collar that later ran out of battery, Scrim was last seen in the Carrollton neighbourhood. "He was spotted on Spruce Street between Joliet and Dante," Ms Cheramie wrote. Flyers and door-to-door searches are underway as volunteers rally to locate the determined dog.<br />
<br />
Recent sightings have placed Scrim near Blue Cypress Books late Friday night and close to Tchoupitoulas Street by Children's Hospital on Saturday morning. The team is urging Mid-City residents to remain vigilant and report any sightings.<br />
<br />
Social media is abuzz once again with “Scrim sightings,” and Ms Cheramie has asked anyone who sees the dog to call her at (504) 231-7865.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
“We just want him back safely,” Ms Cheramie said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Famed Australian broadcaster and former Wallabies coach Alan Jones was charged Monday with a string of alleged historical sex crimes, police said, after an investigation into the conservative radio shock jock.</p>

<p>The 83-year-old is a household name across Australia and for years held immense sway through his top-rating radio talk show.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a colourful career he has also coached the national men's rugby team, been a speechwriter for an Australian prime minister and taught at one of the country's most prestigious schools.</p>

<p>Detectives from a dedicated child abuse squad arrested Jones on Monday while executing a search warrant at his luxury Sydney Harbour apartment.</p>

<p>He has been charged with 24 offences against eight alleged victims spanning between 2001 and 2019, New South Wales Police said.</p>

<p>This included 11 counts of aggravated indecent assault against people that had been employed by Jones.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jones has strenuously denied prior allegations of indecent assault which surfaced in the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper late last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We will allege that the accused knew some of them personally. Some of them professionally," state crime commander Michael Fitzgerald told reporters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The youngest victim was 17 years old at the time of the alleged offending, Fitzgerald said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I wish to commend the victims and their bravery in coming forward.</p>

<p>"They are fully aware, as are the investigators, that the hard work is just beginning."</p>

<p>Whether as a sports coach, aspiring politician or radio heavyweight, Jones has spent decades in the public eye.</p>

<p>He rose to fame while coaching the Australian rugby side in the 1980s, leading the Wallabies to a rare "grand slam" over England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland.</p>

<p>His feats as a coach and administrator earned him a place in Australia's sports hall of fame, where he was inducted in 1989.</p>

<h3><strong>'Powerful, divisive'</strong></h3>

<p>But it was Jones' subsequent career as a radio talkback host that cemented his influence in Australian public life.</p>

<p>At the height of his powers politicians from both sides would scramble to stay friendly with right-leaning Jones and his hit radio show.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Over 36 years, Alan Jones became one of the most powerful, divisive and socially destructive voices the Australian media has ever produced," academic Denis Muller wrote in 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An Australian tribunal found that in 2005 Jones had incited hatred of Lebanese Australians, fuelling racially charged riots in Sydney.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An animal shelter in New Hampshire is struggling to manage an unprecedented surge in mice after a man handed over what he initially claimed to be "150 mice" last week. The reality, however, was much more intimidating.</p>

<p>“When he first arrived, he said he had 150 mice,” Lisa Dennison, the executive director of the New Hampshire Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NHSPCA), told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/17/us/new-hampshire-man-surrenders-1000-mice/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">CNN</a>. It soon emerged that the man had not 150 mice, but 150 containers filled with them.</p>

<p>The sheer volume of rodents, combined with their rapid reproduction, has turned into a huge challenge for both the man and the shelter. “The breeding of the mice has just created this enormous problem for him,” Dennison added.</p>

<p>The man brought three large plastic tubs with 73 mice to the shelter on November 11, saying he was unable to cope with their growing population. Over the week, NHSPCA staff visited his home multiple times, transporting van loads of mice to the shelter. The total count now nears 1,000.</p>

<p>According to the shelter, the conditions in which the mice were kept were deplorable. They were living in filthy plastic tubs that hadn't been cleaned in a long time, NHSPCA said. “We have never seen anything like this. And the longer we wait to get all of the mice out of their terrible living conditions, the greater the likelihood is that the numbers will continue to grow. With a gestation period of just around 20 days, mice can reproduce at an alarming rate,” said Savannah Alcero, Director of Animal and Veterinary Services at the NHSPCA.</p>

<p>At the shelter, efforts are underway to manage the influx. “We were separating the males and females. And now we have many females on pregnancy watch because they breed rapidly,” Dennison said.</p>

<p>While 18 mice have already been adopted, many others have been sent to regional welfare organisations. Among the adopters is Elisha Murray, who decided to take home four female mice. “We've always had small rodents as pets — rats, mice, hamsters, the whole nine — so I just figured I could help out. We have the whole setup, everything I need at home already,” she was quoted as saying by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-hampshire-shelter-mice-453194952194094f71ddfcab3294eb66" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">AP</a>.</p>

<p>Dennison, surrounded by containers stacked with mice, has appealed to the public to step forward and help. “Help these mice find wonderful new homes. They are great fun,” Dennison said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New York man has been charged with murder following the death of his father at a luxury hotel in Ireland. Irish authorities charged 30-year-old Henry McGowan with the murder of his father, 60-year-old John McGowan after John was found dead at the five-star Ballyfin Demesne hotel in County Laois on November 12, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/courts/2024/11/14/henry-mcgowan-30-charged-with-murder-of-his-father-after-fatal-assault-at-ballyfin-demesne-hotel/" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>The Irish Times</em></a>, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly21l2l0lvo" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>BBC</em></a>, and RTE News. &nbsp;</p>

<p>John McGowan sustained severe injuries during an assault in the hotel's leisure centre and was later pronounced dead, the outlets reported. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Local police, known as Gardai in Ireland, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/new-york-man-charged-murder-father-luxury-irish-hotel-8745967" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>PEOPLE </em></a>they responded to the hotel around 8 pm and discovered the 60-year-old man dead. A 30-year-old man was subsequently arrested at a Garda station in the Eastern Region. &nbsp;</p>

<p>While the Gardai did not release the names of those involved, they confirmed the incident remains under investigation. The Garda Technical Bureau and the Office of the State Pathologist are assisting with the case. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“He did everything within his power to bring his son Henry, who suffers from a severe mental illness, the help he so desperately needs,” the heartbroken family said in a statement to the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>

<p>“The family requests privacy at this difficult time and will not be commenting further.”</p>

<p>Henry McGowan, who has a Brooklyn, New York address, appeared in Portlaoise District Court on November 15. His lawyer, Barry Fitzgerald, stated that McGowan has significant mental health challenges and requested a psychiatric evaluation while he remains in custody at Cloverhill Prison. Judge Andrew Cody approved the request. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Henry McGowan's next court appearance is scheduled for November 18. &nbsp;<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jake Paul marked his victory over boxing legend Mike Tyson with a grand celebration in Dallas. Hosted alongside his betting company, Betr, and Passes, the event unfolded in a $9-million mansion, offering an evening of luxury, entertainment and star-studded appearances, according to <a href="http://https://pagesix.com/2024/11/17/celebrity-news/inside-jake-pauls-mike-tyson-fight-afterparty/?_gl=1*16i56h4*_ga*MTk3MzU1OTA1OS4xNzI1MzQ3NjI2*_ga_0DZ7LHF5PZ*MTczMTg5MzUwNC43My4wLjE3MzE4OTM1MDQuNjAuMC4w" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">Page Six</a>.</p>

<p>The party began with guests checking in to receive wristbands to access the venue. Inside, the spacious foyer featured abundant seating and a well-stocked bar serving canned cocktails.</p>

<p>Outdoors, DJ E-V took charge of the music, spinning popular hip-hop and EDM tracks from artists such as Drake, Kanye West, Sexyy Red, BossMan Dlow and others. There was also a larger-than-life robot that entertained attendees, dancing the night away.</p>

<p>An open bar overlooking the pool served premium beverages, including El Tequileno Platinum Tequila, Fix Alkaline Vodka, Eight Beer and BeatBox drinks. The food included a selection of fried chicken sliders, beef sliders, tater tots and El Gallo chicken wings.</p>

<p>Jake Paul, 27, reached the venue with his girlfriend, Jutta Leerdam, his brother Logan Paul, and his golden retriever, Thor. He wore multicoloured shorts paired with a blue-and-white shirt. According to Page Six, inside the mansion, a fan presented Paul with a Taschen book titled, ‘Greatest of All Time. A Tribute to Muhammad Ali.'</p>

<p>The guest list included former NFL player Dez Bryant, model Amber Rose, Bachelorette alum Tyler Cameron and former NBA player Al Harrington. Other attendees included Betr's boxer Derek Sullivan, rapper 1900 Rugrat, Haliey Welch — who recently launched the viral ‘Talk Tuah' podcast — and Myles O'Neal, son of Shaquille O'Neal.</p>

<p>During the evening, the music transitioned to R&amp;B classics by artists such as Brandy and Tevin Campbell, adding a soulful vibe to the celebration.</p>

<p>Paul's afterparty came just a day after his victory over 58-year-old Tyson in a boxing match at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The event attracted over 65 million viewers globally. Charlize Theron, Joe Jonas and Shaquille O'Neal were present to watch the bout, which is available for streaming on Netflix.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid reports that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is in a coma, Iran's Supreme Leader on Sunday posted a picture of himself meeting an Iranian ambassador.</p>

<p>Multiple media reports recently claimed that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/iran-supreme-leaders-hebrew-x-account-suspended-last-post-was-6889056" target="_blank">Khamenei</a>, 85, was in a coma and that he had nominated his 55-year-old son, Mojtaba Khamenei, as his successor in a secret meeting. The reports came after The New York Times in October said that Khamenei was "seriously ill."</p>

<p>In the picture posted on Khamenei's X account, he was seen talking to Iran's Ambassador to Lebanon Mojtaba Amani in his office.</p>

<p>"Ayatollah Khamenei, the leader of the Islamic Revolution, met and talked with Mr Mojtaba Amani, the veteran ambassador of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Lebanon, at noon today, on the sidelines of his daily meetings," he wrote in Persian.</p>

<p>Amani was among nearly 3,000 people who were injured when pagers and walkie-talkies used by the Iran-backed Hezbollah group exploded in Lebanon in September. At least 39 people were also killed in the attack, which <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/netanyahu-praises-israels-strikes-iran-warns-against-exaggeration-6886758" target="_blank">Iran and Hezbollah blamed on Israel</a>.</p>

<p>He said Israel "won't last long" as he backed the Palestinian and Lebanese movements against Israel in his rare sermon on October 5.</p>

<p>Addressing tens of thousands of supporters at a mosque in Tehran, Khamenei justified its missile strikes on Israel as a "public service".</p>

<p>Holding a gun while speaking, the Iran leader declared that Israel would not prevail against <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hamas-says-ready-for-ceasefire-urges-trump-to-pressure-israel-7029137" target="_blank">Hamas</a> or Hezbollah.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump's pick for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has been pictured sharing a McDonald's meal with his future boss, days after they promised to "make America healthy again."</p>

<p>Kennedy flew with Trump aboard his plane to an Ultimate Fighting Championship bout in New York on Saturday along with Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Donald Jr., the Republican's eldest son.</p>

<p>The four men are shown seated in front of trays of McDonald's food in a photo posted online by Donald Jr. on Sunday which he jokingly captioned: "Make America Healthy Again starts TOMORROW."</p>

<p>Trump and Kennedy, a scion of the famous Democratic political family, campaigned together ahead of the presidential election on November 5 promising to tackle processed food among other priorities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Announcing Kennedy's nomination on Thursday, Trump said that "for too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies."</p>

<p>Social media commentators noted that Kennedy appeared the least enthusiastic of the diners as he gingerly held an opened burger box, with fries and a bottle of Coca-Cola in front of him.</p>

<p>The 70-year-old, a conspiracy theorist and anti-vaccine campaigner, has long argued that the United States needs to curb its obesity epidemic by reducing the high levels of sugar, fat and high-additive processed food in the national diet.</p>

<p>In a podcast posted last week, he was scathing about Trump's diet, saying "the stuff that he eats is really bad."</p>

<p>"Campaign food is always bad, but the food that goes onto (Trump's) airplane is just poison," he told the Joe Polish podcast. "You don't have a choice, you're either given KFC or Big Macs."</p>

<p>Trump has never made a secret of his love of fast food and Diet Coke, even briefly stopping to work at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania during his campaign in October.</p>

<p>"I love salt!" he told workers there.</p>

<p>Kennedy will need confirmation by the Senate to take up his job as health secretary, with some senior Republicans voicing concerns about his suitability for the position.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The couple stated that a report to law enforcement had falsely claimed their pets were malnourished and abandoned.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Tennessee police officer is accused of fatally shooting seven dogs during an animal welfare check while their owners were out to dinner. He was later arrested.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Connor Brackin, a former McNairy County Sheriff's deputy, responded to a welfare check at a Bethel Springs home on November 4 following a report about the dogs, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2024/11/15/sheriffs-deputy-fired-after-allegedly-killing-7-dogs-during-animal-welfare-check/" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>Atlanta News First</em></a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Authorities allege that upon arrival, Brackin fired a rifle at the animals without justification. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The dogs' owners, Kevin Dismuke and his wife, had gone out for dinner and returned to find three of their pets dead inside the house and four more killed outside, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.fox13memphis.com/news/homeowner-grieving-after-dogs-allegedly-killed-by-mcnairy-co-deputy/article_420b5da8-a11a-11ef-a60d-3bdb114b91d5.html" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>Fox 13 Memphis</em></a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"To step out of your car with a .223 caliber rifle and shoot through my damn house," Dismuke told the outlet, expressing disbelief and devastation. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The couple stated that a report to law enforcement had falsely claimed their pets were malnourished and abandoned. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"I don't know where they came up with the idea that they were malnourished or abandoned," Mr Dismuke said. "Why he pulled up and done what he done, that's something I don't have an answer for. I'll never have an answer for it." &nbsp;</p>

<p>A warrant was issued for Brackin on Tuesday, and he surrendered to authorities on Wednesday before being released on bond. &nbsp;</p>

<p>At the time of the incident, Brackin had been with the sheriff's office for less than a month. He was subsequently dismissed from his position and charged with seven counts of aggravated cruelty to animals and eight counts of reckless endangerment. &nbsp;<br />

       <description><![CDATA[The UK police investigating the murder of 24-year-old Harshita Brella, whose body was recovered from a car boot in east London.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK police investigating the murder of 24-year-old Harshita Brella, whose body was recovered from a car boot in east London, have launched a manhunt for her Indian-origin husband who they suspect fled the country after killing his wife earlier this month.</p>

<p>In an updated statement from the Northamptonshire Police on Sunday, Chief Inspector Paul Cash said more than 60 detectives were working on the case as the force released an image of Pankaj Lamba, the accused husband, in an appeal for information.</p>

<p>"Our inquiries lead us to suspect that Harshita was murdered in Northamptonshire earlier this month by her husband Pankaj Lamba," Cash said.</p>

<p>"We suspect Lamba transported Harshita's body from Northamptonshire to Ilford by car. We believe he has now fled the country… More than 60 detectives are working on the case and are continuing to follow numerous lines of inquiry, including house to house, property searches, CCTV (cameras) and ANPR (automatic number plate recognition). We are, of course, continuing to appeal for any information that will help us piece together exactly what happened as we work to get justice for Harshita," he added.</p>

<p>Earlier, the Northamptonshire Police had named the woman found dead in the boot of a car in London as Harshita Brella as they launched a murder inquiry over the weekend.</p>

<p>The force said it had received a call on Wednesday regarding concerns for Brella's welfare and officers were deployed to her home address at Skegness Walk in Corby, Northamptonshire.</p>

<p>After getting no answer, the police launched a missing person investigation and fast-track enquiries were made that led to the discovery of the victim's body inside the boot of a vehicle on Brisbane Road in the Ilford area of east London in the early hours of Thursday. A post-mortem was conducted at Leicester Royal Infirmary on Friday.</p>

<p>"First of all, I want to express my heartfelt condolences to everyone who loved Harshita Brella," said Detective Chief Inspector Johnny Campbell, senior investigating officer from the East Midlands Special Operations Major Crime Unit (EMSOU).</p>

<p>"She was a young woman in her early 20s with her whole life ahead of her and it is absolutely tragic that her life has been cut short in this way. Detectives from EMSOU and the Northamptonshire Police are working around the clock to establish the circumstances behind her death, including the exact location and timeframe in which it took place," he said.</p>

<p>Investigators believe Brella was killed in a "targeted incident" as they appealed to anyone who may have information about the incident to come forward.</p>

<p>"Although we believe Harshita was attacked by someone known to her, we are keeping an open mind, and would appeal to anyone who knew her to contact us with any relevant information they may have. If you saw anything suspicious in the past week or have any information, no matter how small, please contact us. We would always rather receive well-meaning information that turns out to be nothing as opposed to not receiving it all," he said.</p>

<p>The police said officers were satisfied there was no wider risk to the public as a result of this incident.</p>

<p>However, extra patrols will be taking place in Corby in the coming days for reassurance purposes. As is mandatory, the Northamptonshire Police has also made a referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) due to previous contact between the police force and the victim.</p>

<p>"Shortly after midnight on the morning of Thursday, November 14, the Met was contacted by officers from the Northamptonshire Police, raising concerns for the welfare of a woman who was believed to be in a car in the east London area," a Metropolitan Police spokesperson said.</p>

<p>"The car was located parked in Brisbane Road, Ilford, and the body of a 24-year-old woman was found inside the vehicle," the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The police investigators are now working to establish the connection between Brella going missing from her home in Corby, around 145 kilometres north of London, and being found dead in a car in the UK capital days later.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump tapped Republican Brendan Carr, an Elon Musk-backed critic of big tech, to lead the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), calling him a "warrior for Free Speech" in a statement on Sunday.</p>

<p>Carr has "fought against the regulatory Lawfare that has stifled Americans' Freedoms" and will "end the regulatory onslaught that has been crippling America's Job Creators and Innovators, and ensure that the FCC delivers for rural America," Trump said in the statement.</p>

<p>Carr said on X, formerly Twitter, that he was "humbled and honored" to take on the role of FCC chairman.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We must dismantle the censorship cartel and restore free speech rights for everyday Americans," he wrote in another post.</p>

<p>Carr was already the senior Republican on the FCC, an independent agency that regulates licenses for television and radio, pricing of home internet, and other communications issues in the United States.</p>

<p>Long rumored as a contender for FCC chair, he has built an alliance with billionaire Musk -- Trump's wealthiest backer, whose Starlink satellite internet service could benefit from access to federal cash.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Carr has also publicly agreed with the incoming Trump administration's promises to slash regulation and punish television networks for what they say is political bias.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He authored a chapter on the FCC in the controversial Project 2025 document that purported to lay out a vision for a second Trump administration, in which he also called for the regulation of the largest tech companies, such as Meta, Google and Apple.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden's administration has lifted restrictions that had blocked Ukraine from using US-provided weapons to strike deep into Russian territory, said three sources familiar with the matter, in a significant change to US policy in the Ukraine-Russia conflict.</p>

<p>Ukraine plans to conduct its first long-range attacks in the coming days, the sources said, without revealing details due to operational security concerns.</p>

<p>The White House declined to comment.</p>

<p>The move by the United States, which comes just over two months before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20, comes after months of requests by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to allow Ukraine's military to use US weapons to hit Russian military targets far from its border.</p>

<p>The change follows Russia's deployment of North Korean ground troops to supplement its own forces, a development that has caused alarm in Washington and Kyiv.</p>

<p>The first deep strikes are likely to be carried out using ATACMS rockets, which have a range of up to 190 miles (306 km), according to the sources.</p>

<p>While some US officials have expressed skepticism that allowing long-range strikes will change the war's overall trajectory, the decision could help Ukraine at a moment when Russian forces are making gains and possibly put Kyiv in a better negotiating position when and if ceasefire talks happen.</p>

<p>It is not clear if Trump will reverse Biden's decision when he takes office. Trump has long criticized the scale of US financial and military aid to Ukraine and has vowed to end the war quickly, without explaining how.</p>

<p>Still, some congressional Republicans have urged Biden to loosen the rules on how Ukraine can use US-provided weapons.</p>

<p>Russia has warned that it would see a move to loosen the limits on Ukraine's use of US weapons as a major escalation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Brazil on Monday on the second leg of his three-nation visit, during which he will attend the G20 Summit. PM Modi arrived in the South American country after wrapping up a "productive" visit to Nigeria, where he held bilateral talks with President Bola Ahmed Tinubu and interacted with the Indian community.</p>

<p>Announcing PM Modi's arrival in Brazil, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in a post on X, "Prime Minister Narendra Modi lands in the vibrant city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to attend the G20 Brazil Summit." It also shared pictures of PM Modi's welcome at the airport.</p>

<p>Announcing his arrival, PM Modi said in a post on his official X handle, "Landed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to take part in the G20 Summit. I look forward to the summit deliberations and fruitful talks with various world leaders." In Brazil, he will attend the 19th G20 Summit as a member of the Troika. India is part of the G20 Troika along with Brazil and South Africa.</p>

<p>Alongside PM Modi, Chinese President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden will be among the leaders attending the Rio de Janeiro summit on November 18-19.</p>

<p>In the third and final leg of his trip, Modi will visit Guyana from November 19 to 21 at the invitation of President Mohamed Irfaan Ali. It will be the first-ever visit of an Indian prime minister to Guyana in more than 50 years.</p>

<p>PM Modi said in his departure statement on Saturday, "This year, Brazil has built upon India's legacy. I look forward to meaningful discussions in keeping with our vision of 'One Earth, One Family, One Future'. I will also use the opportunity to exchange views on furthering bilateral cooperation with several other leaders." Induction of the 55-nation African Union as a permanent member of the G20 and managing to produce a leaders' declaration overcoming deep divisions over the Ukraine conflict were seen as major milestones of India's G20 presidency last year.</p>

<p>During his visit to Nigeria, PM Modi was conferred with the country's national award, the Grand Commander of the Order of the Niger (GCON), making him only the second foreign dignitary to receive the distinction. This was the 17th international award conferred on PM Modi by a country. Queen Elizabeth II is the only other foreign dignitary to be conferred with the award.</p>

<p>PM Modi's visit to Nigeria was the first trip to the West African country by an Indian prime minister after 17 years.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus said on Sunday that the interim government will seek the extradition of deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India after the fall of her government following a mass protest movement in August.</p>

<p>In an address to the nation on the completion of 100 days of the interim government, Yunus also said that his government has been continuing its all-out efforts to ensure the security of all citizens, including religious minorities.</p>

<p>"We must ensure justice in every killing...We will also ask India to send back fallen autocrat Sheikh Hasina," Yunus was quoted as saying by the state-run BSS news agency.</p>

<p>His remarks indicate a U-turn as in an interview with the UK-based Financial Times newspaper last month, Yunus said his government would not immediately seek Hasina's extradition from India.</p>

<p>Yunus, who assumed office on August 8, claimed that about 1500 people, including students and workers, were killed while 19,931 others were wounded during the protest against the Hasina government.</p>

<p>"Our government is very careful to collect information on every death," he said, adding that the government made arrangements for treatment of the injured in various specialized hospitals, including 13 hospitals in Dhaka.</p>

<p>Hasina, 77, resigned and fled to India following massive protests by students and others against her government over a controversial quota system in government jobs.</p>

<p>She landed at the Hindon airbase near Delhi on August 5. She was believed to have been shifted later to an unspecified location and has not been seen in public since then.</p>

<p>Hasina and her party leaders face accusations of ordering brutal suppression of the Anti-Discrimination Students Movement, resulting in numerous casualties during the July-August protests.</p>

<p>Yunus said his government is investigating every incident in a few cases where religious minorities were subjected to violence.</p>

<p>"We have tried our best so that any citizen of the country, not only Hindu community members, doesn't become a victim of violence. We will continue these efforts," he said in his address to the nation.</p>

<p>He said Bangladesh was a completely insecure country when the interim government assumed office.</p>

<p>Yunus said an attempt was made to spread unnecessary fear among the religious minorities.</p>

<p>"In some cases, they have also been subjected to violence. But all the hype about it was completely exaggerated. Those little cases of violence that took place were mainly political," he said.</p>

<p>But ill efforts were made to make the country unstable again by giving religious colour to these events, he said, adding that the government dealt with the situation firmly with the cooperation of all.</p>

<p>He said that after two months of assumption of office by his government, Durga Puja was celebrated in around 32,000 puja mandaps across the country.</p>

<p>He said the government took extensive security preparations during the Durga Puja so that the Hindu community members celebrate the festival smoothly.</p>

<p>Hindus constitute just about 8 per cent of the 170 million Bangladesh population. The minority Hindu community members have faced regular vandalism of their businesses and destruction of temples during and since the protest erupted, resulting in the ouster of Prime Minister Hasina.</p>

<p>Yunus also said that the Election Commission (EC) will be formed soon while an election roadmap will be announced after competing reforms in the electoral system.</p>

<p>"Once the electoral reforms are decided, you will get the election roadmap very soon," he said.</p>

<p>Noting that there is a question in everyone's mind about when the elections will be held, Yunus said the government has started taking necessary steps to hold the elections.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine said it would introduce nationwide emergency power restrictions Monday after a "massive" Russian attack further damaged its already fragile energy grid ahead of a much-feared winter, with nine civilians also killed across the country on Sunday.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Moscow launched 120 missiles and almost 100 drones, targeting Kyiv as well as southern, central and far-western corners of the country.</p>

<p>Civilians were killed in the Mykolaiv, Lviv, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk and Odesa regions in what officials in the capital called one of the biggest barrages in the almost three-year Russian invasion.</p>

<p>The devastation comes at a time when Moscow has been steadily advancing in Ukraine's east and with the imminent return of Donald Trump to the White House, raising fears over the future of US support for Kyiv.</p>

<p>"A hellish night," the spokesman for Ukraine's air force, Yuriy Ignat, said on social media, adding that Kyiv had downed "144 targets".</p>

<p>The country's grid operator Ukrenergo said it would apply emergency measures in all regions on Monday.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow, November 18, all regions will be forced to apply consumption restriction measures," Ukrenergo posted on social media. "The reason for the temporary return of restrictions is the damage to power facilities during today's massive missile and drone attack."</p>

<p>Almost three years of war with Russia has already destroyed half of Ukraine's energy production capacity, Zelensky has warned.</p>

<p>With the harsh Ukrainian winter fast approaching, the country is already suffering from major energy shortfalls, while its outmanned and outgunned forces have been ceding ground to the Kremlin's troops for weeks.</p>

<p>The giant attack followed two days after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called Russian leader Vladimir Putin for the first time in almost two years, urging the Kremlin chief to end Moscow's devastating offensive.</p>

<p><strong>'True response'</strong></p>

<p>Kyiv had slammed Scholz for reaching out to Putin, and said Sunday that the attack was the Kremlin's real answer.</p>

<p>"This is war criminal Putin's true response to all those who called and visited him recently," Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga said after the attack.</p>

<p>"We need peace through strength, not appeasement."</p>

<p>Scholz on Sunday defended the call and insisted that Berlin's backing for Kyiv was unwavering.</p>

<p>"Ukraine can count on us," he said before flying to a G20 meeting in Brazil, promising that "no decision will be taken behind Ukraine's back" on ending the conflict.</p>

<p>But Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk joined the backlash on Sunday.</p>

<p>"No one will stop Putin with phone calls. The attack last night, one of the biggest in this war, has proved that telephone diplomacy cannot replace real support from the whole West for Ukraine," Tusk wrote on X.</p>

<p>The strikes caused extensive power cuts across the country, with fears of a precarious winter to come.</p>

<p>"A massive attack on our country," Zelensky said.</p>

<p>"Over the past week, the aggressor used nearly 140 missiles of various types, more than 900 guided aerial bombs, and over 600 strike drones," he said, accusing Moscow of trying to "intimidate us with cold and blackouts".</p>

<p><strong>Civilian deaths across Ukraine</strong></p>

<p>AFP journalists heard explosions in the early morning in Kyiv and close to Sloviansk in the Donetsk region.</p>

<p>Moscow, meanwhile, said it had hit all its targets, claiming it had targeted an "essential energy infrastructure supporting the Ukrainian military-industrial complex".</p>

<p>But civilian deaths were reported across the country.</p>

<p>Officials in Kherson said a 51-year-old woman was killed by a drone.</p>

<p>In the southern Mykolaiv region, local leader Vitaliy Kim said two women were killed in a night attack and seven people -- including two children -- were wounded.</p>

<p>The death count included two employees of the state railway company Ukrzaliznytsia in the city of Nikopol, who were killed when a depot was hit, the Dnipropetrovsk region's governor Sergiy Lysak and the operator said. Three others were wounded in the bombing.</p>

<p>Two people were also killed in the Odesa region, where a teenager was wounded.</p>

<p>Russian drones also made their way to Zakarpattia, a mountainous region rarely targeted, with officials saying fragments fell in the village of Pavshyno, near the border with Hungary and Slovakia.</p>

<p>The head of the Lviv region, Maksym Kozytsky, said a 66-year-old woman was killed in her car in Sheptytsky, a village around 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the Polish border.</p>

<p>That prompted NATO-member Poland to scramble fighter jets and mobilise all available forces on Sunday in response.</p>

<p>Warsaw puts its armed forces on alert whenever attacks against its neighbouring country are deemed likely to create a danger for its own territory.</p>

<p><strong>Two killed in Russia</strong></p>

<p>In the border Kursk region, where Kyiv has held onto swathes of Russian land since the summer, Russian officials said a Ukrainian drone strike killed a local journalist.</p>

<p>Kursk leader Alexei Smirnov said Yulia Kuznetsova, editor of the local "People's Paper", was killed in the Bolshesoldatskiy district as she "took archives to her editorial office".</p>

<p>The West and Ukraine says thousands of North Korea soldiers are in Russia, with some in the Kursk region, to reinforce Moscow's forces.</p>

<p>Russia also said a man was killed by a Ukrainian drone in its border Belgorod region.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a shocking incident, a pregnant woman was killed allegedly by her mother-in-law who along with her three accomplices chopped her body in dozens of pieces before dumping it in a drain in the Punjab province of Pakistan, police said on Sunday.</p>

<p>The incident took place last week in Daska, Sialkot district, some 100 km from Lahore.</p>

<p>Police arrested four suspects including the mother-in-law Sughran Bibi, her daughter Yasmin, her grandson Hamza and distant relative Navid.</p>

<p>Zara Qadir, who was in her 20s, went missing last week. Later police found the chopped body of a woman in three sacks which was identified as Zara.</p>

<p>Zara, the daughter of a police officer, married Qadir Ahmad four years ago and the couple had a three-year-old son. Zara after marriage had gone to Saudi Arabia to her husband who works there. A few months ago, she had returned to Pakistan.</p>

<p>Senior police officer Omar Farooq told reporters on Sunday that the suspects confessed to having killed and dismembered the body of Zara.</p>

<p>"In her confessional statement, Sughran Bibi said that she suspected Zara of allegedly practising 'witchcraft'. Besides, her son Qadir had started sending money directly to Zara in her bank instead to his mother." "The four suspects smothered Zara with a pillow while she was asleep. After that they burnt her face and chopped off her body into dozens of pieces before dumping it in a drain in three sacks," the police officer said and added Zara was also pregnant.</p>

<p>"On Zara's father's statement that he suspected Sughran for claiming that she had run away with her lover upon her disappearance, we interrogated her (Sughran) who confessed to her crime," Farooq said.</p>

<p>He said Sughran was also the sister of Zara's father.</p>

<p>"This is a case of extreme jealousy as the mother-in-law and her daughter not only killed Zara but in cold blood dismembered her body into pieces in hatred," he said and Sughran and Yasmin were of the view that because of Zara's good looks Qadir was playing into her hands and ignoring them.</p>

<p>A murder case has been registered against the suspects.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping vowed on Saturday to work with the incoming US administration of Donald Trump as he held his final talks with outgoing President Joe Biden on conflicts from cyber crime to trade, Taiwan, the South China Sea and Russia.</p>

<p>Biden met Xi for about two hours at a hotel where the Chinese leader was staying, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Lima, Peru, for their first talks in seven months.</p>

<p>"China's goal of a stable, healthy and sustainable China-US relationship remains unchanged" after Trump's election, Xi said as he met Biden, acknowledging "ups and downs" between the countries. "China is ready to work with the new US administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation and manage differences."</p>

<p>Biden told Xi that the two leaders have not always agreed but their discussions have been "frank" and "candid."</p>

<p>Two months before Trump returns to the White House, US officials see magnified risks of conflict during the transition. Biden told Xi that maintaining leader-to-leader talks would be vital even after he left office, said Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan.</p>

<p>The president-elect has vowed to adopt blanket 60% tariffs on US imports of Chinese goods as part of a package of "America First" trade measures. Beijing opposes those steps. The Republican also plans to hire several hawkish voices on China in senior roles, including US Senator Marco Rubio as secretary of state and Representative Mike Waltz as national security adviser.</p>

<p>Biden has aimed to lower tensions with China, and there were few signs of a breakthrough on the major issues.</p>

<p>But Biden and Xi did agree that human beings, not artificial intelligence, should make decisions over the use of nuclear weapons, according to the White House, the first time the countries are known to have raised the issue.</p>

<p>The US and Chinese presidents also talked about North Korea, an ally of China whose deepening ties with Russia and deployment of troops in Moscow's war with Ukraine have raised concerns in Washington, Beijing and European capitals.</p>

<p>"President Biden pointed out that the (People's Republic of China's) publicly stated position with respect to the war in Ukraine is there should be no escalation, no broadening the conflict, and the introduction of (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) troops runs foursquare against that," said Sullivan.</p>

<p>"He also pointed out that the PRC does have influence and capacity, and should use it to try to prevent a further escalation or further expansion of the conflict with the introduction of even more DPRK forces."</p>

<p><strong>MAJOR ISSUES</strong></p>

<p>Other major issues raised at the meeting included a recent China-linked hack of the telephone communications of US government and presidential campaign officials, stepped-up pressure by Beijing on Taiwan and in the South China Sea, as well as Chinese support for Russia. Biden also raised the cases of Americans he believes are wrongly detained in China.</p>

<p>On Taiwan, the leaders appear to have had a sharp exchange. Biden called for an end to Beijing's "destabilizing" military activity around the island, the White House said.</p>

<p>Xi said the "'Taiwan independence' separatist activities" of Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te were incompatible with peace and stability there, according to the Chinese foreign ministry. Lai plans to stop in the US state of Hawaii and maybe Guam on a sensitive visit that is sure to anger Beijing in the coming weeks, Reuters reported on Friday.</p>

<p>Taiwan's foreign ministry thanked Biden for his comments, and said China was the troublemaker.</p>

<p>"China's persistent military provocations around Taiwan are the greatest source of damage to regional peace and stability and a major threat to global economic prosperity," it said in a statement.</p>

<p>Taiwan's former Economy Minister Lin Hsin-i met Biden at the summit on Friday and invited him to visit Taiwan in the near future.</p>

<p>China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory. The US is Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier, despite the lack of formal diplomatic recognition. Taiwan rejects China's sovereignty claims.</p>

<p>At the same time, Beijing's economy is taking a stiff hit from Biden's steps on trade, including a plan to restrict US investment in Chinese artificial intelligence, quantum computing and semiconductors, and export restrictions on high-end computer chips. Biden has described those steps as necessary for US national security reasons and said they do not impede most trade.</p>

<p>During the meeting, Xi said no evidence supported the claim of Chinese involvement in cyber attacks, according to Chinese state media. He also told Biden that Washington should not get involved in disputes in the Spratly Islands, the subject of a dispute between China and the US-allied Philippines.</p>

<p>Beijing has rejected a 2016 ruling by The Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration, which said its expansive maritime claims over the South China Sea had no legal basis, in a case that was brought by Manila.</p>

<p>"When the two countries treat each other as partner and friend, seek common ground while shelving differences and help each other succeed, our relationship would make considerable progress," Xi told Biden through an interpreter. "But if we take each other as rivals or adversary, pursue vicious competition, and seek to hurt each other, we would roil the relationship or even set it back."</p>

<p>The two leaders also privately reflected back on the blunt-spoken dynamics of their long relationship, said Sullivan, the US national security adviser.</p>

<p>Shen Dingli, a Shanghai-based international relations scholar, said China wants to ease tensions during the transition period. "China definitely does not want relations with the United States to be thrown into turmoil before Trump formally takes office," said Shen.</p>

<p>Pacific Rim leaders gathered at the APEC summit are assessing the implications of Trump's return to power on Jan. 20. The South American summit offers new signs of the challenges to the United States' power in its own backyard, where China is on a charm offensive.</p>

<p>Xi, who arrived in Lima on Thursday, plans a week-long diplomatic blitz in Latin America that includes a refurbished free-trade agreement with Peru, inaugurating the massive Chancay deep-water port there and being welcomed in Brazil's capital next week for a state visit. China also announced plans to host the APEC summit in 2026.</p>

<p>China is seeking Latin America's metal ores, soybeans and other commodities, but US officials worry they may also be looking for new US-adjacent military and intelligence outposts. Chinese state-backed media has called those accusations a smear.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus begged the country's "patience" to prepare for much-awaited elections in a speech to the nation marking 100 days in power since a student-led revolution.</p>

<p>The 84-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner was appointed to lead the government as "chief advisor" on August 9, days after the student-led uprising that ended Sheikh Hasina's 15 years of iron-fisted rule.</p>

<p>Yunus, a microfinance pioneer, is leading a temporary administration, to tackle what he has called the "extremely tough" challenge of restoring democratic institutions in the South Asian nation of some 170 million people.</p>

<p>Vowing an election commission will be formed "within a few days", Yunus said he could not give a timeframe for elections, saying it was dependent on a raft of election and constitutional reforms.</p>

<p>"I promise that we will hold the much-anticipated election once the necessary and essential reforms are complete," he said in the broadcast.</p>

<p>"I request your patience until then. We aim to build an electoral system that will endure for decades. For this, we need some time."</p>

<p>Yunus said his administration was also focused on ensuring those guilty of cracking down on the protests to oust Hasina faced justice, and said he had spoken to Karim Khan, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court.</p>

<p>Bangladesh has issued an arrest warrant for 77-year-old Hasina -- last seen arriving in neighbouring India after fleeing by helicopter as crowds entered her palace.</p>

<p>Hasina has been summoned to appear in court in Dhaka on Monday to face charges of "massacres, killings, and crimes against humanity", but she remains in exile in India.</p>

<p>Several of her former government ministers, who were detained and held in custody, are expected in court to face similar charges.</p>

<p>"We have already taken initiatives to try those responsible for enforced disappearances, murders, and the mass killings during the July-August uprising," Yunus said.</p>

<p>Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean has called the challenge facing Yunus "monumental", warning of that "cracks are emerging in the fragile alliance" that pushed him into power.</p>

<p>"For now, Yunus and his colleagues have widespread support, but popular expectations are double-edged", the thinktank said in report on Thursday.</p>

<p>"If the interim administration falters in making reforms, the outcome is likely to be an early election with little progress; in the worst-case scenario, the military could assume power."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

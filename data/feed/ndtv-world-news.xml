       <description><![CDATA[A 6.9-foot-long ocean sunfish (Mola mola) was recently discovered on an Oregon beach, sparking interest from locals and experts.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A gigantic ocean sunfish measuring 6.9 feet in length was spotted along the shores of Hug Point State Park in Arch Cape, Oregon. The creature, commonly known as a Mola Mola, caught the attention of local aquatic experts and stirred interest among beachgoers.</p>

<p>A local institution, the Seaside Aquarium, posted pictures of the dead sunfish on its Facebook page, saying it was unusually big and caused a lot of attention. While an average is to be considered at 6.9 feet, Mola mola can really go up to an astonishing 10 feet in length and weigh up to 5,000 pounds. This giant sunfish is but one example of the rich and diverse marine life existing off the coast of Oregon.</p>

<p>"Another Mola Mola has washed ashore at Hug Point State Park, and it is creating quite a stir. While it has been dead for quite some time, it is still an interesting site. If you want to go see it, we recommend heading to Huge Point at low tide and head north towards the waterfall. Three sunfish have washed ashore since June in Clatsop County. Two were ocean sunfish (Mola mola), and the other one was a hoodwinker sunfish (Mola tecta)," wrote Seaside Aquarium on Facebook.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="767" scrolling="no" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FSeasideAquarium%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0nCFoZJnDb3efVT9sfPFXemnYkiYk8f6fbvwmmQahaM8EdPwm9JMSAHBRuB3tCCMpl&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=500" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" width="500"></iframe></p>

<p>"It is not unusual for these guys to wash ashore, as they do reside off the Oregon Coast. We are getting more reports because of the stir that the Mola tecta caused when it washed in (it was the first Mola tecta documented in Oregon, but that is likely because it has just recently been described and designated as a new species). People are aware that we are interested in documenting these strandings and collecting information from them.</p>

<p>The most recent sunfish at Hug Point was 6.9 feet long, which is average size for our area; however, they can get up to 10 feet long and weigh up to 5,000 pounds. They feed heavily on jellyfish, which are in huge abundance this time of year," the institution added.</p>

<p>The Seaside Aquarium shared images of the sunfish, showing its grey, wrinkled body in a state of decay. This marks the third sunfish to wash ashore in Clatsop County since June.</p>

<p>One of the previous sunfish discoveries, a hoodwinker sunfish, was spotted in June. This 7.3-foot-long creature, also known as a Mola tecta, is a relatively new species, only identified in the past decade. The June discovery was believed to be one of the largest hoodwinker sunfish ever observed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Saudi court sentenced a retired teacher to 30 years' jail for criticising the government on social media, less than two months after his death sentence was overturned, his brother said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The death sentence against Mohammed al-Ghamdi highlighted what critics describe as heightened repression under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Gulf kingdom's de facto ruler.</p>

<p>Prince Mohammed addressed the case in an interview with Fox News that aired in September 2023, saying the government was "ashamed" over it and expressing hope the outcome could be changed.</p>

<p>Ghamdi's death sentence was overturned on appeal in August.</p>

<p>But the appeals court sentenced him to 30 years imprisonment on the same charges, his brother Saeed al-Ghamdi, an Islamic scholar who lives in Britain, told AFP.</p>

<p>Mohammed al-Ghamdi had been sentenced to death in July 2023 by the Specialised Criminal Court, which was set up in 2008 to deal with terrorism-related cases.</p>

<p>The former teacher, who is in his 50s, was arrested in June 2022.</p>

<p>The case against him was at least partly built on posts criticising the government and expressing support for "prisoners of conscience" like the jailed religious clerics Salman al-Awda and Awad al-Qarni, his brother has previously said.</p>

<p>His account on social media platform X had only nine followers, the Gulf Centre for Human Rights said when his legal troubles came to light last year.</p>

<p>The charges he faced included conspiracy against the Saudi leadership, undermining state institutions and supporting terrorist ideology, sources briefed on the details said at the time.</p>

<p>"This about-face in judgements testifies to the dramatic state of the kingdom's politicised judicial system," Saeed al-Ghamdi said on X.</p>

<p>"My brother is not guilty to be arrested and tried in this way," he added.</p>

<p>The Saudi authorities could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>

<p>Human Rights Watch and Saeed al-Ghamdi reported last month that another brother, 47-year-old Asaad al-Ghamdi, had been sentenced to 20 years over critical social media posts.</p>

<p>There was no word on Tuesday on whether judges would also review Asaad al-Ghamdi's sentence.</p>

<p>Under Prince Mohammed, Saudi Arabia has been pursuing an ambitious reform agenda known as Vision 2030 intended to transform the formerly closed-off kingdom into a global tourism and business destination.</p>

<p>However, Saudi authorities continue to take heat for the country's rights record and restrictions on free speech in particular.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Israel's assault on Iran-backed Hezbollah over the past week, including the targeting of senior commanders and the detonation of booby-trapped pagers and walkie-talkies, has left it reeling.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hezbollah's flexible chain of command, together with its extensive tunnel network and a vast arsenal of missiles and weapons it has bolstered over the past year, is helping it weather unprecedented Israeli strikes, three sources familiar with the Lebanese militant group's operations said. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/lebanese-journalist-thrown-off-screen-as-israeli-missile-strikes-during-live-interview-6645562">Israel's assault on Hezbollah</a> over the past week, including the targeting of senior commanders and the detonation of booby-trapped pagers and walkie-talkies, has left the powerful Lebanese Shiite militant group and political party reeling.</p>

<p>On Friday, Israel killed the commander who founded and led the group's elite Radwan force, Ibrahim Aqil. And since Monday, Lebanon's deadliest day of violence in decades, the health ministry says more than 560 people, among them 50 children, have died in air barrages.</p>

<p>The Israeli military chief of staff Herzi Halevi said on Sunday that Aqil's death had shaken the organisation. Israel says its strikes have also destroyed thousands of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hezbollah-israel-conflict-hezbollah-fires-ballistic-missile-at-mossad-base-near-tel-aviv-6644843">Hezbollah</a> rockets and shells.</p>

<p>But two of the sources familiar with Hezbollah operations said the group swiftly appointed replacements for Aqil and other senior figures killed in Friday's airstrike in Beirut's southern suburbs. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said in an Aug. 1 speech that the group quickly fills gaps whenever a leader is killed.</p>

<p>A fourth source, a Hezbollah official, said the attack on communication devices put 1,500 fighters out of commission because of their injuries, with many having been blinded or had their hands blown off.</p>

<p>While that is a major blow, it represents a fraction of Hezbollah's strength, which a report for the U.S. Congress on Friday put at 40,000-50,000 fighters. Nasrallah has said the group has 100,000 fighters.</p>

<p>Since October, when Hezbollah began firing at Israel in October in support of its ally Hamas in Gaza, it has redeployed fighters to frontline areas in the south, including some from Syria, the three sources said.</p>

<p>It has also been bringing rockets into Lebanon at a fast pace, anticipating a drawn-out conflict, the sources said, adding that the group sought to avoid all out war.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's main supporter and weapons supplier is Iran. The group is the most powerful faction in Tehran's "Axis of Resistance" of allied irregular forces across the Middle East. Many of its weapons are Iranian, Russian or Chinese models.</p>

<p>The sources, who all asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, did not provide details of the weapons or where they were bought.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's media office did not reply to requests for comment for this story.</p>

<p>Andreas Krieg, a senior lecturer at the School of Security Studies at King's College London, said that while Hezbollah operations had been disrupted by the past week's attacks, the group's networked organisational structure helped make it an extremely resilient force.</p>

<p>"This is the most formidable enemy Israel has ever faced on the battlefield, not because of numbers and tech but in terms of resilience."</p>

<h3><strong>POWERFUL MISSILES</strong></h3>

<p>Fighting has escalated this week. Israel killed another top Hezbollah commander, Ibrahim Qubaisi, on Tuesday. For its part, Hezbollah has shown its capacity to continue operations, firing hundreds of rockets towards Israel in ever deeper attacks.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Hezbollah said it had targeted an Israeli intelligence base near Tel Aviv, more than 100 km (60 miles) from the border. Warning sirens sounded in Tel Aviv as a single surface-to-surface missile was intercepted by air defence systems, the Israeli military said.</p>

<p>The group has yet to say whether it has launched any of its most potent, precision-guided rockets, such as the Fateh-110, an Iranian-made ballistic missile with a range of 250-300 km (341.75 miles). Hezbollah's Fateh-110 have a 450-500 kg warhead, according to a 2018 paper published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-hezbollah-missile-chief-killed-in-israeli-airstrike-on-beirut-10-points-6643300">Hezbollah's rocket attacks</a> are possible because the chain of command has kept functioning despite the group suffering a brief spell of disarray after the pagers and radios detonated, one of the sources, a senior security official, said.</p>

<p>The three sources said Hezbollah's ability to communicate is underpinned by a dedicated, fixed-line telephone network - which it has described as critical to its communications and continues to work - as well as by other devices.</p>

<p>Many of its fighters were carrying older models of pagers, for example, that were unaffected by last week's attack.</p>

<p>Reuters could not independently verify the information. Most injuries from the exploding pagers were in Beirut, far from the front.</p>

<br />
Hezbollah stepped up the use of pagers after banning its fighters from using cellphones on the battlefield in February, in response to commanders being killed in strikes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the chain of command breaks, frontline fighters are trained to operate in small, independent clusters comprised of a few villages near the border, capable of fighting Israeli forces for long periods, the senior source added.</p>

<p>That is precisely what happened in 2006, during the last war between Hezbollah and Israel, when the group's fighters held out for weeks, some in frontline villages invaded by Israel.</p>

<p>Israel says it has escalated attacks to degrade Hezbollah's capabilities and make it safe for tens of thousands of displaced Israelis to return to their homes near the Lebanon border, which they fled when Hezbollah began firing rockets on Oct. 8.</p>

<p>Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/netanyahus-message-for-people-of-lebanon-after-deadly-strikes-10-points-6635347">Benjamin Netanyahu's government</a> has said it prefers to reach a negotiated agreement that would see Hezbollah withdraw from the border region but stands ready to continue its bombing campaign if Hezbollah refuses, and does not rule out any military options.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's resilience means the fighting has raised fears of a protracted war that could suck in the U.S., Israel's close ally, and Iran - especially if Israel launches, and gets bogged down in, a ground offensive in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>Israel's military did not respond to a request for comment for this story.</p>

<p>Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian warned on Monday of "irreversible" consequences of a full blown war in the Middle East. A U.S. State Department official said Washington disagreed with Israel's strategy of escalation and sought to reduce tensions.</p>

<h3><strong>UNDERGROUND ARSENAL</strong></h3>

<p>In what two of the sources said was an indication of how well some of Hezbollah's weapons are hidden, on Sunday rockets were launched from areas of southern Lebanon that had been targeted by Israel shortly before, the two sources said.</p>

<p>Hezbollah is believed to have an underground arsenal and last month published footage that appeared to show its fighters driving trucks with rocket launchers through tunnels. The sources did not specify if the rockets fired on Sunday were launched from underground.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Monday's barrage had destroyed tens of thousands of Hezbollah rockets and munitions.</p>

<br />
Israel's military said long-range cruise missiles, rockets with warheads capable of carrying 100kg of explosives, short-range rockets, and explosive UAVs were all struck on Monday.</p>

<p>Reuters could not independently verify the military claims.</p>

<p>Boaz Shapira a researcher at Alma, an Israeli think tank that specializes in Hezbollah, said Israel had yet to target strategic sites such as long-range missiles and drone sites.</p>

<p>"I don't think we are anywhere near finishing this," Shapira said.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's arsenal is believed to compromise some 150,000 rockets, the U.S. Congress report said. Krieg said its most powerful, long-range ballistic missiles were kept below ground.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has spent years building a tunnel network that by Israeli estimates extends for hundreds of kilometres. The Israeli military said Monday's air strikes hit Hezbollah missile launch sites hidden under homes in southern Lebanon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hezbollah has said it does not place military infrastructure near civilians. Hezbollah has issued no statement on the impact of Israel's strikes since Monday.</p>

<h3><strong>TUNNELS</strong></h3>

<p>The group's arsenal and tunnels have expanded since the 2006 war, especially precision guidance systems, leader Nasrallah has said. Hezbollah officials have said the group has used a small part of the arsenal in fighting over the past year.</p>

<p>Israeli officials have said Hezbollah's military infrastructure is tightly meshed into the villages and communities of southern Lebanon, with ammunition and missile launcher pads stored in houses throughout the area. Israel has been pounding some of those villages for months to degrade Hezbollah's capabilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Confirmed details on the tunnel network remain scarce.</p>

<p>A 2021 report by Alma, an Israeli think tank that specializes in Hezbollah, said Iran and North Korea both helped build up the network of tunnels in the aftermath of the 2006 war.</p>

<p>Israel has already struggled to root out Hamas commanders and self-reliant fighting units from the tunnels criss-crossing Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It is one of our biggest challenges in Gaza, and it is certainly something we could meet in Lebanon," said Carmit Valensi, a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, a think-tank.</p>

<p>Krieg said that unlike Gaza, where most tunnels are manually dug into a sandy soil, the tunnels in Lebanon had been dug deep in mountain rock. "They are far less accessible than in Gaza and even less easy to destroy."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's main rival in Canada's parliament on Tuesday introduced a motion of no confidence in the ruling Liberals, in the first major test of his unpopular minority government.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's main rival in Canada's parliament on Tuesday introduced a motion of no confidence in the ruling Liberals, in the first major test of his unpopular minority government.</p>

<p>Following a debate in the House of Commons, a vote on the long-shot Conservative motion is scheduled on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Far ahead in public opinion polls, Tory leader Pierre Poilievre has been itching for a snap election since the leftist New Democratic Party (NDP) earlier this month tore up a coalition agreement with the Liberals, leaving the Trudeau administration vulnerable to being toppled.</p>

<p>Kicking off the debate, a combative Poilievre railed against Trudeau for what he said was a failure to address soaring costs of living, a housing crisis and crime, while doubling the national debt.</p>

<p>He said the promise of Canada, "after nine years of Liberal government, is broken."</p>

<p>If elected prime minister, he said he would legislate "a common sense plan to axe the tax (on carbon emissions), build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime."</p>

<p>During an appearance in New York on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert on Monday evening, Justin Trudeau acknowledged that Canadians are facing "a really tough time."</p>

<p>"People are hurting. People are having trouble paying for groceries, paying for rent, filling up the tank," and "are looking at change," he said.</p>

<p>But he vowed to "keep fighting."</p>

<p>At a news conference at the United Nations on Tuesday, Trudeau criticized Poilievre for suggesting "the best way to get through these difficult times is to cut services and programs that Canadians rely on."</p>

<p>"I'm thinking about how we can best help Canadians," he said.</p>

<h2><strong>LIBERALS HOLDING ON</strong></h2>

<p>The no-confidence motion is not expected to succeed after two smaller political factions have signaled they will side with the government and vote against it.</p>

<p>But Poilievre has vowed to keep trying, with another opportunity to bring down the government to be presented in early October.</p>

<p>Trudeau swept to power in 2015, and has managed to hold on by defeating two of Poilievre's predecessors in 2019 and 2021 ballots.</p>

<p>The deal with the New Democratic Party to prop up the Liberals would have kept his government in office until late 2025.</p>

<p>But the NDP, seeing its alignment with the Liberals hurting its own popularity, exited the deal early.</p>

<p>According to a recent Angus Reid poll, the Conservatives are well ahead of the Liberals, with 43 percent of voting intention against 21 percent for the ruling party. The NDP is at 19 percent.</p>

<p>In Canada's Westminster parliamentary system, a ruling party must hold the confidence of the House of Commons, which means maintaining support from a majority of members.</p>

<p>The Liberals currently have 153 seats, versus 119 for the Conservatives, 33 for the Bloc Quebecois, and the NDP 25.</p>

<p>Political analysts who spoke to AFP suggest an election likely won't happen until at least spring 2025.<br />

<p>The attack on Fadi Boudaya comes amid escalating tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group. Since the Gaza war erupted last October, both sides have been involved in intense cross-border conflict, with recent hostilities reaching new heights.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The situation worsened following a cyber attack on Hezbollah members, during which their communication devices – pagers and walkie-talkies – were targeted. Hezbollah accused Israel of orchestrating the attacks.</p>

<p>On Monday, Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon killed more than 550 people, including 50 children. That evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a video message, urging Lebanese citizens to evacuate their homes. “Once the operation is finished, they can return to their homes,” he said.&nbsp;<br />

The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed Qubaisi's death, saying he was a key figure in Hezbollah's missile operations. Alongside Qubaisi, at least two other high-ranking commanders were reportedly killed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The strikes, targeting the Dahiyeh suburb, came amid intense cross-border clashes, with Hezbollah firing over 300 rockets at northern Israeli cities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[China test-launched an intercontinental ballistic missile on Wednesday, firing it into the Pacific Ocean in its first such exercise in decades.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China said it test-launched an intercontinental ballistic missile on Wednesday, firing it into the Pacific Ocean in its first such exercise in decades. The launch sparked protests from other countries in the region, with China's neighbour Japan saying it had not been given advance notice and expressing "serious concern" about Beijing's military build-up.</p>

<p>Beijing has stepped up its nuclear development and boosted defence spending in recent years, with the Pentagon last October warning China was developing its arsenal more quickly than the United States had anticipated.</p>

<p>China held more than 500 operational nuclear warheads as of May 2023 and is likely to have more than 1,000 by 2030, it said.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the Chinese military's Rocket Force "launched an ICBM... carrying a dummy warhead to the high seas in the Pacific Ocean at 08:44 on September 25, and the missile fell into expected sea areas", the defence ministry said in a statement.</p>

<p>An analyst told AFP such tests were very rare.</p>

<p>"This is extremely unusual and likely the first time in decades that we've seen a test like this," said Ankit Panda, Stanton Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</p>

<p>"(The test) likely speaks to China's ongoing nuclear modernisation manifesting in new requirements for testing," he added.</p>

<h3>'Serious concern'</h3>

<p>China's defence ministry, however, called the firing a "routine arrangement in our annual training plan".</p>

<p>"It is in line with international law and international practice and is not directed against any country or target," it said.</p>

<p>Japan, however, said it was given "no notice from the Chinese side in advance", with a government spokesman adding that Beijing's military build-up was a "serious concern".</p>

<p>New Zealand also said the launch of the missile, which landed in the South Pacific, was "an unwelcome and concerning development".</p>

<p>A spokesman for Wellington's foreign minister vowed to consult with Pacific allies further as details become clear.</p>

<p>Beijing first test-fired an ICBM into the South Pacific in the 1980s.</p>

<p>But since then, Panda told AFP, it has typically conducted such tests in its own airspace.</p>

<p>In 2021, the United States said it was "very concerned" about reported hypersonic missile testing by China.</p>

<h3><strong>Third-largest stockpile</strong></h3>

<p>The United States and China in November held rare talks on nuclear arms control, part of a bid to ease mistrust ahead of a summit between leaders Joe Biden and Xi Jinping.</p>

<p>But in July, Beijing said it had suspended negotiations with the United States on nuclear non-proliferation and arms control in response to Washington's weapons sales to Taiwan.</p>

<p>In an annual report, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) listed China as having the world's third-largest stockpile of nuclear warheads, after Russia and the United States.</p>

<p>This year, Beijing announced it would increase its defence budget -- the world's second-largest -- by 7.2 percent.</p>

<p>The boost comes as China increasingly squares off with the United States and its regional partners from the South China Sea to Taiwan.</p>

<p>This month, senior military officials from China and the United States held "in-depth" talks as part of a bid by the powers to avoid wider tensions escalating into conflict.</p>

<p>Since its first atomic test in 1964, China has been content to maintain a comparatively modest arsenal and has maintained that it would never be the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict.</p>

<p>In recent years, under President Xi, it has begun a massive military modernisation drive that includes upgrading its nuclear weapons to not only deter foes but also be able to counter-attack.</p>

<p>But Beijing's secretive Rocket Force, which carried out Wednesday's test and oversees the country's nuclear arsenal, has also been the target of an aggressive, wide-ranging anti-graft campaign.</p>

<p>In July, Beijing announced that Sun Jinming, the former chief of staff of the force, had been placed under investigation for corruption.</p>

<p>Its head, Li Yuchao, was replaced last July.</p>

<p>And Li Shangfu was ousted last year after only seven months as defence minister following a lengthy absence from public view.</p>

<p>Other disgraced generals include Wei Fenghe, who once headed the Rocket Force and who later became China's defence minister from 2018 to 2023.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Anura Kumara Dissanayake - Sri Lanka's new Marxist President - has said he wants to avoid being "sandwiched" between India and China but recognises each as a "valued partner", as he tries to resolve a financial crisis roiling his country.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/anura-kumara-dissanayake" target="_blank">Anura Kumara Dissanayake</a> - Sri Lanka's new Marxist President - has said he wants to avoid being "sandwiched" between India and China but recognises each as a "valued partner", as he tries to resolve a financial crisis that has roiled his country since 2019 and led to a sovereign default in April 2022.</p>

<p>The former grassroots leader made it clear he intends to steer clear of geopolitical rumblings in South Asia or the Indian Ocean region. He acknowledged that each can provide much-needed financial aid but said he also wanted closer ties with the West, the Middle East, and even Africa.</p>

<p>The remarks were made in an interview with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://monocle.com/shop/product/2546171/issue-176/" target="_blank">The Monocle</a>, a global affairs and lifestyle magazine, in early September (before his election win was confirmed), in which he spoke about his foreign policy.</p>

<p>"There are many power camps within a multipolar system... but we won't be part of that geopolitical fight, nor will we be aligned with any party. We also don't want to be sandwiched, especially between China and India. Both are valued friends and we expect them to become closer partners."</p>

<p>Mr Dissanayake, 55, a previously fringe Left leader, was catapulted into the limelight after winning the presidential election; he pulled over 42 per cent of the votes.</p>

<p>Rumoured close ties to China raised eyebrows, particularly in Delhi, which expressed concerns over Beijing's growing influence on Sri Lanka, which sits on key shipping lanes in the Indian Ocean. Added to that, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3279800/sri-lanka-seek-maximum-support-china-under-new-leader-dissanayake-analysts-say" target="_blank">South China Morning Post</a> claimed Beijing expects Dissanayake will seek "maximum support" via foreign direct investment.</p>

<p>That report cited an economics professor from the University of Colombo as saying it is "highly probable" Mr Dissanayake would prefer to work with Beijing over Delhi.</p>

<p>However, Mr Dissanayake has, publicly at least, sought to reassure both Delhi and the United States, which too is wary of China's growing influence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking to an Indian publication on voting day (on Saturday), Mr Dissanayake said India is "crucial" to his country's hopes for economic stability and regional security.</p>

<p>"We will consider how our economic measures impact our country (while) recognising the importance of India's support in our development efforts," he told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theweek.in/news/world/2024/09/24/dont-want-to-be-sandwiched-between-india-china-sri-lankan-president-anura-on-his-foreign-policy.html" target="_blank">The Week</a>.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken to Mr Dissanayake, stating he looks forward to working closely with him to further strengthen the Indo-Lanka multifaceted cooperation. Mr Modi's post on X also contained a reference to Colombo's "special place" in Delhi's Neighbourhood First policy.</p>

<p>Mr Dissanayake responded, "I share your commitment... Together, we can work towards enhancing cooperation for the benefit of our peoples and the entire region."</p>

<p>The Sri Lankan leader also played down fears - expressed by both Delhi and Washington - his country would become a military base for Beijing; as recently as last month three Chinese Navy ships were berthed at Colombo Port, at the same time as India's front-line warship, INS Mumbai, docked.</p>

<p>"We are committed to maintaining our sovereignty and will not become subordinate to any power in this geopolitical race..." Mr Dissanayake said this month.</p>

<p>Delhi has played a key role - recognised by the International Monetary Fund, which has provided a $3 billion bailout programme - in guiding Colombo through the ongoing financial crisis, having provided aid - food, medicines, fuel, etc., - worth nearly $4 billion since the storm broke.</p>

<p>Mr Dissanayake, however, has said he will try to renegotiate the IMF's loan conditions, some of which led to tax hikes and spending cuts, which many in Colombo said actually exacerbated the cost-of-living crisis that sparked the violent protests of 2019 and 2020. Reviewing the debt plan, though, risks delaying additional loans he needs to meet fiscal criteria before more funds are released.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[For Hamas, the hostages are key bargaining chips to negotiate a truce with Israel and seek the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Hamas militants staged the worst-ever attack on Israel, they took back into the Gaza Strip 251 hostages, some of them already dead. A year later, 64 people, including two children, are still in captivity and Israel believes they are alive.</p>

<p>For the Palestinian militant group that rules the Gaza Strip, the hostages are key bargaining chips to negotiate a truce with Israel and seek the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.</p>

<p>Here is what we know about the hostages still held in Gaza.</p>

<h3><strong>52 men, 10 women, two children</strong></h3>

<p>Of the 251 hostages seized by militants on October 7, 2023, 117 have been freed, most of them women, children and foreign workers.</p>

<p>Most were released during a week-long truce in late November in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.</p>

<p>Nearly a year later, Israel believes 64 hostages still held in Gaza are alive.</p>

<p>The army has confirmed 70 others are dead, 33 of whose bodies are still in Gaza.</p>

<p>The military has repatriated the bodies of 37 hostages who either died in Gaza or were killed on October 7 and taken to the territory.</p>

<p>Of the 64 thought to be alive, 57 are Israelis, though some of them have more than one nationality. Another six are Thai nationals and one is Nepalese.</p>

<p>Fifty-two are men and 10 are women. Eleven are military personnel.</p>

<p>Two are children.</p>

<p>The youngest hostage, Kfir, was just eight-and-a-half months old when he was kidnapped. The other is his brother Ariel, who was only four years old when he was taken to Gaza.</p>

<p>Hamas has said the two children are dead, but Israel has not confirmed this.</p>

<h3><strong>No proof of life</strong></h3>

<p>Since the truce ended on December 1, only seven other hostages have been freed alive, all during Israeli military operations.</p>

<p>With no proof of life, uncertainty remains over whether the 64 are still alive.</p>

<p>The armed wing of Hamas said on August 12 that its fighters had shot and killed an Israeli hostage and injured two others.</p>

<p>Hamas has announced on several occasions deaths of hostages that have not been confirmed by Israel, leaving families in agonising limbo.</p>

<h3><strong>Bodies taken to Gaza</strong></h3>

<p>On October 7, Hamas militants took several dead back into Gaza with them, including 10 Israeli soldiers' bodies.</p>

<p>At least 28 other hostages have died in the territory since the start of the war.</p>

<p>Three were killed in error by the Israeli army on December 15, 2023. They were Yotam Haim, 28, Samer El-Talalqa and Alon Shamriz, 26.</p>

<p>The Israeli army accuses Hamas of executing six others in August: Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Alexander Lobonov, Almog Sarusi and Ori Danino.</p>

<p>They were found dead by soldiers in a tunnel in Rafah, in southern Gaza.</p>

<h3><strong>Festival, kibbutz survivors</strong></h3>

<p>Most of the hostages were taken during the attack on the Nir Oz kibbutz and on the Nova music festival.</p>

<p>At Nir Oz kibbutz, of the at least 76 hostages taken on October 7, 40 were released alive. Another 20 are still in Gaza and believed to be alive. The remaining 16 are dead.</p>

<p>Only 17 people abducted from the festival are thought to be alive and still being held in Gaza.</p>

<p>Only nine of at least 43 hostages taken from Nova have been released, while 17 others have died.</p>

<h3><strong>Whole families</strong></h3>

<p>On October 7, whole families were taken to Gaza. For them, the November 2023 truce brought relief but also the heartache of leaving loved ones behind.</p>

<p>French-Israeli children Eitan, Erez and Sahar were freed but their fathers Ohad Yahalomi and Ofer Kalderon are still being held.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video of UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer calling on Hamas to return "the sausages" as he urged a peaceful solution to the Gaza war with Israel went viral on Tuesday. Starmer's slip of the tongue came while he was speaking at the Labour Party conference in Liverpool, northwest England, as he meant to say "hostages".</p>

<p>Having first called for "restraint and de-escalation at the border between Lebanon and Israel", Starmer moved on to the Gaza conflict.</p>

<p>"I call again for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the return of the sausages," he said, before quickly correcting himself with "the hostages" as applause rang out around the conference hall.</p>

<p>"And a recommitment to the two-state solution, a recognised Palestinian state alongside a safe and secure Israel," he continued.</p>

<p>Almost as soon as the words had left Starmer's mouth, the video went viral on X and by Tuesday evening it was the second most shared content.</p>

<p>British media were quick to jump on Starmer's mistake, with the left-wing Guardian calling it a "gaffe" and the right-wing Daily Mail noting a "faux-pas".</p>

<p>Starmer was referring to the nearly year-long war that broke out after the attack by Hamas militants on Israel on October 7 last year and the Israeli ground invasion of Gaza that followed.</p>

<p>Recent escalation has seen Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah move to the brink of all-out war.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Trump's campaign team said in a statement Tuesday that US intelligence had warned the former president of "real and specific" threats from Iran to assassinate him.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump said Wednesday there were "big threats" on his life posed by Iran after the Republican presidential candidate's campaign team said US intelligence warned him of "real and specific" threats from Tehran.</p>

<p>"Big threats on my life by Iran. The entire US Military is watching and waiting," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>"Moves were already made by Iran that didn't work out, but they will try again. I am surrounded by more men, guns, and weapons than I have ever seen before," he said, following increased scrutiny of the US Secret Service since two attempts on Trump's life this year.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign team said in a statement Tuesday that US intelligence had warned the former president of "real and specific" threats from Iran to assassinate him.</p>

<p>It was not immediately clear if the threats referred to by the campaign and Trump himself were new or threats that have previously been reported.</p>

<p>"President Trump was briefed earlier today by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence regarding real and specific threats from Iran to assassinate him in an effort to destabilize and sow chaos in the United States," campaign communications director Steven Cheung said in the statement.</p>

<p>"Intelligence officials have identified that these continued and coordinated attacks have heightened in the past few months, and law enforcement officials across all agencies are working to ensure President Trump is protected and the election is free from interference," he added.</p>

<p>The campaign did not elaborate on the claims, which come as world leaders scramble to try to avert hostilities between Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel escalating into a wider regional war.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Iran has rejected accusations that it is trying to kill Trump this summer, shortly after a gunman opened fire at a rally in Pennsylvania, killing one person and wounding the presidential candidate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Days after the July 13 assassination attempt, US media reported that authorities had received intelligence on an alleged Iranian plot against the Republican, prompting his protection to be boosted. Iran rejected the "malicious" accusations.</p>

<p>"If they do 'assassinate President Trump,' which is always a possibility, I hope that America obliterates Iran, wipes it off the face of the Earth -- If that does not happen, American Leaders will be considered 'gutless' cowards!" Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, at the time.</p>

<h3><strong>Iranian cyberattackers</strong></h3>

<p>US intelligence agencies have also accused Iran of a hack targeting Trump's campaign, alleging Tehran is seeking to influence the 2024 election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A joint statement from the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency this month said Iranian cyberattackers had offered "stolen, non-public" material from Trump's campaign to staff for his then-White House rival, President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>"Foreign actors are increasing their election influence activities" as Election Day in November approaches, the statement said, singling out Russia, Iran and China as "trying by some measure to exacerbate divisions in US society for their own benefit."</p>

<p>The US agencies said the Iranian cyberattackers had also attempted to share the information stolen from the Trump campaign with US media organizations. It did not name the outlets.</p>

<p>Iran has also vehemently denied those accusations.</p>

<p>The campaign of Trump's presidential election rival, Democrat Kamala Harris, said on August 13 that it too had been targeted by foreign hackers, but did not give an indication of which country was believed to be behind the attempt.</p>

<p>Americans cast their ballots on November 5. Polls show Trump and Harris, who launched her campaign after Biden dropped out earlier this summer, are neck and neck.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[At the time of the incident, the Democratic campaign office in Tempe, located just east of Phoenix in Arizona, was unoccupied and nobody was injured in the attack.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Multiple gunshots were fired at a campaign office of US Vice President Kamala Harris in Arizona, police said. The gunshot damage from several bullets, believed to have been fired sometime after midnight on Monday, was discovered at the Democratic campaign office near Southern Avenue and Priest Drive in Tempe, the city police told The New York Post.<br />
<br />
“No one was inside the office during the overnight hours, but this raises concerns about the safety of those who work in that building, as well as those nearby,” Public Information Officer Ryan Cook said.<br />
<br />
According to the Tempe Police Department, the matter is currently being looked upon as a potential property crime. In footage aired by the local TV stations, two bullet holes were seen in a door, while two others were in windows of the office.<br />
<br />
Currently, the investigators are analysing the evidence collected from the party office, while additional measures have been taken to tighten the security of the staff members and others in the area, police said.<br />
Shockingly, this was the second time criminal damage was reported at the property in as many weeks.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Earlier, the front windows of the office were shot by what appeared to be a BB gun or pellet gun, just after midnight on September 16. So far, no arrests have been made in either incident, while the authorities investigate all possible angles and motives.<br />
<br />
In a statement, Sean McEnerney, the Arizona Democratic Party coordinated campaign manager, thanked the city police for swiftly taking action on the matter.<br />
<br />
“We are grateful to Tempe Police for coming quickly to the scene and are fortunate no one was present or injured,” McEnerney said.</p>

<h3><strong>Kamala Harris' Arizona visit</strong></h3>

<p>The twin shootings at the local campaign office of the party took place days before US Vice President Kamala Harris was scheduled to touch down in Arizona, a key battleground state in the November 5 presidential election in the US.<br />
<br />
As per reports, Harris will campaign across the Grand Canyon State during her visit.<br />
<br />
Further, sources told The New York Times that Harris plans to visit the US-Mexico border on Friday, seeking to counter Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's advantage with voters on the immigration issue.</p>

<h3><strong>Assassination attempt on Trump</strong></h3>

<p>The alleged attack on the local campaign office in Arizona comes on the heels of the second assassination attempt on former US president Donald Trump at his West Palm Beach golf course on September 15.<br />
<br />
Ryan Routh, the gunman, was uncovered by a Secret Service agent, who spotted the muzzle of a rifle sticking out of the bushes. The agent fired before Routh had the chance to fire a single shot. Soon after, Routh allegedly dropped his rifle and fled in a car, but was arrested in 40 minutes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>German YouTuber Naomi Seibt has shared on microblogging website x (formerly known as Twitter) that she had experienced a truly unforgettable Uber ride when her Tesla car arrived to pick her up. The experience, which Naomi described in words as the "best of her life," was made special by having a chance to ride in the self-driving car mode.</p>

<p>According to Seibt, it felt surreal and revolutionary to be riding in such advanced technology. She went so far as to predict that self-driving technology will dramatically change the future of driving.</p>

<p>She shared her excitement on X in a video clip, detailing the conversation with the driver about the car's progress and her awe at the futuristic technology.</p>

<p>"Self-driving Tesla first experience. Best Uber ride of my life: I got to witness first-hand how the new Tesla manages to manoeuvre around obstacles and steer the wheel automatically. This technology will revolutionise the market; no one can come close. Respect, Elon Musk," she captioned the video.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[It is the first time the group has claimed a ballistic missile strike since its nearly year-long battle with Israel began after Hamas carried out its October 7 attack.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hezbollah said Wednesday it had fired a ballistic missile targeting Israeli spy agency Mossad's headquarters near Tel Aviv, saying that recent attacks on the militant group had been planned there. It is the first time the group has claimed a ballistic missile strike since its nearly year-long battle with Israel began after Hamas carried out its October 7 attack.</p>

<p>Earlier Wednesday, Israel's military had said it intercepted a missile fired from Lebanon after sirens sounded in Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>"The Islamic Resistance launched a 'Qader 1' ballistic missile at 6:30 am (0330 GMT) on Wednesday, 25-9-2024, targeting the Mossad headquarters in the outskirts of Tel Aviv," Hezbollah said in a statement.</p>

<p>"This headquarters is responsible for the assassination of leaders and the explosion of pagers and wireless devices," it added, referring to attacks last week that killed scores in Lebanon including a top commander.</p>

<p>It also said the strike was carried out in support of the people of Gaza and "in defence of Lebanon and its people".</p>

<p>Longtime foes Hezbollah and Israel have been locked in near-daily exchanges of cross-border fire since Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7.</p>

<p>The Hamas attack sparked a war in Gaza that has drawn in Hezbollah and other Iran-backed militants from across the Middle East.</p>

<p>The focus of Israel's firepower has shifted sharply from Gaza to Lebanon in recent days.</p>

<p>The Lebanese health ministry said Israeli strikes killed at least 558 people on Monday -- the deadliest day of violence in the country since its 1975-90 civil war.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Advait Paliwal, an Indian-origin entrepreneur, has recently introduced a wearable AI device called Iris, designed to provide users with "infinite memory." According to Paliwal, the device captures "pictures every minute," which are stored either on the device or in the cloud, allowing users to preserve life's small moments and recognize patterns often overlooked.</p>

<p>In a series of tweets, Mr Paliwal, who is based in San Francisco, explained that Iris not only organises the photos into a timeline but also uses AI to generate captions and help users recall forgotten details. Additionally, the device features a "focus mode," which detects when the wearer is distracted and offers reminders to refocus.</p>

<p><em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://advaitpaliwal.notion.site/Iris-d05b5e2cfe4b4314b8732c73d24e2397">Mr Paliwal</a></em> shared that the design of Iris is inspired by the evil eye symbol. He developed the device over the summer at the Augmentation Lab in Cambridge, part of a two-month AI and hardware talent accelerator program. After the program, Mr Paliwal presented Iris to over 250 attendees at the MIT Media Lab, where he received positive feedback, with many expressing interest in owning the device.</p>

<p>Highlighting its potential, Mr Paliwal suggested that Iris could offer safety and health benefits, such as aiding doctors in understanding patients' daily habits or ensuring workplace safety compliance. In elderly care, the device could help caregivers monitor patients without being intrusive.</p>

<p>However, after Mr Paliwal shared his post on X (formerly Twitter), reactions were mixed. While some users expressed excitement, others raised privacy concerns. One person commented, "It's an interesting concept, but I wouldn't want to interact with someone wearing this, taking a photo every minute." Paliwal responded by pointing out that people are already "constantly taking mental photos."</p>

<p>Others were more enthusiastic, with one user noting, "I've been searching for a device like this for years! A picture every minute should be enough if it archives, organizes, labels, and retrieves them." Another user praised the concept, saying, "Love the idea. The design and name are perfect. Great work!"</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The son of Ryan Routh, who is accused of plotting to assassinate Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at his golf course, has been arrested on charges of possessing child pornography. Oran Alexander Routh has been charged with one count of receipt of child pornography and another count of possession of child pornography, NBC News reported.</p>

<p>Records at a district court showed Oran Routh was arrested on Tuesday, while there was no attorney listed for him. As per public reports, Oran is the son of Ryan Routh, who is believed to have hatched the plot to target the former US president at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, on September 15.</p>

<p><strong>'Hundreds' of files uncovered</strong></p>

<p>An FBI search was carried out at Oran's home in North Carolina on Saturday in connection with an unrelated case, as per the criminal complaint.&nbsp;An SD card found in a phone in his bedroom allegedly contained "hundreds" of files having child sex abuse images.</p>

<p>The files include videos from a "known" series. It includes videos of an adult man with a "prepubescent" girl, believed to be under the age of 10, the complaint states.</p>

<p>Another handset, recovered from Oran Routh's possession, had a downloaded folder with additional video files. A review of the device uncovered a video of an adult woman with a child, aged around 6-8 years.</p>

<p>Further, investigating officers also uncovered a messaging app on the smartphone which is "commonly used by individuals who distribute and receive child pornography."</p>

<p>According to the complaint, the individual, who sent the messages from the handset asked for a preview of digital content being sold. Later, two files were shared and both included adults engaging in sexual activities with minors.</p>

<p>The warrant for Oran's arrest was filed in the federal court on Monday, the NBC News report states.</p>

<p><strong>Cocaine, MDMA, Ketamine seized</strong></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Oran Routh has also been charged with drug possession as the law enforcement officers seized cocaine, Ketamine and MDMA along with gold and black trays having white powdery substance from his house.</p>

<p>It further prompted two felony and two misdemeanour charges for possession, records show.</p>

<p><strong>Case against Ryan Routh</strong></p>

<p>On Tuesday, US prosecutors charged Ryan Routh with the attempt to kill Donald Trump, according to the US Department of Justice. He has also been charged with possession of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, assaulting a Secret Service agent among others.</p>

<p>He is currently in custody and faces a maximum of life in prison if found convicted in the case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dr Jay Varma, the former COVID-19 czar of New York City, has been fired from his position at SIGA Technologies following the revelation of his involvement in drug-fuelled sex parties during the pandemic. Dr Varma's NYC COVID policies drew national attention when Brooklyn Nets' Kyrie Irving was banned from playing for refusing vaccination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr Varma, who previously served as a senior health adviser under former Mayor Bill de Blasio, was reported to have boasted about attending underground raves and hosting parties while the city was under severe lockdowns. These admissions were made public through secretly recorded conversations.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>On September 23, SIGA Technologies issued a <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/23/us-news/ex-nyc-covid-czar-jay-varma-fired-from-job-after-sex-party-scandal/ ">statement</a> confirming Dr Varma's immediate termination, stating, “Pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement, Dr Varma's service on the Company's Board of Directors also automatically ended effective immediately”.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The scandal erupted last week when podcaster Steven Crowder released clips of Dr Varma's candid discussions, in which he said, “I did all this deviant, like sexual stuff,” and confessed to sneaking around due to his role in managing the city's COVID response.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In one recorded conversation, Dr Varma recounted hosting a party in August 2020 where attendees used MDMA: “So we rented a hotel … we all took, like, you know, molly and like it was like eight or nine or us, eight to 10 of us were in a room and everybody had a blast because everybody was like so pent up.”</p>

<p>Dr Varma also recalled attending a June 2021 rave with hundreds of attendees, and when asked if he regretted his actions, he replied, “No, actually, I'm like, I love being my authentic self.” A source revealed that Dr Varma hosted another gathering in November 2020.</p>

<p>City Councilwoman Inna Vernikov condemned Dr Varma's actions, stating, “While grandmothers took their last breaths alone on cold hospital beds, Dr Varma was fulfilling his sick fantasies with hundreds of sweaty strangers.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Michael Kane of Teachers for Choice said he was disgusted “hearing Varma say having drug-fuelled group sex orgies was necessary for him to be his ‘authentic self' because COVID had him ‘pent up.'”</p>

<p>Despite the uproar, a source close to Dr Varma defended him, claiming that “he technically didn't violate the mandate” and that his statements were taken out of context.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr Varma himself issued a statement acknowledging his actions, saying, “In those private conversations that were secretly recorded, spliced, diced and taken out of context, I referred to events that transpired four years ago. Between April 2020 – May 2021, I participated in two private gatherings. I take responsibility for not using the best judgement at the time.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2020 clash between Indian and Chinese troops in Galwan Valley overshadowed the relations between the two countries and New Delhi's focus for the last four years has been disengagement on the border, External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar has said.</p>

<p>Addressing an event titled 'India, Asia and the World' in New York yesterday, Dr Jaishankar said the India-China relationship is key to the future of Asia and would influence the entire world.</p>

<p>"I think the India-China relationship is key to the future of Asia. In a way, you can say that if the world is to be multi-polar, Asia has to be multi-polar. And therefore this relationship will influence not just the future of Asia, but in that way, perhaps the future of the world as well," Dr Jaishankar said, according to news agency PTI. The event was hosted by Asia Society and Asia Society Policy Institute.</p>

<p>The External Affairs Minister said India had a "difficult history" with China. "You have two countries who are neighbours, unique in the sense that they are the only two countries with over a billion people, both rising in the global order and who often have overlapping peripheries, including the fact that they have a common border. So it's really a very complicated issue. I think, if you look today in global politics, the parallel rises of India and China present a very, very unique problem," he said.</p>

<p>He referred to a recent remark that 75 per cent of the disengagement problems with China have been sorted out. "When I said 75 per cent of it has been sorted out - I was asked in a way to quantify - it's only of the disengagement. So that's one part of the problem. The main issue right now is the patrolling. You know, how do we, both of us, patrol up to the Line of Actual Control."</p>

<p>Dr Jaishankar said patrolling arrangements have been disturbed after 2020. "So we've been able to sort out much of the disengagement, the friction points, but some of the patrolling issues need to be resolved." He said that once the disengagement issue is dealt with, "there is the larger issue as both of us have brought a very large number of troops up to the border". "So there is what we call the de-escalation issue, and then there is the larger, the next step is really, how do you deal with the rest of the relationship?"</p>

<p>The minister said the "entire 3500 kilometre-border between India and China is disputed". "And so you make sure the border is peaceful so that other parts of the relationship can move."</p>

<p>Dr Jaishankar said several agreements between the two countries detailed how to ensure the border remained peaceful.</p>

<p>"Now the problem was in 2020, despite these very explicit agreements, we saw that the Chinese - we were all in the middle of Covid at that time - moved a large number of forces in violation of these agreements to the Line of Actual Control. And we responded in kind," he said. "Once troops were deployed very close up, which is 'very dangerous', it was likely a mishap could happen, and it did happen."</p>

<p>Referring to the 2020 Galwan clash, he said, "So there was a clash, and a number of troops died on either side, and that has since, in a sense, overshadowed the relationship. So until we can restore peace and tranquillity on the border and ensure the agreements signed up to are adhered to, it's obviously difficult to carry on with the rest of the relationship."</p>

<p>The External Affairs Minister said the focus for the last four years had been to at least disengage the troops, meaning that they go back to the camp, the military bases from which they traditionally operate.&nbsp;"Because right now, both sides have troops deployed forward," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The digital rights group NOYB (None Of Your Business) said Mozilla has enabled a feature that turned the browser into a tracking tool for websites without directly telling its users.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vienna-based advocacy group NOYB on Wednesday said it has filed a complaint with the Austrian data protection authority against Mozilla accusing the Firefox browser maker of tracking user behaviour on websites without consent. NOYB (None Of Your Business), the digital rights group founded by privacy activist Max Schrems, said Mozilla has enabled a so-called "privacy preserving attribution" feature that turned the browser into a tracking tool for websites without directly telling its users.</p>

<p>Mozilla had defended the feature, saying it wanted to help websites understand how their ads perform without collecting data about individual people. By offering what it called a non-invasive alternative to cross-site tracking, it hoped to significantly reduce collecting individual information.</p>

<p>While this may be less invasive than unlimited tracking, it still interferes with user rights under the EU's privacy laws, NOYB said, adding that Firefox has turned on the feature by default.</p>

<p>"It's a shame that an organisation like Mozilla believes that users are too dumb to say yes or no," said Felix Mikolasch, data protection lawyer at NOYB. "Users should be able to make a choice and the feature should have been turned off by default."</p>

<p>Open-source Firefox was once a top browser choice among users due to its privacy features but now lags market leader Google's Chrome, Apple's Safari and Microsoft's Edge with a low single-digit market share.</p>

<p>NOYB wants Mozilla to inform users about its data processing activities, switch to an opt-in system and delete all unlawfully processed data of millions of affected users.</p>

<p>NOYB, which in June filed a complaint against Alphabet for allegedly tracking users of its Chrome browser, had also filed hundreds of complaints against big tech companies, some leading to big fines.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a first, an American woman reportedly died by suicide inside a new 3D-printed “suicide pod”, Sarco, in a forest cabin in Merishausen, Switzerland. The 64-year-old woman, who has not been publicly named, entered the Sarco pod on Monday. The machine allegedly encouraged her with a chilling message before her last moments, “If you want to die, press this button,” according to a report by AFP.</p>

<p>The Sarco pod, short for ‘sarcophagus', operates by flooding its chamber with nitrogen gas. That leads to a rapid decrease in oxygen levels due to which the person becomes unconscious within moments. Death typically occurs within ten minutes.</p>

<p>Florian Willet, co-president of the assisted suicide group Exit International's Swiss affiliate, the Last Resort, was the only witness present during the incident. He described the woman's death as “peaceful, fast and dignified,” as reported by the organisation. The woman suffered from “severe immune compromise,” the group said.</p>

<p>Dr Philip Nitschke, director of Exit International was “pleased” by the pod's performance. He stated, “I am pleased that the Sarco had performed exactly as it had been designed… to provide an elective, non-drug, peaceful death at the time of the person's choosing.”</p>

<p>Although the pod is designed with an emergency exit button, the device is not yet legally approved for use. Authorities have since arrested several individuals connected to the woman's death.</p>

<p>Switzerland allows assisted suicide, but individuals must do so without help from a doctor, meaning those who assist cannot act for selfish reasons. Unlike the Netherlands, where euthanasia with medical assistance is legal, Swiss law forbids euthanasia entirely.</p>

<p>Swiss Health Minister Elisabeth Baume-Schneider has voiced scepticism regarding the Sarco pod's potential approval, noting, “It does not fulfil the demands of the product safety law, and as such, must not be brought into circulation.” She added that the use of nitrogen is “not compatible with the article on purpose in the chemicals law.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

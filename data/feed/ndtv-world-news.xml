       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Countries at the United Nations COP29 climate summit in Azerbaijan will attempt to agree rules for a global system for trading carbon offset credits.</p>

<h2><strong>Here's what you should know:</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>WHAT ARE CARBON OFFSETS?</strong></h2>

<p>Some governments and companies may struggle to reduce their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to meet their climate targets. Supporters of carbon offsets see them as a key means to help meet these goals.</p>

<p>These offsets allow one nation or company to offset some of their emissions by paying for actions to cut emissions elsewhere. These actions might include rural solar panel installations or converting a fleet of petrol buses to electric.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT IS ARTICLE 6?</strong></h3>

<p>Article 6 of the Paris Agreement helps countries work together to reduce their carbon emissions. It sets out two options for countries and companies to trade offsets, helping them meet the goals they set to reduce planetary-warming gases in their climate action plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs).</p>

<p>One allows two countries to set their own terms for a bilateral carbon trading agreement, this is known as Article 6.2. The second aims to create a central, UN-managed system for countries and companies to begin offsetting their carbon emissions and trading those offsets, known as Article 6.4.</p>

<p>Article 6 is seen an important mechanism for delivering climate finance to developing countries, and a Paris Agreement carbon market, if launched, could continue operating even if the United States under Donald Trump withdraws support for the Paris Agreement.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT'S BEEN DECIDED SO FAR?</strong></h3>

<p>At the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, negotiators reached a breakthrough agreement that established a broad rulebook to regulate trading of carbon credits.</p>

<p>But after two weeks of talks at COP28 in Dubai, countries failed to seal a deal on necessary details to operationalise a central carbon trading system or to clarify rules for nations wanting to make bilateral arrangements.</p>

<p>Some countries like Japan and Indonesia have decided to press ahead with bilateral agreements without those clarifications and are already preparing to trade carbon credits, known as "internationally transferable mitigation outcomes" (ITMOs). The UN says 91 agreements had been made between 56 countries as of October this year. Thailand and Switzerland completed the first sale in January, and the market for bilateral trade agreements is still quite small.</p>

<p>Some buyers are worried there are not adequate rules to stop countries changing the terms of the agreements, or revoking them, and that there is not a robust system to ensure that credits bought and sold are not being counted by both the buying and selling countries.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT WILL BE DECIDED AT COP29?</strong></h3>

<p>Officials are keen to secure an early "win" on Article 6 at this year's climate conference.</p>

<p>Market watchers are hopeful an agreement can be reached to set guardrails for the bilateral agreements and to operationalise the UN-backed centralised marketplace.</p>

<p>Guardrails include checks and balances to provide assurance countries are buying and selling actual emissions reductions. Some countries for example want methods nations use to generate credits to be checked internationally.</p>

<p>Countries will also negotiate whether the UN's central registry can itself house credits that can be transacted and retired or whether it should operate just for accounting purposes.</p>

<p>An expert group elected under United Nations rules has already hammered out a framework for the multilateral trading system to ensure credits meet basic quality standards. But countries at COP29 can decide to either sign off on this standard, open up further discussions, or reject it.</p>

<p>After COP29, the technical expert group will meet again to agree which methodologies for generating carbon credits through cookstoves projects or reforestation for example can issue credits into the new Paris Aligned system.</p>

<p>If the key points are resolved this year, the system could launch as soon as 2025.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE VOLUNTARY CARBON MARKET?</strong></h3>

<p>Some companies that are under no legal obligation to cut their emissions have set voluntary targets, which they can meet partially through buying credits on a voluntary carbon market. In 2022, the voluntary market was valued at about $2 billion worldwide. But the market value plummeted to $723 million last year after being shaken by repeated scandals.</p>

<p>Linking up carbon projects currently in the voluntary market with the Paris Agreement system could boost confidence.</p>

<p>Developers of projects like mangrove restoration to regenerative agriculture can apply to have their credits sold under the UN system, meaning that if approved, they could sell in either that system or on the voluntary market. Experts expect UN-approved credits to carry a higher price tag.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump has begun the process of choosing a cabinet and selecting other high-ranking administration officials following his presidential election victory.</p>

<p>Here are the early picks and top contenders for some of the key posts overseeing defence, intelligence, diplomacy, trade, immigration and economic policymaking. Some are in contention for a range of posts.</p>

<p><strong>SUSIE WILES, chief of staff</strong></p>

<p>Trump on Thursday announced that Wiles, one of his two campaign managers, will be his White House chief of staff.</p>

<p>While the specifics of her political views are somewhat unclear, Wiles, 67, is credited with running a successful and efficient campaign. Supporters hope she will instil a sense of order and discipline that was often lacking during Trump's first four-year term when he cycled through a number of chiefs of staff.</p>

<p><strong>TOM HOMAN, 'border czar'</strong></p>

<p>Trump announced on Sunday night that Homan, the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement from his first administration, will be in charge of the country's borders.</p>

<p>Trump made cracking down on people in the country illegally a central element of his campaign, promising mass deportations.</p>

<p>Homan said on Monday he would prioritize deporting immigrants in the U.S. illegally who posed safety and security threats as well as those working at job sites.</p>

<p>Trump, in a post on his Truth Social platform, said Homan will be "in charge of our nation's borders ("The Border Czar"), including, but not limited to, the Southern Border, the Northern Border, all Maritime, and Aviation Security," including the deportation of immigrants in the U.S. illegally.</p>

<p><strong>ELISE STEFANIK, U.N. ambassador</strong></p>

<p>Trump announced on Monday that Stefanik, a Republican congresswoman and staunch Trump supporter, would be his ambassador to the United Nations.</p>

<p>Stefanik, 40, a U.S. representative from New York state and House Republican conference chair, took a leadership position in the House of Representatives in 2021 when she was elected to replace then-Representative Liz Cheney, who was ousted for criticizing Trump's false claims of election fraud.</p>

<p>"I am honored to nominate Chairwoman Elise Stefanik to serve in my Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations," Trump said in a statement. "Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter."</p>

<p>Stefanik will arrive at the U.N. after bold promises by Trump to end the Russia-Ukraine war and Israel's war in Gaza.</p>

<p><strong>SCOTT BESSENT, potential treasury secretary</strong></p>

<p>Bessent, a key economic adviser to Trump, is widely seen as a top candidate for treasury secretary. A longtime hedge fund investor who taught at Yale University for several years, Bessent has a warm relationship with the president-elect.</p>

<p>While Bessent has long favored the laissez-faire policies that were popular in the pre-Trump Republican Party, he has also spoken highly of Trump's use of tariffs as a negotiating tool. He has praised the president-elect's economic philosophy, which rests on a skepticism of both regulations and international trade.</p>

<p><strong>JOHN PAULSON, potential treasury secretary</strong></p>

<p>Paulson, a billionaire hedge fund manager and major Trump donor, is another top contender for treasury secretary. The longtime financier has told associates he would be interested in the job.</p>

<p>A longtime proponent of tax cuts and deregulation, Paulson's profile is broadly similar to that of other potential members of Trump's economic team. He has publicly supported targeted tariffs as a tool to ensure U.S. national security and combat unfair trade practices abroad.</p>

<p>One high-profile fundraiser hosted by Paulson in April raked in over $50 million for the former president.</p>

<p><strong>LARRY KUDLOW, potential treasury secretary</strong></p>

<p>Fox Business Network personality Larry Kudlow, who served as director of the National Economic Council for much of Trump's first term, has an outside shot at becoming his treasury secretary and would likely have an opportunity to take a separate economics-focused position if he is interested.</p>

<p>While he is privately skeptical of broad tariffs, there is publicly little daylight between the policies Kudlow advocates and those of the president-elect.</p>

<p><strong>ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, potential treasury secretary</strong></p>

<p>A loyalist who served as Trump's U.S. trade representative for essentially the then-president's entire term, Lighthizer will almost certainly be invited back. Though Bessent and Paulson likely have a better shot at becoming treasury secretary, Lighthizer has an outside chance, and he might be able to reprise his old role if he's interested.</p>

<p>Like Trump, Lighthizer is a trade skeptic and a firm believer in tariffs. He was one of the leading figures in Trump's trade war with China and the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, with Mexico and Canada during Trump's first term.</p>

<p><strong>HOWARD LUTNICK, potential treasury secretary</strong></p>

<p>The co-chair of Trump's transition effort and the longtime chief executive of financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald, Lutnick is in the running for treasury secretary.</p>

<p>A bombastic New Yorker like Trump, Lutnick has uniformly praised the president-elect's economic policies, including his use of tariffs.</p>

<p>He has at times given elaborate, unvarnished opinions about what policies will be enacted in Trump's second term. Some Trump allies had privately complained that he too often presented himself as speaking on behalf of the campaign.</p>

<p><strong>LINDA McMAHON, potential commerce secretary</strong></p>

<p>Professional wrestling magnate and former Small Business Administration director Linda McMahon is seen as the frontrunner to lead Trump's Department of Commerce, three sources briefed on the plans said.</p>

<p>McMahon is a major donor and was an early supporter of the Republican president-elect when he first ran for the White House almost a decade ago. This time, Trump tapped her to co-lead a transition team formed to help vet personnel and draft policy ahead of the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>McMahon is the co-founder and former CEO of the professional wrestling franchise WWE. She later served as director of the Small Business Administration, resigning in 2019, and went on to lead a pro-Trump political action committee that supported his 2020 reelection bid.</p>

<p><strong>RICHARD GRENELL, potential secretary of state&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Grenell is among Trump's closest foreign policy advisers. During the president-elect's first four-year term, he served as acting director of national intelligence and U.S. ambassador to Germany. When Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in September, Grenell sat in on the private meeting.</p>

<p>Grenell's private dealings with foreign leaders and often-caustic personality have made him the center of multiple controversies, though significant Republican gains in the Senate mean he could likely be confirmed. He is also considered a top contender for national security adviser, which does not require Senate confirmation.</p>

<p>Among the policies he has advocated for is setting up an autonomous zone in eastern Ukraine to end the war there, a position Kyiv considers unacceptable.</p>

<p><strong>ROBERT O'BRIEN, potential secretary of state</strong></p>

<p>O'Brien, Trump's fourth and final national security adviser during his first term, maintains a close relationship with Trump, and the two often speak on national security matters.</p>

<p>He is likely in the running for secretary of state or other top foreign policy and national security posts. He has maintained close contacts with foreign leaders since Trump left office, having met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel in May.</p>

<p>His views are somewhat more hawkish than some of Trump's advisers. He has, for instance, been more supportive of military aid for Ukraine than many of his Republican contemporaries, and he is a proponent of banning TikTok in the United States.</p>

<p><strong>BILL HAGERTY, potential secretary of state</strong></p>

<p>A U.S. senator from Tennessee who worked on Trump's 2016 transition effort, Hagerty is considered a top contender for secretary of state. He has maintained solid relations with essentially all factions of the Republican Party, and could likely be confirmed with ease in the Senate.</p>

<p>He served as U.S. ambassador to Japan in the first Trump administration at a time when the president touted his warm relationship with then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.</p>

<p>Hagerty's policies are broadly in line with Trump's. Earlier in the year, he voted against a major military aid package for Ukraine.</p>

<p><strong>MARCO RUBIO, potential secretary of state</strong></p>

<p>Rubio, a U.S. senator from Florida and 2016 Republican presidential candidate, is also a top secretary of state contender whose policies hew closely to those of Trump. Like Hagerty, he was a contender to be Trump's 2024 running mate.</p>

<p>Rubio has long been involved in foreign affairs in the Senate, particularly as it relates to Latin America, and he has solid relationships throughout the party.</p>

<p><strong>MIKE WALTZ, potential defense secretary</strong></p>

<p>A former Army Green Beret who is currently a U.S. congressman from Florida, Waltz has established himself as one of the foremost China hawks in the House.</p>

<p>Among the various China-related bills he has co-sponsored are measures designed to lessen U.S. reliance on critical minerals mined in China.</p>

<p>Waltz is on speaking terms with Trump and is widely considered to be a serious contender for secretary of defense.</p>

<p><strong>KEITH KELLOGG, potential candidate for national security adviser</strong></p>

<p>A retired lieutenant general who served as chief of staff to the National Security Council under Trump, Kellogg has Trump's ear and is a contender for national security adviser, among other national security posts.</p>

<p>During the campaign, he presented Trump with a plan to end the war in Ukraine, which involved forcing both parties to the negotiating table and ruling out NATO membership for Ukraine for the foreseeable future, among other measures.</p>

<p><strong>MARK GREEN, potential homeland security secretary</strong></p>

<p>A former Army flight surgeon and the current chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, Green is considered by some Trump allies in Washington as a contender for the top job at the Department of Homeland Security . His supporters describe him as a Trump loyalist and immigration hardliner who also has significant legislative experience.</p>

<p>Green was nominated by Trump during his first term to serve as secretary of the Army, but he withdrew his name as past statements, which were widely seen as transphobic and Islamophobic, drew more scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>JOHN RATCLIFFE, potential attorney general</strong></p>

<p>A former congressman and prosecutor who served as director of national intelligence during Trump's last year in office, Ratcliffe is seen as a potential attorney general, though he could also take a separate national security or intelligence position, such as CIA director.</p>

<p>The president-elect's allies view Ratcliffe as a hardcore Trump loyalist who could likely win Senate confirmation. Still, during his time as director of national intelligence, Ratcliffe often contradicted the assessments of career civil servants, drawing criticism from Democrats who said he politicized the role.</p>

<p><strong>MIKE LEE, potential attorney general</strong></p>

<p>A U.S. senator from Utah, Lee is widely seen as another top candidate for attorney general. Though the former prosecutor declined to vote for Trump during the 2016 election, he later became an unwavering ally, and he has become something of an intellectual hero among some factions of Trumpworld.</p>

<p>Lee was a key figure in attempts by Trump and his allies to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden and has spread unfounded conspiracy theories about the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.</p>

<p><strong>KASH PATEL, potential candidate for national security posts</strong></p>

<p>A former Republican House staffer who served in various high-ranking staff roles in the defence and intelligence communities during Trump's first term, Patel frequently appeared on the campaign trail to rally support for the candidate.</p>

<p>Some Trump allies would like to see Patel, considered the ultimate Trump loyalist, appointed CIA director. Any position requiring Senate confirmation may be a challenge, however.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Patel has leaned into controversy throughout his career. In an interview with Trump ally Steve Bannon last year, he promised to "come after" politicians and journalists perceived to be enemies of Trump.</p>

<p>During Trump's first term, Patel drew animosity from some more experienced national security officials, who saw him as volatile and too eager to please the then-president.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Right up to Election Day, Donald Trump and his backers were issuing warnings of voter fraud. But once his decisive victory took shape, the flood of misinformation slowed to a trickle.</p>

<p>Experts said the shift points to what opponents have long argued was Trump's preemptive deployment of fraud claims in case he lost, setting the stage for him to challenge the results as he did in the 2020 election.</p>

<p>A sharp example came toward the end of voting on Tuesday when officials in the largest city of must-win Pennsylvania had to quickly deny Trump's unfounded claim that police were responding to "massive cheating" in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Those were the latest doubts the ex-TV star raised about election fraud. But the false accusations go back to his rejection of the 2020 results that ultimately led to his supporters trying to violently undo President Joe Biden's poll win.</p>

<p>"As soon as the vote came in swinging their way, Republicans stopped making claims of election fraud late Tuesday, proving yet again it was all a gift," Philip Mai, co-director of the Toronto-based Social Media Lab, told AFP.</p>

<p>The drop was particularly noticeable among members of the "Election Integrity Community," a group on X started by Elon Musk's America PAC, which encouraged its some 65,000 members to report irregularities.</p>

<p>When the polls opened on November 5, the group shared over 1,000 posts an hour, according to data collected by the nonprofit National Conference on Citizenship (NCoC).</p>

<p>The pace had fallen dramatically by the time the race was called for Trump in some crucial swing states early on November 6, blocking viable paths to victory for Vice President Kamala Harris.<br />
In the days since the election, the group has posted fewer than 100 posts per hour, NCoC said.</p>

<p>The fraud mentions on some platforms popular on the right began to drop the day before the election -- after rising considerably in the run-up, said Welton Chang, co-founder of Pyrra Technologies, a company that monitors fringe social networks.</p>

<p>"For one thing, Trump himself stopped talking about it," Chang told AFP. "Part of this is a follow-the-leader effect."</p>

<p>The drop-off in fraud narratives, researchers said, was particularly evident on alternative tech platforms catering to conservatives -- including Trump's own Truth Social.</p>

<p><strong>- Trump 'the conductor' -</strong></p>

<p>Not only did Trump go quiet on fraud claims after his Philadelphia allegations, but other Republicans have as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Asked on CNN whether he believed the election was free and fair, lawmaker and hard-line Trump ally Jim Jordan said "I do."</p>

<p>He declined to engage with the suggestion that Republicans only call foul when they lose.<br />
Trump won all seven battleground states and he is on pace to capture the popular vote, which he did not do in his shock election victory in 2016.</p>

<p>The Democratic leadership has not questioned the 2024 election's outcome, with both Biden and Harris conceding the loss and deeming the result a free and fair one.</p>

<p>However, there were 30,300 mentions of the hashtag #DoNotConcedeKamala with one of the words rigged, fraud, or stolen on Musk's social media platform X the morning after the election, data showed. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Danielle Lee Tomson, research manager at the University of Washington Center for an Informed Public, said an isolated number of people on the left have cast doubt on the integrity of the vote.</p>

<p>"No major candidate or political organizer has amplified it," she told AFP. "It is diffuse and significantly smaller because there is no leadership spreading it, whereas on the right that was the case in 2020 and 2022."</p>

<p>She noted that on the right there was evidence from even the early voting period this year that Republicans and MAGA-affiliated influencers -- shorthand for Trump's "Make America Great Again" slogan -- were discussing potential election fraud.</p>

<p>"Think of it like Trump is the conductor, (and) there's a symphony of media and legal infrastructure to really make sure that he won," Tomson said. "That's what they built."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two branches of Qatar's royal family began their fight over a diamond worth millions of dollars at London's High Court on Monday, with a company run by a cousin of Qatar's Emir trying to enforce his alleged right to buy the 70-carat gemstone.</p>

<p>The dispute over the "Idol's Eye" diamond pits art collector Sheikh Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thani, cousin of Qatar's ruler Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, against the relatives of former culture minister Sheikh Saud bin Mohammed Al Thani.</p>

<p>Sheikh Saud, who was Qatar's minister of culture between 1997 and 2005, was one of the world's most prolific art collectors and bought the Idol's Eye diamond in the early 2000s.</p>

<p>He lent the diamond to QIPCO, whose chief executive is Sheikh Hamad bin Abdullah, shortly before he died in 2014.</p>

<p>The agreement gave QIPCO the option to buy the diamond with the consent of Elanus Holdings, a company ultimately linked to Sheikh Saud's relatives.</p>

<p>Elanus is ultimately owned by the Liechtenstein-based Al Thani Foundation, whose beneficiaries are Sheikh Saud's widow and three children.</p>

<p>The two sides disagree over how much the gem is worth.</p>

<p>QIPCO's lawyers say that a 2020 letter sent by the Al Thani Foundation's lawyer amounted to an agreement to sell the Idol's Eye diamond for $10 million and is asking the High Court to order Elanus to sell the gem to QIPCO.</p>

<p>Elanus, however, argues the letter was sent by mistake.</p>

<p>Elanus' lawyer Sa'ad Hossain said in court filings that Sheikh Saud's son Sheikh Hamad bin Saud Al Thani had "only sought to explore the possibility of a sale at the right price", but had not consulted with the foundation's other beneficiaries.</p>

<p>Hossain added that Elanus' diamond expert valued the gemstone at around $27 million, which QIPCO's lawyers said was an attempt to achieve a higher purchase price.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The year 2024 is on course to become the hottest year ever recorded, with global temperatures reaching unprecedented levels, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) warned.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The year 2024 is on course to become the hottest year ever recorded, with global temperatures reaching unprecedented levels, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) warned.</p>

<p>According to a report released on the opening day of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP29) here, the January-September global mean surface temperature was 1.54 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</p>

<p>This alarming surge, driven by an intense El Nino event and rising greenhouse gas concentrations, marks a critical threshold for climate change impacts worldwide.</p>

<p>The report titled "State of the Climate 2024" highlights the accelerating risks posed by global warming, particularly for vulnerable communities. "Climate catastrophe is hammering health, widening inequalities, harming sustainable development, and rocking the foundations of peace," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.</p>

<p>Guterres emphasised the urgent need for climate action to protect those most affected by these changes.</p>

<p>A major finding of the report is the unprecedented temperature increase. The average global temperature for the first nine months of 2024 exceeded the pre-industrial level by 1.54 degrees Celsius, temporarily surpassing the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal set in the Paris Agreement.</p>

<p>Though long-term warming remains around 1.3 degrees Celsius, experts caution that every fraction of a degree compounds the intensity of extreme weather events and exacerbates climate risks.</p>

<p>Another key observation is the surge in ocean heat content, which reached a historic high in 2023 and shows no signs of abating in 2024.</p>

<p>Oceans have absorbed over 90 per cent of the extra energy from global warming, a trend that will have long-term implications for marine life and coastal communities.</p>

<p>Rising ocean temperatures also fuel extreme weather patterns, further intensifying climate challenges.</p>

<p>Sea levels, driven by thermal expansion and glacier melt, continue to rise at a rate more than double that observed between 1993 and 2002.</p>

<p>Although the rate of increase slightly slowed in 2024, the WMO warns that sea level rise remains a grave concern for coastal regions worldwide. This trend underscores the need for coastal communities to strengthen resilience against rising waters.</p>

<p>The WMO report also draws attention to unprecedented glacier loss, with a record 1.2 metres of water equivalent lost in 2023.</p>

<p>Glaciers in Switzerland, for example, lost approximately 10 per cent of their remaining volume over just two years. Such rapid glacier retreat impacts mountainous and polar regions, highlighting the urgency for climate adaptation measures in these vulnerable areas.</p>

<p>Extreme weather events have also intensified globally, with WMO attributing deadly heatwaves, severe floods, tropical cyclones, and persistent droughts to climate change. These events have led to economic losses, food insecurity, and forced migration, hindering sustainable development and causing significant human suffering.</p>

<p>Additionally, greenhouse gas concentrations reached record levels in 2023, with CO2 rising to 420 parts per million, marking a 51 per cent increase from pre-industrial levels. This trend has persisted into 2024, pushing atmospheric heat retention higher and driving further warming. Such findings underline the pressing need to curb emissions on a global scale.</p>

<p>The polar ice regions continue to experience dramatic changes. Antarctic sea ice extent in 2024 was the second lowest since satellite records began, with the Arctic also seeing near-record lows. The loss of polar ice contributes to global warming feedback loops, with cascading effects on ecosystems and weather patterns.</p>

<p>WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo emphasised the need for climate adaptation, particularly through initiatives like Early Warnings for All (EW4All), which aim to protect communities from extreme weather events.</p>

<p>As part of this initiative, 108 countries now report having a Multi-Hazard Early Warning System, a significant step towards enhancing resilience in vulnerable areas.</p>

<p>The WMO's findings underscore the urgency of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and implementing effective climate policies. In response, a team of international experts has been convened to track and communicate climate goals relative to the Paris Agreement and guide policymakers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden laid a wreath Monday to honour the nation's fallen soldiers on Veterans Day, an event marking his first appearance with Vice President Kamala Harris since her election defeat last week.</p>

<p>The ceremony, at historic Arlington National Cemetery across the Potomac River from Washington, is also the first time Harris has been seen in public since her November 6 speech in which she conceded the presidential election to Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Democrats, facing a painful reckoning over their drubbing, have begun soul-searching internal discussions -- and some not-so-private blaming -- over what caused Harris's loss, with some pointing to Biden's initial insistence on running again at age 81, despite having promised to be a bridge president to the next generation.</p>

<p>Criticism of Harris herself has been more muted, and Biden heaped praise on Harris last Thursday in a televised White House address.</p>

<p>Earlier Monday Biden hosted veterans at the White House to mark the holiday before heading to Arlington, the final resting place of two presidents, generals from all major US wars, and thousands of other military personnel.</p>

<p>Biden and Harris, both dressed in dark suits, placed their hands on their hearts before participating in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.</p>

<p>The president was to deliver remarks at the cemetery's Memorial Amphitheater.</p>

<p>The ceremony comes ahead of Biden hosting Trump at the White House on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The Republican has begun naming loyalists to his new administration. He announced he is bringing a hardline immigration official, Tom Homan, back into the fold to serve as his so-called "border czar," and rightwing congresswoman Elise Stefanik to be US ambassador to the United Nations.</p>

<p>Trump himself has long claimed he is a fierce supporter of America's military, but he has made a series of controversial comments about veterans.</p>

<p>His longest-serving White House chief of staff, retired general John Kelly, has said the Republican leader privately disparaged US servicemembers, including describing those who died or were imprisoned defending America as "suckers" and "losers."</p>

<p>Trump denies the accusation.</p>

<p>But the soon-to-be 47th president has been on record expressing contempt for late American war hero and senator John McCain, who spent years in a Hanoi prison during the Vietnam war.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world's second 6th-Generation fully-stealth fighter aircraft has gained impetus with Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer giving the green signal for the strategically important project being co-developed by G7 member states - UK, Italy, and Japan. The approval was given last week.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Starmer and his cabinet gave the approval for the Global Combat Aircraft Programme or GCAP, and a formal announcement of the project is likely in the next few weeks, according to a report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ft.com/content/aab8c68b-eb7e-4305-989c-d107cb931f4b" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">Financial Times</a>.</p>

<p>The GCAP programme aims to counter a rising threat from Russia and China. The project will merge two different military programs - UK and Italy's Tempest Project, for which the UK had already pledged the initial 2-billion-pounds, and Japan's F-X programme.</p>

<p>Italy, Japan, and the UK had signed a treaty in December last year, however, there was uncertainty over UK's participation due to the Labour Party's Strategic Defence Review or SDR which could scrap UK's participation on grounds of high costs. However, with Prime Minister Starmer's go-ahead, those fears have been laid to rest.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><em><small>Image Credit: baesystems.com</small></em></p>
</div>

<p>The final cost of the multi-billion-dollar project is not known yet, but the target to develop and commission the stealth fighter jet has been set for 2035. The project is being jointly developed by British aircraft manufacturer BAE Systems, engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, Italy's Leonardo Aerospace, and Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.</p>

<p>According to the trilateral agreement, the joint GCAP government headquarters will be based in the UK. "UK is a proud member of the Global Combat Air Programme, working together with our partners Japan and Italy, we are fully focused on delivering a next-generation combat aircraft for 2035," UK's Defence Ministry said.</p>

<p>If the deadlines are met, the GCAP supersonic, 6th generation stealth fighter aircraft will become only the second such fighter jet in the world after the United States' B-21 Raider Bomber which is manufactured by Northrop Grumman.</p>

<h2><strong>THE 'B-21 RAIDER' BOMBER</strong></h2>

<p>The B-21 Raider bomber has 6th generation stealth technology, advanced networking capabilities and an open systems architecture. It is made with stealth materials which defeat the anti-access, area-denial systems it faces.</p>

<p>It is capable of delivering both conventional and nuclear payloads. It also has the ability to use a broad mix of stand-off and direct attack munitions. It is the world's first digital bomber with the aircraft ops based on cloud technology.</p>

<p>Currently the "world's most advanced strike aircraft", the B-21 Raider is named in honour of the Doolittle Raid of World War II when 80 airmen, led by Lt. Col. James "Jimmy" Doolittle, and 16 B-25 Mitchell medium bombers set off on a mission that changed the course of World War II. The actions of these 80 volunteers were instrumental in shifting momentum in the Pacific theatre. This marked the raid as a catalyst to a multitude of future progress in US air superiority from land or sea. The courageous spirit of the Doolittle Raiders is the inspiration behind the name of the B-21 Raider.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[The beluga dubbed the "spy whale," was wearing a harness with a small camera and a buckle marked with "Equipment St Petersburg."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The well-known white beluga whale suspected of being a Russian spy may have been guarding "Kremlin property" when it was found dead off Norway's coast, according to a new <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002504p" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>documentary</em></a>.</p>

<p>The whale, nicknamed Hvaldimir-a combination of the Norwegian word for whale, hval, and the name of Russian President Vladimir Putin- was found floating in Risavika Bay in southern Norway in September. Fishermen first spotted the 14-foot whale near Ingoya in northern Norway in April 2019.</p>

<p>The beluga dubbed the "spy whale," was wearing a harness with a small camera and a buckle marked with "Equipment St Petersburg," fueling suspicions of its role as a spy, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/10/new-film-unravels-mystery-of-the-russian-spy-whale" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>Guardian </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After a 10-month investigation, the BBC documentary Secrets of the Spy Whale uncovered evidence suggesting Hvaldimir may have been trained as a covert "guard whale." Speaking to <em>The Observer</em>, film director Jennifer Shaw noted, "Our findings about Hvaldimir's potential role bring us closer to solving the mystery, but they also raise further questions about what Russia might be guarding in the Arctic, and why."</p>

<h2><strong>How do animals become guards?</strong></h2>

<p>The documentary team consulted a former dolphin trainer and experts from an early US Navy program to understand how animals could serve as guards. Blair Irvine explained that dolphins can detect the bubbles and noise created by swimmers, making them highly effective at tracking intruders due to their sensitive hearing.</p>

<p>Shaw explained that Hvaldimir was likely trained similarly and was seen using his nose to target specific objects, hinting that he may have been used for security patrol rather than espionage.</p>

<p>On September 1, Hvaldimir was found dead, and some animal rights groups initially suggested he had been shot. However, an autopsy revealed a 35 cm by 3 cm stick lodged in his mouth and some superficial injuries, but Norwegian police found no evidence indicating he was shot. "There is nothing in the investigations to suggest that human activity directly caused Hvaldimir's death," police stated.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump has chosen Republican Representative Elise Stefanik to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, the president-elect said in a statement shared with Reuters on Monday.</p>

<p>"I am honoured to nominate Chairwoman Elise Stefanik to serve in my Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter," Trump said.</p>

<p>Stefanik, a New York representative and House Republican Conference chair has been a fierce Trump ally.</p>

<p>She could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>

<p>Trump said on Saturday that former Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will not be asked to join his administration.</p>

<p>Haley served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under Trump during his previous term and had endorsed Trump for president despite having criticized him harshly when she ran against him in the party primaries.</p>

<p>Trump is meeting with potential candidates to serve in his administration before his Jan. 20 inauguration as president.</p>

<p>Reuters reported Friday that Trump met with prominent investor Scott Bessent, who is a potential U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The flight headed to Shenzhen, China, encountered trouble when a bird strike caused an engine failure.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Hainan Airlines flight that departed from Fiumicino Airport in Rome, Italy, was forced to turn back shortly after takeoff due to a fire on board. The flight headed to Shenzhen, China, encountered trouble when a bird strike caused an engine failure. Italian Coast Guard officials reported that the bird strike posed a threat to the aircraft's 249 passengers and 16 crew members.</p>

<p>While bird strikes are relatively common, they can be dangerous, especially if they impact an engine. Fortunately, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner safely returned to Fiumicino after dumping fuel over the sea. Despite the emergency landing, there were no reported delays to air traffic, according to an Italian airport official. Italian sources indicate that the plane will undergo thorough checks to assess the extent of the damage, as flames were visible on the right engine while the aircraft was in the air.</p>

<p>The Dreamliner 787-9, bound for Shenzhen, took off at 9:55 a.m. local time and managed a safe landing following the incident. Bird strikes with aircraft are not rare; last year, The Mirror reported a similar case where a pilot was left covered in blood after a bird shattered his windscreen mid-flight.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dominica, a Caribbean Island nation, has faced significant natural disasters, particularly hurricanes and tropical storms. In 2015, Tropical Storm Erica caused severe flooding, landslides and widespread destruction, leaving thousands homeless and costing the island millions in damages. In 2017, Hurricane Maria, a Category 5 hurricane, devastated Dominica, destroying nearly all infrastructure, homes and agriculture, and killed dozens. The island experienced extensive power outages, water shortages, and disruptions in healthcare and education. Dominica's economy, heavily reliant on agriculture and tourism, was severely impacted. But the island nation always showed remarkable resilience and progress - something that its Prime Minister Dr Roosevelt Skerrit highlighted on Sunday.</p>

<p>"After Hurricane Maria, everybody said Dominica is finished and guess what today? The world cannot talk about resilience unless they talk about the Commonwealth of Dominica," he said at the Dominica Labour Party Delegates Conference in Vieille Case.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Dr Skerrit also said that the country surprised the world by rebuilding Dominica "in 24 months" as against the expected and widely publicised 20 years.</p>

<p>"We have tackled them head on, not with fear, but with the determination that defines us as leaders," the Dominican Prime Minister said at the conference, according to a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://wicnews.com/dominica/world-cannot-talk-about-resilience-unless-they-talk-about-dominica-pm-skerrit"><em>WIC News</em></a>.</p>

<p>Initiatives like climate resilience project, emergency agricultural livelihoods and housing recovery program, launched by his administration, restored hope and renewed the strength of the country.</p>

<p>Out of these, the housing programme is the "envy of the world", said Dr Skerrit adding that the Labour Party has always placed the people of Dominica at the centre of its policies and their journey together is far from over.</p>

<p>"Our work is not over. We're here today not only as a political party but as a family with deep roots in the history of our beloved Dominica. It is our shared struggle that has brought us victories. Victories that have improved the lives of our people. Our health care and education to infrastructure and social protection of the vulnerable. Our senior citizens and children," said the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Dr Skerrit emphasised that Labour is an inclusive party, and all are welcome to be a part of it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Deep in a thick forest in Italy's northwestern Piedmont region, the hunt is on for the white Alba truffle, with excited dogs zigzagging and digging into the wet earth.</p>

<p>But the culinary treasure is becoming increasingly rare, undermined by climate change.</p>

<p>"Go find it! Where is it?" Carlo Marenda, a part-time truffle hunter, calls out to Gigi and Buk, seven month-and 13-year-old crosses between the Spinone Italiano and Lagotto Romagnolo breeds, prized for their keen sense of smell.</p>

<p>Autumn leaves crunch under the weight of boots sinking into muddy soil. Below a picturesque hillside vineyard, not far from Alba, trails wind along the Rio della Fava, crossing damp ground ideal for growing truffles.</p>

<p>Sought after by gourmets and starred chefs around the globe, the white truffle of Alba, the most prestigious in the world, is an underground fungus growing in symbiosis with certain hardwood trees by attaching itself to their roots.</p>

<p>Its intense and refined scent, a mixture of hay, garlic and honey, allows hunting dogs to detect it, even if the truffle is sometimes buried up to a metre deep.</p>

<p>Introduced to truffle hunting at the age of five by a family friend, Carlo Marenda, 42, founded the "Save the Truffle" association in 2015, alongside Edmondo Bonelli, a researcher in natural sciences.</p>

<p>It was an octogenarian "trifulau" loner, Giuseppe Giamesio, known as "Notu" and the last descendant of a family with a century-old truffle tradition, who revealed his secrets to him and bequeathed his dogs just before his death in 2014.</p>

<p>The master's message was a testament: "If we want to prevent the disappearance of the truffle, we must protect the forests, stop polluting the waterways and plant new 'truffle' trees".</p>

<p>Ten years later, thanks to donations and the support of some winegrowers, the association has planted more than 700 such trees in the hilly Langhe area, including poplars, oaks and lindens.</p>

<p><strong>Notu's legacy</strong></p>

<p>"Notu passed on to me his passion for truffle hunting and tree preservation," said Marenda, emerging from his metallic grey Fiat Panda 4X4, the preferred car of truffle hunters.</p>

<p>In the last three decades, the areas dedicated to white truffles in Italy have dropped by 30 per cent, gradually giving way to more profitable vineyards, but also hazelnut groves.</p>

<p>The Langhe hills provide a large quantity of hazelnuts to the chocolate giant Ferrero, which was founded in 1946 in Alba, a small prosperous town of 30,000 inhabitants.</p>

<p>But the main threat to the white truffle, whose harvest was classified as an intangible heritage of humanity by UNESCO in 2021, is climate change.</p>

<p>Global warming, drought, deforestation and sudden temperature changes are all factors weakening the natural habitat of this fungus.</p>

<p>To survive, the truffle needs cold and humidity. At the beginning of November, however, the temperature was at 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>

<p>"With the prolongation of summer weather, production is definitely falling", he lamented.</p>

<p><strong>Soaring prices</strong></p>

<p>The harvest, running from October to the end of January, is getting shorter. And with the delayed cold and snow to arrive, "the aroma of the truffles is not yet 100 per cent and they don't keep as long", Marenda said.</p>

<p>Abundant rain, as seen in recent weeks, can also be harmful, he said.</p>

<p>"If there is too little water, the truffle does not grow. If there is too much, it rots."</p>

<p>Alerted by Buk, Marenda crouched down to the ground to delicately scratch the earth with a narrow spade, extracting a truffle, albeit rather modest in size.</p>

<p>On whether the white truffle is on the brink of extinction, experts say it isn't too late.</p>

<p>"Not yet. But if we don't act, it could become so," said Mario Aprile, president of the Piedmont truffle hunters' association.</p>

<p>"The white truffle cannot be cultivated, unlike the black one. Without trees, there are no truffles. We plant them to rebuild biodiversity," Aprile said.</p>

<p>Faced with limited supply and booming demand, the white truffle is trading at a high price, reaching 4,500 euros per kilo this year at the International Alba White Truffle Fair, which ends December 8.</p>

<p>Two "twin" white truffles, bound to the same root and dug up by Aprile, were the stars of the annual world charity auction for white truffles in Alba Sunday.</p>

<p>Weighing a total of 905 grams (2 lbs), the fungi were sold for 140,000 euros ($150,000) to a Hong Kong finance tycoon.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Computer users have been searching "Are Bengal cats legal in Australia?" after falling victim to an unusual cyber attack, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/09/tech/hackers-are-targeting-people-who-type-these-six-words-into-their-computer/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>New York Post</em></a> reported.&nbsp;Cybersecurity firm <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2024/11/06/bengal-cat-lovers-in-australia-get-psspsspssd-in-google-driven-gootloader-campaign/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>SOPHOS </em></a>issued an urgent alert on its website, warning people against entering this specific phrase into search engines. Reports indicate that those who search this question and click on certain links at the top of the results risk having their data stolen.</p>

<p>"Victims are often lured into clicking on malicious adware or links disguised as legitimate content, or in this case, a standard Google search," explained SOPHOS in a release.</p>

<p>Currently, the dangerous links only appear when the term "Australia" is included, putting Australian users at the highest risk. After clicking one of these seemingly legitimate search results, users may have personal information, like bank details, stolen through a program called Gootloader, which can also lock them out of their computers.</p>

<p>While searching about Bengal cats may seem harmless, SOPHOS notes that this makes the hacking risk even more alarming, as it shows that even innocuous search terms can lead to data theft.</p>

<p>The company warns that cybercriminals are increasingly using a tactic known as "SEO poisoning," manipulating search engine results to elevate their malicious websites. The Daily Mail describes this as an "insidious technique" where criminals optimize their websites to appear prominently in search results.</p>

<p>SOPHOS advises anyone who suspects they may have fallen victim to this tactic to change their passwords immediately.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's Punjab province banned most outdoor activities and ordered shops, markets and malls in some areas to close early from Monday to curb illnesses caused by intense air pollution.</p>

<p>The province has closed educational institutions and public spaces like parks and zoos until Nov. 17 in places including Lahore, the world's most polluted city in terms of air quality, according to Swiss group IQAir's live ratings.</p>

<p>The districts of Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad and Gujranwala have seen an unprecedented rise in patients with respiratory diseases, eye and throat irritation, and pink eye disease, the Punjab government said in an order issued late on Sunday.</p>

<p>The new restrictions will also remain in force until Nov. 17.</p>

<p>"The spread of conjunctivitis/ pink eye disease due to bacterial or viral infection, smoke, dust or chemical exposure is posing a serious and imminent threat to public health," the Punjab government said.</p>

<p>While outdoor activities including sports events, exhibitions and festivals, and dining at restaurants have been prohibited, "unavoidable religious rites" are exempt from this direction, the order said.</p>

<p>Outlets like pharmacies, oil depots, dairy shops and fruit and vegetable shops have similarly been exempted from the directions to close by 8 p.m. local time.</p>

<p>Lahore's air quality remained hazardous on Monday, with an index score of more than 600, according to IQAir, but this was significantly lower than the 1,900 that it touched in places earlier this month.</p>

<p>A score of 0-50 is considered good.</p>

<p>UNICEF on Monday also called for greater efforts to reduce pollution and protect children's health in Punjab, saying that more than 11 million children under five years of age are in danger as they breathe the toxic air.</p>

<p>"In addition, schools in smog-affected areas have been closed...the learning of almost 16 million children in Punjab has been disrupted," said Abdullah Fadil, UNICEF Representative in the country.</p>

<p>"Pakistan, already in the grips of an education emergency...cannot afford more learning losses," he said.</p>

<p>Several parts of South Asia are engulfed by a toxic haze each winter as cold air traps dust, emissions and smoke from farm fires.</p>

<p>Punjab has blamed its toxic air this year on pollution wafting in from India, where northern parts have also been battling hazardous air, and has said it will take the issue up with the neighbouring country through its foreign ministry.</p>

<p>India's Supreme Court on Monday directed the Delhi government to decide by Nov. 25 on imposing a perpetual ban on firecrackers, legal news portal Bar and Bench reported.</p>

<p>Firecrackers set off by revellers on Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights celebrated on Oct. 31 this year despite a ban, have aggravated the region's pollution problem.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">(1962) A Mi-4 in the Galwan Valley, as seen from the Chinese side.</p>
</div>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody" dir="ltr">It was August 1962. The Alpha company of 5 Jat was in Chushul when it received a directive to take control of Hot Springs. It was never the plan to send the Alphas further down from there, to Galwan. Major Ajit Singh's Bravo company was to take that post. However, when he insisted that his company remain at Hot Springs, the task befell the Alphas. And that is how, in October, about 60 soldiers arrived at the Galwan post: unexpectedly and without much preparation.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody" dir="ltr">Numerous difficulties would beset the Alphas at Galwan. Apart from heavy snowfall, Chinese posts closed off the land route completely. The post was entirely dependent on air supplies, which meant that on occasion, supplies would also land on the enemy side. The Chinese also kept up their attacks to demoralise the Alphas by circling the posts and yelling propaganda slogans like <em>‘Hindi Chini Bhai Bhai'.</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">The Jats prepared four posts in the complex: the company headquarters with one section under Major Srikant Sitaram Hasabnis, a platoon under Subedar Hoshiar Singh, another section under Naik Inder Singh, and a post comprising the remaining men under Subedar Nihal Singh. There was no communication between these posts. Supplies were in limited numbers too, with 16 soldiers reportedly lacking any kind of weaponry. Even the radio communication between the headquarters of the company and that of the battalion was only as per schedule. Every soldier was scared and felt as though they had been thrown into a death trap.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>When Bullets Rained</strong></h2>

<p dir="ltr">A week passed eventlessly after the last soldier landed in Galwan. But it was an eerie peace, not to last too long. In the early hours of October 20, Major Hasabnis, who was in his tent then, heard a machine gun being fired at his post. As he peeked outside, he was met with a barrage of firing from the Chinese side.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">In no time, firing from all directions engulfed the area. Bullets from rifles, machine guns, and artillery were pelting the ground. Major Hasabnis approached the tent with the radio to alert the battalion and brigade headquarters that they had been attacked by the Chinese. Except, it was radio silence period at the headquarters, which meant that there was no one to alert or ask for help from. The Alphas, thus, with no contact with the outside world, were now left to tackle the Chinese all by themselves.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The remaining company positions were out of sight. Amid heavy gunfire, a company headquarters soldier was seen sitting outside, in the open. Someone questioned him, "Why are you doing this?" He replied, "<em>Intezaar, Saab</em>" ("Waiting, Sir"). One of the 16 unarmed men, he was waiting for the shot that would kill him. Even Major Hasabnis had but just a pistol on him.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Deterred By Nothing</strong></h2>

<p dir="ltr">Subedar Nihal Singh's post was also pounded. After the shelling stopped for a while, the infantry launched a battalion-sized assault on the forward defences. Troops kept fighting from their crumbling defences, and amidst that, Nihal Singh went from man to man, encouraging them to fight till the end.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Not too far away, the JCO was fatally wounded in shelling. Upon noticing this, Sepoy Bhopal Singh immediately ran to him, gave him aid, and moved him to a safe location. He found his LMG-1 severely wounded when he returned to his trench. Even so, he took control of the weapon and dealt severe casualties to the enemy. Ultimately, when he was left with only grenades, he lobbed them at the enemy defiantly, causing numerous fatalities. Eventually, however, as the front-line defences crumbled completely, Bhopal Singh was killed.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Fighting Till The End</strong></h2>

<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Major Hasabnis, in the rear position, continued to take on the Chinese with his remaining troops. Captain Doctor HN Paul was advised to exit the tent and enter the trench. But before he could do so, the tent caught fire due to an incendiary round; he was presumed to have died. Company Havildar Major Banwari Lal, who was charged with organising ammunition, was also killed by a shell when he was sprinting to supply ammo.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Left, Major S.S. Hasabnis, and right, Subedar Nihal Singh" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/u207i6k8_hasabnis_625x300_11_November_24.jpg" title="Left, Major S.S. Hasabnis, and right, Subedar Nihal Singh" /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">Left, Major S.S. Hasabnis, and right, Subedar Nihal Singh</p>
</div>

<p dir="ltr">Subedar Hoshiar Singh's isolated location wasn't spared either. Although the initial wave of the attack was repelled, the sheer extent of it was overwhelming. It was clear to Singh that it was a dire moment. After his LMG operators sustained fatal injuries, he personally fired the weapon and took on the adversary, before being shot.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Naik Inder Singh's weak section also took on a four times larger enemy valiantly. The section gave it all it had, but after an hour, when they had nothing left, they fell, with the enemy taking on their position.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>When The Chinese Seized The Post</strong></h2>

<p dir="ltr">The hail of gunfire ended quickly, just as it had begun. Unsettling silence suddenly descended over the Galwan complex. Hand-to-hand combat broke out as soon as the adversary closed. Soldiers who were hurt could be heard screaming. After several hours of fighting, the Chinese took complete control of the post, killing 30 Indian soldiers, including Dr. Paul. Eighteen men suffered serious injuries.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The men fought until the last bullet was shot. And even though they knew death and defeat were staring them in the eye, they did not raise the white flag of surrender. Major Hasabnis and his surviving soldiers were taken prisoner by the enemy. Galwan had been seized. Subedar Nihal Singh and one OR died in captivity, while Sepoy Roshan Lal lost his limbs.</p>

<p dir="ltr">On October 21, Chinese soldiers again opened fire on Indian helicopters as they flew over the Galwan position. The pilot, after seeing no sign of life at the post, concluded that every single man had either been killed or taken prisoner.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">It was only in May 1963 that the captives were finally repatriated. Among them, Subedar Nihal Singh was posthumously awarded Vir Chakra in recognition of his bravery and leadership.</p>

<p>The wealthy Gulf country hosts the largest US base in the Middle East and Hamas's political office, and has played a pivotal role in indirect talks since the October 7 attack on Israel that sparked the war.</p>

<p>The negotiations offered the only hope for freeing Israeli hostages held by Hamas and ending a war that has left 43,603 people dead in Gaza, according to a toll from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.</p>

<p>But Qatar announced last week that it has put its mediation on hold until Israel and Hamas show "willingness and seriousness" to end the conflict.</p>

<p><strong>- Where do talks stand? -</strong></p>

<p>Since a one-week pause in fighting last year, when scores of hostages were released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, successive rounds of negotiations have made no headway.</p>

<p>This month, Hamas rejected a proposal from Egypt and Qatar for a short-term truce, as it did not offer a lasting ceasefire.</p>

<p>Israel has repeatedly vowed it will not stop fighting until it achieves its war objectives -- to crush Hamas and bring the hostages home.</p>

<p>While Egypt borders Gaza and the United States is Israel's main backer, Qatar's role in the talks was unique in that was the only player able to claim neutral ground.</p>

<p>It has mediated numerous international crises in Ukraine, Syria and Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Negotiations on Gaza need a broker, and "I can't see how that would be anyone else," says Andreas Krieg, a senior lecturer at King's College London.</p>

<p>The talks are "now in a situation where there is no negotiation process anymore", he added.</p>

<p>Hamas has been weakened by the killings of leaders Yahya Sinwar in October and Ismail Haniyeh in July, to a point where it is unclear "how you maintain a negotiation process with all the main interlocutors dead", he said.</p>

<p>Anna Jacobs, a Gulf analyst with the International Crisis Group think tank, said "Hamas feels they already agreed to a US ceasefire plan over the summer".</p>

<p>But that proposal never produced an agreement.</p>

<p>Jacobs said Hamas thinks Israel is "sabotaging negotiations by constantly adding on new conditions", including keeping a military presence in Gaza.</p>

<p><strong>- Could Hamas leave Qatar? -</strong></p>

<p>Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al-Ansari on Saturday pushed back against reports suggesting that Hamas would be ejected from the country.</p>

<p>The "main goal of the (Hamas) office in Qatar is to be a channel of communication", Ansari said, adding that it had "contributed to achieving a ceasefire in previous stages".</p>

<p>A senior Hamas official told AFP that the group had received no indication from Qatar that it should leave.</p>

<p>Earlier, a diplomatic source told AFP that with Qatar pulling back in its mediation role, the Hamas office "no longer serves its purpose".</p>

<p>Given the Hamas and Qatari denials, Jacobs said that "it's unlikely that there will be a big, public closing of the Hamas office and kicking out the leadership."</p>

<p>Qatar gave Hamas a similar message in April, prompting several group members to leave for Turkey -- only to return two weeks later at the request of the United States and Israel, when negotiations proved unworkable.</p>

<p>Krieg said Hamas now appeared to be in "limbo" and that demands were mounting for expulsion in "a fairly short window of maybe a few weeks", with the most likely destination being Iran.</p>

<p>Turkey has been touted as a new host but the NATO member is unlikely to want to upset the United States, Krieg added.</p>

<p>According to Jacobs, it is possible that until US President-elect Donald Trump's January 20 inauguration, "Hamas officials will stay out of Doha until more serious negotiations resume".</p>

<p><strong>- Will Qatar bow out for good? -</strong></p>

<p>Qatar had already signalled its unhappiness in April when it said it was re-evaluating its mediator role.</p>

<p>But it has signalled its willingness to return to the table when conditions permit.</p>

<p>"This is primarily about... signalling to the world, we are mediating, we're happy to continue it, but we're also willing to put all the weight, all the leverage that we have over Hamas," Krieg said.</p>

<p>Jacobs said Qatar's relationship with Hamas had come under scrutiny from American policymakers, especially Republicans in Congress.</p>

<p>"It makes sense that they are trying to protect themselves and preemptively remove any vulnerability that Trump and a likely Republican-controlled Congress could attack," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The hazardous level of pollution has forced authorities in Pakistan to close schools till November 17 in a bid to lower children's exposure to the pollution.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A thick toxic blanket of smog covering eastern Pakistan and entire northern India is seen in a striking satellite image released by American <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/?v=64.49116547151472,25.4299555277525,81.23650026844116,33.3752680277525&amp;s=74.3507,31.558%2B77.2188,28.6324&amp;t=2024-11-10-T00%3A00%3A00Z">space agency NASA</a>. It shows location pins for Lahore in Pakistan's Punjab and New Delhi, with both cities under huge cloud of grey smog. Lahore - a city of 14 million people stuffed with factories on the border with India - regularly ranks among the world's most polluted cities, but it has hit record levels this month.</p>

<p>Last week, live rankings by Swiss group IQAir gave the city a pollution index score of 1165. In New Delhi and neighbouring areas, it is hovering around 350. An Air Quality Index (AQI) of 50 or below is considered good with little risk of pollution.</p>

<p>The hazardous level of pollution has forced authorities in Pakistan to close schools till November 17 in a bid to lower children's exposure to the pollution.</p>

<p>In Multan, another city of several million people some 350 kilometres away, the AQI level passed 2,000 last week, according to news agency AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Access to parks, zoos, playgrounds, historic monuments, museums and recreational areas has <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pakistans-punjab-shuts-amusement-parks-museums-for-10-days-due-to-severe-smog-6977921">also been banned</a> along with tuk-tuks with polluting two-stroke engines and restaurants that operate barbecues without filters.</p>

<p>A "smog war room" has been set up in Pakistan's Punjab province where staff members from eight departments work towards controlling burning of farm waste and managing traffic.</p>

<p>A mix of low-grade fuel emissions from factories and vehicles and agricultural stubble burning blanket the city each winter, trapped by cooler temperatures and slow-moving winds.</p>

<p>According to World health Organisation (WHO), air pollution can trigger strokes, heart disease, lung cancer and other respiratory diseases.</p>

<p>It is particularly punishing for children and babies, and the elderly.</p>

<p>The chief pollutant is PM2.5, the fine particulate matter that poses greatest risk to health. It comes from sources like the combustion of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to asthma, heart and lung disease, cancer, and other respiratory illnesses, as well as cognitive impairment in children.</p>

<p>PM2.5 travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reports have been flooding in of Black people across the United States receiving disturbing text messages referencing slavery and "picking cotton", following Donald Trump's presidential election win. These racist messages have been reported in over a dozen states, including California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan, North Carolina, Virginia, and Alabama, as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/09/us/racist-texts-black-people-investigation-what-we-know/index.html"><em>CNN.</em></a>&nbsp;The messages, sent anonymously, instructed recipients to report to a "plantation" or board a bus, sparking widespread alarm and prompting investigations by the FBI and other agencies.</p>

<p>The messages often instruct recipients to report to a specific address, sometimes mentioning the incoming presidential administration. Some even target children, with reports of middle school students receiving these hateful messages. For instance, a 16-year-old girl in California received a text directing her to report to a "plantation" in North Carolina.</p>

<p>The FBI is working with the Justice Department to address these incidents, while the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is investigating alongside federal and state law enforcement.

<p>''We've said it before and we'll say it again - there is no place for hate in a democracy.

       <description><![CDATA[Calling it "completely false", Moscow today rejected claims of a phone call between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump last week.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Calling it "completely false", Moscow today rejected claims of a phone call between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump last week. A report by US's Washington Post had claimed on Sunday that Trump had called up Putin, and that the two leaders had discussed the conflict in Ukraine.</p>

<p>"This is completely false information," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said today, adding that there has been no phone call whatsoever, between the Russian President and his US counterpart.</p>

<p>In its report, now flagged as 'fake news' by Moscow, The Washington Post had claimed that Donald Trump had called Vladimir Putin from his residence-cum-resort Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida. The call was reportedly made on Thursday, a day after Trump and his close aide Elon Musk had spoken to Ukraine's Zelensky.</p>

<p>According to the Washington Post report, which was based on 'anonymous sources familiar with the matter', Trump had allegedly "reminded Putin" of America's sizable military presence in Europe. The report went on to claim that Trump had allegedly expressed an interest in further conversations with Putin to discuss "the resolution of Ukraine's war soon."</p>

<h2><strong>DONALD TRUMP CALLS UKRAINE'S ZELENSKY</strong></h2>

<p>Notably, in his victory speech after the 2024 US Election result was declared last week, Donald Trump had said that "I will not start wars, I will help end them", and within a few days of winning the presidential election, President-elect Trump had called his Ukrainian counterpart Zelensky.</p>

<p>After the phone call last Wednesday, President Zelensky had shared a post on X which read: "I had an excellent call with President Trump and congratulated him on his historic landslide victory - his tremendous campaign made this result possible."</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/cl3gesag_trump-musk_625x300_13_August_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Notably, that phone call was attended by Elon Musk too. Elon Musk was with Donald Trump at the President-elect's residence and luxury resort Mar-a-Lago. During the phone call, Donald Trump reportedly <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-asks-elon-musk-to-join-call-with-ukraines-zelensky-in-big-hint-at-his-possible-role-6976601" target="_blank">handed the phone over to Elon Musk</a> and supposedly asked the SpaceX founder to join the call with President Zelensky.</p>

<p>It is not known yet, if they discussed any change in policy the United States has towards Ukraine.</p>

<p>According to the news report by Axios, there were two surprises that day - the first being that Elon Musk spoke with Zelensky, and the second, that Zelensky was reportedly "somewhat reassured by what he heard." This shows just how important and influential a role Elon Musk could end up playing in the Trump administration 2.0.</p>

<h3><strong>ELON MUSK'S POSSIBLE ROLE</strong></h3>

<p>The report further stated that the phone call between Trump, Musk, and Zelensky lasted for nearly half-an-hour. After being congratulated by Zelensky, Mr Trump reportedly said he will support Ukraine, but didn't reveal much else.</p>

<p>Elon Musk then reassured President Zelensky that he will continue to help Ukraine via his Starlink satellite constellation. Since the Russian invasion in 2022, Elon Musk's Starlink satellite system has provided Ukraine with significant frontline advantage by allowing its armed forces to share real-time drone coordinates, data and footage between units. It also gave Ukraine's military communications support in areas where mobile phone networks were destroyed.</p>

</div>

<p>Zelensky and Trump had met recently in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly meet in September. The two leaders had discussed ways in which the war with Russia could end and a diplomatic solution be found. "I promise you will be happy with me," Trump had reportedly told Zelensky at that meeting.</p>

<h3><strong>PUTIN AND ZELENSKY'S DEMANDS</strong></h3>

<p>The Russian president had recently demanded that Ukraine withdraw from swathes of its eastern and southern territory as a precondition to peace talks. The Washington Post reported that people familiar with "Thursday's call" said Trump had briefly raised the question of land with Putin.</p>

<p>President Zelensky has said there should be "no concessions" to Putin. Ceding land or giving in to any of Moscow's other hard line demands would only embolden the Kremlin and lead to more aggression, President Zelensky had said.</p>

<p>The outgoing Democratic administration of President Joe Biden has confirmed that it will send as much aid as possible to Ukraine before Trump's inauguration on January 20.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the White House aims "to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position on the battlefield so that it is ultimately in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table."</p>

<p>This would include using the remaining $6 billion of funding for Ukraine available, Mr Sullivan said.<br />

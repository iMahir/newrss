       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hours after Iranian missiles rained down on Israel on October 1, President Joe Biden's administration sent an urgent message to Israel: Take a breath.</p>

<p>Israel, Washington argued, owned the clock and had time to decide on how to best respond to an Iranian strike that the United States assessed could have killed thousands if Israel, with US military support, hadn't been able to defeat the attack from its long-time foe.</p>

<p>Such a massive Iranian attack had the potential to trigger a sharp, rapid Israeli response that, weeks before the US presidential election, could push the Middle East closer to an all-out regional conflagration, officials feared.</p>

<p>This account from current and former US officials explains how the United States sought to influence Israel during the more than three weeks before its military finally retaliated on Saturday with airstrikes that were far more tailored toward military targets than Washington initially feared.</p>

<p>They destroyed key Iranian air defenses and missile production facilities, weakening Iran's military. But, importantly, they avoided Iran's sensitive nuclear sites and energy infrastructure, meeting Biden's two top demands.</p>

<p>"US pressure was critically important," said Jonathan Panikoff, a former deputy US national intelligence officer for the Middle East.</p>

<p>"Israeli decision-making would have been far different had the Biden administration not taken measures to push Israel not to strike nuclear or energy sites."</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denied that Israel avoided striking Iranian gas and oil facilities because of US pressure.</p>

<p>"Israel chose in advance the attack targets according to its national interests and not according to American dictates," he said.</p>

<p>The first move by Biden's administration was to acknowledge that Iran would have to pay for the October 1 attack, officials say.</p>

<p>"In the hours after that attack, we promised serious consequences for Iran," according to one senior Biden administration official.</p>

<p>US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin held around a dozen calls with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, since October 1. Austin, a retired four star Army general, and Gallant would discuss the possible response.</p>

<p>"We knew they were getting ready to do something, and he was pushing for it to be proportional," one US official said of Austin's conversations with Gallant.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, like other senior administration officials, worked the phones, speaking with European and Arab allies in the days after Iran's October 1 attack, explaining that Israel would have to respond but assuring them that Washington was working to calibrate it.</p>

<p>But what would be a proportional response that could deter another Iranian attack?</p>

<p>Although Iran's October 1 strike only killed one person, a Palestinian who died from falling debris, many of Iran's missiles were not intercepted by Israeli or US air defenses.</p>

<p>Jeffrey Lewis, a non-proliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said that analysis of satellite imagery showed at least 30 impacts at Israel's Nevatim Airbase alone.</p>

<p>That could suggest that Israel was either trying to conserve dwindling air defenses or simply thought that the hardened facility would be less expensive to repair than to repel each projectile fired by Iran, Lewis said.</p>

<p>"Israel may have decided that the stockpiles were running low or that interceptors were just too expensive to use on ballistic missiles," Lewis said.</p>

<p><strong>AIR DEFENSES</strong></p>

<p>When the administration first started speaking with the Israelis, among their potential targets were Iran's nuclear sites and oil sites, one US official said, although underscored that Israel had not definitively decided to go ahead with these targets.</p>

<p>But US officials worked to present an alternative option that included a set of different measures: Washington worked to impose oil sanctions targeting Iran's so-called "Ghost Fleet" to offer an alternative measure to the Israelis who wanted to damage Iran's oil revenues with a kinetic strike.</p>

<p>The senior Biden administration official said the United States worked to bolster Israel's air defenses ahead of its Saturday strike on Iran. That includes a rare US deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, to Israel along with about 100 US soldiers to operate it.</p>

<p>Before deploying the system, the United States wanted to know Israel's attack plans.</p>

<p>Biden held a call with Netanyahu on October 9, which gave the United States an understanding of what the Israeli response would look like, allowing the THAAD deployment to go forward, officials said.</p>

<p>As Iran warned Israel's supporters could be targeted in response to any Israeli strike, Gulf states emphasized their neutrality.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia has been wary of an Iranian strike on its oil facilities since a 2019 attack on its key refinery at Abqaiq briefly shut down more than 5% of global oil supply. Iran denied involvement.</p>

<p>To address Israel's desire to punish Iran's oil sector, the Biden administration rolled out sanctions. That included an October 11 expansion of US sanctions against Iran's petroleum and petrochemical sectors.</p>

<p>Encouraging the European allies to impose penalties on Iran Air, while at the same time deploying the THAAD system as a deterrent and showing the world that US had Israel's back were other key elements of this "package" of alternative measures.</p>

<p>And this option, the administration argued, would still be a powerful deterrent and effective in imposing costs on Iran without engulfing the region into a wider war Washington believed Israel does not want, officials said.</p>

<p><strong>NUCLEAR NO-GO</strong></p>

<p>In what many experts saw as a message to Iran, the US military also carried out a strike against the Iran-aligned Houthis in Yemen with long-range B-2 stealth bombers.</p>

<p>Austin said at the time the strike was a unique demonstration of the Pentagon's ability to strike hard-to-reach facilities, "no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified."</p>

<p>As speculation swirled over whether Israel might strike Iran's nuclear sites, Washington's message to Israel was that it could count on its help should Tehran ever choose to build a nuclear weapon, something the US intelligence community does not believe it has done yet.</p>

<p>Now was not the time.</p>

<p>"The implication was that if in the long term they want US help to destroy such targets - if a decision is made to do so - they'd have to be more measured this time," Panikoff said.</p>

<p>For Blinken, a calibrated Israeli counter-attack against Iran could open the chance for long elusive diplomatic goals in a regional already convulsing from a year-old war in Gaza between Israel and Iran-backed Hamas and an escalating war between Israel and Lebanese Hezbollah, another Iranian ally.</p>

<p>During a trip to the Middle East last week, Blinken told Arab foreign ministers that US discussions with Israel had gotten to a place where Israel will only strike military targets. Iran, in turn, should not do anything else, Blinken said, in a message he hoped would make its way to Tehran.</p>

<p>On Sunday, as the dust settled on the attack, neither side signaled further escalation. Netanyahu said his airstrikes "hit hard" at Iran's defences and missile production. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the damage from Saturday's attack should not be exaggerated.</p>

<p>While it's impossible to predict whether Israel and Iran will de-escalate, US officials say the Biden administration worked hard to create an opportunity for breaking the unprecedented cycle of direct attacks and counter-attacks that began in April.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"If Iran chooses to respond once again, we will be ready, and there will be consequences for Iran once again. However, we do not want to see that happen," the senior Biden administration official said.</p>

<p>Biden's strategy of trying to restrain Israel has its critics, including opposition Republicans in the United States like Mike Turner, a Republican congressman who chairs the House Intelligence Committee.</p>

<p>"They've limited the ability for Israel to really impact Iran and its ability to continue to threaten Israel," Turner told Fox News.</p>

<p>Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the result of the back-and-forth strikes is, however paradoxically, an expansion of potential risk tolerance in Israel that could further widen if Republican candidate and former US President Donald Trump wins the November 5 presidential election.</p>

<p>"If Trump wins this election, I think that the Israelis will perhaps even look for opportunities in the months ahead, now that they've demonstrated that they can get away with dismantling Iran's air defense systems and essentially doing a good deal of damage," Miller said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's military campaign in southern Lebanon has caused vast destruction in more than a dozen border towns and villages, reducing many of them to clusters of grey craters, according to satellite imagery provided to Reuters by Planet Labs Inc.</p>

<p>Many of the towns, emptied of their residents by the bombing, had been inhabited for at least two centuries. The imagery reviewed includes towns between Kfarkela in southeastern Lebanon, south past Meiss al-Jabal, and then west past a base used by U.N. peacekeepers to the small village of Labbouneh.</p>

<p>"There are beautiful old homes, hundreds of years old. Thousands of artillery shells have hit the town, hundreds of air strikes," said Abdulmonem Choukeir, mayor of Meiss al-Jabal, one of the villages hit by Israeli attacks.</p>

<p>"Who knows what will still be standing at the end?"&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reuters compared satellite images taken in October 2023 to those taken in September and October 2024. Many of the villages with striking visible damage over the course of the last month sit atop hills overlooking Israel.</p>

<p>After nearly a year of exchanging fire across the border, Israel intensified its strikes on southern Lebanon and beyond over the last month. Israeli troops have made ground incursions all along the mountainous frontier with Lebanon, engaging in heavy clashes with Hezbollah fighters inside some towns.</p>

<p>Lebanon's disaster risk management unit, which tracks both victims and attacks on specific towns, said the 14 towns reviewed by Reuters had been subject to a total of 3,809 attacks by Israel over the last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel's military did not immediately respond to Reuters questions about the scale of destruction. Israel's military spokesman Daniel Hagari said on Oct. 24 that Israel has struck more than 3,200 targets in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>The military says it is attacking towns in southern Lebanon because Hezbollah has turned "civilian villages into fortified combat zones," hiding weapons, explosives and vehicles there. Hezbollah denies using civilian infrastructure to launch attacks or store weapons, and residents of the towns deny the assertion.</p>

<p>A person familiar with Israel's military operations in Lebanon told Reuters that troops were systematically attacking towns with strategic overlook points, including Mhaibib.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The person said that Israel had "learned lessons" after its last war with Hezbollah in 2006, including incidents in which troops making ground incursions into the valleys of southern Lebanon were attacked by Hezbollah fighters on hilltops.</p>

<p>"That is why they are targeting these villages so heavily - so they can move more freely," the person said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most recent images of Kfarkela showed a string of white splotches along a main road leading into a town. Imagery taken last year showed the same road lined with houses and green vegetation, indicating the houses had been pulverized.</p>

<p>Further south, Meiss al-Jabal, a town 700 meters (yards) away from the U.N.-demarcated Blue Line separating Israeli and Lebanese territory, suffered significant destruction to an entire block near the town centre.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The area, measuring approximately 150 meters by 400 metres, appeared as a swatch of sandy brown, signalling the buildings there had been entirely flattened. Images from the same month in 2023 showed a densely packed neighbourhood of homes.</p>

<p><strong>'Any Sign Of Life'</strong></p>

<p>At least 1.2 million people have been displaced by Israel's strikes and more than 2,600 have been killed over the last year - a vast majority in the last month, Lebanon's government says.</p>

<p>Residents of the border villages have not been able to reach their hometowns in months. "After the war came to Meiss al-Jabal, after the residents left, we no longer know anything about the state of the village," Meiss al-Jabal's mayor said.</p>

<p>The imagery of the nearby village of Mhaibib depicted similar levels of destruction. Mhaibib is one of several villages - alongside Kfarkela, Aitaroun, Odaisseh, and Ramyeh - featured in footage shared on social media showing simultaneous explosions of several structures at once, indicating they had been laden with explosives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel's military spokesman said on Oct. 24 that a command centre for Hezbollah's elite Radwan unit lay under Mhaibib and that Israeli troops had "neutralised the main tunnel network" used by the group, but did not give details.</p>

<p>Hagari has said that Israel's goal is to "push Hezbollah away from the border, dismantle its capabilities, and eliminate the threat to northern residents" of Israel. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is a plan you take off the shelf," said Jon Alterman, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington. "Militaries plan, and they're executing the plan."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seth Jones, another senior vice president at CSIS, had earlier told Reuters that Hezbollah used frontline villages to fire its shorter-range rockets into Israel.</p>

<p>Lubnan Baalbaki, the conductor of Lebanon's philharmonic orchestra and son of late Lebanese artist Abdel-Hamid Baalbaki, said his family had been purchasing satellite imagery of their hometown of Odaisseh to check if the family house still stood.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The house had been transformed by Abdel-Hamid into a cultural centre, full of his artworks, original sketches and more than 1,000 books in an all-wood library. Abdel-Hamid passed away in 2013 and was buried behind the house with his late wife.</p>

<p>"We're a family of artists, my father is well-known, and our home was a known cultural home. We were trying to reassure ourselves with that thought," Baalbaki, the son, told Reuters.</p>

<p>Until late October, the house still stood. But at the weekend Baalbaki saw a video circulating of several homes in Odaisseh, including his family's, exploding.</p>

<p>The family is not affiliated with Hezbollah and Baalbaki denied that any weapons or military equipment were stored there.</p>

<p>"If you have such high-level intelligence that you can target specific military figures, then you know what's in that house," Baalbaki said. "It was an art house. We are all artists. The aim is to erase any sign of life."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday he seeks peace with Arab countries, after a year of war in Gaza and Lebanon which has stoked Arab anger.</p>

<p>He spoke as Washington seeks to rally Arab countries around long-term plans for post-war governance in the Gaza Strip, and further normalisation deals with Israel following the 2020 Abraham Accords.</p>

<p>"I aspire to continue the process I went through a few years ago, with the signing of the historic Abraham Accords, in order to achieve peace with other Arab countries," Netanyahu said in a speech to lawmakers as Israel's parliament began its winter session.</p>

<p>The US-brokered Abraham Accords saw Gulf countries Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Morocco, establish formal ties with Israel.</p>

<p>"I emphasise peace for peace, peace out of strength with important countries in the Middle East," Netanyahu said Monday.</p>

<p>"These countries and other countries see very well the blows we inflict on those who attack us, the Iranian axis of evil," he added, two days after Israel bombed military targets in Iran, as retaliation for an Iranian missile barrage on Israel.</p>

<p>"They are impressed by our determination and courage. Like us, they aspire to a stable, secure, prosperous Middle East."</p>

<p>The Abraham Accords were reached under the administration of then-president Donald Trump, who is seeking a return to the White House.</p>

<p>The United States, Israel's main backer, has long sought to broker an eventual agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel, which would entail US security guarantees for the kingdom.</p>

<p>Washington has hoped to give an incentive to Netanyahu to stop the war and gain a powerful Arab ally, the guardian of Islam's two holiest sites.</p>

<p>Riyadh, however, has conditioned any such agreement on the recognition of an independent Palestinian state -- a prospect rejected by Israel.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia did not join the 2020 deals and has never recognised Israel.</p>

<p>An agreement had nevertheless seemed closer last year, before the October 7 attack by Hamas on Israel, which sparked the deadliest ever war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Last week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken sought to make headway with Saudi Arabia on normalisation with Israel.</p>

<p>The top US diplomat flew directly from Tel Avivi in Israel to the Saudi capital Riyadh, on a tour of the Middle East days before the US election.</p>

<p>"There remains, despite everything that's happened, an incredible opportunity in this region to move in a totally different direction," Blinken said minutes before he left Israel.</p>

<p>"Saudi Arabia would be right at the heart of that, and that includes potentially normalisation of relations with Israel."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli tanks thrust deeper on Monday into two north Gaza towns and a historic refugee camp, trapping around 100,000 civilians, the Palestinian emergency service said, in what the military said were operations to eliminate regrouping Hamas militants.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said soldiers captured around 100 suspected Hamas militants in a raid into Kamal Adwan Hospital in the Jabalia camp. Hamas and medics have denied any militant presence at the hospital.</p>

<p>The Gaza Strip's health ministry said at least 19 people were killed by Israeli airstrikes and bombardment on Monday, 13 of them in the north of the devastated coastal territory.</p>

<p>The Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said around 100,000 people were marooned in Jabalia, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun without medical or food supplies. Reuters could not verify the number independently.</p>

<p>The emergency service said its operations had come to a halt because of the three-week Israeli assault into the north, an area where the military said it had wiped out Hamas combat forces earlier in the year-long war.</p>

<p>Talks led by the US, Egypt and Qatar to broker a ceasefire resumed on Sunday after multiple abortive attempts, with Egypt's president proposing an initial two-day truce to exchange four Israeli hostages of Hamas for some Palestinian prisoners, to be followed by talks within 10 days on a permanent ceasefire.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday the latest meetings in Doha focused on a new outline that takes into account previous proposals and regional developments.</p>

<p>He said mediators would resume talks in coming days "in a continued attempt to advance a deal", without elaborating.</p>

<p>To date, Israel has repeatedly said the war will go on until Hamas is eradicated while the Islamist movement has ruled out end to fighting until Israeli forces leave Gaza.</p>

<p>Gaza's war has kindled wider conflict in the Middle East, raising concern about global oil supplies, with Israel carrying out bombings across Lebanon and sending forces into its south in an offensive to disable Iran-backed Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas.</p>

<p>It has also triggered rare direct clashes between regional arch-foes Israel and Iran. At the weekend, Israeli warplanes pounded missile production sites in Iran in retaliation for an Oct. 1 Iranian missile volley at Israel.</p>

<p>Iran's Foreign Ministry said on Monday Tehran would "use all available tools" to respond to Israel's weekend attack.</p>

<p><strong>ISRAEL BOMBS TYRE IN SOUTH LEBANON, 7 DEAD</strong></p>

<p>Israel continued battering Lebanon on Monday, including an early-morning airstrike on a district in the southern port of Tyre that left seven dead, the Lebanese health ministry said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military later issued an evacuation order for large swathes of Tyre, including areas that have not been previously asked to evacuate and that included neighbourhoods near a seaside hotel where journalists are usually based.</p>

<p>In an update, the Israeli military said it bombed Hezbollah anti-tank missile depots and other arms assets in Tyre for the second time in several days.</p>

<p>Footage circulated online of civil defence workers driving through Tyre on Monday and urging people to leave. "For your safety, because of the warning, evacuate immediately!" one of them shouted into a megaphone attached to a car.</p>

<p>Israel's expanding evacuation warnings have made ghost towns out of much of southern Lebanon, including Tyre, and the bombing campaign has left many towns along the border in ruins.</p>

<p>Hezbollah carried out a string of attacks on Israeli troops within Lebanese territory and on military targets within Israel. It said it had struck a military equipment factory southeast of Acre, but there were no reports of damage or casualties.</p>

<p>North Gaza's three major hospitals, whose officials refused Israel's orders to evacuate, said they were hardly operating. At least two had been damaged by Israeli fire during the assault and run out of medical, food and fuel stocks.</p>

<p>At least one doctor, a nurse and two child patients had died in those hospitals due to a lack of treatment in the past week.</p>

<p>North Gaza residents said Israeli forces were besieging schools and other shelters housing displaced families, ordering them out before rounding up men and pushing women and children to leave the area for Gaza City and points in the south.</p>

<p>Only a few families headed toward southern Gaza as the majority preferred to relocate temporarily in Gaza City, fearing they could otherwise never regain access to their homes.</p>

<p>Some said they had written their death notices in case they died from the constant bombardment.</p>

<p>"While the world is busy with Lebanon and new nonsense talk about a few days of ceasefire (in Gaza), the Israeli occupation is wiping out north Gaza and displacing its people," a resident of Jabalia told Reuters by a chat app.</p>

<p>The Israeli military says its forces operate in keeping with international law and accuses militants of hiding fighters and weaponry in civilian areas including hospitals and schools, a charge Hamas denies.</p>

<p>North Gaza was the first part of the enclave to be hammered by Israel's ground offensive after Hamas' cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, with intensive bombing largely flattening towns.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Hamas-led militants continue to attack Israeli forces in hit-and-run operations.</p>

<p>Hamas' 2023 attack killed 1,200 people and resulted in more than 250 hostages being taken into Gaza, per Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>The death count from Israel's retaliatory air and ground onslaught in Gaza has reached 43,020, the Gaza health ministry said in an update on Monday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said on Monday it sued Delta Air Lines in US District Court in Georgia after a faulty software update prompted a global outage in July.</p>

<p>The July 19 incident led to worldwide flight cancellations and hit industries including banks, healthcare, media companies and hotel chains.</p>

<p>CrowdStrike said it sued to make clear that CrowdStrike did not cause the harm that Delta claims, and that Delta repeatedly refused assistance from both CrowdStrike and Microsoft. Delta did not immediately comment on CrowdStrike's suit.</p>

<p>CrowdStrike is seeking a declaratory judgment plus legal fees.</p>

<p>Delta's lawsuit filed on Friday in Fulton County Superior Court called the faulty software update from CrowdStrike "catastrophic" and said the company "forced untested and faulty updates to its customers, causing more than 8.5 million Microsoft Windows-based computers around the world to crash."</p>

<p>Delta said the faulty update caused 7,000 flight cancellations, disrupted travel plans of 1.3 million customers and cost the carrier more than $500 million.</p>

<p>CrowdStrike's lawsuit, also filed on Friday, said Delta's own response and technology caused delays in the carrier's ability to resume normal operations.</p>

<p>CrowdStrike's lawsuit reiterated its contention that it has minimal liability, something Delta rejected.</p>

<p>Delta said CrowdStrike is liable for over $500 million in out-of-pocket losses as well as for unspecified lost profits, expenditures - including legal fees - reputational harm and future revenue loss.</p>

<p>The incident prompted the US Transportation Department to open an investigation.</p>

<p>"If CrowdStrike had tested the faulty update on even one computer before deployment, the computer would have crashed," Delta's lawsuit says.</p>

<p>Delta said it has invested billions of dollars in information technology licensing and infrastructure.</p>

<p>Last month, a senior CrowdStrike executive apologized before Congress for the faulty software update.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan's Mount Fuji remained snow-less as of Monday -- the latest date that its majestic slopes have been bare since records began 130 years ago, the weather agency said.</p>

<p>The volcano's snowcap begins forming on October 2 on average, and last year snow was first detected there on October 5.</p>

<p>But because of warm weather, this year no snowfall has yet been observed on Japan's highest mountain, said Yutaka Katsuta, a forecaster at Kofu Local Meteorological Office.</p>

<p>That marks the latest date since comparative data became available in 1894, he said beating the previous record of October 26 -- seen twice, in 1955 and then in 2016.</p>

<p>"Temperatures were high this summer, and these high temperatures continued into September, deterring cold air" which brings snow, Katsuta told AFP.</p>

<p>He agreed that climate change may have a degree of impact on the delay in the snowcap's formation.</p>

<p>Japan's summer this year was the joint hottest on record -- equalling the level seen in 2023 -- as extreme heatwaves fuelled by climate change engulfed many parts of the globe.</p>

<p>Mount Fuji is covered in snow for most of the year, but during the July-September hiking season, more than 220,000 visitors trudge up its steep, rocky slopes.</p>

<p>Many climb through the night to see the sunrise from the 3,776-metre (12,388-foot) summit.</p>

<p>Fewer climbers tackled Mount Fuji this year however after Japanese authorities introduced an entry fee and a daily cap on numbers to fight overtourism.</p>

<p>The symmetrical mountain has been immortalised in countless artworks, including Hokusai's "Great Wave".</p>

<p>It last erupted around 300 years ago.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A UK judge on Monday jailed notorious far-right agitator Tommy Robinson for 18 months after he admitted committing contempt of court over a long-running libel case involving a Syrian refugee.</p>

<p>The sentence is the latest jail term for one of Britain's most prominent anti-Muslim activists, who is blamed for helping fuel anti-immigration riots earlier this year.</p>

<p>It came after Robinson -- whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon -- pleaded guilty earlier on Monday to 10 breaches of a 2021 High Court order.</p>

<p>It bars the 41-year-old far-right figurehead from repeating false allegations he had made about the Syrian refugee, who successfully sued him for libel.</p>

<p>Handing down the 18-month jail sentence at Woolwich Crown Court in southeast London, judge Jeremy Johnson said Robinson's actions were a "planned, deliberate, direct, flagrant breach of the court's orders".</p>

<p>"Nobody is above the law. Nobody can pick and choose which injunctions they obey and those they do not," the judge added.</p>

<p>"It is in the interests of the whole community that injunctions are obeyed."</p>

<p>Robinson, wearing a grey suit and waistcoat with no tie, was held in custody, as some of his supporters looked on in court.</p>

<p>He had turned himself in to police on Friday, after an arrest warrant was issued following his failure to appear for a July court hearing on the case.</p>

<p>Lawyers for the Solicitor General, a senior government post advising on legal matters and which pursues such cases, said during the hearing that Robinson had been "thumbing his nose at the court".</p>

<p><strong>'Undermining'</strong></p>

<p>It accused him of "undermining" the rule of law, including by last year helping to publish a film called "Silenced", which contains the libellous allegations.</p>

<p>The film remains pinned to the top of Robinson's profile on the social media site X.</p>

<p>The former football hooligan, who helped form the now-defunct far-right English Defence League in 2009, had landed himself back in court because of his "principles", his lawyers argued.</p>

<p>Robinson, who brands himself as a free speech advocate, has previously served time for contempt of court, which is not a crime but can be sanctioned with a jail term.</p>

<p>He also has several criminal convictions, including for assault.</p>

<p>On Saturday, thousands of his supporters and other protesters marched through central London demanding his release, as well as tougher immigration laws.</p>

<p>Robinson, who has reportedly spent recent months outside the UK, has amassed a large online following built around his vehemently anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant messaging.</p>

<p>Demonstrators at anti-immigrant riots which erupted across England and Northern Ireland in late July and early August could be heard chanting his name.</p>

<p>He was widely condemned for a stream of social media posts during the week of violence, which was sparked by false rumours that the suspect behind the fatal stabbings of three young girls was a Muslim asylum seeker.</p>

<p>He has been a familiar sight at far-right rallies over the years, but has seen his profile grow over the last year after his X account was reinstated following billionaire Elon Musk's purchase of the platform.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris said Monday she would take a cognitive test in response to jabs from Donald Trump, and challenged the ex-president to take one too as mental fitness becomes a battle line in the White House race.</p>

<p>Harris has repeatedly said her 78-year-old Republican opponent, now the oldest presidential candidate in US history, is increasingly "unhinged" and unfit to lead the country again.</p>

<p>Trump has meanwhile called the 60-year-old Democratic vice president stupid, attacking her IQ in his pitch to voters in a race that the polls suggest is effectively tied.</p>

<p>Harris was asked in a CBS interview segment released Monday if she would take a cognitive test, as Trump had called for on social media.</p>

<p>"Sure. I would challenge him to take the same one," the vice president said.</p>

<p>"This is what he has resorted to. I think he is actually increasingly unstable and unhinged and has resorted to name calling because he actually has no plan for the American people," she added.</p>

<p>Harris's attacks on Trump's fitness focused last week on revelations from his longest-serving chief of staff, John Kelly.</p>

<p>The decorated Iraq veteran told The New York Times that Trump, while president, remarked that "Hitler did some good things too" and that instead of the US military's leadership, he "wanted generals like Adolf Hitler had."</p>

<p>Harris told reporters that Trump's alleged conduct was "deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous" and she later said she agreed with Kelly's description of Trump being a "fascist."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea has sent some 10,000 troops to train in Russia, the Pentagon said Monday, more than tripling the previous estimate as NATO warned of a dangerous expansion of the Ukraine war.</p>

<p>Russia and North Korea have boosted their political and military alliance in the course of the conflict, but the deployment of Pyongyang's troops into combat against Kyiv's forces would mark a significant escalation.</p>

<p>"We believe that the DPRK has sent around 10,000 soldiers in total to train in eastern Russia that will probably augment Russian forces near Ukraine over the next several weeks," Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told journalists, using an abbreviation for North Korea's official name.</p>

<p>"A portion of those soldiers have already moved closer to Ukraine, and we are increasingly concerned that Russia intends to use these soldiers in combat or to support combat operations against Ukrainian forces in Russia's Kursk Oblast," Sabrina Singh said.</p>

<p>The number of North Korean troops in Russia could grow further "as Putin's desperation continues to rise," she said of Russia's president, whose forces have reportedly suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties in Ukraine.</p>

<p>US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby previously put the number of North Korean troops in Russia at more than 3,000 on October 23, warning that they would become "legitimate military targets" if they fight against Ukraine.</p>

<p>NATO chief Mark Rutte on Monday decried the deployment of North Korean troops to bolster Russia's war effort in Ukraine as a dangerous expansion of the conflict that signaled Putin's "growing desperation."</p>

<p>Experts have said that in return for the troops, North Korea is likely aiming to acquire military technology, ranging from surveillance satellites to submarines, plus possible security guarantees from Moscow.</p>

<p>North Korea and Russia are under UN sanctions -- Pyongyang for its nuclear weapons program, and Moscow for the Ukraine war.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that Iran is seeking to develop a "stockpile" of nuclear bombs aimed at destroying Israel, two days after Israel bombed military targets in the Islamic republic.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Israel carried out air strikes on military sites in Iran in response to Tehran's October 1 attack, itself retaliation for the killing of Iran-backed militant leaders and a Revolutionary Guards commander.</p>

<p>"Iran is striving to develop a stockpile of nuclear bombs to destroy us, equipped with long-range missiles, intercontinental missiles that Iran is trying to develop," Netanyahu said.</p>

<p>"Iran could threaten the entire world at any point," Netanyahu added during a speech to lawmakers as Israel's parliament began its winter session.</p>

<p>"Stopping the Iranian nuclear programme is at the forefront of our minds, and for obvious reasons, I cannot share with you all our plans and actions in this regard."</p>

<p>The Iranian government has long denied that it is trying to build nuclear weapons and insists its programme is for peaceful purposes.</p>

<p>In recent years it has decreased its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, while significantly ramping up its nuclear programme, including amassing large stockpiles of enriched uranium.</p>

<p>But the head of the UN's nuclear watchdog said last week that Iran was showing "willingness" to re-engage on the nuclear issue.</p>

<p>Tehran, which supports Hamas, warned it would "respond firmly and effectively" to Israel's strikes at the weekend.</p>

<p>The war in Gaza has drawn in Tehran-backed allies of Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, including Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said Monday that "the fanatical axis of evil led by Iran threatens to destroy our country and threatens to take over other countries".</p>

<p>It "aspires to take control of our region by force," he said, adding that Israel is the "real barrier in Iran's path".</p>

<p>"Because according to Iran, if Israel falls, many countries will fall along with it. The entire Middle East will fall into its hands."</p>

<p>The UN Security Council will meet later on Monday at Iran's request. Tehran has urged the world to condemn Saturday's strikes, which authorities said killed four soldiers and caused some damage.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With over 5.2 million people of Indian origin residing in the US, Indian-Americans are now the second-largest immigrant group and an important political actor because of their rapid demographic growth.</p>

<p>A recent survey, "2024 Indian-American Attitudes," conducted by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and YouGov, reveals a decline in Indian-Americans' attachment to the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>According to the survey, 61% of registered voters plan to vote for Kamala Harris, while 32% intend to vote for Trump.</p>

<p>Abortion and reproductive rights are a highly salient issue, ranking second in policy concerns after inflation and prices and has tied with the economy and jobs and the reason why most Indian Americans lean towards Democrats is because of the Republican party's intolerance of minorities, its perspective about abortion and ties to Christian evangelicalism.</p>

<p>While they remain solidly behind Democrats, there's an increase in support for Republican candidates and former President Donald Trump. “This modest drift toward Trump appears to be driven by Indian-American men, particularly young men born in the United States.” the report says.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris' presence on the ballot, acknowledging her Indian heritage, has increased attention on Indian-American political views. “Harris's identity in this election is worth underscoring because findings from academic research have demonstrated that, among Asian-Americans, Indian-Americans are especially inclined to mobilise behind candidates who share their ethnicity,” the survey states.</p>

<p>Indian-Americans are what are called “high propensity” voters and both parties have wooed the group because of their pivotal nature.</p>

<p>In a campaign, Harris draws attention to the fact that her mother is an immigrant from the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and as “a brilliant, 5-foot tall, brown woman with an accent.” On the other hand we also see how the Republican campaign has highlighted their Indian American community and brought Usha Vance to the limelight - the wife of Trump's vice presidential candidate JD Vance.</p>

<p>Still and all, the Democratic Party has seen a 9% decline in support among respondents, from 56% in 2020 to 47% currently. “There has been a modest shift in the community's preferences, with a greater share of respondents willing to vote for Trump since the last election,” the survey says.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Canada, once a country welcoming an inpour of immigration, on Thursday announced that it is expected to hack down on its annual permanent-resident (PR) target to 395,000 down 21% from half a million for next year, 380,000 in 2026 and 365,000 in 2027.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada, once a country welcoming an inpour of immigration, on Thursday announced that it is expected to hack down on its annual permanent-resident (PR) target to 395,000 down 21% from half a million for next year, 380,000 in 2026 and 365,000 in 2027.</p>

<h2>What are the implications for Indians?</h2>

<p>The number of Indians immigrating to Canada skyrocketed by 326% over the decade, increasing from 32,828 in 2013 to a staggering 139,715 in 2023, according to NFAP analysis.</p>

<p>“In the tumultuous times as we emerged from the pandemic, between addressing labor needs and maintaining population growth, we didn't get the balance quite right," Trudeau said, as the permanent residency dream for Indians seems more and more improbable now. He said, that although immigration is essential for Canada's future it has to be controlled and sustainable.</p>

<p>This change would mean stricter eligibility criteria for international students and temporary workers will be implemented to manage the influx of newcomers.</p>

<h2>Will this help the Trudeau government stay in office?</h2>

<p>Amid plummeting poll numbers, and rising popularity of the opposition, the government is seeking to regain public favour and maintain its hold on power. According to the Canadian government, the plan “will pause population growth in the short term to achieve well-managed, sustainable growth in the long term”.</p>

<p>Trudeau also said that businesses have also been a major reason for the spiralling immigration system, “Far too many corporations have chosen to abuse our temporary measures, exploiting foreign workers while refusing to hire Canadians for a fair wage.”</p>

<p>The pandemic-era policies had relaxed temporary residency to address labour gaps and the government is trying to change that.</p>

<p>“We have listened to Canadians,” Immigration Minister Marc Miller said in a statement on Thursday. He added, “This immigration policy is essential for the economic success and development of our country.”</p>

<h2>What do the Canadians want?</h2>

<p>According to a poll by Environics Institute, “The latest Focus Canada research shows that almost six in ten (58%) Canadians now believe the country accepts too many immigrants…”</p>

<p>Economists sound alarm on Canada's ballooning population, citing strains on housing and critical services like healthcare and the government has been criticised for welcoming immigrants without reinforcing housing and healthcare.</p>

<p>Canada has experienced a 2 million growth in population according to Statistics Canada, which has exacerbated the housing supply and demand imbalance. “These lower PR targets are expected to reduce the housing supply gap by about 6,70,000 units by the end of 2027,” Miller said.</p>

<h3>How do migrant advocacy groups view this issue?</h3>

<p>Syed Hussan, spokesperson for the Migrant Rights Network Secretariat, said in a statement, “Cutting permanent resident numbers is a direct assault on migrants, who will be forced to remain temporary or become undocumented, pushed further into exploitative jobs.”</p>

<p>The group is of the opinion that migrants are not the root of Canada's housing crisis, unemployment and inadequate healthcare. Instead, they are the result of "decades of federal and provincial policies that have underfunded and privatised public services".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The once luxurious palace of Bangladesh's autocratic ex-leader Sheikh Hasina will become a museum to honour the revolution that ousted her, the leader of the caretaker government said Monday.</p>

<p>"The museum should preserve memories of her misrule and the people's anger when they removed her from power," Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus said as he toured the battered Ganabhaban palace, the former official residence of the prime minister.</p>

<p>The 84-year-old microfinance pioneer was appointed the country's "chief advisor" after the student-led uprising that forced Sheikh Hasina to flee by helicopter to India on August 5.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina's 15-year rule saw widespread human rights abuses, including the mass detention and extrajudicial killings of her political opponents, and a Bangladeshi court this month issued an arrest warrant for her arrest.</p>

<p>More than 700 people were killed, many in a brutal police crackdown, before Sheikh Hasina's fall.</p>

<p>As she fled, thousands rushed into her former residence, which the government said was a "symbol of repression".</p>

<p>The walls of the palace, looted and damaged in the chaos after Sheikh Hasina escaped, are daubed with graffiti condemning her fallen regime.</p>

<p>The museum will include a replica of the notorious "House of Mirrors" Aynaghar detention centre operated by Sheikh Hasina's regime -- given its name because its detainees were never supposed to see any other person besides themselves.</p>

<p>"The Aynaghar should remind visitors of the torture endured by secret prisoners," Muhammad Yunus said.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina's overthrow resulted in at least two days of chaos, which included the looting of a museum at the home of her father, Bangladesh's first president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.</p>

<p>Apurba Jahangir, a press official in the office of Muhammad Yunus, said construction would start by December.</p>

<p>"The museum construction hasn't begun yet, but it will start soon," Apurba told AFP.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina has not been seen in public since fleeing Bangladesh.</p>

<p>The 77-year-old's last official whereabouts was a military airbase near India's capital New Delhi.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four Indian nationals were killed and one injured when the car they were travelling in crashed and burst into flames in Canada's Ontario province, authorities said.</p>

<p>The accident occurred last week on Thursday in the Lake Shore Boulevard East and Cherry Street area of Toronto city, police said in a press release.</p>

<p>The five people, between the ages of 25-32, were travelling in a Tesla when it "lost control and struck the guard rail and then a concrete pillar" before bursting into flames, the press release said.</p>

<p>"We have gathered some evidence so far to suggest that speed was a factor," Toronto Police Duty Inspector Phillip Sinclair was quoted as saying by the Toronto Sun newspaper.</p>

<p>Four of the car occupants were pronounced dead on the scene by the police officials responding to the accident, the press release said. The fifth occupant, a 25-year-old woman, was transported to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.</p>

<p>She was rescued by a passing motorist who stopped to help, according to the report.</p>

<p>"Heartfelt condolences on tragic loss of Indian nationals in car accident that took place yesterday in Toronto," the official handle of the Indian Consulate in Toronto said in a post on X.</p>

<p>The post added that the consulate was in regular touch with local authorities and affected families in Canada and India. "All required assistance is being provided," it said.</p>

<p>Police have asked residents and drivers who may have dash camera footage or witnessed the event to contact investigators.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's not just the Harris-Trump show: US voters this November 5 will cast ballots for new members of Congress, tens of thousands of state and local officials, and in multiple referendums on topics including hot-button issues like abortion.</p>

<p>Here is a look at who and what is up for a vote beyond the choice between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris.</p>

<p><strong>Congress&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>In addition to choosing a president, millions of US voters will decide the fate of Congress: both in the House of Representatives -- where all seats are up for grabs -- and the Senate, where one-third are.</p>

<p>The House of Representatives has 435 members, with each representing a Congressional district and elected for a two-year term. Republicans hold the House by a small margin, but with Harris's entry into the race, Democrats are hoping to benefit from a surge in enthusiasm to recapture the lower house.</p>

<p>Thirty-four of the Senate's 100 seats are in play. The Senate consists of two senators from every state, who hold six-year terms. Democrats are in control now, but Republicans are hoping to reverse the situation.</p>

<p>If the same party were to win the presidency and both houses of Congress, it would have the power to push through the president's agenda without support from opposition lawmakers.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Governors&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Gubernatorial elections will occur in 11 of the 50 US states, with key races in New Hampshire, North Carolina and Washington state.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The governor is the top executive at the state level, where most powers that do not belong to the federal government lie.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Referendums&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Since the federal right to an abortion was overturned in 2022 by the Supreme Court, the issue has been ever-present on the political landscape.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Democrats have often used the debate over reproductive rights to dissuade women voters from casting ballots for Republicans.</p>

<p>Abortion rights will be the subject of referendums in 11 states, 10 of which are on whether to establish state-level abortion guarantees. Voters in Nebraska will decide whether the possibility of abortion should be limited to the first trimester.</p>

<p>In dozens of states, voters are being asked to decide on a variety of other issues.</p>

<p>In Colorado, for example, voters will vote on whether or not to ban "trophy hunting" of the mountain lion, bobcat and lynx.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And in Maine, voters will decide if they want to change their state flag.</p>

<p><strong>Local elections&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Thousands of local offices will also be up for election, including state-level lawmakers, judges, mayors, city council members, county officials, sheriffs and others.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon said an Israeli strike on Tyre on Monday killed seven people, with the Israeli army later issuing an evacuation call for swathes of the southern coastal city.</p>

<p>An "Israeli enemy strike this morning on a building" in the centre of Tyre killed "seven people and wounded 17 others", a health ministry statement said, updating an earlier toll of five dead and 10 wounded.</p>

<p>An AFP video journalist saw emergency personnel rush a survivor to an ambulance on a stretcher, while other rescuers worked to put out a heavily smouldering fire at the site, where a residential apartment block had collapsed.</p>

<p>Later Monday, the Israeli army told residents in parts of central Tyre to leave immediately, warning it would attack Hezbollah targets there.</p>

<p>"Hezbollah's activities force the (Israeli army) to act against it forcefully," military spokesman Avichay Adraee said in a post on X, urging residents to "head north".</p>

<p>An accompanying map showed large swathes of the city marked in red, including an area abutting a UNESCO World Heritage site.</p>

<p>Israel last month escalated air strikes on Hezbollah strongholds and sent ground forces into Lebanon, following a year of cross-border exchanges of fire with the Iran-backed group over the Gaza war.</p>

<p>Tyre was subjected to heavy Israeli strikes last week, leaving swathes of the centre in ruins.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Reports suggest Xie may have used some of her illicit gains to fund plastic surgery in an attempt to evade arrest.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 30-year-old Chinese woman, identified by her surname Xie, has been arrested in Thailand after evading capture for nearly two years on charges of defrauding over 1.5 million yuan (approximately Rs 1.77 crore). Xie, who allegedly underwent plastic surgery to change her appearance, was wanted for orchestrating a scheme promising airline jobs to victims in exchange for large payments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thai Immigration Police detained her following a tip-off from Bangkok residents who noticed her frequent face-covering and mask-wearing, raising suspicions of illegal immigration, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3283169/china-woman-arrested-us210000-scam-after-undergoing-plastic-surgery-evade-capture" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>South China Morning Post </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On October 7, police arrested Xie as she came down from her apartment to collect a food delivery. She failed to present a valid passport and was found to have overstayed her 15-day visa-on-arrival by over 650 days, having entered Thailand in late 2022.</p>

<p>Xie's criminal activities reportedly began nearly a decade ago. Between 2016 and 2019, she allegedly conned at least six people out of 1.52 million yuan by fabricating ties with major airlines and offering job placements to aspiring flight attendants. Among her victims was her cousin, whom she convinced to lend her 52,000 yuan (Rs 6.13 lakh) under the pretence of helping a friend buy a watch in Japan. Xie promised a reward for the favour, but her cousin only recovered a small part of the loan and later discovered that Xie's flight attendant persona was a fabrication.</p>

<p>Thai authorities revealed that Xie had an Interpol Blue Notice, indicating her status as an international fugitive. Chinese authorities requested this notice after tracking her fraudulent activities back to 2014, according to the South China Morning Post.</p>

<p>Reports suggest Xie may have used some of her illicit gains to fund plastic surgery in an attempt to evade arrest. The Thai Immigration Bureau Division has confirmed that Xie will be penalized under Thai law for visa violations before being deported to China. Her case has drawn parallels to that of Lao Rongzhi, a notorious Chinese fugitive who was apprehended in 2019 after eluding capture for 20 years through aliases and multiple surgeries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cristiano Ronaldo, a legendary footballer with a global fan base, recently met a 24-year-old superfan named Gong, who cycled from China to Saudi Arabia for seven months to meet him. Starting from his home on March 18, Gong arrived at the Al Nassr Football Club on October 20, as the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3283844/devoted-china-cristiano-ronaldo-football-fan-takes-13000km-bicycle-ride-meet-idol" rel="nofollow, noindex">South China Morning Post</a></em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3283844/devoted-china-cristiano-ronaldo-football-fan-takes-13000km-bicycle-ride-meet-idol" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em> </em></a>reported.</p>

<p>Throughout his journey, Gong cycled through several countries, including Kazakhstan, Georgia, Iran, and Qatar, before reaching Riyadh, Saudi Arabia's capital. After Ronaldo's team learned about Gong's extraordinary effort, they arranged a meeting outside the Al Nassr Football Club.</p>

<p>During their encounter, Ronaldo signed Gong's shirt and posed for several photos with him. According to the South China Morning Post, Gong faced numerous challenges. He struggled with language barriers, budget-friendly meals in different countries, and the physical exhaustion of cycling such a vast distance.</p>

<p>Gong's trip to Riyadh was inspired after Ronaldo had to cancel a planned visit to China in February due to a leg injury. Gong covered an impressive 13,000 kilometres on his bike, carrying essentials like two 60,000mAh power banks, a tent, cooking utensils, clothes, and other necessities. In places where food was costly, he relied on bread and used translation software to communicate with locals. In August, while in Armenia, he fell ill with a high fever and collapsed on the roadside, later receiving free hospital treatment.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the journey, Gong shared that the experience made him more mature and patient and helped him forge new friendships. After reaching Riyadh on October 10, he waited several days to meet Ronaldo, who was in Europe at the time. The Al Nassr FC staff assured him of a brief meeting, which finally happened after he saw Ronaldo play in an Al Nassr vs. Al Shabab match, thanks to a fan who offered him a ticket.</p>

<p>When Gong met Ronaldo, the footballer shook his hand, hugged him, and signed his No. 7 Al Nassr jersey. Ronaldo also autographed a banner with the names of Gong's friends and inscribed the phrase, "What I dream of is true love and freedom."</p>

<p>In China, Ronaldo, or "C Luo," is celebrated for his record-breaking career, boasting over 900 goals and being the most-followed individual on Instagram, with 640 million followers. Gong now plans to visit Portugal, Ronaldo's hometown, as his next adventure.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lone catamaran named "Silky" patrols waters around the remote island of Malpelo, a refuge that is protected yet full of peril for endangered marine species in the Colombian Pacific.</p>

<p>Its crew of environmentalists is the terror of boats illegally fishing for sharks inside the reserve some 500 kilometers (310 miles) off mainland Colombia -- one of the richest countries in terms of marine fauna.</p>

<p>Without weapons or backup, the activists shoo away intruder vessels, threaten to report them to the authorities, even dive under water to cut loose sharks caught in nets or on lines.</p>

<p>Active round-the-clock since 2018, the team of shark-lovers claims to be turning the tide in the Malpelo Fauna and Flora Sanctuary, a mecca for divers and the largest no-fishing zone in the Eastern Tropical Pacific.</p>

<p>"The success of the project can be seen in the fact that they (the illegal fishers) do not return," said Colombian diver Erika Lopez, who created the foundation Biodiversity Conservation Colombia with the help of an Australian philanthropist.</p>

<p>The project was born from what the activists view as a lack of official shark protection, with the navy arresting illegal fishers only if they happen to come across them on routine patrols against drug traffickers and other territorial intruders.</p>

<p>Due to play host of the UN COP16 biodiversity conference starting next Monday, Colombia's vast Pacific coastline is on a key migratory route for hammerhead sharks, whale sharks and other species, many of them endangered.</p>

<p>But the bountiful waters of the sanctuary attract vessels from far and wide, many from neighboring Ecuador, others from Panama and Costa Rica in the Caribbean or even China, where shark fin is a delicacy.</p>

<p>Lopez's foundation claims the crew of the Silky -- the name of a type of shark -- has rescued 508 animals alive since 2018, scared away 302 boats and confiscated more than 70,000 meters of fishing line.</p>

<p>Since last December, the foundation reports it has not spotted any fishing boats near Malpelo island in the reserve of more than 850,000 hectares recognized as a UNESCO heritage site.</p>

<p>"We try as much as possible to take the equipment away from them, to free the species that are trapped, that's the main mission," 53-year-old Dario Ortiz, an artisanal fisherman-turned-environmentalist, told AFP on board the "Silky."</p>

<p>But it is a full-time effort.</p>

<p>"This boat has to be basically 24/7, 365 days a year containing this threat," said Lopez, 51, who dreams of upscaling the project to a flotilla of vessels dedicated to conservation and science in the Pacific.</p>

<p><strong>Rich and desirable</strong></p>

<p>On the high seas, far from Malpelo island, a Colombian navy warship also patrols an area teeming with hammerhead sharks, marlin and other endangered creatures.</p>

<p>On a recent mission with AFP on board, it arrested three Ecuadoran fishermen found with a highly valuable haul of silky, hammerhead and blacktip sharks, sailfish and four blue marlins -- all still alive.</p>

<p>"The Colombian Pacific is very rich and it is desirable," said Admiral Rafael Aranguren.</p>

<p>With "our ships we can reach this part of the territory and exercise controls so that they do not illegally exploit these riches, so that they do not harm the environment."</p>

<p>In 2020, the government of former president Ivan Duque banned shark fishing, both on an industrial and small-scale, to try to protect marine stocks.</p>

<p>But faced with an outcry from Afro-Caribbean fishing communities on the Pacific coast which rely on shark catches for meat to eat and sell, incumbent President Gustavo Petro in January partly repealed the ban.</p>

<p>The government decreed that small-scale fishermen may keep and consume sharks accidentally caught in nets meant for other, unrestricted, fish species.</p>

<p>The decision caused outrage among conservationists who view it as a license to kill.</p>

<p>The Navy estimates it has arrested 30 people so far this year for illegal fishing in Colombian waters.</p>

<p>Between 2012 and 2022, authorities seized more than 334 tons of fish meat illegally harvested, according to the Ministry of Environment.</p>

<p>The country does not keep a record of sharks that fall victim to illegal fishing.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday accused the Indian government of "coercive behaviour&nbsp;and threatening and violent acts", as the two countries announced tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats following the killing of a Khalistani terrorist. During a press conference, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/statements/2024/10/14/statement-prime-minister-ongoing-investigation-violent-criminal-activity-linked">Mr Trudeau</a> said New Delhi's "fundamental error" was "unacceptable" as tensions reached new heights over&nbsp;the 2023 murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian citizen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Calling the expulsion "additional steps to protect Canadians", Mr Trudeau echoed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)'s claim that "agents of the Government of India have engaged in, and continue to engage in, activities that pose a significant threat to public safety".</p>

<p>Trudeau's allegations coincide with sliding support and tanking popularity ratings, and two electoral losses ahead of next year's elections.</p>

<p>Mr Trudeau also urged India to cooperate with the investigation, to recognize the evidence shared in the murder case so far and asserted that "extrajudicial operations abroad will henceforth be unequivocally aligned with international law".</p>

<p>India has repeatedly denied the charges and claimed Canada has not shared any evidence in this regard.</p>

<p>New Delhi yesterday hit back at Canada over pursuing its diplomats as "persons of interest" in its investigation, calling their allegations "preposterous" and a "strategy of smearing India for political gains". India has been maintaining that the main issue has been that of Canada giving space to pro-Khalistani elements operating from Canadian soil with impunity.</p>

<p>India and Canada each expelled the other's ambassador and five other top diplomats, after New Delhi said its envoy had been named among "persons of interest" in Nijjar's murder.&nbsp;New Delhi said it was withdrawing its six diplomats from Canada, but Ottawa said it had served them notices of expulsion. Though tensions have been simmering since the 2023 murder as&nbsp;Trudeau said there were "credible allegations" linking Indian intelligence services to the crime, the expulsions mark a major escalation.</p>

<p>India "decided to expel" Ottawa's acting High Commissioner Stewart Wheeler, his deputy and four first secretaries, ordering they leave before midnight on Sunday.</p>

<p>Ottawa announced similar measures in return, with Canadian police saying they had "evidence pertaining to agents of the government of India's involvement in serious criminal activity" in Canada.&nbsp;Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said that India had refused to cooperate in the investigation, or to lift diplomatic immunity for its envoys.</p>

<p>India rejected the claim yesterday and said, "Since Prime Minister Trudeau made certain allegations in September 2023, the Canadian Government has not shared a shred of evidence with the Government of India, despite many requests from our side."</p>

<p>Nijjar -- who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2015 -- had advocated for a separate Sikh state, known as Khalistan, carved out of India.&nbsp;He had been wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder.&nbsp;Four Indian nationals have been arrested in connection with Nijjar's murder, which took place in the parking lot of a Sikh temple in Vancouver in June 2023.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pollution, habitat degradation, climate change and over-use of freshwater resources are putting a strain on Europe, with only a third of its surface water in good health, the European Environment Agency warned on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"The health of Europe's waters is not good. Our waters face an unprecedented set of challenges that threatens Europe's water security," EEA executive director Leena Yla-Mononen said in a statement.</p>

<p>Only 37 percent of Europe's surface water bodies achieved "good" or "high" ecological status, a measure of aquatic ecosystem health, the EEA report said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, only 29 percent of surface waters achieved "good" chemical status over the 2015-2021 period, according to data reported by EU member states.</p>

<p>Europe's groundwaters -- the source of most drinking water in the continent -- fared better, with 77 percent enjoying "good" chemical status.</p>

<p>Good chemical status means the water is free of excessive pollution from chemical nutrients and toxic substances like PFAS and microplastics.</p>

<p>Surface water is threatened by air pollution -- such as coal burning and car emissions -- as well as the agriculture industry, whose dumped waste contaminates the soil.</p>

<p>"European agriculture needs to increase its use of more sustainable organic and agroecological practices, accompanied by incentives and a change in our food and dietary habits," the report said.</p>

<p>The European agency analysed 120,000 surface water bodies and 3.8 million square kilometres (1.5 million square miles) of groundwater body areas in 19 EU countries and Norway.</p>

<p>It called on EEA member states to halve their use of pesticides by 2030.</p>

<p>"We need to redouble our efforts to restore the health of our valued rivers, lakes, coastal waters and other water bodies, and to make sure this vital resource is resilient and secure for generations to come," Yla-Mononen said.</p>

<p>Climate change effects, including extreme droughts and flooding, and the over-use of freshwater resources are putting a strain on Europe's lakes, rivers, coastal waters and groundwaters "like never before", the EEA said.</p>

<p>Governments must prioritise reducing water consumption and restoring ecosystems, it said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Indigenous organizations in the Brazilian state of Para said they were not consulted by the government before it signed a deal with multinational companies to sell carbon offset credits to support conservation of the Amazon rainforest in the state.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indigenous organizations in the Brazilian state of Para said they were not consulted by the government before it signed a deal with multinational companies to sell carbon offset credits to support conservation of the Amazon rainforest in the state.</p>

<p>Amazon.com Inc and other firms agreed last month to buy carbon credits valued at $180 million through the LEAF Coalition conservation initiative, which it helped set up in 2021 with a group of companies and governments, including the United States and United Kingdom.</p>

<p>At the time, Para Governor Helder Barbalho said the deal had the participation of Indigenous peoples and traditional communities.</p>

<p>But on Tuesday, 38 Indigenous and community organizations from Para signed a public letter denouncing his failure to consult them.</p>

<p>"It is unacceptable for the government of Para to take decisions without consulting traditional communities, who are the greatest protectors of the forests while also being the most impacted by the lack of effective climate adaptation policies," they said in the letter.</p>

<p>"Forest peoples must be heard and consulted. Our territories are not for sale," they said.</p>

<p>Alessandra Korap Munduruku, a tribal leader who was the letter's principal author, said the role of U.S.-based companies like Amazon and the Walmart Foundation, Walmart's philanthropic organization, in the carbon credit purchase was worrying.</p>

<p>"Our priority is the eviction of invaders on our reservation lands that are threatened by miners and a grain railway," she told Reuters by telephone. "Our leaders were never consulted on the carbon credits. We are being sold like goods."</p>

<p>The governor's office did not reply to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Korap Munduruku is an Indigenous&nbsp;teacher turned community leader who won the prestigious Goldman environmental prize in 2023 for her efforts to convince mining companies leave Munduruku lands.</p>

<p>The agreement is LEAF's first deal in the Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, which is vital to curbing climate change because of the enormous amount of greenhouse gas its trees absorb.</p>

<p>The deal foresees the purchase of up to 12 million tons of carbon credits generated by reducing deforestation in Para between 2023 and 2026. It was announced on Sept. 24 during New York Climate Week.</p>

<p>Each of the credits represents a reduction of 1 metric ton of carbon emissions and they are jurisdictional, so Para gets paid for reducing deforestation across the state, including on public lands like reservations.</p>

<p>Governor Barbalho said the state would only collect the portion of the sales' proceeds needed to continue its efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions, while the rest would go to Indigenous peoples and traditional communities as well as family farms.</p>

<p>Para will host the UN COP30 climate summit next year, in a move that is the centerpiece of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's bid to restore Brazil's environmental credentials after years of soaring deforestation.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday vowed to strike Hezbollah without mercy following a deadly drone strike on a military base in Israel, and retaliation would extend to targets in Beirut.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday vowed to strike Hezbollah without mercy, a day after the Iran-backed group's deadliest strike on Israel since the start of the war in late September.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's drone attack on an Israeli base killed four soldiers on Sunday, while another 60 people were injured, according to the Israeli volunteer rescue service United Hatzalah.</p>

<p>"We will continue to mercilessly strike Hezbollah in all parts of Lebanon -- including Beirut," Netanyahu said as he visited the base near Binyamina, south of Haifa.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it launched the "squadron of attack drones" in response to Israeli attacks, including one last week that Lebanon's health ministry said killed at least 22 people in central Beirut.</p>

<p>Since Israel on September 23 escalated its bombing against targets in Lebanon the war has killed at least 1,315 people, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures, though the real toll is likely to be higher.</p>

<p>Prior to Netanyahu's comments a string of new air strikes had already occurred against targets around Lebanon, including one in a northern Christian-majority village which killed at least 21 people, according to the health ministry.</p>

<p>Yousef, the manager of a restaurant near the Binyamina base, told AFP he heard "a huge boom" before many ambulances arrived.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said on Monday around midday that it had launched rockets at a naval base near Haifa before a further "big rocket salvo" in the early evening at the northern Israeli town of Safed.</p>

<p>Its fighters were also "engaged in violent clashes" in the Lebanese frontier village of Aita al-Shaab, and were fighting elsewhere as well, it said.</p>

<p>Air raid sirens sounded across central Israel in the early evening, including in the commercial hub of Tel Aviv, the military said, after it earlier reported the interception of two drones approaching from Syria.</p>

<p><strong>'Never-ending' strikes</strong></p>

<p>After almost a year of tit-for-tat exchanges between Hezbollah and Israeli forces over the Lebanon border, Israel intensified its strikes against targets in Lebanon late last month before sending ground troops across the frontier.</p>

<p>Israel wants to push back Hezbollah in order to secure its northern boundary and allow tens of thousands of people displaced by rocket fire over the last year to return home safely.</p>

<p>Hezbollah says its strikes are in solidarity with its Palestinian ally, Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7 last year, triggering the ongoing Gaza war with Israel.</p>

<p>The International Organization for Migration said last week it had verified 690,000 displaced people in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Israel's deadly air strike on the village of Aito in northern Lebanon on Monday marked a departure from the usual pattern, being located far from the main combat area and in a mostly Christian area.</p>

<p>Israel has focused its firepower mostly on Hezbollah strongholds in Shiite Muslim-majority areas in the south and in the suburbs of Beirut.</p>

<p>An AFP photographer in Aito said the missile levelled a residential building. Body parts were scattered in the rubble.</p>

<p>In the southern border town of Marjayoun, civil defence chief Anis Abla told AFP his rescue teams were exhausted.</p>

<p>"Our rescue missions are becoming more and more difficult, because the strikes are never-ending and target us," he said.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry condemned Israel's "continued targeting of medical, relief and paramedics teams."</p>

<p>Israel also continues to face criticism over injuries and damage sustained by the UN peacekeeping force which has been deployed in Lebanon since 1978.</p>

<p>Five peacekeepers were injured in a series of incidents last week, with the UN force on Sunday accusing Israeli troops of breaking through a gate with two tanks and entering one of their positions.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said a tank "backed several meters into a UNIFIL post" while "under fire" and attempting to evacuate injured soldiers.</p>

<p><strong>Anti-missile defence</strong></p>

<p>Prime Minister Simon Harris of Ireland, which has troops in the UNIFIL mission, on Monday told Israeli President Isaac Herzog in a phone call that UNIFIL has "a clear mandate from the Security Council, and that it must be allowed to carry out its functions unimpeded," Harris's office said.</p>

<p>The Hamas attack on Israel last year which triggered war in Gaza resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The number includes hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, 42,289 people, the majority civilians. The UN has described the figures as reliable.</p>

<p>With the war there, and in Lebanon, showing no sign of abating, fears of even wider regional conflict have seen Iran, which backs Hezbollah and Hamas, engage in diplomatic efforts with allies and other powers.</p>

<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met a senior official from Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi movement in Oman, the latest stop in a regional diplomatic tour.</p>

<p>Jordan's King Abdullah II warned of "a regional war that will be costly for everyone," during a meeting with Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati on Monday.</p>

<p>Just before Sunday's attack on the Israeli army base, the Pentagon said it would deploy a high-altitude anti-missile system known as THAAD to Israel to further boost its ally's defences against a potential Iranian attack.</p>

<p>Israel is still weighing its response to an October 1 missile attack by Iran, the latest of two it has carried out against Israel this year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Extreme temperatures and humidity driven by climate change could reduce the Amazon rainforest's capacity to absorb the greenhouse gas methane by 70 per cent, a study has found. Researchers said that under a warmer climate, the extreme rainfall and droughts projected for South America's Amazon could impact its net greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>Often referred to as the 'lungs of the planet', the tropical rainforest lies majorly in Brazil, with parts in Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, among others, and is known to be a crucial 'greenhouse gas sink' that absorbs these gases from the air.</p>

<p>However, 20 per cent of the Amazon region, which remains flooded for nearly half a year, releases methane, countering its ability to absorb other greenhouse gases, the researchers at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil said. Their study is published in the journal Environmental Microbiome.</p>

<p>Previous studies have shown that the flooded areas of Amazon contribute up to almost 30 per cent of methane emissions from wetlands globally.</p>

<p>"Although it's already been shown that factors such as air temperature and seasonal flooding can influence the composition of microbial communities affecting the flow of methane in these environments. But what should we expect in the context of climate change and the projected extreme weather?" Lead author Julia Gontijo, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Davis, US, said.</p>

<p>For this study, researchers took soil samples from two flooded regions of the Amazon and one from elevated forests known to absorb methane. These samples were subjected to extreme temperatures -- 27 degrees Celsius and 30 degrees Celsius -- and humidity.</p>

<p>They found that in the soil sample from the elevated forest methane absorbtion dropped by 70 per cent in hot and dry conditions, while methane production surged in heavy rainfall, as the soil was not used to dealing with extreme humidity.</p>

<p>"Within this (elevated) forest soil, an average decrease of 70 per cent in (methane) consumption potential was observed with temperature increase in dry conditions," the authors wrote.</p>

<p>It means that the floodplain microbiome can adapt to climate change but the upland forest microbiome is sensitive to its effects, which could cause a shift in the balance of greenhouse gas emissions in the Amazon in future, Gontijo said.</p>

<p>"In view of the Amazon Rainforest biome's importance in proportion to global levels, this could represent a very serious problem," she said.</p>

<p>She further said that in both (the) floodplains, although there were no observation of significant changes in methane emission patterns, the number of methane-producing microorganisms increased that can be a future problem.</p>

<p>The results could be used in framing public policies, the author added</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli army on Monday said air raid sirens were activated across central Israel, including the commercial hub of Tel Aviv, as projectiles were fired across the border from Lebanon.</p>

<p>"Sirens sounded in a number of areas in central Israel due to projectiles fired from Lebanon into Israeli territory," the army said in a statement.</p>

<p>The police said they had deployed officers to locate and secure any potential impact sites "to ensure public safety".</p>

<p>In a later statement, the military said that "several interception attempts were made toward a number of projectiles that crossed from Lebanon".</p>

<p>It did not specify whether any of the projectiles had breached the country's air defences.</p>

<p>The barrage comes just a day after a Hezbollah drone attack killed four soldiers in the deadliest attack on Israel since the war in Lebanon began.</p>

<p>Israel and Hezbollah have been at war since Israel intensified its strikes on Lebanon on September 23 and sent ground troops across the border a week later.</p>

<p>Israel has vowed to secure its northern border to allow tens of thousands of people displaced by nearly a year of Hezbollah rocket fire. Hezbollah says the rocket fire is in solidarity with its Palestinian ally, Hamas.</p>

<p>Israel's air defences, including the Iron Dome system, have so far intercepted most of the projectiles, with a few casualties caused by strikes or falling debris.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA launched a spacecraft from Florida on Monday on a mission to examine whether Jupiter's moon Europa has conditions suitable to support life, with a focus on the large subsurface ocean believed to be lurking beneath its thick outer shell of ice.</p>

<p>The US space agency's Europa Clipper spacecraft blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket under sunny skies. The robotic solar-powered probe is due to enter orbit around Jupiter in 2030 after journeying about 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion km) in 5-1/2 years. The launch had been planned for last week but was put off because of Hurricane Milton.</p>

<p>It is the largest spacecraft NASA has built for a planetary mission, at about 100 feet (30.5 meters) long and about 58 feet (17.6 meters) wide with its antennas and solar arrays fully deployed - bigger than a basketball court - while weighing approximately 13,000 pounds (6,000 kg).</p>

<p>Even though Europa, the fourth-largest of Jupiter's 95 officially recognized moons, is just a quarter of Earth's diameter, its vast global ocean of salty liquid water may contain twice the water in Earth's oceans. Earth's oceans are thought to have been the birthplace of life on our planet.</p>

<p>Europa, whose diameter of roughly 1,940 miles (3,100 km) is approximately 90% that of our moon, has been viewed as a potential habitat for life beyond Earth in our solar system. Its icy shell is believed to be 10-15 miles (15-25 km) thick, sitting atop an ocean 40-100 miles (60-150 km) deep.</p>

<p>NASA Associate Administrator Jim Free told a prelaunch briefing on Sunday that Europa boasts one of the most promising environments for potential habitability in our solar system, beyond Earth, though he noted that this mission will not be a search for any actual living organisms.</p>

<p>"What we discover on Europa," Free said, "will have profound implications for the study of astrobiology and how we view our place in the universe."</p>

<p>"Scientists believe Europa has suitable conditions below its icy surface to support life. Its conditions are water, energy, chemistry and stability," said Sandra Connelly, deputy associate administrator of NASA's science mission directorate.</p>

<p>Among the mission, objectives are measuring the internal ocean and the layer of ice above it, mapping the moon's surface composition, and hunting for plumes of water vapour that may be venting from Europa's icy crust. The plan is for Europa Clipper starting in 2031 to conduct 49 close flybys of Europa over three years, coming as close as 16 miles (25 kilometers) to the moon's surface.</p>

<p>Europa Clipper will be operating in an intense radiation environment around Jupiter, our solar system's biggest planet.</p>

<p>Jupiter is enveloped by a magnetic field about 20,000 times stronger than Earth's. This magnetic field spins, capturing and accelerating charged particles and creating radiation that could harm spacecraft. NASA fashioned a vault made of titanium and aluminium inside the Europa Clipper to protect its sensitive electronics from this radiation.</p>

<p>"One of the Europa Clipper mission's main challenges is delivering a spacecraft hardy enough to withstand the pummeling of radiation from Jupiter but also sensitive enough to gather the measurements needed to investigate Europa's environment," Connelly said.</p>

<p>NASA said Europa Clipper is loaded with more than 6,060 pounds (2,750 kg) of propellant to get it to Jupiter. For the launch, the spacecraft was placed inside the protective nose cone atop the rocket.</p>

<p>The spacecraft will not take a straight path to Jupiter. Instead, it is due to fly by Mars, then back by Earth, using the gravity of each planet to increase its momentum like a slingshot. Its expansive solar arrays, which were folded up for the launch, will gather sunlight for powering the spacecraft's nine scientific instruments as well as its electronics and other subsystems.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia, which chairs the BRICS group this year, has called on its partners to create an alternative to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to counter political pressure from Western nations ahead of the BRICS summit later this month.</p>

<p>BRICS, originally comprising Brazil, Russia, India, and China, has expanded to include South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates. Top BRICS finance and central bank officials are meeting in Moscow this week.</p>

<p>Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, who is hosting the meeting, said the global financial system is controlled by Western countries and that the group, which represents 37% of the global economy, needs to create an alternative.</p>

<p>"The IMF and the World Bank are not performing their roles. They are not working in the interests of BRICS countries," Siluanov said at an event on the first day of the meeting.</p>

<p>"It is necessary to form new conditions or even new institutions, similar to the Bretton Woods institutions, but within the framework of our community, within the framework of BRICS," Siluanov added.</p>

<p>Russia had its forex reserves in dollars and euros frozen and its financial system heavily hit by sanctions by the West after it invaded Ukraine in February 2022. The country is cut off from international capital markets.</p>

<p>Russia has recently also experienced delays in international transactions with its trading partners, including BRICS member countries, as banks in these countries fear punitive actions from Western regulators.</p>

<p>Russia's central bank Governor, Elvira Nabiullina, has previously talked about a BRICS Bridge payments system, which would link member countries' financial systems, but progress has been slow.</p>

<p>The only financial institution the BRICS countries have established so far is the New Development Bank, created in 2015 to finance infrastructure and sustainable development projects in BRICS members and other emerging economies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel expanded its targets in its war with the Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon on Monday, killing at least 18 people in its first strike on the Christian-majority town of Aitou in the north, the Lebanese Red Cross said.</p>

<p>So far the main focus of Israel's military operations in Lebanon has been in the south, the eastern Bekaa Valley and the suburbs of Beirut.</p>

<p>The strike in the northern region hit a house that had been rented to displaced families, Aitou Mayor Joseph Trad told Reuters. In addition to the deaths, four people were injured, the Red Cross said.</p>

<p>Israel on Monday ordered residents of 25 villages to evacuate to areas north of the Awali River, which flows through southern Lebanon, as it intensifies its attacks in the region.</p>

<p>An Israeli strike killed Muhammad Kamel Naim, the commander of the anti-tank missile unit of Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force, in the Nabatieh area of south Lebanon, the military said.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has not immediately commented.</p>

<p>The operations come amidst high tensions between Israel and the UN peacekeeping force UNIFIL in south Lebanon, with Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen on Monday repeating a call by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the UN troops to leave.</p>

<p>Israel and the United Nations have been trading accusations over the peacekeepers in south Lebanon, as Israel keeps pushing its forces through the area in an attempt to wipe out Iran-backed Hezbollah and its military infrastructure while it battles Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>The UN said Israeli tanks had burst into its base on Sunday, the latest allegations of Israeli violations against peacekeeping forces, that have been condemned by Hezbollah and by Israel's allies.</p>

<p>Israel disputed the UN account and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for the peacekeepers to withdraw, saying they were providing "human shields" for Hezbollah during an upsurge in hostilities.</p>

<p>Hezbollah denies it uses the proximity of peacekeepers for protection.</p>

<p>The Middle East, meanwhile, remains on high alert for Israel to retaliate against Iran for an October 1 barrage of long-range missiles launched in response to Israel's assaults on Lebanon.</p>

<p>The Pentagon said on Sunday it would send US troops to Israel along with an advanced US anti-missile system, as Israel weighs its expected retaliation against Iran.</p>

<p>The Israeli military took foreign journalists into southern Lebanon on Sunday and showed them a Hezbollah tunnel shaft that was less than 200 metres away (650 feet) from a UNIFIL position, as well as weapon stashes that the troops found.</p>

<p>Brigadier General Yiftach Norkin said the tunnels were built a few years ago.</p>

<p>"We are actually standing in a military base of Hezbollah very close to the UN," Norkin said, pointing to the shaft's trap door in an area covered by undergrowth and overlooked by a UN observation post.</p>

<p>Since announcing its ground operation near the border, the Israeli military says that it has destroyed dozens of Hezbollah tunnel shafts, rocket launchers and command posts.</p>

<p>"We found several days ago a huge quantity of weapons originally coming from Iran and Russia. Brand new," said Colonel Olivier Rafowicz. "They were prepared for attacking us and (launching) a large invasion into the north of Israel," Rafowicz said, showing the journalists crates of weapons.</p>

<p>Reuters could not immediately verify these claims.</p>

<p><strong>EXTENSIVE TUNNEL NETWORK</strong></p>

<p>Hezbollah possesses an extensive tunnel network in southern Lebanon, both the group and Israel say. Israel estimates they extend for hundreds of kilometres. A Hezbollah field commander told Reuters last week that the tunnels "are the foundation of the battle." Hezbollah has not immediately commented.</p>

<p>UNIFIL has said previous Israeli attacks on a watchtower, cameras, communications equipment and lighting had limited its monitoring abilities. UN sources say they fear any violations of international law in the conflict will be impossible to monitor.</p>

<p>The European Union's member states have taken too long to condemn Israel's attacks on UNIFIL soldiers in Lebanon, the European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Monday, describing the attacks as "completely unacceptable".</p>

<p>EU countries, led by Italy, France and Spain, have thousands of troops in the 10,000-strong peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon, which has said it has repeatedly come under attack from Israeli forces in recent days</p>

<p>On Monday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez urged European Union members to respond to a request by Madrid and Ireland to suspend the bloc's free trade agreement with Israel over its attacks in Lebanon and Gaza.</p>

<p>The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah resumed a year ago when the operator group began firing rockets at Israeli positions in support of Hamas at the start of the Gaza war and has sharply escalated in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Israel says its operations in Lebanon are aimed at securing the return of tens of thousands of its residents displaced from their homes in northern Israel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The decapitated bodies of five men were discovered on a road in central Mexico, in a region controlled by the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel. Police were alerted to the scene near the town of Ojuelos, in Jalisco state, on Sunday morning, after drivers reported seeing plastic bags containing human remains, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c148yy7yxyno" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>BBC </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A report was received indicating that, on the asphalt strip of the road (...) there were several bags that looked like human silhouettes," the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://fiscalia.jalisco.gob.mx/comunicacion-social/boletines-de-prensa/boletin-2542-20241013" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>state prosecutor's office</em></a> said.&nbsp;Officials said forensic teams are working to identify the victims.</p>

<p>The gruesome nature of the murders and the public disposal of the bodies strongly suggest cartel involvement.&nbsp;National Guard troops also arrived at the scene, where they found the remains wrapped in black plastic bags, according to a statement from the Jalisco state prosecutor's office.</p>

<p>The victims' ages have not yet been determined, and an investigation is underway, the statement added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Jalisco, official statistics show that 1,415 people were murdered between January and September this year.</p>

<p>More than 30,000 people are killed annually in Mexico, which has one of the highest murder rates in the world.</p>

<p>Last week, the mayor of a Mexican city plagued by drug violence was assassinated just days after taking office.</p>

<p>Alejandro Arcos was murdered in Chilpancingo, a city of about 280,000 people in the southwestern state of Guerrero.</p>

<p>President Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office last week, has ruled out a return to the previous administration's war on drugs.</p>

<p>She stated that her security strategy would focus on gathering intelligence on cartels and addressing the root causes of violence- a policy known as "hugs not bullets," introduced by her predecessor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.</p>

<p>However, the opposition is pushing for a tougher stance against the cartels.</p>

<p>Since the government began deploying the Mexican military against the drug cartels in 2006, hundreds of thousands of people have been killed, and tens of thousands more have gone missing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran said Monday it currently sees "no grounds" for its indirect talks with the United States via intermediary Oman, citing the crisis in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Iran said in June that it had held indirect talks with the United States via Oman, despite having no diplomatic relations with its foe.</p>

<p>"Currently we don't see any ground for these talks, until we can get past the current crisis," Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told reporters in Oman's capital Muscat.</p>

<p>The process, he said, had been halted "due to the specific conditions of the region".</p>

<p>Iran fired 200 missiles at Israel on October 1 in what it said was retaliation for the killing of Tehran-aligned operator leaders in the region and a general in Iran's Revolutionary Guards.</p>

<p>Israel has vowed to respond.</p>

<p>The Gulf sultanate of Oman has long mediated between Iran and the United States, which cut ties after the 1979 Islamic revolution.</p>

<p>The United States is Israel's close ally and top provider of military assistance, while Iran backs the Palestinian operator group Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah which are fighting Israel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senior Indian military sources who have analysed satellite imagery of a new Chinese base on the North bank of the Pangong Lake say that the site ''is unlike any other site'' that lies on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual control.</p>

<p>The site in question, images of which have been published in this report, lies 36 kilometres East of the LAC on territory China holds. It is approximately 15 km East of a new bridge that China has constructed across the high-altitude Pangong Lake in Ladakh and marks Beijing's latest effort at stepping up pressure in areas near the Line of Actual Control which were previously unoccupied. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Military sources say the site, which features upwards of 70 permanent structures, ''has been dispersed over a wide area. &nbsp;This has been done to reduce the potential impact of missile attacks.'' The site appears to have two primary functions - to accommodate soldiers and porters who are involved in China's construction activity in the area. &nbsp;And to store logistics for potential transfer to locations along the LAC with India. &nbsp;''Each structure can accommodate 6-8 soldiers or up to 10 tonnes of logistics,'' say military experts. This can include ammunition, including artillery shells. &nbsp;</p>

<p>''A major development initiative appears to be underway at this village, evidenced by the heavy machinery, including cranes, and substantial supply depots,'' says the geospatial imagery expert Damien Symon. ''The settlement is witnessing the development of multiple double-storey buildings alongside village administrative offices and emerging town centres. Electrification efforts are progressing as power lines are drawn from the southern highway. Furthermore, to secure the water supply, a potential pumping station is being constructed to the north, drawing fresh water from an adjacent riverbed. Thanks to these preparations, the village, once established, is likely to be well-shielded from the area's extreme and unforgiving climate.''</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">In April 2022, the site was clear. However, the construction started in March 2024.</p>

<p>Lt. General DS Hooda (retired), the former Northern Army Commander who speared India's surgical strikes on Pakistani territory, says the site under construction has dual uses. ''It enables China to say that they are only improving facilities for the civilian population, but this is clearly dual-use infrastructure that would be utilised by the military in a conflict.''&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The construction of this site also changes facts on the ground. &nbsp;''Article VII of the 2005 agreement between India and China on the political parameters and guiding principles for the settlement of the boundary question states that 'in reaching a boundary settlement, the two sides shall safeguard due interests of the settled population in border areas.' &nbsp;However, by creating these villages in areas claimed by India, where there was no settled population, China is attempting to strengthen its claims and weaken our bargaining position,'' says Lt. General Hooda. ''This is a long game.''</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/heavy-military-fortifications-near-chinas-now-complete-pangong-lake-bridge-6226235">An NDTV report published</a> in July showed Chinese vehicles crossing its Pangong Lake bridge, 15 km from the new site.</p>

<p>The report also identified fortified sites to the North of the bridge, including a likely air defence site which could house a surface-to-air missile battery. This site would likely protect this new Chinese base from aerial attacks.</p>

<p>"The issue of concern is the size and scale of construction and infrastructure so close to the LAC in conjunction with the bridge across Pangong Tso which connects the North and South banks," says Lt. General Satish Dua (retired), a former Chief of the Integrated Defence Staff. "The bridge allows lateral switching of forces and this dual-use village could be used as a logistic hub. We will have to keep a close watch over their activities in the region, which should give us an advance warning of any malafide activities."</p>

<p>Damien Symon, perhaps the closest international observer of fresh developments along the India-China frontier says that construction activity at the new site appears to replicate similar activity in Chinese-held areas on the South bank of the Pangong Lake. "Similar construction activity has recently also been noted near Spanggur Lake's eastern region where another sizeable settlement is under construction approximately 18 kilometres from Rezang La, where Indian forces outmanoeuvred the Chinese during the 2020 border standoff."</p>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs, which was forwarded these images by NDTV last week, has chosen not to respond specifically to the new Chinese construction activity. However, India has dramatically ramped up infrastructure development along the China frontier. This includes the construction of roads, tunnels, and other military facilities to ensure that Indian forces are well-prepared and can swiftly respond to any challenges posed by Chinese actions along the LAC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>India's Vibrant Villages programme, for which Rs 4,800 crore has been allocated from 2022-'23 to 2025-'26, is aimed at the comprehensive development of villages along the Northern border. The project, which promotes infrastructure development, livelihood opportunities and cultural and heritage promotion targets 2,967 villages in total. The project has a broader strategic goal of maintaining an Indian presence along the border which is seen as a deterrent against territorial encroachments.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 10 people were killed and 40 injured in northern Gaza on Monday after Israeli tank shells hit people queuing for food, Palestinian medics said, as fears mounted in the enclave that Israel plans to displace all residents from the north.</p>

<p>Medics said an Israeli drone had also opened fire where dozens of residents had gathered to receive food in Jabalia, one of Gaza's eight historic refugee camps. Women and children were among the victims, they said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it was looking into the incident.</p>

<p>Jabalia has been the focus of an Israeli offensive for around 10 days and the military has now encircled the camp and sent tanks into nearby Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun towns, with the declared aim of stamping out Hamas fighters who are trying to regroup there.</p>

<p>With the Israeli military calling on Palestinians to evacuate south as they step up pressure on Hamas - and Hamas telling them not to leave because it was too risky - the past few days resemble earlier phases of the war.</p>

<p>The northern part of Gaza, home to well over half the territory's 2.3 million people, was heavily bombed in the first phase of Israel's assault on the territory which began a year ago.</p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of northern Gaza residents quit their homes in the early months of the war, driven by Israeli evacuation orders and a military ground offensive in their areas, while around 400,000 people remained, according to United Nations estimates.</p>

<p>But months after intense ground fighting there, Israel sent troops back to Jabalia to root out Hamas fighters it said were regrouping for more attacks.</p>

<p>The armed wings of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad said their fighters have been staging attacks against the Israeli forces with anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs.</p>

<p>For residents, there has been no reprieve.</p>

<p>"We have been hit from the air and the ground, non-stop for a week, they want us to leave, they want to punish us for refusing to leave our homes," said Marwa, 26, who left with her family to a school in Gaza City.</p>

<p>People were afraid they would never be able to return if they head south, she said.</p>

<p>Later on Monday, Hamas said Israel aimed to displace the people of northern Gaza by force through constant bombardment, and the blocking of aid, food and fuel.</p>

<p>"The international community should act against this war crime as the occupation is closing the territory and preventing the entry of relief goods and medication," senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters.</p>

<p>"By doing so it causes slow death, that is in addition to daily direct killings it has been conducting," said Abu Zuhri.</p>

<p><strong>CONCERN ISRAEL PLANS TO EMPTY JABALIA</strong></p>

<p>Some residents also fear that Israel plans to empty Jabalia and possibly, the entire northern area under a proposal floated by former Israeli generals, which calls for north Gaza to be cleared of civilians and remaining militants to be put under siege until they surrender.</p>

<p>Israel flatly denies such designs.</p>

<p>"We have not received a plan like that," military spokesman Nadav Shoshani told reporters. "We are making sure we're getting civilians out of harm's way while we operate against those terror cells in Jabalia," he said.</p>

<p>The proposal's main author, Giora Eiland, said that his plan is meant to pressure Hamas to release hostages by ending its control of territory and aid, rather than sending Israeli forces in to battle its fighters.</p>

<p>"What they're doing in Jabalia now is more of the same," Eiland told Army Radio on Sunday. "My plan is not being implemented."</p>

<p>Israel's plans for the future of Gaza are unclear, beyond its stated aim of dismantling Hamas as a military and governing force.</p>

<p>The United Nations has described dire conditions affecting the civilian population remaining in Jabalia.</p>

<p>"Over 50,000 people have been displaced from the Jabalia area, which is cut off, while others remain stranded in their homes amid increased bombardment and fighting," The U.N.'s Humanitarian Coordinator Muhannad Hadi said on Sunday.</p>

<p>"The latest military operations in northern Gaza have forced the closure of water wells, bakeries, medical points and shelters, as well as the suspension of protection services, malnutrition treatment, and temporary learning spaces. At the same time, hospitals have seen an influx of trauma injuries."</p>

<p>The Israeli military did not immediately comment.</p>

<p>Israel launched the offensive against Hamas after its Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage to Gaza, by Israeli tallies. More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the offensive so far, according to Gaza's health authorities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People living near an Israeli army base hit by a Hezbollah drone strike described a loud explosion then multiple ambulances arriving, as fresh rocket fire and air raid sirens sent them rushing to shelters on Monday.</p>

<p>Four soldiers were killed Sunday night by a Hezbollah drone at the base in the Binyamina area -- the deadliest strike on Israeli soil since the war between Israel and the Lebanese armed group intensified last month.</p>

<p>Emergency services that helped transport the wounded to hospital said more than 60 were injured.</p>

<p>"Last night was crazy," Yousef, the manager of a local restaurant in the village of Kfar Kara, told AFP, declining to give his full name for safety reasons. "There was a huge boom and then suddenly ambulances started driving past, first one, then two, then three and more and more.</p>

<p>"There were so many police cars and paramedics," he added.</p>

<p>Yousef said that at first he thought the explosion was related to organised crime, which is high in some Israeli Arab villages. But he soon realised that the boom was from the nearby army base, which sits less than a kilometre (mile) away from his restaurant.</p>

<p>"We've been open here for two years and didn't realise that we were next to such an important base," Yousef told AFP. "How did Hezbollah know it was here?"</p>

<p>"Now they know where that base is, what if next time they fire and are slightly off target?"</p>

<p>The village sits along one of the main thoroughfares to the base and other witnesses described seeing ambulances and private cars whisking away dozens of injured soldiers Sunday night.</p>

<p>According to residents interviewed by AFP, there were no sirens or advanced warning of an incoming drone.</p>

<p>On Kibbutz Regavim, a few kilometres from the base, residents said they did not hear the explosion but recognised that it was nearby from television images.</p>

<p>"The kibbutz's security team was immediately alerted," Eyal Nabet, a resident of the kibbutz, told AFP.</p>

<p>"Sadly, afterwards, we heard the ambulances and helicopters heading to and from the base."</p>

<p>Nabet said the residents of the kibbutz were shaken but bomb shelters had been renovated recently and new concrete structures added in locations, giving people "the feeling they are secure and someone is watching out for us".</p>

<p>The Israeli military has pledged a full investigation into the incident.</p>

<p>"This was a difficult event with painful results. We must investigate it, study the details, and implement lessons in a swift and professional manner," said Defence Minister Yoav Gallant during a visit to the base that was targeted.</p>

<p>"We are concentrating significant efforts in developing solutions to address the threat of UAV attacks."</p>

<p>Following the strike, Hezbollah threatened to continue targeting Israel with more attacks if its offensive in Lebanon is not stopped.</p>

<p>The Iran-backed group "promises the enemy that what it witnessed today (Sunday) in southern Haifa is nothing compared to what awaits it if it decides to continue its aggression against our noble and dear people," it said in a statement after the attack on the base.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has been regularly firing rockets, drones and missiles into Israel for more than a year in support of Hamas militants in Gaza. But the salvos have begun to reach further into Israel since September 23, when the Israel-Hezbollah war escalated.</p>

<p>Israel's sophisticated air defences, however, have intercepted most of the projectiles, with few casualties caused by the barrages or the subsequent falling debris.</p>

<p>But for those on the ground near the Binyamina base in north Israel, a feeling of helplessness is palpable.</p>

<p>"What can we do?" asked a proprietor of a kiosk at the entrance to the village of Kfar Kara, who did not provide her name for security reasons.</p>

<p>"We are afraid but there is nothing we can do about it."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India has summoned Canada's charge d' affairs in New Delhi after the diplomatic relations between the two countries witnessed a new low today. Foreign Ministry's summons to&nbsp;Stewart Wheeler followed the government's criticism of Canada for investigating the Indian ambassador and other diplomats as "persons of interest" over the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.</p>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said India received a "diplomatic communication from Canada yesterday suggesting that the Indian High Commissioner and other diplomats are 'persons of interest' in a matter related to an investigation in that country".</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/reject-preposterous-imputations-india-strongly-hits-back-at-canada-6785660">government called the allegations "preposterous"</a> and a "strategy of smearing India for political gains".</p>

<p>&nbsp;"The Government of India strongly rejects these preposterous imputations and ascribes them to the political agenda of the Trudeau Government that is centred around vote bank politics," the government said in a sharp rebuttal.</p>

<p>"India now reserves the right to take further steps in response to these latest efforts of the Canadian Government to concoct allegations against Indian diplomats," the foreign ministry added.</p>

<p>The 2023 murder of Nijjar crashed diplomatic ties between New Delhi and Ottawa after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there were "credible allegations" linking Indian intelligence to the crime. India, which had designated Nijjar as a terrorist in 2020, dismissed the charges as "absurd".</p>

<p>Canada has now reportedly named the Indian High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma as a 'person of interest' in its investigation. India accused Canada of maligning its officials without evidence and using "preposterous" claims to justify its failure to curb Khalistani extremism on its soil.</p>

<p>"High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma is India's senior-most serving diplomat with a distinguished career spanning 36 years. He has been an Ambassador in Japan and Sudan, while also serving in Italy, Turkiye, Vietnam and China. The aspersions cast on him by the Government of Canada are ludicrous and deserve to be treated with contempt," the foreign ministry said.</p>

<p>It said Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau's hostility to India has long been in evidence. In 2018, his visit to India, "which was aimed at currying favour with a vote bank, rebounded to his discomfort".</p>

<p>"His Cabinet has included individuals who have openly associated with an extremist and separatist agenda regarding India," the ministry said.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently met Justin Trudeau on the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit in Laos, almost a year after his Canadian counterpart accused India of involvement in the death of a Khalistani terrorist.</p>

<p>Even as sources in New Delhi said there was no substantive discussion between the two leaders, Trudeau termed the meeting a "brief exchange".</p>

<p>"I won't go into details about what we talked about but what I've said many times is that the safety of Canadians and upholding the rule of law is one of the fundamental responsibilities of any Canadian government and that's what I'll stay focused on," Trudeau told a press conference at Vientiane.</p>

<p>Canada is home to around 7,70,000 Sikhs, who make up about two percent of the country's population.</p>

<p>India has been maintaining that the main issue between the two countries is that of Canada giving space to pro-Khalistan elements operating from Canadian soil with impunity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The EU imposed sanctions on Monday on prominent Iranian officials and entities, including airlines, accused of taking part in the transfer of missiles and drones for Russia to use against Ukraine.</p>

<p>European Union foreign ministers approved the sanctions on seven entities, including Iran Air, and seven individuals, including deputy defence minister Seyed Hamzeh Ghalandari and senior officials of the Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force, the bloc said.</p>

<p>Leading European powers Britain, France and Germany adopted similar sanctions last month over Iranian missile transfers to Russia, as did the United States.</p>

<p>European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the adoption of the sanctions by the entire bloc, while adding: "More is needed."</p>

<p>"The Iranian regime's support to Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine is unacceptable and must stop," she posted on X.</p>

<p>Two other Iranian airlines, Saha Airlines and Mahan Air, were hit under the EU measures, along with two procurement firms blamed for the "transfer and supply, through transnational procurement networks, of Iran-made UAVs and related components and technologies to Russia".</p>

<p>The sanctions also target two companies involved in the production of propellant used to launch rockets and missiles.</p>

<p>Those targeted are subject to an asset freeze and banned from travelling to the European Union.</p>

<p>Iran rejects Western accusations it has transferred missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine.</p>

<p>According to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, dozens of Russian military personnel have received training in Iran on using the Fath-360 missile, which has a range of 120 kilometres (75 miles).</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Keir Starmer - treading a tricky path to be both pro-business and also pro-worker, with a series of new workplace safeguards for employees -- has placed great importance on the International Investment Summit in London.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday told global business leaders it was "time to back Britain", as he hosted a major summit aimed at securing much-needed funds to fuel economic growth after post-Brexit chaos.</p>

<p>Starmer told captains of industry that his recently elected Labour government would "rip out the bureaucracy that blocks investment" and pledged to slash red tape.</p>

<p>The premier - treading a tricky path to be both pro-business and also pro-worker, with a series of new workplace safeguards for employees -- has placed great importance on the International Investment Summit in London.</p>

<p>He is hoping that the announcement of billions of pounds (dollars) of foreign investment in UK projects will overshadow its chaotic build-up.</p>

<p>Starmer won a thumping majority in July's election but has seen his government's popularity plummet following a series of missteps, with a recent YouGov poll showing only 18 per cent of the public approved of its performance.</p>

<p>The prime minister said his focus is "not the days or hours of the news grid" but on the "golden opportunity" that his electoral mandate presents for delivering his central mission of growing the UK economy.</p>

<p>"Private sector investment is the way we rebuild our country and pay our way in the world. Make no mistake, this is a great moment to back Britain," Starmer said.</p>

<p>He promised that where regulation is currently "stopping us building the homes, the data centres, warehouses, grid connectors, roads, train lines, you name it, then mark my words -- we will get rid of it".</p>

<p>"We will rip out the bureaucracy that blocks investment," he added, promising that his administration "will make sure that every regulator in this country" takes growth "as seriously as this room does".</p>

<p>Starmer said he was "determined to repair Britain's brand as an open, outward-looking, confident trading nation".</p>

<p>Ministers are set to announce billions worth of major investment deals in AI, life sciences and infrastructure, having already unveiled £24 billion pounds ($31.4 billion) in green energy projects, including £12 billion by Spanish giant Iberdrola and £8.0 billion by Danish firm Orsted.</p>

<p><strong>- P&amp;O row -</strong></p>

<p>The build-up to the summit was dominated by criticism over its organisation, a failure to attract top names and a row involving shipping company P&amp;O's Dubai owners DP World that put a £1 billion investment project in jeopardy.</p>

<p>Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, the chairman DP World, threatened not to attend the summit after transport minister Louise Haigh and Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner called P&amp;O's employment practices "unscrupulous" and "exploitative".</p>

<p>Last-ditch talks with the UK government ensued and DP World revealed that the P&amp;O investment to expand a London container port would go ahead.</p>

<p>While around 200 private sector executives were expected to attend, many multinational bosses and tech titans decided to give it a miss.</p>

<p>Even the opportunity to meet Britain's head of state King Charles III at the closing reception on Monday evening failed to entice them.</p>

<p>The Financial Times partly attributed the summit's poor turnout to concerns over its "quality and organisation".</p>

<p>Five days before the event, the start time and venue had still not been confirmed.</p>

<p>Two foreign companies seeking urgent information were reportedly astonished to receive an "out-of-office" message from the organisers, the business daily said.</p>

<p>Then the highly secret guest list was revealed by mistake, when the organisers sent an email to all confirmed participants without hiding their addresses.</p>

<p>The timing of the summit -- two days after Labour clocked its 100th day in office -- has also caused unease.</p>

<p>In two weeks' time finance minister Rachel Reeves delivers Labour's first budget, when businesses are steeling themselves for a possible rise in capital gains tax.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mysterious drones have been surveilling some of America's most sensitive military sites, and the Pentagon is struggling to respond, according to a report by the<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/drones-military-pentagon-defense-331871f4" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em> Wall Street Journal</em></a>. The report states that these drones have been observed flying over military bases in Virginia and Nevada over the past year, including the secret base of the Navy's elite SEAL Team Six and Naval Station Norfolk, the world's largest naval port.</p>

<p>Federal laws currently prevent the military from shooting down these drones due to the risk they could pose to troops and civilians. The Wall Street Journal also reported that high-level White House meetings ruled out jamming the drones' signals, citing concerns that it might interfere with 911 systems, WiFi networks, and commercial airlines.</p>

<p>Former U.S. Air Force Gen. Mark Kelly revealed to the Wall Street Journal that he first learned about the drone sightings in December 2023, when officials at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia reported seeing dozens of drones flying over the base at night. Langley is home to the F-22 Raptor, one of America's most advanced stealth fighter jets.</p>

<p>The drone sightings continued for 17 days, raising suspicions that they might be the work of Russian or Chinese agents seeking to spy on American military assets. However, since the drones did not pose an immediate threat, military law prohibited any action to shoot them down.</p>

<p>The option of directed jamming attacks was also deemed too risky, as it could disrupt commercial air traffic, especially during the peak of the holiday travel season, according to an FAA official. Analog methods proved ineffective as local police assisting in the investigation lost sight of the drones during nighttime pursuits, the Wall Street Journal reported.</p>

<p>The sightings ended on December 23, with authorities still unsure of the drones' origin or who was controlling them. The complexity and coordination of the operation led officials to dismiss the idea that amateur drone pilots were responsible.</p>

<p>A significant clue emerged in January when a Chinese student named Fengyun Shi, studying at the University of Minnesota, was caught flying a drone near Langley Air Force Base. Shi's drone got stuck in a tree, which he abandoned before flying to California. The drone was later retrieved by the FBI, who discovered it had taken photos of Navy ships docked at the base.</p>

<p>Shi was arrested as he prepared to board a one-way flight to China and was charged with unlawfully taking photographs of classified naval installations, marking the first such case involving a drone. Magistrate Judge Lawrence Leonard rejected Shi's claim that he was merely a student flying a drone for fun, and Shi pleaded guilty to espionage charges on October 2.</p>

<p>Despite these incidents, U.S. officials have confirmed that similar drone swarms have recently been observed near Edwards Air Force Base in Nevada. The Defense Department has not yet publicly identified the source behind these surveillance drones.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel and Hezbollah have threatened to intensify their cross-border attacks, disregarding calls from the international community to de-escalate and step back from a potential all-out war.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>Hezbollah's deputy chief, Naim Qassem, issued a defiant message that the group has entered "a new phase" in its confrontation with Israel. Qassem made his remarks following Israeli strikes on northern Lebanon that targeted Hezbollah strongholds, resulting in widespread damage and numerous casualties.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant reiterated Israel's commitment to ensuring the security of its northern residents, stating, "Military actions will continue until we reach a point where we may ensure the safe return of Israel's northern communities to their homes." As both sides harden their stances, Army Chief Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi vowed that Israel would "hit anyone who threatens" its citizens.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The United States, Israel's biggest ally, has urged restraint. President Joe Biden emphasised that military escalation is not in Israel's "best interest" and that the US is working tirelessly to prevent a broader conflict. "We're going to do everything we can to keep a wider war from breaking out," Biden said.</li>
	<li>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres echoed similar concerns, warning of the risk of Lebanon becoming "another Gaza" amid the ongoing Gaza conflict.</li>
	<li>Over the weekend, Hezbollah launched a barrage of rockets that reached Kiryat Bialik near Haifa, Israel's largest northern city, damaging infrastructure and igniting fears of further escalation. In retaliation, Israel struck Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon, including an airbase and military production facilities. The exchange of fire led Israel's civil defence agency to order schools in the north to shut down.</li>
	<li>Lebanon's health ministry reported that three people were killed in Israeli strikes on southern areas, while Hezbollah confirmed that two of its fighters were killed. The Israeli army reported that over 150 rockets, missiles, and drones were fired into its territory overnight from Lebanon.</li>
	<li>Israel's recent airstrikes, including an attack on the densely populated Dahiyeh neighbourhood in Beirut, killed Ibrahim Aqil, head of Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force.</li>
	<li>Hezbollah has signalled that it will not be deterred, with Qassem stating that the group is prepared to face "all military possibilities." This comes as Israel continues to target Hezbollah's military infrastructure, attempting to prevent the group from expanding its influence along the Israeli-Lebanese border.</li>
	<li>Despite mediation efforts led by Qatar, Egypt, and the United States, the conflict shows no sign of abating. Attempts to secure a ceasefire and facilitate hostage release have stalled, with Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty indicating that the situation between Israel and Hezbollah is negatively affecting efforts to stabilize Gaza.</li>
	<li>The United Nations has described the situation as being "on the brink of an imminent catastrophe."&nbsp;</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man's bold decision to get the Monster Energy Drink logo tattooed across his chest has sparked amusement online. The tattoo, featuring the company's recognisable large "M" symbol, was shared on social media platform X. The image showed the surrounding skin red and inflamed, indicating the ink was freshly done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tattoo drew attention for its size, as the large "M" – designed to resemble three claw marks – was placed prominently on the man's chest, covering much of the space. While the man seemed proud of his new ink, Monster Energy's response on social media was far from enthusiastic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The energy drink company replied to the viral post with a humorous comment, saying, “Kinda wish we never saw this.”&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man who was abducted as a six-year-old boy over 70 years ago has been found alive on the East Coast of the United States. Luis Armando Albino disappeared on February 21, 1951, from a park in West Oakland, California. He was lured away by a woman who promised to buy him sweets while he played with his 10-year-old brother, Roger. For decades, his whereabouts remained a mystery, until this year, when DNA testing and family efforts revealed the truth.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/09/20/oakland-boy-kidnapped-1951-found-alive-new-york/ ">Mercury News</a> first reported the discovery, which came after Mr Albino's niece, Alida Alequin, set on a quest to find her uncle. Using DNA testing, newspaper clippings and help from the Oakland Police Department, FBI and Department of Justice, Ms Alequin, a 63-year-old Oakland resident, tracked her uncle down. Luis Albino He is now a retired firefighter and Marine Corps veteran, having served two tours in Vietnam.</p>

<p>In June, Mr Albino, now 79, was reunited with emotional family members, including his older brother, Roger, who died from cancer last month at the age of 82. The brothers shared a heartwarming reunion before Mr Roger's death, with Alida Alequin describing the moment, “They grabbed each other and had a really tight, long hug. They sat down and just talked."</p>

<p>Ms search began in 2020 when she casually took an online DNA test. The results revealed a 22 per cent match with Albino, leading her to dig deeper into family history. Along with her daughters, Ms Alequin sifted through newspaper archives and microfilm at local libraries, ultimately finding pictures of Luis Albino that confirmed her suspicions. Her determination was key to solving the decades-old mystery.</p>

<p>Mr Albino recalls parts of his abduction and journey to the East Coast but shared that those around him at the time refused to provide answers. Now, he prefers to keep some of his experiences private.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, their mother, who died in 2005 at the age of 92, never lived to see the mystery solved.</p>

<p>Ms Alequin described Roger's final days as peaceful. She said he "died happily" and was "at peace with himself, knowing his brother had been found."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the CEO of OpenAI, a leader in developing artificial intelligence (AI) tools, Sam Altman is no stranger to taking risks. In 2005, he made a career-defining decision by dropping out of Stanford to create Loopt, a location-based social networking app. This move ultimately led him to co-found OpenAI, the organization behind ChatGPT.</p>

<p>"It seemed like a really fun thing to try," the 39-year-old explained during an interview with students at his alma mater, John Burroughs School in the St. Louis area, as reported by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/17/openai-ceo-sam-altmans-his-no-1-strategy-for-living-without-regrets.html" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>CNBC Make It</em></a>. Altman noted that he was willing to take the risk because he could always return to his studies if entrepreneurship didn't pan out.</p>

<p>"That's the key to most risk, is most things are not a one-way door," Altman said. "You can try something, it doesn't work out, you can undo it, you can do something else." It's important to take the right risks but that doesn't mean that one should avoid taking them altogether, he added. "The risky thing is not to go try the things that might really work out" because regret can kick in, the OpenAI boss said. "You kind of look back at your career 10, 20, 30 years later and say, 'Man, I wish I had tried the thing I really wanted to try. You should just put a huge premium on doing that anytime you feel like you might say that later."</p>

<p>Mr Altman also encouraged students and young professionals to be open to deviating from a traditional path of going to college, getting a job and staying there "forever." He said that that might have been a guarantee of financial security for some people in previous generations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Now I think the traditional path is, I won't say falling apart, but it's quite challenged," he said. "And AI will probably disrupt things even more and put more variants in the traditional path."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday arrived in the United States for a crucial visit to present Kyiv's plan to end two and a half years of war with Russia.</p>

<p>Zelensky will present his proposals -- which he calls a "victory plan" -- to President Joe Biden, as well as presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The visit comes after a summer of intense fighting: with Moscow advancing fast in eastern Ukraine and Kyiv holding on to swathes of Russia's Kursk region.</p>

<p>It also comes as Kyiv has for weeks pressed the West to allow it to use long-range weapons to strike targets deep inside Russia -- so far to no avail.</p>

<p>When they meet at the White House on Thursday, Zelensky is expected to try to convince Biden to change his mind.</p>

<p>On the first leg of his US visit, Ukraine's president visited a factory in Pennsylvania on Sunday that produces badly needed 155mm artillery shells.</p>

<p>"I began my visit to the United States by expressing my gratitude to all the employees at the plant," Zelensky said Sunday in a post on X, formerly Twitter.</p>

<p>The post included photos of him shaking hands with workers at the plant, where he said production had been ramped up.</p>

<p>"It is in places like this where you can truly feel that the democratic world can prevail," he wrote.</p>

<p>He will next travel to New York and Washington.</p>

<p>Zelensky said the coming weeks would decide how more than 30 months of fighting that has killed thousands would end.</p>

<p>"It is now being determined what the legacy of the current generation of state leaders will be. Those in the highest offices," he said.</p>

<p>In comments before his trip, Zelensky said the United States and UK have not given Ukraine permission to use the long-range weapons as they fear escalation, but hinted he had not given up hope.</p>

<p>"We have had some decisions in the history of our relationship with Biden -- very interesting and difficult dialogues," Zelensky said earlier this week, adding: "He later changed his point of view."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moscow has said it considers such a go-ahead as NATO countries being "at war" with Russia.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>'Fair and stable peace'&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>A close adviser to Biden said this month that the US leader would use his remaining time in office to "put Ukraine in the best possible position to prevail."&nbsp;</p>

<p>No details on Ukraine's plan have been made public.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zelensky said Biden would be the first foreign leader to see the plan "in full" -- saying it will then also be presented to "all leaders of our partner countries."</p>

<p>Zelensky plans to present the proposals to the US Congress, Harris and Trump. The White House has said he will meet with Democratic Vice President Harris separately from Biden, and Zelensky has said he expects to meet with Republican Trump on Thursday or Friday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris has indicated she would continue Biden's policies on Ukraine, while Trump has been hugely critical of Washington's massive aid packages for Kyiv.</p>

<p>Zelensky said earlier this week that the plan envisages that "war will not return to us again in an even bigger wave" in years to come.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He has said Kyiv plans to hold meetings throughout autumn and that the "entire plan" will be ready by "early November."</p>

<p>The proposals, he told the media Friday, envisage "quick and concrete steps by our strategic partners."&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>'Clear place for Ukraine'&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>One of those steps, he said, is "related to strengthening Ukraine's weapons capabilities" while another demands a "clear place for Ukraine in the world's security architecture".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zelensky has also said he plans to invite Russia to a possible second international peace summit in November.</p>

<p>But Moscow this weekend said it would not attend and referred to President Vladimir Putin's conditions to enter talks: that Ukraine surrender four of its regions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I think both are still betting on the possibility of a military victory," UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres told CNN Sunday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Russian attacks on Ukraine killed six people -- including two children -- this weekend, while a strike on the city of Kharkiv wounded 21 people in a residential neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Ukraine said it struck two arms depots in Russia, with Kyiv's army saying it hit a key ammunition storage base important to the Russian army's logistics for its invasion.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX plans to launch about five uncrewed Starship missions to Mars in two years, CEO Elon Musk said on Sunday in a post on social media platform X.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Musk had said that the first Starships to Mars would launch in two years "when the next Earth-Mars transfer window opens."</p>

<p>On Sunday, the CEO said that the first crewed mission timeline would depend upon the success of the uncrewed flights. If the uncrewed missions land safely, crewed missions will be launched in four years. However, in case of challenges, crewed missions will be postponed by another two years, Musk said.</p>

<p>Musk, known for providing changing timelines on Starship's readiness, said earlier this year that the first uncrewed starship to land on Mars would be within five years, with the first people landing on Mars within seven years.</p>

<p>In June, a Starship rocket survived a fiery, hypersonic return from space and achieved a breakthrough landing demonstration in the Indian Ocean, completing a full test mission around the globe on the rocket's fourth try.</p>

<p>Musk is counting on Starship to fulfil his goal of producing a large, multipurpose next-generation spacecraft capable of sending people and cargo to the moon later this decade, and ultimately flying to Mars.</p>

<p>NASA earlier this year delayed Artemis 3 mission and its first crewed moon landing in half a century using SpaceX's Starship, to September 2026. It was previously planned for late 2025, NASA said.</p>

<p>Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa in June cancelled a private mission around the moon he had paid for, which was to have used SpaceX's Starship, citing schedule uncertainties in the rocket's development.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a bilateral meeting with Kuwait Crown Prince, Sheikh Sabah Khaled Al-Hamad Al-Sabah Al-Sabah, in New York on Sunday (local time).</p>

<p>Prior to this, PM Modi also held a bilateral meeting with Nepali Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli.</p>

<p>"The meeting was very good," PM Oli told ANI after his meeting with PM Modi.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar met Kuwait's Foreign Minister Abdullah Ali Al-Yahya and discussed strengthening India-Kuwait bilateral relations.</p>

<p>India and Kuwait enjoy traditionally friendly relations, which are rooted in history and have stood the test of time. India has been a natural trading partner of Kuwait and until 1961, Indian Rupee was a legal tender in Kuwait.</p>

<p>The year 2021-22 marked the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p>

<p>India was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with Kuwait following its independence from British Protectorate in 1961. Prior to the establishment of diplomatic relations, India was represented by a Trade Commissioner.</p>

<p>India's trade with Kuwait has seen a surge, with Indian exports to the Gulf nation reaching USD 2.10 billion in the fiscal year 2023-24, as per the official data by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.</p>

<p>PM Modi arrived in New York in the second leg of his three-day visit to the United States. On Saturday, PM Modi took part in the Quad Summit and held bilateral meetings with US President Joe Biden, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.</p>

<p>Quad has emerged as a key group of like-minded countries to work for peace, progress and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<p>PM Modi and President Biden reviewed and identified new pathways to further deepen the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership.</p>

<p>PM Modi interacted with important American business leaders, who are the key stakeholders, and provide vibrancy to the unique partnership between the largest and the oldest democracies of the world. He will also address the Summit of the Future at the UN General Assembly in New York.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican Donald Trump said that he will not make a fourth consecutive run for the U.S. presidency if he loses the Nov. 5 election, saying "that will be it" in an interview released on Sunday.</p>

<p>Asked if he saw himself running again in four years if he is not successful in his third consecutive bid for the White House, the 78-year-old former president told Sharyl Attkisson's "Full Measure" program: "No I don't. I think that will be — that will be it. I don't see that at all. Hopefully, we will be successful."</p>

<p>Trump faces a tight race against Democratic U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, with polls showing the two neck-and-neck in key battleground states that are likely to be decisive in determining the winner, even as Harris has begun to edge up in nationwide polls.</p>

<p>Trump launched his first reelection bid for the 2020 election the same day he was inaugurated in 2017 and announced his latest White House bid two years ago in November 2022.</p>

<p>Trump has continued to falsely blame his 2020 loss to Democratic President Joe Biden on widespread voter fraud and faces federal and state criminal charges over efforts to overturn the election results. He denies any wrongdoing and has cast his indictments as a political attack against him while embracing increasingly dystopian rhetoric if he were to lose in 2024.</p>

<p>He has also launched a number of businesses ventures amid his latest campaign, including Trump Media, NFTs, and Trump branded sneakers, coins and crypto.</p>

<p>Harris, 59, meanwhile, has cast the race as a critical moment for U.S. democracy even as she seeks to focus on kitchen-table issues such as costs for families and housing.</p>

<p>Asked whether the four year break helped him regroup and figure out who he could trust as allies, Trump said: "It would have been easier if I did it ... contiguous."</p>

<p>"But the benefit is more than anything else, it shows how bad they were," he added.</p>

<p>Trump, who spoke with Attkisson at his Florida resort, also said it was "too early" to make deals with people for any position in his White House cabinet should he win in November.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi today highlighted the growing stature of India at the global platform and said that "the world listens when India speaks."</p>

<p>Addressing the Indian diaspora in New York, PM Modi said, "We are also a strong voice of the Global South. Today, when India says something on a global platform, the world listens. Some time ago when I said that this is not the era of war, its severity was understood by all..."</p>

<p>This vision was recently exemplified through the Voice of Global South Summit, hosted by India in January 2023. The summit, themed "Unity of Voice, Unity of Purpose," brought together leaders from the Global South to discuss shared challenges and opportunities. By providing a platform for these nations to unite and speak with one voice, India demonstrated its commitment to fostering cooperation and driving positive change.</p>

<p>He said that for India, power and potency means - "knowledge is for sharing, wealth is for caring, power is for protecting."</p>

<p>By hosting the Voice of Global South Summit and promoting unity among developing nations, India has reaffirmed its position as a key player on the global stage. As PM Modi emphasised, when India speaks, the world listens - a testament to India's increasing influence and leadership in shaping a more equitable and prosperous world.</p>

<p>PM Modi said that now India does not lag behind, it creates new systems and leads. India has given the new concept of digital public infrastructure (DPI) to the world.</p>

<p>"Today our partnership is growing with the whole world. Earlier, India followed the policy of equidistance. Today, India follows the policy of equidistance. Today, India's 5G market has become bigger than America, and this has happened in just two years. Now India is working on 'Made in India' 6G," said PM Modi.</p>

<p>He said that now India is a land of opportunities. "Now, India doesn't wait for the opportunities, it creates them," the PM asserted.</p>

<p>Speaking about the sea changes brought in last decade regarding opportunities and bringing 25 crore people out of poverty, PM Modi said, "In the last ten years, India has created opportunities for new launching pads in every sector. In just a decade, 25 crore people were lifted out of poverty. This was possible because we changed the old thoughts and approach. We focussed on empowering the poor. We connected more than 50 crores with the banking system..."</p>

<p>"In a decade, India has become the 5th largest economy from the 10th position. Now every Indian wants that India should soon become the 3rd largest economy. Today, India is a land of opportunities. Now India does not wait for opportunities, it creates opportunities," PM Modi added.</p>

<p>Regarding the demographic dividend, the PM said, "Today, India is one of the youngest countries in the world. India is filled with energy and dreams. Every day, new records and news are being made. Today, India has won gold in the Chess Olympiad (Men and Women). This has happened for the first time in a century. Our entire country is proud of our chess players. We have AI driving India, and the other AI - Aspirational India - is a new force driving the growth of Indians."</p>

<p>He also set goals for Modi 3.0, moving ahead with three times the power and strength asked the people remember the word 'PUSHP'. P-Progressive Bharat, U-Unstoppable Bharat, S-Spiritual Bharat, H-Bharat committed to Humanity and P-Prosperous Bharat</p>

<p>"We will build Viksit Bharat, combining the five petals of PUSHP," added PM Modi.</p>

<p>Regarding the conflict ongoing around the world, the PM said, "This 2024 is crucial for the entire world. On one hand, there is conflict and tension among some countries. In some countries, however, there is a celebration of democracy."</p>

<p>He further said that India's priority is not to increase its pressence in the world but to increase its impact.</p>

<p>'"Hum aaag ki tarah jalaane waale nahin, Suraj ki kiran ki tarah roshani dene waale hain'. We don't want our supremacy in the world, but to increase cooperation in the prosperity of the world," said PM Modi</p>

<p>The Prime Minister said that India and America are together in this celebration of democracy.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed a watershed arrangement to set up a semiconductor fabrication plant focused on advanced sensing, communication, and power electronics for national security, next generation telecommunications, and green energy applications.</p>

<p>The plant (or fab), which will be built with the objective of manufacturing infrared, gallium nitride and silicon carbide semiconductors, will be enabled by support from the India Semiconductor Mission as well as a strategic technology partnership between Bharat Semi, 3rdiTech, and the US Space Force.</p>

<p>In a historic moment, the first ever National security Fab in India is announced as a technology partnership between Indian businesses Bharat Semi, 3rdiTech and US space force. This is the first ever India-US Semiconductor Fab cooperation of its kind.</p>

<p>It's for the first time the US military has agreed to do a technology partnership for these highly valued technologies with India, so it's a watershed moment as powerful as the civil nuclear deal.</p>

<p>The fab becomes not only India's first, but one of the world's first multi-material fab for national security. The Bharat Semi fab titled Shakti also became one of the first fabs of its kind in the Quad. The Fab will focus on three essential pillars for the modern warfighting - advanced sensing, advanced communications and high-voltage power electronics.</p>

<p>These three areas have huge growing needs for commercial sectors such as railways, telecom infrastructure, data centres and green energy. These semiconductors fall under a family known as 'compound semiconductors'.</p>

<h2><strong>THREE MAIN TECHNOLOGY AREAS</strong></h2>

<p>The three main technology areas are infrared, galium nitride, and silicon carbide. It is part of PM Modi's vision for India to become a chipmaker from a chip-taker. This fab will become a national asset and further help India's goals of becoming a net security provider in the region.</p>

<p>For a country to become a net security provider it needs to become a net technology provider. This is a glass ceiling that has been broken in tech diplomacy and years down the road it will be seen in history as a watershed moment in India-US relationship.</p>

<p>India's current import bill in these semiconductors for national security alone is $1 Billion a year. India and the US have signed multiple cooperation deals focused on critical tech with a special focus on semiconductors, from iCET to commerce to commerce MOU to the strategic trade dialogue.</p>

<p>This becomes the first true India US semiconductor fab project. Other projects in the past have included testing and assembly OSAT. But this is raising the game and going into true chip fabrication - the holy grail of semiconductors.</p>

<p>After this technology partnership, India will join a handful of elite nations with the capability and knowhow to manufacture these types of semiconductors on shore.</p>

<p>Bharat Semi and 3rdiTech are a true iCET success story and a true success story of PM Modi's Atmnanirbhar vision From the launch of iCET in January 2023 to building India's first compound semiconductor fab for national security.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday (local time) highlighted the relationship between India and the US in terms of artificial intelligence and gave a new meaning to it, describing it as the America-India spirit.</p>

<p>Addressing the Indian community at Nassau Coliseum in New York, Long Island at 'Modi&amp;US' Event, he said, "For the world, AI means artificial intelligence, but for me, AI also means American-Indian spirit. This is the new 'AI' power of the world....I salute the Indian diaspora here."</p>

<p>PM Modi said that Indian community has always been the country's strongest brand ambassadors.</p>

<p>"I have always understood your potential... the potential of the Indian diaspora. You have always been India's strongest band ambassador for me. That's why I call all of you 'Rashtradoot'."</p>

<p>"Now Apna Namaste has also become multinational. It has gone from local to global and you have done all this. Every Indian who keeps India in his heart has done this. You have connected India with America and America with India. Your skill, talent, and commitment are unmatched. Despite being overseas, no ocean can separate you from India," PM Modi added.</p>

<p>He also praised the Indian community for keeping up the tradition of "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam" that means "the world is one family."</p>

<p>"Wherever we go, we treat everyone as family and mingle with them. Understanding diversity, living it, implementing it in our lives... it is in our values. Someone speaks Tamil... someone Telugu, someone Malayalam, someone Kannada... someone Punjabi, someone Marathi, someone Gujarati... There are many languages, but the feeling is one... and that feeling is - Indianness," said PM Modi.</p>

<p>Speaking on the diversity of India, PM Modi said, "We are residents of a country where there are hundreds of languages and dialects, all the religions and sects of the world. Still, we are moving ahead united and noble. This is our biggest strength to connect with the world. These values naturally bind us to the world."</p>

<p>Praising the Indian community for their talent and skill, he said that they connect India to America.</p>

<p>"You have connected India to America and America to India. Your skill, talent, and commitment have no competition. You might have come seven seas apart, but no sea has that much depth that it can distance you from India. What Ma Bharati has taught us, we can never forget that. Wherever we go, we accept all as family. To understand diversity, to live diversity is in our veins," said PM Modi.</p>

<p>America and India are poised to become AI powerhouses in the new world, and Prime Minister Modi's recent visit to the US has strengthened this partnership.</p>

<p>During his address at the Quad Leaders' Summit, PM Modi emphasized that the group is a "force of Global Good" that will contribute to the betterment of the world.</p>

<p>The US-India partnership has made significant strides in AI research and development. The Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) has facilitated cooperation in key areas like space, semiconductors, and advanced telecommunications.</p>

<p>The two nations are also collaborating on the development of small modular reactor technologies and exploring opportunities to expand cooperation in solar, wind, and nuclear energy.</p>

<p>The Indian community gave a standing ovation to PM Modi, as he entered the event venue, and took the stage. Talented artists from the Indian community took the stage, setting the perfect tone for PM Modi's imminent address to the Indian diaspora in the US.</p>

<p>PM Modi's address at "Modi and US" program is a historic event which is unfolding at the Nassau Coliseum in Long Island, New York, as 15,000 members of the Indian community gather from 42 different states to welcome the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Later in the day, PM Modi will chair key bilateral meetings in New York and attend a CEO Roundtable in addition he will also address the Summit of the Future on September 23.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India does not seek its dominance but wants to play a role in the prosperity of the world, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday, asserting that India's role will be crucial in accelerating the global peace process.</p>

<p>Addressing thousands of Indian-Americans in New York, PM Modi said India today has a foreign policy of maintaining equal closeness with all and not equal distance.</p>

<p>Referring to his remarks "This is not the time for war," PM Modi told the Indian community that the severity and the seriousness of this was understood by all friends.</p>

<p>"Whenever in the world there is a disaster, India has come forward as a first responder," the prime minister said, referring to the recent help provided by New Delhi to people across the world including during the COVID-19 crisis to more than 150 countries.</p>

<p>India is the first country to arrive whenever there is an earthquake somewhere or a civil war somewhere, he said.</p>

<p>"The role of India would be crucial to accelerate the process of global growth, and India's role will be crucial to accelerate global peace," he said.</p>

<p>India's goal is not to increase its global influence but to play a part in its prosperity.</p>

<p>Whether it is promoting yoga, lifestyle or the environment, it does not aspire for only a GDP-centric but a human-centric growth for all of you, he said, adding that India "does not want to seek its global dominance".</p>

<p>India, he said, is not like fire. "We are like the sun which gives brightness," the prime minister said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday announced the Indian government will open two new consulates in the US -- one in Boston, and another in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>"Last year, I announced the opening of a new Indian consulate in Seattle. I sought your suggestions for two additional Consulates. India has now decided to open two new consulates in Boston and Los Angeles," PM Modi said.</p>

<p>PM Modi made this announcement while interacting with the Indian community in New York's Nassau Coliseum which was packed with excited and cheerful-looking faces while reverberating with chants of "Modi, Modi".</p>

<p>During his speech, PM Modi highlighted India's growing ties with the US. Addressing the crowd, he thanked the people for turning up at the event, making people repeat "Bharat Mata ki Jai" before concluding his speech.</p>

<p>Among the many issues PM Modi stressed during his speech was the BJP-led Central government's return to power. The crowd was heard raising slogans of "Ab ki Baar, Modi Sarkar" while the PM was speaking on the subject.</p>

<p>More than 16,000 people - many of them travelling from all corners of the US overnight - have gathered at the Long Island to listen to PM Modi's speech at the community reception.</p>

<p>A cultural programme, depicting the diversity of Indian culture, began long before the PM's arrival at the packed venue.</p>

<p>On Saturday, immediately after his arrival in Philadelphia, the Prime Minister had shared his eagerness to meet the Indian community and Americans from across the US at the New York event.</p>

<p>"The Indian community has distinguished itself in the USA, making a positive impact across diverse sectors. It's always a delight to interact with them. At around 9:30 PM India time on Sunday, 22nd September, I will address the 'Modi and US' programme in New York City. Let's celebrate the bonds that connect our nations!" he mentioned after landing in Philadelphia following a nearly 16-hour journey from Delhi.</p>

<p>Preparations for the key engagement, sandwiched between the Quad Summit convened by US President Joe Biden in Delaware on Saturday and PM Modi's address to the United Nations Summit of the Future on Monday, have been going on for the past many weeks with the organisers overwhelmed by the number of people who wanted to attend the event billed as 'Modi and US, Progress Together'.</p>

<p>"We are just so proud of Modiji, and we're proud to be part of this great celebration. Modiji, we love you, and we want you to be very successful in whatever you're doing for our country," said a lady who had arrived early at the venue on Sunday.</p>

<p>The multi-purpose arena, which is the home of the Long Island Nets basketball team, is in Uniondale, about 50 km from Manhattan.</p>

<p>"This is an event that's being organised by the community. As you know, we have about 4.5 million strong Indian community in the United States, amongst the largest such groups there, and one that has made a mark for itself and is contributing to the relationship between the two countries by acting as a vibrant living bridge between the two of us," Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said earlier.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said that India has no role in causing destruction to the world, in an apparent criticism of the West.</p>

<p>Addressing thousands of Indian-Americans at a community event in New York, PM Modi said that India has 17 per cent of the world's population and its carbon emissions are less than four per cent.</p>

<p>Talking about India's green energy transition, he said a large number of green jobs are being created in India.</p>

<p>"India represents about 17 per cent of the world's population, and despite that, our contribution to emission is about only four per cent," he said, adding India today has "no role in causing destruction" to the world.</p>

<p>China is the world's biggest carbon emitter followed by the US, India and the EU.</p>

<p>"Our carbon emission is almost negligible," he said, adding that like other countries, India could also have opted for a carbon fuel-driven growth. But that's not the case.</p>

<p>It's India's tradition for the love of nature, and that is why India is focusing on solar, wind, hydro, green hydrogen and nuclear energy areas in which they are carrying out investment.</p>

<p>Referring to the impressive digital progress made by India, PM Modi told Indian Americans that they might have wallets in their pockets here, but people in India have digital wallets. "No one can stop India now. India wants to have maximum mobile devices on 'Made in India' chips," he said.</p>

<p>The prime minister spoke about the remarkable progress made in the education sector. He wants students from across the world to come and study in India. The number of educational institutions has increased manifold.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India is a launching pad of all sorts of technologies and the country now aspires to see 'Made in India' semiconductor chips running devices globally, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told a large gathering of Indian Americans in New York on the second day of his 3-day visit.</p>

<p>"India is not going to stop now; India is not going to slow down now. India wants more and more devices in the world to run on Made in India chips.," he told the gathering, outlining India's growing manufacturing capacity, particularly in the spheres of electronics and semiconductors.</p>

<p>"The day is not far when you will see Made in India chips here in America as well," the Prime Minister added.</p>

<p>In June, 2023, the Union Cabinet had approved a proposal for setting up a semiconductor unit in Sanand, Gujarat.</p>

<p>"Just a few months after this, the foundation stone of Micron's first semi-conductor unit was also laid. So far, five such units have been approved in India. The day is not far when you will see Made in India chips here in America as well. This small chip will take the flight of developed India to new heights and this is Modi's guarantee," the Prime Minister said.</p>

<p>The government has so far approved five semiconductor units in India, of which construction in two sites is on, and soon the work in the other three will start. They have already made a cumulative investment of almost Rs 1.5 lakh crore. He also spoke about India's innovations in digital public infrastructure, and how its adoption is growing at a rapid pace.</p>

<p>"Now India does not lag behind, it creates new systems and leads. India has given the new concept of digital public infrastructure (DPI) to the world," he said.</p>

<p>PM Modi apprised the community that India's 5G market has now become bigger than America's, and this has happened in just two years.</p>

<p>"Now, India is working on 'Made in India' 6G. This was possible because we made policies to promote this sector. We worked on Made in India technology," he said.</p>

<p>He also apprised the gathering how India has become a key player in mobile manufacturing, from being an importer to an exporter. PM Modi also spoke about India's commitment to climate mitigation, despite being a low emitter.</p>

<p>"Our conviction for reforms is unprecedented. Our Green Energy Transition programme is a good example of it. Despite having 17 per cent of the world's population, India's contribution is only 4 per cent in global carbon emissions. We have no role in destroying the world! We could have supported our growth by burning carbon fuel. However, we chose green energy transition," he said.</p>

<p>At COP26 held in 2021, India committed to an ambitious five-part "Panchamrit" pledge. They included reaching 500 GW of non-fossil electricity capacity, generating half of all energy requirements from renewables, and reducing emissions by 1 billion tonnes by 2030.<br />
India as a whole also aims to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent. Finally, India commits to net-zero emissions by 2070. India meets a sizable portion of its energy needs through fossil fuels, and various renewable energy sources, are seen as an avenue to reduce the dependence on conventional sources of power.</p>

<p>Later on Sunday, Prime Minister Modi will interact with the CEOs of leading US-based companies to foster greater collaborations between the two countries in the cutting-edge areas of AI, quantum computing, semiconductors, and biotechnology, among others.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

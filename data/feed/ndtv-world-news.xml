       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of Indigenous women are hoping to stop the bulldozers at a former Montreal hospital which they believe could hold the truth about children still missing from a grisly half-century-old CIA experiment.</p>

<p>They have spent the last two years trying to delay the construction project by McGill University and the Quebec government.</p>

<p>"They took our children and had all kinds of things done to them. They were experimenting on them," said Kahentinetha, an 85-year-old activist from the Mohawk community of Kahnawake, southwest of Montreal, who goes by just one name.</p>

<p>The activists are relying on archives and testimonies that suggest the site contains unmarked graves of children formerly interned at the Royal Victoria Hospital and Allan Memorial Institute, a neighbouring psychiatric hospital.</p>

<p>In the 1950s and 1960s, behind the austere walls of the old psychiatric institute, the US Central Intelligence Agency funded a human experiments program called MK Ultra.</p>

<p>During the Cold War, the program aimed to develop procedures and drugs to effectively brainwash people.</p>

<p>Experiments were conducted in Britain, Canada and the United States, subjecting people -- including Indigenous children in Montreal -- to electroshocks, hallucinogenic drugs, and sensory deprivation.</p>

<p>"They wanted to erase us," said Kahentinetha.</p>

<p>A leading figure in the Indigenous rights movement who has travelled to Britain and the United States to denounce colonialism, she called this fight "the most important of (her) life."</p>

<p>"We want to know why they did this and who's going to take the blame for it," she said.</p>

<h2><strong>Sniffer dogs</strong></h2>

<p>In the fall of 2022, the mothers obtained an injunction to suspend work on a new university campus and research centre at the site -- a project worth Can$870 million (US$643 million).</p>

<p>Fellow activist Kwetiio, 52, who also uses just one name, said they insisted on arguing the case themselves without lawyers, "because in our ways, no one speaks for us."</p>

<p>Last summer, sniffer dogs and specialized probes were brought in to search the property's expansive and dilapidated buildings. They managed to identify three areas of interest for excavations.</p>

<p>But, according to McGill and the government's Societe Quebecoise des Infrastructure (SQI), "no human remains have been discovered."</p>

<p>The Mohawk mothers accuse the university and the government infrastructure agency of breaching an agreement by selecting the archaeologists who did the search and then ending their work too soon.</p>

<p>"They gave themselves the power to lead the investigation of crimes that were potentially committed by their own employees in the past," says Philippe Blouin, an anthropologist working with the mothers.</p>

<p>Even though their appeal was dismissed earlier this month, they have vowed to continue their fight.</p>

<p>"People should know history, so that it does not repeat itself," said Kwetiio.</p>

<p>In recent years, Canada has opened its eyes to past atrocities.</p>

<p>Generations of Indigenous children were sent to residential schools where they were stripped of their language, culture and identities in what a 2015 truth and reconciliation report said amounted to "cultural genocide."</p>

<p>Between 1831 and 1996, some 150,000 Indigenous children were taken from their homes and placed in 139 such schools. Several thousand never returned to their communities.</p>

<p>In May 2021, the discovery of unmarked graves of 215 children at the Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia started a national reflection on this dark chapter of Canadian history, while sparking searches for more graves across Canada.</p>

<p>"It was not only residential schools, it involved hospitals, sanatoriums, churches and orphanages too," said Kwetiio.</p>

<p>For her, what is most important is shedding light on what happened in order for "things to change," and to recreate "the harmony that we had before colonialism."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman stabbed and wounded five people in a bus in western Germany on Friday, police said, one week after a deadly knife attack that shook the country.</p>

<p>The 32-year-old suspect was arrested after the incident in the town of Siegen with no indications it was a terrorist attack, the local police force said in a statement.</p>

<p>Three of the five victims are in life-threatening condition, one is seriously wounded and the fifth is only lightly injured.</p>

<p>Germany was rocked by a stabbing attack one week ago that left three people dead and eight wounded in the western city of Solingen.</p>

<p>The identity of the suspected attacker, a 26-year-old Syrian man who was previously due for deportation to Bulgaria, stoked debate about Germany's immigration and asylum policies.</p>

<p>The killings have prompted Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government to announce new restrictions on carrying knives at public gatherings and on long-distance transport, as well as curbing benefits for some illegal migrants.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, police shot dead a man suspected of attacking passers-by with knives in the western town of Moers near Solingen.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Egyptian worker was killed Friday in a hotel fight that wounded three Arab-Israeli tourists and other workers in the Egyptian seaside town of Taba, a medical source told AFP.</p>

<p>The worker succumbed to his injuries "in an ambulance transporting him from Taba" on the border with Israel to Sharm al-Sheikh, 200 kilometres south, the source said, requesting anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the media.</p>

<p>Three other workers and three "Arab 48" tourists were also wounded, state-linked Egyptian media Al-Qahera News reported.</p>

<p>"Arab 48" is a term that refers to Palestinians and their descendants who remained in Israel following its creation in 1948.</p>

<p>Friday's fight broke out between hotel staff and the tourists "who attempted to obtain services from the hotel without charge", the channel reported.</p>

<p>Al-Qahera News, which is linked to state intelligence, reported security authorities were investigating the incident.</p>

<p>A high-level security source denied Israeli media reports describing the altercation as a "stabbing operation".</p>

<p>The incident occurred in the Egyptian border town of Taba in South Sinai, which is a popular tourist destination for Israelis.</p>

<p>Egypt was the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel and has for decades played a key role as a mediator between Israeli and Palestinian officials, including in the current war in the Gaza Strip.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[There is an "undeniable complicity" of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) with terrorist groups, former US National Security Advisor Lt Gen (retd) H R McMaster has said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is an "undeniable complicity" of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) with terrorist groups, former US National Security Advisor Lt Gen (retd) H R McMaster has said, revealing that during his tenure under then President Donald Trump, the White House faced resistance from the state department and Pentagon over providing security aid to Islamabad.</p>

<p>Despite directions from Trump to stop all aid to Pakistan till it stops giving safe havens to terrorists, McMaster in his latest book 'At War with Ourselves: My Tour of Duty in the Trump White House' says that the then Defence Secretary Jim Mattis was planning to deliver a military aid package to Islamabad that included over USD 150 million worth of armoured vehicles.</p>

<p>However, the aid was stopped after his intervention, McMaster writes in the book that hit the bookstores this week.</p>

<p>“It was difficult to get State and Defence even to comply with Trump's directives to stop certain activities. I discovered that contrary to the South Asia strategy, which called for the suspension of all aid to Pakistan with a few exceptions, when Mattis visited Islamabad in the coming weeks, the Pentagon was going to deliver a military aid package that included more than USD 150 million worth of armoured vehicles,” he writes.</p>

<p>McMaster says soon after he came to know about it, he called for a meeting with Mattis, the deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Gina Haspel, and other senior officials.</p>

<p>“I started by noting that the president (Trump) had been very clear on multiple occasions to suspend aid to the Pakistanis until they halted support for terrorist organisations that were killing Afghans, Americans, and coalition members in Afghanistan...We had all heard Trump say, 'I do not want any money going to Pakistan',” he says.</p>

<p>Mattis, the former NSA writes, noted the possibility that Pakistan might retaliate in certain ways, but others, including Ambassador David Hale, who had joined by video from Islamabad, did not share those concerns.</p>

<p>“Mattis reluctantly halted that shipment of assistance, but other aid would continue, prompting Trump to tweet on New Year's Day, 'The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years and they have given us nothing but lies &amp; deceit thinking of our leaders as fools. They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan with little help. No more!',” he writes.</p>

<p>“Pakistan was not changing its behaviour, and almost as an insult, the government released Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind behind the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, on the eve of Mattis's visit. Moreover, a recent event in Pakistan involving hostages had exposed the undeniable complicity of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence with the terrorists,” McMaster writes.</p>

<p>He notes that news reports that time criticised the president's tweet as capricious and devoid of a coherent policy. But halting assistance was a critical part of the South Asia strategy that Trump had approved at Camp David in August, he says.</p>

<p>"A lunch that the president hosted with the vice president, Tillerson, Mattis, Kelly, and me on December 14 helped me understand why it was difficult to implement Trump's guidance on Pakistan or to foster cooperation on contingency plans for North Korea,” says McMaster.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US regulators on Friday cleared SpaceX to restart launching its stalwart Falcon 9 rocket, as a probe continues into a rare mishap this week during a first-stage booster landing.</p>

<p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded the Falcon 9 rocket on Wednesday after a first-stage booster tipped over and exploded while attempting to land on a droneship off the Florida coast.</p>

<p>The early morning launch was otherwise successful, delivering the latest batch of 21 Starlink internet satellites into orbit.</p>

<p>"The SpaceX Falcon 9 vehicle may return to flight operations while the overall investigation of the anomaly during the Starlink Group 8-6 mission remains open, provided all other license requirements are met," the FAA said in a statement Friday.</p>

<p>A webcast from Elon Musk's company showed the first stage, which normally fires its thrusters to achieve a precise upright landing, tilting and blowing up as it descended onto a droneship off the Florida coast.</p>

<p>Although landing the booster is a secondary objective, and no lives or public property were at risk, the reusability of the entire rocket system is crucial to SpaceX's business model.</p>

<p>It broke a more than three-year streak of hundreds of successful booster landings.</p>

<p>Falcon 9 is the workhorse of SpaceX's fleet, trusted by the US government and private industry to propel satellites and astronauts into orbit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was last grounded for around two weeks in July when its second-stage engine experienced an anomaly that prevented it from deploying another batch of Starlink satellites at the correct altitude, leading them to burn up on re-entry through Earth's atmosphere</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A newly-elected UK MP from the Labour Party, Jas Athwal, has landed in controversy after reports emerged of appalling conditions in rental properties he owns. According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyg1j0lv1go?">BBC</a>, black mould and ant infestations have been found in flats managed by Mr Athwal, who holds the distinction of being the biggest landlord in the House of Commons with 15 rental properties.</p>

<p>Tenants in a block of seven flats in Ilford South have reported severe mould problems, with some residents having to clean their ceilings regularly to prevent the toxic substance from spreading. The situation is exacerbated by ant infestations that have made living conditions unbearable. One tenant described ants crawling on their child's body, while another feared eviction after voicing concerns about the dismal state of their flat.</p>

<p>"The ants are everywhere," one resident said. "They are on my kid's body and on their clothes."</p>

<p>Mr Athwal, expressing shock and remorse, has pledged to address these issues urgently.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Andrew Boff, a Conservative member of the London Assembly, has called for an investigation by the Labour Party. Exploitative practices in the rental market was one of the issues that the Labour Party vowed to tackle in its 2024 general election manifesto.</p>

<p>"I'm deeply concerned," said Mr Boff. "I worry that there are people who are Jas Athwal's tenants who are now frightened to speak for fear of being evicted. We've heard this time and time again about how the threat of eviction is used to excuse poor maintenance of properties."&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 21-year-old student from Nepal was shot dead allegedly by an Indian-origin man at her apartment in US during a robbery, police said on Saturday. The man, who has been identified as 52-year-old Bobby Sinh Shah, has been arrested.</p>

<p>Muna Pandey, a community college student, was found with multiple gunshot wounds inside her Houston apartment around 5.30 pm on Monday, police said. Staff at her apartment complex told police that they received an anonymous call about a body inside the apartment. When the police reached the scene, she was declared dead.</p>

<p>Two days later, police released a photo of Shah who was caught on CCTV leaving her apartment on Saturday. Police said Shah was arrested later that day at a traffic stop and charged with murder.</p>

<p>According to a GoFundMe page, Ms Pandey had moved to study at the Houston Community College from Nepal in 2021. Her mother had been trying to reach her for days before her body was found inside her apartment, a member of Nepalese Association of Houston told the New York Post.</p>

<p>"What her Mom said is her phone was always online. After Saturday night, phone was offline. She had three gunshots and she was laying down on the bed, with head down. Hopefully, the investigation will come up with some idea of how this happened," he said, adding that Ms Pandey was an only child.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The association is working with the Nepal Consulate to help make travel arrangements for Ms Pandey's mother to fly to Houston.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are reaching out to you, our community, to help bring Anita to the United States so she can say goodbye to her only child and give Muna the farewell she deserves. The funds raised will be used to cover the costs of Muna's funeral and to bring her mother to Houston to be with her daughter's body for the final rituals," reads the GoFundMe page that has raised nearly $30,000.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of two doctors who are among the five people charged in the ketamine overdose death of "Friends" star Matthew Perry was barred by a federal judge on Friday from practising medicine and through his lawyer afterwards expressed remorse.</p>

<p>Dr Mark Chavez appeared in US District Court in Los Angeles for a brief arraignment on a single felony count of conspiracy to illegally distribute ketamine and was permitted to remain free on a $50,000 bond.</p>

<p>Chavez has previously signed an agreement with federal prosecutors to enter a guilty plea, which defence lawyer Matt Binninger told reporters his client would do at a later proceeding to be scheduled within a few weeks. No plea was entered on Friday.</p>

<p>As part of the bond conditions set by Magistrate Judge Jean Rosenbluth, Chavez also surrendered his passport and was ordered not to practice medicine. He had agreed to surrender his medical license at a separate administrative hearing earlier this week, according to a spokesperson for the US Attorney's Office.</p>

<p>"My client is accepting responsibility. He's doing everything in his power to cooperate, to help in this situation, and he's incredibly remorseful," Binninger said outside the courthouse.</p>

<p>The lawyer added that Chavez's regret stemmed not from Perry's celebrity but from the fact that "someone who was trying to seek treatment died."</p>

<p>The attorney declined to discuss any details of the case. Chavez, with a downcast expression on his face, stood beside his lawyer but made no comment.</p>

<p>Another physician charged in the case, Dr Salvador Plasencia, has pleaded not guilty, as has co-defendant Jasveen Sangha, who authorities said was an illicit supplier of the drug and was known as the "ketamine queen."</p>

<p>Perry's live-in personal assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, who admitted to injecting Perry, and the alleged middleman who said he obtained ketamine from Sangha, have already pleaded guilty to charges they faced.</p>

<p>Authorities said Plasencia purchased ketamine from Chavez, and in text messages to Chavez discussing the amount to charge Perry for the drug wrote: "I wonder how much this moron will pay."</p>

<p>Perry died at age 54 in October 2023 from "acute effects" of ketamine and other factors that caused him to lose consciousness and drown in his hot tub, according to a December 2023 autopsy report.</p>

<p>The actor had publicly acknowledged decades of substance abuse, including during the years he starred as Chandler Bing on the hit 1990s television sitcom "Friends."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. plans to dismiss a few hundred employees in the coming weeks as part of the firm's annual cull of low-performing staff, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>The fresh round of firings would bring total cuts in 2024 to about 3% to 4% of the bank's workforce, with most of those reductions made earlier this year, one of the people said, asking not to be named discussing internal moves.</p>

<p>That's in line with the bank's typical approach as it seeks to keep a lid on costs and make room to enlist new talent. The annual exercise was briefly suspended in the middle of the Covid pandemic and was near the lower end of its typical 1% to 5% range last year.</p>

<p>Goldman employed 44,300 people at midyear. A company spokesperson said the bank's annual review of staff is normal and standard and that the company plans to have more employees at the end of 2024 than a year earlier.</p>

<p>The bank's stock climbed to an all-time high this week, rising more than 32% to surpass $510 by Friday's close of trading - making it the best performer among the top US banks. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier in the day that Goldman is carrying out its annual cull.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least six people were killed and 59 others injured in a Russian strike on Ukraine's eastern city of Kharkiv, Ukrainian officials have said.</p>

<p>Russia launched an attack with guided bombs from the Belgorod region, striking five locations, including a 12-story apartment building, Kharkiv regional governor Oleg Synegubov wrote on Telegram on Friday.</p>

<p>Among the victims was a 14-year-old girl, he noted.</p>

<p>The governor added that 20 of those injured are in either serious or critical condition.</p>

<p>"Occupiers killed a child right on the playground," Kharkiv mayor Ihor Terekhov said in a statement on Telegram.</p>

<p>Rescuers and emergency personnel are working at the scenes of the attacks, said the State Service for Emergencies.</p>

<p>A purported video from the site shared by Andriy Yermak, head of the office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, showed flames and thick black smoke coming from the upper part of the building.</p>

<p>"Russians hit civilians again," Yermak said on Telegram.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US State Department expressed disappointment on Friday, on the second anniversary of a United Nations report on human rights in Xinjiang, and called on China to take action and end the current repression of Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups.</p>

<p>The 2022 report by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights concluded that "serious human rights violations" had been committed in the Xinjiang region.</p>

<p>Sharing a post on X, Matthew Miller, US State Department spokesperson said, "Two years since the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights released an assessment on human rights violations in Xinjiang, the US continues to urge the PRC (People's Republic of China) to take immediate action and end the ongoing repression of Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups."</p>

<p>In 2022, after a multi-year assessment, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) concluded that "serious human rights violations have been committed" in Xinjiang, the US Department of State said in a press release.</p>

<p>The release further said that the United States is disappointed that after two years, the PRC continues to reject the OHCHR assessment's findings and refuses to implement the High Commissioner's recommendations to release all those arbitrarily deprived of their liberty, cease all intimidation and reprisals against Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim minorities in Xinjiang and abroad, and investigate allegations of human rights abuses, including torture, sexual violence, forced labor, and forced medical treatment.</p>

<p>The United States remains gravely concerned by the PRC's ongoing repression of predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang, which the High Commissioner's assessment found "may constitute international crimes, particularly crimes against humanity." We again urge the PRC to take immediate action to end these ongoing atrocities, the release said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a day earlier, the Human Rights Watch (HRW), an international human rights watchdog, in a statement lamented the Chinese government for its human rights abuses in Xinjiang, claiming that the authorities have been persistently committing human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang.</p>

<p>While commenting on the situation, Maya Wang, the associate China director at Human Rights Watch, stated, "Beijing's brazen refusal to meaningfully address well-documented crimes in Xinjiang is no surprise, but shows the need for a robust follow-up by the UN human rights chief and UN member states. Contrary to the Chinese government's claims, its punitive campaign against millions of Uyghurs in Xinjiang continues to inflict great pain."</p>

<p>Thousands of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang continue to remain wrongfully imprisoned, wherein their relatives living domestically and abroad have little to no contact with their families in China. Many live with the uncertainty about whether their loved ones, sometimes dozens of their family and relatives, remain detained, imprisoned, or forcibly disappeared.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Friday reiterated India's stand regarding the Russia-Ukraine war and said that it will support any feasible and mutually acceptable solution or format that could restore peace.</p>

<p>Addressing a briefing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, " The decision as to when and how to commence peace talks is the prerogative of the two parties to the conflict. As friends and partners, we would support any feasible and mutually acceptable solution or format that could restore peace..."</p>

<p>Answering a question about Indians stuck in the Russian army, he said that 15 Indians, who were stuck in Russia, have been released and have returned to India adding that the Indian Embassy is in constant touch with the Russian authorities to facilitate the release of those who wish to return to India.</p>

<p>"We have an update as of now, as of today we have 15 Indians who have been released and they have returned to India, there are others who are waiting for discharge. Our mission, our embassy, is in touch with Russian authorities, and we hope that those who want to return back to india will be released soon," said Jaiswal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jaiswal said that India has always advocated constructive, solution-oriented, and practical engagement with all stakeholders to achieve a negotiated settlement to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.</p>

<p>This comes days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi returned from his visit to Ukraine where he had met President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and advocated India's stand on achieving peace through dialogue.</p>

<p>Jaiswal stated that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already indicated India's willingness to play a constructive role in the interest of peace. He noted that the decision on when and how to begin peace talks is the prerogative of the two parties to the conflict.</p>

<p>"We have always advocated constructive, solution-oriented and practical engagement with all stakeholders to achieve a negotiated settlement to this conflict. This is evident in our outreach to both Russia and Ukraine at the highest level. PM has already indicated India's willingness to play a constructive role in the interest of peace. However, it is too early to comment on specific modalities and pathways at this stage," said the MEA spokesperson.</p>

<p>Following this, the MEA spokesperson also addressed the issue of Indian nationals stranded at the Sao Paolo Airport and stated that our Consulate is in contact with the Brazilian Foreign Office representative in Sao Paulo on the matter. They have also sought a meeting with the relevant authorities and are ascertaining further details.</p>

<p>"As far as the issue of indian stranded in the international airport in Sao Paulo is concerned, yes we are aware. here are several Indians. we also have a consulate in Sao Paulo. the consulate is in touch with the foreign office representative in the city. They have also sought a meeting with the local authorities. let me tell you what was reported in some medium, the indian there at the airport are been taken care of in terms of food nourishment etc..." said MEA.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, MEA also spoke at the CII Event on Africa and stated that "India-Africa relations are historic and special. Together with our African friends and partners, we want to strengthen the voice of the Global South. We are also keen to deepen our economic partnership with them."</p>

<p>"In pursuit of this objective, the 19th CII India-Africa Conclave was held in Delhi last week. It was inaugurated by the Hon'ble Vice President and attended by the Hon'ble Vice Presidents of Burundi, Equatorial Guinea, Gambia, Liberia, Mauritius and Zimbabwe. In addition, we had 40 Ministerial participants from Africa and 1200 delegates from 65 countries attending the event. The conclave has given a major boost to our economic ties with African countries," MEA added.</p>

<p>"Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has had a long engagement with Africa and keeping in mind its importance, started an Africa division more than 25 years ago," according to CII</p>

<p>The organization has played a catalytic role in strengthening India-Africa ties, especially in the world of business. Today, CII has 75 counterpart organisations in 37 African countries that facilitate the exchange of information between the Indian and African industries.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Supreme Court judge on Friday ordered the suspension of Elon Musk's X social media network in Brazil, after months-long standoff over disinformation in South America's largest nation.</p>

<p>The judge, Alexandre de Moraes, handed down the ruling after Musk failed to comply with an order to name a new legal representative for the company.</p>

<p>Musk, who also owns Tesla and SpaceX, reacted with fury, branding Moraes an "evil dictator cosplaying as a judge" and accusing him of "trying to destroy democracy in Brazil."</p>

<p>"Free speech is the bedrock of democracy and an unelected pseudo-judge in Brazil is destroying it for political purposes," the billionaire wrote on X.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Free speech is the bedrock of democracy and an unelected pseudo-judge in Brazil is destroying it for political purposes <a href="https://t.co/eqbowALCeu">https://t.co/eqbowALCeu</a></p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1829624142452195334?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 30, 2024</a></blockquote></p>

<p>The two have been locked in an ongoing, high-profile feud for months as Moraes leads a battle against disinformation in Brazil.</p>

<p>Musk has previously declared himself a "free speech absolutist," but since he took over the platform formerly known as Twitter in 2022 he has been accused of turning it into a megaphone for right-wing conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Moraes ordered the "immediate, complete and comprehensive suspension of the operation of" X in the country, telling the national communications agency to take "all necessary measures" to implement the order within 24 hours.</p>

<p>He also asked Google, Apple, and internet providers to "introduce technological obstacles capable of preventing the use of the X application" and access to the website.</p>

<p>And he threatened to fine people 50,000 reais ($8,900) if they used "technological subterfuges" to get around the block, such as a VPN.</p>

<p>The social media platform has more than 22 million users in Brazil.</p>

<p>Musk shut X's business operations in Brazil earlier this month, claiming Moraes had threatened the company's previous legal representative with arrest to force compliance with "censorship orders."</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Moraes told Musk he had 24 hours to find a new representative or he would face suspension.</p>

<p>Shortly after the deadline passed, X said in a statement that it expected Moraes to shut it down "simply because we would not comply with his illegal orders to censor his political opponents."</p>

<p>- 'Who does Musk think he is?'-</p>

<p>The standoff with Musk began when Moraes ordered the suspension of several X accounts belonging to supporters of Brazil's former far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, who tried to discredit the voting system in the 2022 election, which he lost.</p>

<p>Brazilian authorities are investigating whether Bolsonaro plotted a coup attempt to prevent current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from assuming office in January 2023.</p>

<p>Online users blocked by Moraes include figures like far-right ex-congressman Daniel Silveira, who was sentenced to nine years in prison in 2022 on charges of leading a movement to overthrow the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>In April, Moraes ordered an investigation of Musk, accusing him of reactivating some of the banned accounts.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Musk's satellite internet operator Starlink said it had received an order from Moraes that froze its accounts and prevented it from conducting financial transactions in Brazil.</p>

<p>Starlink alleged that the order "is based on an unfounded determination that Starlink should be responsible for the fines levied -- unconstitutionally -- against X."</p>

<p>The company said on X that it intended "to address the matter legally."</p>

<p>Musk is also the subject of a separate judicial investigation into an alleged scheme where public money was used to orchestrate disinformation campaigns in favor of Bolsonaro and those close to him.</p>

<p>"Any citizen from anywhere in the world who has investments in Brazil is subject to the Brazilian Constitution and laws," Lula told a local radio station on Friday.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;On Friday evening, a violent incident occurred on a bus in Siegen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, leaving five people injured after a woman attacked them with a knife, local police confirmed, Xinhua reported.</p>

<p>Notably, the woman has been arrested.</p>

<p>The police informed that three persons were in life-threatening conditions. At least 40 other passengers were on the bus at the time of the incident. No further danger is posed, police said, according to Xinhua.</p>

<p>According to German newspaper Bild, the attacker is believed to be a German national, with indications suggesting that they may have been struggling with mental health issues and potentially under the influence of drugs. The police has clarified that they do not suspect terrorism to be a motivating factor.</p>

<p>The incident comes days after a Syrian man brought himself in and admitted to stabbing three people to death and several others at a festival in the western German city of Solingen on Friday, CNN reported citing the police.</p>

<p>The incident claimed the lives of two men, ages 67 and 56, and a lady, age 56.</p>

<p>It stunned Germany and led opposition parties to demand stricter immigration laws. The 26-year-old is accused by German prosecutors of being an ISIS member. Via its Amaq news agency, the terrorist group claimed responsibility for the incident. But it provided no proof to support that claim.</p>

<p>In a statement, prosecutors said that due to his "radical Islamist convictions, [the suspect] decided to kill as many people as possible at the Solingen city festival."</p>

<p>The suspect went on a significant manhunt before turning himself in. The man stated, "I'm the one you're looking for," to the officers while covered in blood, according to the daily Bild, reported CNN.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Supreme Court judge on Friday ordered the suspension of Elon Musk's X social media network in Brazil after the billionaire failed to comply with an order to name a new legal representative for the company.</p>

<p>Musk has been locked in a months-long feud with the judge, Alexandre de Moraes, who is leading a battle against disinformation in South America's largest nation.</p>

<p>Moraes ordered the "immediate, complete and comprehensive suspension of the operation of 'X Brasil Internet LTDA' in the national territory."</p>

<p>He ordered the National Telecommunications Agency (Anatel) to "adopt all necessary measures to implement" the order within 24 hours.</p>

<p>He also asked Google, Apple, and internet providers to "introduce technological obstacles capable of preventing the use of the X application" and access to the website.</p>

<p>The social media platform formally known as Twitter has more than 22 million users in Brazil.</p>

<p>Musk shut X's business operations in Brazil earlier this month, claiming Moraes had threatened the company's previous legal representative with arrest to force compliance with "censorship orders."</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Moraes told Musk "to appoint the company's new legal representative in Brazil within 24 hours" or face suspension.</p>

<p>The South African-born Tesla boss fired off tweets calling Moraes an "evil dictator cosplaying as a judge" and accusing him of "trying to destroy democracy in Brazil."</p>

<p>"Soon, we expect Judge Alexandre de Moraes will order X to be shut down in Brazil – simply because we would not comply with his illegal orders to censor his political opponents," X said in a statement shortly after the passing of a 24-hour deadline.</p>

<p>Musk and other critics accuse Moraes of stifling free speech.</p>

<p>"Any citizen from anywhere in the world who has investments in Brazil is subject to the Brazilian Constitution and laws," Lula told a local radio station on Friday.</p>

<p>"Who does (Musk) think he is?"</p>

<p><strong>- Starlink finances frozen -</strong></p>

<p>On Thursday, Musk's satellite internet operator Starlink said it had received an order from Moraes that "freezes Starlink's finances and prevents Starlink from conducting financial transactions" in the country.</p>

<p>Starlink, which operates in Brazil, particularly in the Amazon, alleged that the order "is based on an unfounded determination that Starlink should be responsible for the fines levied -- unconstitutionally -- against X."</p>

<p>The company said on X that it intended "to address the matter legally."</p>

<p>Musk is also the subject of a separate judicial investigation into an alleged scheme where public money was used to orchestrate disinformation campaigns in favor of Bolsonaro and those close to him.</p>

<p>The proliferation and amplification of misinformation and conspiracy theories on social media have sparked debate over the need for content moderation and a balance between calling out falsehoods and veering towards censorship or curbing free speech.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A controversial biopic of Donald Trump that depicts the former president raping his wife and which has drawn legal threats from his attorneys will hit US theaters this October, it was reported Friday.</p>

<p>Tiny indie studio Briarcliff Entertainment plans to release "The Apprentice" for US audiences less than a month before Trump takes on Kamala Harris in the country's razor-tight presidential election, the Hollywood Reporter said.</p>

<p>Representatives for Briarcliff did not immediately respond to AFP queries.</p>

<p>The explosive film about Trump's younger years caused shockwaves at the Cannes Film Festival in May.</p>

<p>Its most talked about scene shows Trump raping his first wife, Ivana, after she belittles him for growing fat and bald.</p>

<p>In real life, Ivana accused Trump of raping her during divorce proceedings but later rescinded the allegation. She died in 2022.</p>

<p>The movie also shows Trump suffering erectile dysfunction, and undergoing liposuction and surgery for hair loss.</p>

<p>Just hours after "The Apprentice" premiered in May, Trump's lawyers vowed to sue the producers, calling the film "garbage" and "pure malicious defamation."</p>

<p>Further complicating the film's prospects for US release is that one of its early financial backers was pro-Trump billionaire Dan Snyder, who was reportedly displeased with its depiction of Trump and sought to block the movie.</p>

<p>He has now been bought out of his financial stake in the movie, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The film is set to be released in US theaters October 11, the Los Angeles Times said.</p>

<p>Sebastian Stan's lead performance as young New York property tycoon Trump received largely positive reviews at Cannes.</p>

<p>The film's screenplay was written by Gabriel Sherman, a journalist who covered real estate for the New York Observer and regularly spoke to Trump.</p>

<p>Far from a simple hatchet job, the film depicts Trump as an ambitious but naive social climber desperately trying to navigate the cutthroat world of Manhattan property deals and politics.</p>

<p>The Times of London argued it would "make you feel sympathy for Trump."</p>

<p>But Trump's decency is gradually eroded as he learns the dark arts of dealmaking and power from his mentor Roy Cohn, played by "Succession" star Jeremy Strong.</p>

<p>Film director Ali Abbasi told AFP he included the rape scene to show how Trump distanced himself from "human relationships that define him and that hold him in check as a human being."</p>

<p>Stan, best known from the Marvel superhero movies, added that Trump's early behavior "is much more relatable than we want to admit."</p>

<p>Briarcliff Entertainment launched in the late 2010s. Its founder Tom Ortenberg previously helped steer Oscar campaigns for best picture winners "Spotlight" and "Crash."</p>

<p>He is expected to promote "The Apprentice" in Hollywood's upcoming award season.</p>

<p>The news comes on the same day "Reagan," another biopic of a former Republican president, Ronald Reagan, hits US theaters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Kremlin has never made any deals with Telegram boss Pavel Durov, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday, adding that he was not aware of any meetings between the tech entrepreneur and Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>A French judge put Russian-born Durov under formal investigation on Wednesday for suspected complicity in running an online platform that allows illicit transactions, child sex abuse images, drug trafficking and fraud.</p>

<p>Durov's lawyer said on Thursday it was "absurd" to suggest he should be held responsible for any crimes committed on the app.</p>

<p>"There were no negotiations between Durov and the Kremlin," Peskov told reporters. "And the fact that he visited Russia, well, he is a Russian citizen, he moves freely, so naturally he visited Russia.</p>

<p>"There were no deals between the Kremlin and Durov," Peskov said in response to further questions.</p>

<p>Peskov said that as far as he was aware, Putin and Durov had never met.</p>

<p>Russia, after years of pressure on Durov and his tech ventures, has rallied behind him, with Peskov this week saying that the case against him should not become political persecution.</p>

<p>Moscow tried and failed to block Telegram, which has almost 1 billion users, in 2018, and has demanded the platform hand over data in the past, something Durov says he refused to do.</p>

<p>The case has plunged Franco-Russian relations to new lows, according to Moscow, where some pro-Kremlin figures have accused Washington of being behind the detention of Durov, something Paris has denied.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The investigation into Telegram boss Pavel Durov that has fired a warning shot to global tech titans was started by a small cybercrime unit within the Paris prosecutor's office, led by 38-year-old Johanna Brousse.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The investigation into Telegram boss Pavel Durov that has fired a warning shot to global tech titans was started by a small cybercrime unit within the Paris prosecutor's office, led by 38-year-old Johanna Brousse.</p>

<p>The arrest of Durov, 39, last Saturday marks a significant shift in how some global authorities may seek to deal with tech chiefs reluctant to police illegal content on their platforms.</p>

<p>The arrest signalled the mettle of the J3 cybercrime unit, but the true test of its ambitions will be whether Brousse can secure a conviction based on a largely untested legal argument, lawyers said.</p>

<p>In an unprecedented move against a major tech CEO, prosecutors argued Durov bears responsibility for the alleged illegality on his platform, placing him under formal investigation on organized crime charges. He is suspected of complicity in running an online platform that allows the posting of child sex abuse images, drug trafficking and fraud.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Durov's lawyer said on Thursday it was "absurd" for him to be held responsible and that the app abided by European laws, echoing an earlier statement by Telegram itself.</p>

<p>Being placed under formal investigation in France does not imply guilt or necessarily lead to trial, but indicates judges consider there is enough evidence to proceed with the probe. Investigations can last years before being sent to trial or dropped. Durov is out on bail, but barred from leaving France.</p>

<p>Brousse's unit began investigating Durov earlier this year after seeing his app being used for countless alleged crimes, and growing frustrated by the "almost total lack of response from Telegram to judicial requests", Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Brousse declined to comment.</p>

<p>In an interview with newspaper Liberation in January, Brousse said her office was overseeing a growing number of probes involving Telegram and rival messaging app Discord, adding that tackling crime on them was "one of my battles".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jason Citron, Discord's CEO, did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brousse's J3 cybercrime unit is France's most important, with licence to prosecute nationwide. But it also is small, with just five prosecutors, well below the 55-60 cybercrime prosecutors in Switzerland, a 2022 parliamentary report found. With limited resources, they "prioritize the most serious crimes", Brousse told Le Figaro last year.</p>

<p>Brousse said in a 2022 podcast appearance she wanted to be tough "so cybercriminals believe that if they attack France, they will be judged and punished very severely".</p>

<p>"We want people to be prosecuted, either in their country ... or in France through arrest warrants," she said.</p>

<p>Her office was used to "extremely sensitive cases", she added. "Sometimes, legal and geopolitical issues intersect."</p>

<p>Patrick Perrot, who coordinates AI-assisted probes at the French gendarmerie and advises the Interior Ministry's cybercommand unit, said the J3 had been innovative in seeking to prosecute cases that set an international precedent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I think it shows that you can't do whatever you want with these platforms," he told Reuters. "It's a real question for the future, because these platforms won't stop multiplying, so the challenge of regulation is essential."</p>

<p><strong>TOUGH LEGAL GROUND?</strong></p>

<p>Brousse has led the J3 since 2020, which has given her oversight of one of the most important - and controversial - French cybercrime cases ever.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In late 2020, the J3 took charge of the probe into Sky ECC, which alongside Encrochat was one of the main encrypted communications services used by gangsters to buy drugs and weapons, or murder rivals. A few years earlier, French, Dutch and Belgian police had hacked into their servers, which were housed in northern France, giving French prosecutors jurisdiction over many of the resulting probes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There have been more than 6,500 arrests since the takedown of Encrochat in 2020, according to Europol, with the legality of the intercepts challenged in appeals courts across Europe.</p>

<p>Paul Krusky, the Canadian Encrochat boss, was extradited in February from the Dominican Republic to France, where he now awaits trial. Lawyers for Sky ECC's Jean-François Eap are contesting his French arrest warrant.</p>

<p>Stephane Bonifassi, Eap's lawyer, said his client was innocent, adding that "Sky ECC was not conceived as a tool for criminals, nor commercialized as such".</p>

<p>Krusky's lawyer, Antoine Vey, said his client was innocent.</p>

<p>"The service set up by Paul Krusky, like other services that have enjoyed global success, was only intended to protect the privacy and freedom of exchange of its users, and in no case to support criminal activities," Vey said in a statement.</p>

<p>Two other French lawyers who have worked on Sky ECC and Encrochat cases told Reuters that these earlier probes gave prosecutors the ambition - and a blueprint - to target Durov.</p>

<p>Robin Binsard, who has fought Encrochat cases at France's top court, said prosecutors would need to prove that Durov knew and approved of the criminality on the app, calling their argument "totally questionable".</p>

<p>The fact that Telegram didn't comply with law enforcement requests "does not automatically make one an accomplice to a criminal project", he added.</p>

<p>Binsard said it was clear "France is pursuing encrypted messaging providers", and that other operators of such apps, such as Signal, "should be concerned about whether or not they are in compliance with French regulations. Because the message is clear if they are not, legal action will take place".</p>

<p>Signal did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A source at the Paris prosecutor's office said the Sky ECC probe had no links to the Telegram investigation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A French retiree goes on trial Monday accused of recruiting dozens of strangers online to rape his wife after he drugged her into unconsciouness, in a case that has horrified the country.</p>

<p>Fifty other men are also on trial in the southern city of Avignon alongside the main suspect, a 71-year-old former employee at France's power utility EDF.</p>

<p>They are accused of raping the woman who, her lawyers say, was so heavily sedated that she was not aware of the abuse.</p>

<p>The trial will be "a horrible ordeal" for the woman, now in her 70s, and who does not wish to be identified, said Antoine Camus, one of her lawyers.</p>

<p>"For the first time, long after the fact, she will have to live through the rapes that she endured over 10 years," he told AFP, adding that his client had "no recollection" of the abuses which she only discovered in 2020.</p>

<p>The woman could have asked for the trial to be held behind closed doors but didn't, because "that's what her attackers would have wanted", Camus said.</p>

<p>"She is completely determined to face them and her husband with whom she lived for 50 years but whom she knew nothing about, as she discovered at 68," the lawyer said.</p>

<p>Police began to investigate the defendant Dominique P. in September 2020 when he was caught by a security guard secretly filming under the skirts of three women in a shopping centre.</p>

<p>Examining his computer, police said they found thousands of pictures and videos of his wife, visibly unconscious and mostly in the fetal position.</p>

<p>The images are alleged to show dozens of instances of rape in the couple's home in Mazan, a village of barely 6,000 inhabitants some 33 kilometres (21 miles) from Avignon in Provence.</p>

<p><strong>Up to six times</strong></p>

<p>Investigators also found chats on a site called coco.fr, since shut down by police, in which he recruited strangers to come to their home and have intercourse with his wife.</p>

<p>Police counted a total of 92 rapes, committed by 72 men of whom 51 were formally identified.</p>

<p>Dominique P. admitted to investigators that he gave his wife powerful tranquilisers, especially Temesta, an anxiety-reducing drug.</p>

<p>The abuse started in 2011, when the couple was living near Paris, and continued after they moved to Mazan two years later.</p>

<p>The suspect gave the men strict instructions so they would not wake her up when they abused her during the night.</p>

<p>No aftershave or cigarette odour were allowed, and they had to warm their hands before touching her, and get undressed in the kitchen so they would not accidentally leave clothes behind in the bedroom.</p>

<p>The husband took part in the rapes, filmed them and encouraged the other men using degrading language, according to prosecutors.</p>

<p>No money exchanged hands.</p>

<p>The accused rapists, aged between 21 and 68, included a forklift driver, a fire brigade officer, a company boss, and a journalist.</p>

<p>Some were single, others married or divorced, and some family men. Most participated just once, some up to six times.</p>

<p><strong>'Closer to coma'&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Their defence has been that they simply helped a libertine couple live out its sexual fantasies, but Dominique P. told investigators that they were all aware that his wife had been drugged without her knowledge.</p>

<p>The trial will have to establish to what degree they understood the situation when they had intercourse with the woman whose state, an expert said, "was closer to a coma than to sleep".</p>

<p>Her husband told prosecutors that only three men left the house quickly after arriving, while all others proceeded to have intercourse with his wife.</p>

<p>Dominique P., who said he himself was raped by a male nurse when he was nine, is ready to face "his family and his wife", his lawyer Beatrice Zavarro told AFP.</p>

<p>This trial may not be his last. He has also been charged with a 1991 murder and rape, which he denies, and an attempted rape in 1999, to which he admitted after conclusive DNA testing.</p>

<p>"There is no such thing as a typical rapist profile," Veronique Le Goaziou, a specialist on sexual violence, told AFP.</p>

<p>"Many people will say he is crazy," she said about Dominque P. "But that's in no way certain. Only a tiny number of rapists are diagnosed with a real mental illness."</p>

<p>Psychiatric evaluations during the investigation have shown Dominique P. to be "a patriarch" and "a manipulator" with a "perverse" personality who used his wife as "bait".</p>

<p>The trial is set to run to December.<br />

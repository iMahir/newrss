       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian nationals currently in Lebanon and those planning to travel to the West Asian country are advised to "exercise caution," the Indian Embassy in Beirut said in an advisory issued on Monday.</p>

<p>Tensions in the region have escalated following a rocket strike on a soccer field in northern Israel's Majdal Shams on July 27 that resulted in the death of 12 children and injured several others.</p>

<p>Israel and the USA blamed Hezbollah for the air strike with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that Hezbollah will pay a "heavy price which it has not paid up to now" for the attack.</p>

<p>Netanyahu also held a security assessment meeting in Tel Aviv on Sunday during which "the manner and timing of the response" against Hezbollah was decided.</p>

<p>Several flights heading to Beirut have also been suspended over the last couple of days following the Israeli threat of military action against Hezbollah.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was in Tokyo on Monday, also expressed Washington's support for Israel, highlighting Israel's right to self-defence while also urging the need to avoid escalation of the conflict on Israel's northern border.</p>

<p>"We don't want to see the conflict escalate. We don't want to see it spread," Blinken said on the sidelines of the Quad Foreign Ministers Meeting.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Indian Embassy in Beirut shared an emergency mail ID and phone number, asking the Indian nationals in the country to remain in touch.</p>

<p>According to the Indian embassy, there are nearly 4000 Indian nationals in Lebanon, with a majority of them employed as workers in companies, construction sector, agricultural farms, etc.<br />

<p>So what if our team turned up in an eyesore of a formal kit at the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics? Our shaadi ceremonies are way grander than the show France put up earlier this week. As we say in Delhi, "vibe is better here".</p>

<p>On a serious note, Team India's sartorial ignominy will, disproportionately, remain the defining moment for the country's most important sporting outing in four years. Unless, of course, the shine of medals makes us forget how we repeatedly let our athletes down.&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://sports.ndtv.com/olympics-2024/paris-olympics-2024-live-updates-manu-bhaker-ramita-jindal-olympic-games-paris-2024-day-3-latest-updates-6212322">While shooter Manu Bhaker</a> is being cheered for her bronze, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://sports.ndtv.com/olympics-2024/videos/sharath-kamal-deepika-kumari-and-others-bow-out-paris-olympics-on-day-2-819598">Deepika Kumari</a> has been turned into a villain online after India's archery team lost 0-6 to the Netherlands.</p>

<h2><strong>What The Olympics Represent</strong></h2>

<p>The modern Olympics are important, they have always been, for not just what they present during some weeks but also what they represent before and after the opening and the closing ceremonies. They are scrutinised, overanalysed, politicised, and sometimes even totemised. Terrorist threats emerging around each edition of the games underscore their geopolitical importance. Like their ancient version, the modern Olympics are overburdened with the task of building bridges between countries and cultures. They are a celebration of the indomitable spirit of humanity that burns bright even when countries and cultures stand on the brink of annihilation. The loudest cheers, therefore, are reserved for the contingents marching under the refugee flags, every four years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Olympics have been serving as an antidote to strife and conflict since ancient times. The Greeks loved to fight. But they also halted their warring business for the games. Even in the middle of the fierceness of the Trojan War in <em>The Iliad</em>, Achilles organises funeral games to honour the memory of Patroclus. Many an observer of the games in both their ancient and modern avatars believe that the Olympics are all about winning. Surely, the hymns of glory in Homer's epic and other classical texts like the odes of Pindar reserved for the winning athletes may foster this idea. Nothing could be further than the truth. The spirit of games, especially the Olympics, was far higher than the podium.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>A Question Of Honour</b></h2>

<p>In the ancient Greek culture, the desire for honour, <em>philotimia</em>, and the desire for victory, <em>philonikia</em>, run parallel. Heroes are heroes because they win, or lose, with their honour intact. Agamemnon, a great warrior, is no hero and meets a rather unheroic end by being killed in a bathtub in his home upon returning as a victor in the Trojan War. Achilles, had it not been for the funeral games, would not have emerged as the hero of<em> The Iliad</em>. His rage and retribution subside after immersion in the nobleness surrounding honourable competition. The Greeks did not have much respect for a man - women were not there in the game, they were often the prize - who could not bear to see another man win. Phthonos - the tendency to deprive another man of good and happiness - was acknowledged but not celebrated.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-was-the-masked-torchbearer-at-paris-olympics-opening-ceremony-6205762">Also Read |&nbsp;Who Was The Masked Torchbearer At Paris Olympics Opening Ceremony?</a></strong></p>

<p>It must be noted that codes of honour applied only to the mortals. The gods and goddesses could lie, cheat, quarrel, and be as base as they wished. Only those who could die could aspire to heroism; only they had to make a choice. Antilochus urging his horses mercilessly when competing against Menelaus makes a less-than-ideal choice. His zeal for victory ought not to be a burden for his beasts. He loses. Even if he'd won, Antilochus would have to swear that he didn't resort to unfair means.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The modern Olympics aim to carry this legacy of honour. And it's not confined to the competition venues. It is now becoming a norm to use the Olympics platform to make political statements. The throwing of the red roses by the Algerian contingent in the river Seine near a protest site where allegedly 300 Algerians were killed in 1961 after a French police crackdown is a powerful gesture of memorialising the victims of colonialism. Being honourable and successful is rarely coterminous now.</p>

<h2><strong>Indian Athletes Are Already Winners</strong></h2>

<p>Coming back to the Indian contingent, their success lies in the fact of their very presence at the Olympics. They are a case study in honour and humility. Racing against time, crossing interminable systemic, societal, and logistical hurdles if they are able to don their country's colours-however non-aesthetically rendered-with pride and dignity on that barge cruising down the Seine, they are winners even before competing. India's neglect of its athletes is a story oft told.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/paris-olympics-2024-coco-gauff-reveals-why-her-teammates-left-olympic-village-for-hotel-6207833">Also Read |&nbsp;"10 Girls, 2 Bathrooms": Coco Gauff On Why Her Teammates Left Olympic Village For Hotel</a></strong></p>

<p>This should bring us to the question: what should winning at the Olympics mean for Indians beyond the immediate photo ops? And what about the promised infrastructural and systemic reforms that would allow Indian children to even think of sports as a real choice? Why do we, the people, expect any glory and honour from our athletes at the Olympics when we do not fuel their fire with honourable conduct on our part? We are the quickest to throw them under the bus for their inability to handle the flash-in-a-pan moment of the limelight they get after any sporting victory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After such knowledge, what forgiveness?&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Europe's Ariane 6 rocket blasted off carrying satellites on July 9. The lift-off marked the return of Europe's access to outer space. The lift-off was successful, but the mission ended with Ariane 6 coasting into orbit without releasing the final payload.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To protect "Europe's return to space", three French Rafale fighter jets were deployed to escort the rocket and prevent any "malicious intrusion in the air". A video of Rafales escorting the rocket is now viral on X.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[CCHF is transmitted through tick bites or contact with bodily fluids of infected animals or humans.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man in Spain&nbsp;died after contracting a lethal 'bleeding eyes' disease called Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF),&nbsp;a deadly viral disease with a fatality rate of up to 40%. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/07/29/man-dies-contracting-lethal-bleeding-eyes-disease-tick-bite-spain-21316113/">Metro</a></em>, the 74-year-old died on Saturday&nbsp;after being hospitalised near Madrid.</p>

<p>The man, whose identity has not been revealed, was&nbsp;admitted to Rey Juan Carlos University Hospital in Mostoles, Spain, after being bitten by a tick in Toledo, approximately 100 miles southwest of Madrid. After he was diagnosed with the rare Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus, he was transferred to a high-dependency isolation unit at La Paz University Hospital in Madrid to prevent transmission. Initially, his condition was deemed stable, but he subsequently deteriorated after developing all symptoms associated with CCHF.</p>

<p>Tragically, he died from the virus on Saturday, marking the first CCHF-related death in Spain since May 2020. Health authorities are likely to be on high alert to prevent further cases and contain the spread of this dangerous virus.</p>

<p><strong>About&nbsp;Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever</strong></p>

<p>CCHF, described as 'Ebola-like' due to its similar hemorrhagic symptoms, is a disease caused by a tickborne virus. It has been categorised as a "priority disease" on a list by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and currently has no vaccine available.&nbsp;It is also one of nine pathogens deemed most likely to trigger a pandemic.&nbsp;CCHF is endemic in all of Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and in Asia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CCHF is transmitted through tick bites or contact with bodily fluids of infected animals or humans. Ticks can also transmit various other diseases, including Lyme disease, and the Powassan virus. The initial symptoms of CCHF include fever, muscle aches, abdominal pain, sore throat, and vomiting. It can also cause mood swings, confusion, and sleepiness, and trigger bleeds, usually from the nose or broken capillaries on the eyes and skin.</p>

<p>As per WHO, general supportive care with treatment of symptoms is the main approach to managing CCHF in people. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used to treat the infection with apparent benefit. To prevent tick-borne diseases, people are advised to wear protective clothing, use insect repellents, and check for ticks after spending time outdoors.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Germany said on Monday it was not deterred by Russian President Vladimir Putin's threats to relaunch production of intermediate-range nuclear weapons if the United States confirms its intention to deploy missiles to Europe.</p>

<p>"We will not be intimidated by such statements," foreign ministry spokesman Sebastian Fischer told a government press conference.</p>

<p>In early July, Washington and Berlin announced that the "episodic deployments" of long-range US missiles, including Tomahawk cruise missiles, to Germany would begin in 2026.</p>

<p>Putin on Sunday threatened to relaunch production of intermediate-range nuclear weapons if the plans go ahead.</p>

<p>"We will consider ourselves liberated from the unilateral moratorium previously adopted on the deployment of medium- and short-range strike capabilities," Putin said during a naval parade in Saint Petersburg.</p>

<p>Putin added that now in Russia "the development of a number of such systems is in the final stages".</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/russian-president-vladimir-putin-warns-us-of-cold-war-style-missile-crisis-819501" target="_blank">"We will take mirror measures in deploying them</a>, taking into account the actions of the US, its satellites in Europe and in other regions of the world," the Russian president warned.</p>

<p>Such missiles, which can travel between 500 and 5,500 kilometres (300-3,400 miles), were the subject of an arms control treaty signed by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1987.</p>

<p>But both Washington and Moscow withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 2019, each accusing the other of violations.</p>

<p>"This type of missile... had already been developed and deployed long ago" by Russia, Fischer said.</p>

<p>"What we are now planning is a response to deter these weapons from being used against Germany or other targets," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Calling India an "important partner" at a time when the world is at a "historic turning point", Japan on Monday said that it hopes to work more closely with the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the times to come.</p>

<p>External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa discussed ways to strengthen bilateral cooperation during their 40-minute meeting following the Quad Foreign Ministers Meeting in Tokyo on Monday.</p>

<p>According to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Kamikawa stated during the meeting that Tokyo wishes to "co-create" new solutions through dialogue and collaboration while deepening cooperation with New Delhi.</p>

<p>In response, EAM Jaishankar mentioned that as the India-Japan Special Strategic and Global Partnership marks its 10th anniversary, India is hoping to further deepen cooperation in a wide range of areas, including the economy, security and people-to-people exchanges.</p>

<p>The two ministers also shared the view that they would strengthen bilateral cooperation, including the steady progress of the high-speed rail project, a flagship project between Japan and India.</p>

<p>They also welcomed the expansion of recruitment for Indian nationals under the JET Programme and the start of the dispatch of Japanese Language Partners to India besides exchanging views on cooperation regarding the Security Council reform, with a view to the Future Summit in September this year.</p>

<p>Earlier, the Quad Foreign Ministers, including EAM Jaishankar, jointly called on Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida following their meeting on Monday afternoon.</p>

<p>During the 20-minute meeting, Kishida welcomed the progress that has been made in various areas of cooperation following discussions between the Quad grouping's foreign ministers that also included Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Japanese Foreign Minister Kamikawa Yoko.</p>

<p>"Honoured to call on Prime Minister Kishida along with fellow Quad Foreign Ministers today in Tokyo. Conveyed the warm regards of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Briefed him on the key takeaways from our meeting today. Appreciate his guidance for continued growth of Quad grouping and value his views on further intensification of India-Japan relations," EAM Jaishankar posted on X after the meeting.</p>

<p>In his remarks, Kishida mentioned that Japan, India, the United States and Australia would continue to cooperate closely at various levels.</p>

<p>"At the outset, Prime Minister Kishida welcomed the visit of the foreign ministers of the three countries to Japan. He stated that amid increasing uncertainty in the international situation, cooperation among Japan, the United States, Australia and India is becoming increasingly important in order to uphold principles and fundamental values," the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated after the meeting.</p>

<p>Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hayashi Yoshimasa, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Moriya Hiroshi, Special Advisor to the Prime Minister Ishihara Hirotaka, and several other top officials also attended the meeting.</p>

<p>"The three foreign ministers stated the importance of Japan, the United States, Australia and India, as partners sharing fundamental values, strengthening a rules-based, free and open international order, and confirmed that the four countries will promote various forms of cooperation and further collaborate together for the sake of peace and stability in the region," the statement added.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Monday said that the solution will not emerge from the battlefield, adding that it is imperative to return to dialogue and diplomacy.</p>

<p>He underlined how India had reiterated numerous times that the use of force is not the way to resolve problems between countries, and emphasized that "more needs to be done."</p>

<p>"From the very beginning, we had the view that the use of force does not resolve problems between countries. In the last 2-2.5 years, this conflict has cost lives, economic damage, and global consequences, impacted other societies, and contributed to global inflation... We do not think that the solution will emerge from the battlefield," Mr Jaishankar said while speaking to the press in Tokyo today.</p>

<p>The EAM further called for a return to dialogue and diplomacy and continuous efforts should be made by the countries involved to resolve the conflict.</p>

<p>"We believe that there must be a return to dialogue and diplomacy...Our feeling today is that more needs to be done, we should not resign ourselves to the continuation of the current state of conflict and say let this take its own course..." the minister said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar, along with Foreign Ministers of Japan Yoko Kamikawa and Australia's Penny Wong as well as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken participated in the Quad foreign ministers' meeting held on July 29 in Tokyo.</p>

<p>Quad is a diplomatic partnership between Australia, India, Japan, and the United States, committed to supporting an open, stable, and prosperous Indo-Pacific that is inclusive and resilient.</p>

<p>The Quad Foreign Ministers Meeting joint statement issued on July 29 said that the countries of the bloc were collectively advancing a positive and practical agenda to support the Indo-Pacific region's sustainable development, stability, and prosperity, responding to the region's needs.</p>

<p>The statement said that they contribute to a region in which all countries and people can exercise free choice on how they cooperate, and trade based on partnership, equality and mutual respect.</p>

<p>Through Quad, the countries are supporting the region through practical cooperation on challenges such as maritime security, critical and emerging technologies, cyber security, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, health security, climate change, counterterrorism, infrastructure and connectivity, and addressing the debt crisis through sustainable, transparent and fair lending and financing practices. The countries will cooperate with regional partners to address shared challenges in the region, the statement read.</p>

<p>PM Modi, who was on an official visit to Moscow recently, met with Russian President Vladimir Putin there. It was PM Modi's first visit to Russia since the war started between Moscow and Kyiv in 2022.<br />
Notably, India has always advocated "peace and diplomacy" for resolving conflict between Ukraine and Russia but has continued to purchase Russian oil, despite the objections of the Western nations, especially the US.</p>

<p>PM Modi said that everyone who believes in humanity is pained when there is a loss of lives. He further stated that it is "heart-wrenching" when innocent children are dying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Prime Minister also reiterated that the resolution to the conflict can't happen on battlefield but only through dialogue.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least two people were killed and up to 100 people injured on Monday when a passenger train carrying 800 people collided with a Kamaz truck, derailing eight carriages, Russian media outlets reported.</p>

<p>Some of the carriages lay twisted and battered beside the railway track, they said.</p>

<p>The train had been travelling from Kazan in Tatarstan to Adler on the Black Sea when it derailed in the southern Volgograd region near the Kotelnikovo station about 1,200 km (750 miles) south of Moscow, the emergencies ministry said.</p>

<p>"Paramedics are on the scene," the ministry said, adding that 324 emergency workers were involved in the operation. Emergency helicopters have also been scrambled, it said.</p>

<p>The Mash Telegram channel said at least two people were killed but that the death count could rise. Interfax news agency said that up to 100 people could be injured.</p>

<p>Unverified video on Telegram showed at least four carriages derailed, some twisted, with people climbing out of one that was on its side beside the rails.</p>

<p>Mash published video showing the battered remains of the cabin of a Kamaz truck beside the derailed train.</p>

<p>TASS cited unidentified sources in Russian law enforcement as saying that 20 people had been injured when the train collided with a Kamaz truck.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden announced plans on Monday for urgent reforms to the conservative-dominated Supreme Court, in a bold but long-shot move as he seeks to make a mark in his last six months in power.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old Democrat is calling for a constitutional amendment to reverse the Supreme Court's recent ruling backing Donald Trump's claims of presidential immunity, according to the White House.</p>

<p>The Democrat is also calling for term limits for Supreme Court justices, who currently serve for life, following shock rulings such as the repeal of the nationwide right to abortion.</p>

<p>Biden, who will further unveil the plans in a speech in Austin, Texas later Monday, will also seek an enforceable ethics code after a string of scandals.</p>

<p>He had confirmed he would seek the reforms during an Oval Office address last week outlining his priorities after deciding to drop out of the 2024 election, though the plans have almost no hope of getting through a deeply divided Congress.</p>

<p>"This nation was founded on a simple yet profound principle: No one is above the law. Not the president of the United States. Not a justice on the Supreme Court of the United States. No one," Biden said in an opinion piece published Monday.</p>

<p>"What is happening now is not normal, and it undermines the public's confidence in the court's decisions, including those impacting personal freedoms. We now stand in a breach."</p>

<p>Though their chances are slim, the proposed reforms reflect Biden's growing frustration with a court packed with Trump-appointed judges, and come as opinion polls show a growing loss of public confidence in the institution.</p>

<p>The White House said that both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee for November's election, "look forward to working with Congress" on the plans.</p>

<p>This would "reduce the chance that any single presidency imposes undue influence for generations to come," it said in a fact sheet.</p>

<p>But the White House said Biden would now seek 18-year term limits on Supreme Court justices, with new justices being appointed every two years.</p>

<h3><strong>Close to zero</strong></h3>

<p>This would "reduce the chance that any single presidency imposes undue influence for generations to come," it said in a fact sheet.</p>

<p>He would also seek a "binding, enforceable" ethics code similar to those that apply to federal judges.</p>

<p>The top court has a 6-3 conservative majority, with three judges who were appointed while Trump was president, and has dealt Biden several blows in recent years.</p>

<p>The court stunned the world in 2022 when it overturned the 1973 Roe v Wade ruling that had underpinned the federal right to abortion. At least 20 states have now brought in full or partial abortion bans.</p>

<p>This year the court significantly rolled back the power of federal agencies, while also partially ruling in early July in favor of Republican nominee Trump's immunity claims.</p>

<p>Trump is now using that ruling to challenge his recent criminal conviction in a porn star-hush money case as well as a series of other prosecutions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Supreme Court has been rocked by ethics scandals involving arch-conservative justices.</p>

<p>Justice Clarence Thomas recently admitted that two luxury vacations he took in 2019 were paid for by a billionaire Republican political donor.</p>

<p>Thomas, the longest-service justice on the court, has also ignored calls to recuse himself from cases related to the 2020 election, after his wife took part in the drive to keep Trump in power despite his electoral loss.</p>

<p>And Justice Samuel Alito has rejected calls to recuse himself from some Trump-related cases after flags linked to the former president's false election fraud claims were discovered to have been flown outside his home and vacation property.</p>

<p>Legal expert Steven Schwinn warned however that Biden had a "close to zero" chance of getting the plan through.</p>

<p>But Biden was probably trying to "raise public consciousness" and "introduce the Supreme Court as an election issue," Schwinn, a law professor at the University of Illinois Chicago, told AFP.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There comes a point in the life of every 30-something Indian woman where many interactions take the form of an explanation. The pressing issue to be addressed is this: "What's a brilliant girl like you doing single?"</p>

<h2><strong>The "Graveyard" Of 30s</strong></h2>

<p>You'd think the legalisation of homosexuality, new flourishing pockets of polyamory and open relationships, the fluidities in gender and sexuality and self-expression, would've dulled the kind of thinking that prompts people to ask such questions. But even the young and supposedly open-minded let slip their belief now and then that 30 is some kind of a graveyard, after which life either ends or is not as meaningful as it once was. A young man was recently telling our common friend about "a really old woman" he was lucky to have sex with. "She was, like, 31 or something, dude," he bragged, before realising his faux pas.</p>

<p>Another Gen-Z woman told me "I'll never be Gen-Z, no matter how hard I try". I wondered if the implication was that I was too old to be so online, or that I was not as good at it as she was, or that instead of being so up-to-date with memes and popular discourse, I should do something more age-appropriate. The internet is, after all, riddled with girl-math and boy-math-never woman-math.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But when you are content with your life and its discontents, you don't want to engage with anyone who doesn't get it. Especially when you can just write a column about it.</p>

<h2><strong>Young, Sweet Love</strong></h2>

<p>So, let me tell you (almost) everything: At the age of 29, I was in perhaps the best relationship of my life with a cool, caring and emotionally stable man I'd known for years, who had a family that I'd have been honoured to enter. Just a few weeks into our relationship, I knew that I should marry him, but by our two-year anniversary, when we were at a crossroads about what to do next, I felt I'd changed too much. "Settling down" suddenly seemed too distant from who I felt I was becoming, even though I'd been anxious to get married throughout my late twenties. Maybe it was distaste at having chased something so externally imposed that made me want to upend it, or maybe it was something deeper (it was definitely something deeper. My parents are divorced and my family is dysfunctional, and I have been subject to my own creative, destructive self-sabotage for a long time now).</p>

<p>Either way, I was trying to discard the imposed and honour the internal. My twenties had been driven by the need to succeed at every task thrown my way, despite familial troubles, all some form of survival disguised as decorum. But I now intended to live my many unlived lives: I moved out of our shared apartment into a one-bedroom flat - a veritable 'Room with a View' - in which I started writing more, painting for the first time, thinking and working fully without disruption. I loved my solitude, which also I'd never allowed myself, because even outside of your gender, living and doing things alone, and enjoying them no less, is considered 'weird' at best. I wanted to date freely and widely, to understand what really suited me, to devote more time to my many friendships, without romance or marriage becoming the fulcrum for the rest of my life. I'd seen much harm ensue from people doing things just because other people were doing them too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I wanted to be a sovereign individual, in short.</p>

<h2><strong>I Now Understand Carrie Bradshaw</strong></h2>

<p>Favourable or not, this was the honest thing to do. From Virginia Woolf to Carrie Bradshaw - whose room with a view was in expensive New York City ( even in Bengaluru, I work multiple non-writing jobs to sustain my mostly modest lifestyle) &nbsp;- writers especially want this kind of solitary freedom. The first time I watched <em>Sex and the City</em> last year, however, just after I turned 30, my reaction to Carrie's life was not a kindred "I'm just like her <em>fr</em>". I was way more judgmental. Her initially crazy behaviour with Big notwithstanding, I thought her dresses were too floozy and her columns simplistic and her attitude too carefree - not dark and brooding and <em>real</em>, like mine - and her pursuits too meaningless. Going out every night, meeting new people, buying more shoes than she could afford... What kind of 30-year-old woman does that? She was being such a... <em>girl</em>... I realised, in horror.</p>

<p>She was being what I could never be at home, as the eldest daughter to perfectionistic Tamil Brahmin parents: unbothered, free, promiscuous, cute, silly, often stupid, at least financially, if not romantically too. She was being what I found it hard to be even now, due to both internal and external deterrents. Unlike in New York City, a Bangalorean landlady might still tell you things like "don't allow boys to enter for your own safety". When I told this woman that I had male friends, she asked me whether I was "really Brahmin". Another landlady flat out refused to rent to a single woman because "if something happened to me", she'd be responsible.</p>

<h2><strong>There Is No Right Way To Live</strong></h2>

<p>So, when you walk away from such well-trodden paths, the pressure to display satisfaction and success intensifies. Carrie was one of TV's first female protagonists to portray women as desiring beings, rather than just desired objects. She doesn't just take what she gets - not always; she tries to be a discerning customer, at least. And like her, despite choosing authenticity over safety, I too experience doubt. I might catch myself thinking like the 'society uncle and aunty', who'd wonder about how much money I'm making or how big my house is or how many followers I have or how likely I am to get married in the next few years. After all, what do I have to show for my deviance? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>But if there's one thing I've learnt from my Robert Frost era, it discourages this kind of habitual comparative evaluation, normalised by the hypercompetitive Indian coming-of-age experience. I have to keep reminding myself of it, but the only lesson is this: There is No Right Way to Live.</p>

<h2><b>On Love And Lovers</b></h2>

<p>In just the past few weeks, as I was travelling through Goa and Kerala, I wondered sometimes what "settling down" might look for someone like me. I met people from, as ChatGPT might say, "all walks of life". It started with an old friend ringing to tell me he was back in the city, on a sort of a sabbatical, an unimaginable luxury for '90s Indian kids who were repeatedly asked to excel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We spent the day yapping - if I may be so bold, my Gen-Z readers - and then met a few of his friends. The single ones chatted about how romance is irrevocably different in our 30s than in our 20s. It's less about giving into chemistry and more about overcoming the attachment styles and subconscious patterns that lead to exciting but otherwise unsuitable partners. Another was in an open relationship with her primary partner for nearly a decade, with girlfriends and boyfriends in other countries too. Another bemoaned his inability to fall in love after his most serious relationship ended badly. Another old friend texted me about the end of their marriage after years of being together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From this colourful scene, my friend and I departed to meet two other friends, a married couple, who might be the poster child of the 'New-Indian-Happily-Married-Hindu' Family. Like the other couples I've hung out with of late, they too briefly made me long for the traditional monogamous setup. We talked until 3 am, and I woke up the next day to meet a friend I'd made in Goa. He'd moved there to "be more openly queer", after realising that the more metropolitan cities wouldn't offer him the life he wanted. We flirted with the idea of dating, but my now familiar commitment-phobia reared its head again. I was hardly out of a situationship with an ex who had once been a favourite, but was now completely wrong for me, thanks to chemistry coupled with traumatic highs and lows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Talk about being romantically stupid, well past the age for it.</p>

<h2><strong>Who Doesn't Have 'Problems'?</strong></h2>

<p>Fortunately, it didn't take me long to forget about him, because I matched with interesting, desirable people on the multiple apps you can now be on-from Bumble and Hinge and Feeld to, yes, even... Shaadi.com. Many people find these platforms hellish, and I might too eventually, but if you're an anthropologist as I sometimes get to be, it's easier to trade outcomes for observations and stories. I'm still not sure what I want, but I've met a wildlife researcher whose first conversation with me included an image of a bear standing on one of his weighing scales. I've also met lawyers and designers and writers and artists and technology brothers, and couples and divorcees and singles and weirdos and non-weirdos - some chronically online and others not - and what I'm learning is something no relationship coach or matchmaker will ever tell me, but what feels most important to know: there is no right way to live.</p>

<p>No one seems objectively happier than the other. No one seems to not have any problems. Some of these problems are despite following the well-trodden path. Some of them are from walking away from it, understandably. A lot of problems come from wondering if the problems are even legitimate, and whether others could or would or should have them.</p>

<p>For now, I am here to confirm: they do have problems, and they're quite like yours, and you're okay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And I'm okay too, I think.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Telecom installations belonging to French companies SFR and Bouygues Telecom have been vandalised, reported Le Parisien newspaper and BFM TV on Monday, citing unnamed sources.</p>

<p>SFR and Bouygues did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>The reports said cables in electrical cabinets had been cut in southern France, and that installations in the Meuse region near Luxembourg and the Oise area near Paris had been vandalised, affecting mainly fixed-line services.</p>

<p>Saboteurs targeted France's high-speed rail network on Friday with pre-dawn attacks on signal substations and cables, causing travel chaos hours before the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics.</p>

<p>Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said that one far-left extremist had been arrested on Sunday in relation to the case.</p>

<p>Traffic only returned to normal Monday morning but only after some 800,000 people faced disruptions, including 100,000 people whose trains had to be cancelled outright.</p>

<p>The reports by Le Parisien and BFM TV did not state if there were any links between the vandalism on the telecom installations, and that earlier sabotage on the rail network.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A far-left activist has been arrested in connection with the sabotage attack on France's high-speed rail network last Friday, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said on Monday.</p>

<p>It is the first publicly announced arrest made since the sabotage attack, which took place on Friday hours before the Olympic Games opening ceremony got underway.</p>

<p>Earlier Monday, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said that France suspects members of far-left groups were behind the sabotage of the country's high-speed rail network.</p>

<p>"We have identified the profiles of several people," Darmanin told France 2 TV, adding that the sabotage bore the hallmarks of far-left groups.</p>

<p>In recent years, France has been targeted in attacks by Islamist militants, but security services have been increasingly concerned about far-left or anarchist militants, who typically oppose the state and capitalism.</p>

<p>The then-head of France's domestic intelligence agency, Nicolas Lerner, told Le Monde newspaper last year French President Emmanuel Macron's divisive 2023 pension shake-up had helped lure recruits to far-left groups, which have increasingly incorporated ecological issues into their ideologies.</p>

<p>"In recent years, the far-left movements have been known for particularly violent clandestine actions, including arson campaigns ... ransacking and destruction of property," Lerner, who now leads the foreign spy agency DGSE, said in the interview.</p>

<p>In a 2023 report on terrorism trends, the European police agency Europol said left-wing and anarchist groups typically attacked "critical infrastructure, such as repeaters and antennas, government institutions and private companies" with their "most common modus operandi" being arson and improvised explosive devices.</p>

<p>Train services in France were back up and running by early Monday after teams worked around the clock over the weekend to fix the damage, Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete told RTL radio.</p>

<p>Vergriete said 800,000 people had faced travel disruptions and said the cost to the state-owned rail operator SNCF would be considerable.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Going vegan for eight weeks was found to be linked to lowering of biological age, according to a study published in the journal BioMed Central (BMC) Medicine.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Going vegan for eight weeks was found to be linked to lowering of biological age, according to a study published in the journal BioMed Central (BMC) Medicine.</p>

<p>Researchers looked at the molecular effects of the plant-based diet that abstains from consuming animal food products, such as dairy. The diet largely includes eating fruits and vegetables, along with grains, beans and nuts.</p>

<p>The researchers, including those at Stanford University, US, found that consuming the plant-based diet was related with changes in how a gene expressed itself, or gene behaviour, without changing the DNA itself. Specifically, they looked at DNA methylation, known to be able to "turn off" or "silence" a gene, thereby not allowing it to express itself.</p>

<p>Higher levels of DNA methylation is associated with a higher biological age. It is one of the epigenetic processes, which affect the behaviour of a gene by altering its environment.</p>

<p>For eight weeks, the team followed 21 pairs of adult identical twins -- one half of each pair consumed an omnivorous diet, including meat, eggs and dairy, while the other consumed a vegan one. Identical twins share a significant amount of their genetic makeup.</p>

<p>On average, the participants were aged 40 years and had a body mass index (BMI) in the overweight category. About 77 per cent of the group were women.</p>

<p>After eight weeks, the researchers observed a 'younger' heart, liver, inflammatory and metabolic system among the participants consuming the vegan diet. These changes were not seen in those eating the omnivorous diet.</p>

<p>However, the authors cautioned that the extent to which these changes could be attributed to their diets was unclear.</p>

<p>They noted that on average, the individuals on the vegan diet lost two kilograms more compared to those on the omnivorous diet.</p>

<p>The results suggest that the weight loss could have contributed to lowering of the biological age in the vegan group, the researchers said.</p>

<p>Reacting to the study, Tom Sanders, a professor emeritus of Nutrition and Dietetics at King's College London, and not involved in the study, said that the findings might be favourable for vegans in terms of ageing.</p>

<p>However, the diet can come with micronutrient deficiencies, which often take years to exert harmful effects, Sanders said.</p>

<p>"For example, unless a vegan diet is supplemented with vitamin B12 they develop vitamin B12 deficiency that causes chronic and often insidious damage to the nervous system," Sanders said.</p>

<p>Long-term studies of vegans also find adverse effects on bone density, probably caused by very low calcium and barely adequate protein intakes, Sanders said.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[In 2016, Steven Van de Velde was sentenced to four years in prison after admitting to three counts of rape involving a 12-year-old British girl.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dutch beach volleyball player Steven van de Velde, a convicted child rapist, was met with boos during his Olympic debut in Paris.</p>

<p>He was sentenced to four years in prison in 2016 after admitting to three counts of rape involving a 12-year-old British girl.</p>

<p>He met his victim on Facebook, travelled from Amsterdam to the UK in 2014, and raped her in Milton Keynes. Despite his sentence, he served only 12 months, sparking strong reactions from the public.</p>

<p>During the volleyball competition near the Eiffel Tower, Van de Velde and his teammate Matthew Immers played against the Italian pair Alex Ranghieri and Adrian Carambula.</p>

<p>When Van de Velde was introduced, he was greeted exclusively with boos.</p>

<p>The Dutch Olympic Committee maintains that Van de Velde has been successfully rehabilitated and deserves his place in the squad. However, Rape Crisis England &amp; Wales has called his inclusion at the Games "shocking."</p>

<p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has faced calls for an investigation into how a convicted child rapist has been allowed to compete at Paris 2024. Despite this, the IOC insists it has no plans to prevent the Dutchman from competing.</p>

<p>Dutch team spokesperson John van Vliet said the decision to shelter van de Velde was made by the National Olympic Committee and shared with the IOC. When asked if they were protecting a convicted child rapist, he responded, "We are protecting a convicted child rapist to do his sport as best as possible and for a tournament which he qualified for."</p>

<p>He recognised the gravity of sex-related crimes, saying they were a more significant concern than sport. Van de Velde has fulfilled all conditions to compete again after serving his sentence, he added.</p>

<p>Van de Velde is understood to be staying outside the Olympic Village at his request and will not participate in the usual post-match mixed zone interviews.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The attacks affected 800,000 travellers, but "in the end, 700,000 were able to make their trips" while 100,000 were hit by train cancellations.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France's high-speed train network was back to normal on Monday, three days after coordinated acts of sabotage heavily disrupted travel before the Olympics opening ceremony, Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete said.</p>

<p>It remains unclear who carried out the three arson attacks on strategic points of the rail infrastructure early Friday, or if they were deliberately timed to disrupt the Games' opening spectacle later that day.</p>

<p>The network gradually returned to normal over the weekend following repairs.</p>

<p>"This morning, all trains are running," Vergriete told RTL radio.</p>

<p>The attacks affected 800,000 travellers, but "in the end, 700,000 were able to make their trips" while 100,000 were hit by train cancellations, he said.</p>

<p>Since the attacks, 50 drones, 250 rail security agents and 1,000 maintenance workers were deployed to tighten security along the 28,000-kilometre (17,400-mile) high-speed train network, the minister added.</p>

<p>The incident will likely cost millions of euros, Vergriete said.</p>

<p>Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said authorities had "identified a certain number of profiles that could have committed" the acts of sabotage.</p>

<p>Far-left French anarchists have a history of targeting the train network with arson attacks.</p>

<p>The attacks were "deliberate, very precise, extremely well-targeted," Darmanin told France 2 television.</p>

<p>"This is the traditional type of action of the ultra-left," he said.</p>

<p>But asked whether the profiles that were identified were close to the far left, Darmanin said: "We must be cautious."</p>

<p>He said "The question is to know whether they were manipulated" or acted "for their own benefit".</p>

<p>"These are people who may be close to this movement," the interior minister added.</p>

<p>A statement signed by "an unexpected delegation" was sent to several news media outlets expressing support for the sabotage and criticising the Olympic Games as being a "celebration of nationalism" and the oppression of peoples by nation-states.</p>

<p>Darmanin said the statement was "something that resembles a claim", but "we must be careful because it could be an opportunistic claim".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Georgia man has been sentenced to life in prison for the 2019 murder of a woman he briefly met on a dating app, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/woman-unfriended-man-then-he-murdered-her-8683696"><em>The People</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fabiola Thomas, 39, was discovered in a bathtub by her roommate in June 2019 in her Roswell, Ga., apartment, according to reports from <em>WSB-TV, 11 Alive, </em>and <em>FOX 5 Atlanta</em>.</p>

<p>Antonio Wilson, then 38, was arrested and charged with her murder months later, as reported by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/man-charged-with-murder-death-roswell-woman-found-bathtub/nPIoQybamtbHNCtalSjIBM/"><em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em></a> and 11 Alive, citing Roswell Police.</p>

<p>The investigation began on June 8, 2019, when police received a frantic phone call from Ms Thomas' roommate, who reported finding her in the bathtub and feared "something bad had happened to her," according to FOX 5 Atlanta and 11 Alive.</p>

<p>Police found Ms Thomas unresponsive at the scene, and she was later pronounced dead at the hospital, as per FOX 5 Atlanta.</p>

<p>A medical examiner ruled her death a homicide several months later, according to FOX 5 Atlanta.</p>

<p>During the investigation, authorities discovered that Ms Thomas and Wilson had met on a dating app shortly before the murder, as reported by WSB-TV.</p>

<p>"Ms. Thomas did everything that you would think you should do," Assistant District Attorney Abigail Potter told WSB-TV. "She told her friends where she was going. She would only meet him in public places."</p>

<p>Prosecutors stated that when Ms Thomas expressed her desire to end the relationship, Wilson could not handle the rejection, according to WSB-TV.</p>

<p>In a text message sent before her death, Thomas asked Wilson to "stop claiming" her, authorities said.</p>

<p>"Keep your ring, I'm not your woman, never was, stop claiming me because I never claimed u," Ms Thomas wrote in a text, according to WSB-TV, citing prosecutors.</p>

<p>Senior Assistant District Attorney Nalda Charles told the outlet, that on the day she died, she 'unfriended'&nbsp;Wilson. It remains unclear which dating app they were using to communicate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wilson was arrested on October 25, 2019, after Ms Thomas' death was ruled a homicide. Five years later, following his trial, a jury took only 30 minutes to find him guilty, according to WSB-TV.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, July 23, a judge sentenced Wilson to life in prison without the possibility of parole for malice murder, as reported by WSB-TV from a Fulton County court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The foreign ministers of the Quad countries -- S Jaishankar, US' Antony Blinken, Japan's Yoko Kamikawa, and Australia's Penny Wong -- met in Tokyo.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a loud and clear message to China, the Quad on Monday reaffirmed its steadfast commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, vowing to work towards a region where no country dominates others and each state is free from coercion in all its forms.</p>

<p>At a meeting here, the foreign ministers of the Quad countries called for upholding the free and open rules-based international order and respecting the principle of freedom, human rights, democratic values, sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations.</p>

<p>Without directly naming China, the four foreign ministers expressed serious concern over the situation in the East and South China Seas and reiterated the Quad's strong opposition to any "unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion." The meeting was attended by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa and Australia's Penny Wong.</p>

<p>"All countries have a role in contributing to regional peace, stability, and prosperity while seeking a region in which no country dominates and no country is dominated, competition is managed responsibly, and each country is free from coercion in all its forms and can exercise its agency to determine its own future," the ministers said in the statement.</p>

<p>The Quad also vowed to work towards a free, open and prosperous Indo-Pacific, a region that has seen increasing Chinese military muscle-flexing in the last few years.</p>

<p>"We reaffirm the Quad's steadfast commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, which is inclusive and resilient, and are united in our commitment to upholding the free and open rules-based international order, with its strong support for the principle of freedom, human rights, the rule of law, democratic values, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and peaceful settlement of disputes," the ministers said.</p>

<p>The ministers also referred to increasing Chinese manoeuvres in the South China Sea, especially the "dangerous use" of coast guard and maritime militia vessels.</p>

<p>"We continue to express our serious concern about the militarisation of disputed features, and coercive and intimidating manoeuvres in the South China Sea, " the joint statement said.</p>

<p>"We also express our serious concern about the dangerous use of coast guard and maritime militia vessels, the increasing use of various kinds of dangerous manoeuvres, and efforts to disrupt other countries' offshore resource exploitation activities," it said.</p>

<p>The ministers emphasised the importance of adherence to international law, particularly as reflected in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), to address challenges to the global maritime rules-based order, including in the South and East China Seas.</p>

<p>The ministers also "unequivocally" condemned terrorism and violent extremism in all its forms including cross-border terrorism.</p>

<p>"We deplore the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), drones, tunnels and information and communication technologies by terrorists and terrorist entities," they said.</p>

<p>"We strongly reiterate our condemnation of terrorist attacks, including the 26/11 Mumbai and Pathankot attacks and call for bringing the perpetrators of these attacks to justice without delay," they added.</p>

<p>The Quad urged all countries to take immediate, sustained and irreversible action to prevent territory under their control from being used for terrorist purposes.</p>

<p>"We are committed to working together to promote accountability for the perpetrators of terrorist attacks and support implementation including through domestic designations of UN Security Council resolutions as they pertain to sanctions," the ministers said.</p>

<p>"We reiterate the call for concerted action against all UN-listed terrorist groups including Al-Qa'ida, ISIS/Daesh, Lashkar e-Tayyiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), and their proxy groups," they said.</p>

<p>The ministers said the Quad is committed to international cooperation and working together with our international and regional partners in a comprehensive and sustained manner to strengthen their capacity to prevent, detect and respond to threats posed by terrorism and violent extremism.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A United Airlines flight bound for Boston from Houston was forced to divert to Washington DC over a "biohazard" situation connected to a passenger that left crew members vomiting and other fliers onboard in distress.</p>

<p>The United Airlines flight UA2477 (Boeing 737-800) operating from Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport to Boston was diverted to the Dulles International Airport in Washington DC on July 28, the New York Post reported citing the airline.</p>

<p>The flight was cut short and forced to land at Dulles Airport, Washington DC to undergo a "deep clean", according to the airline.</p>

<p>The conversation between the captain and the air traffic control indicated a distressing situation in mid-air.</p>

<p>"I talked to the crew and it sounds like it's quite bad back there. The crew is vomiting, and passengers all around are asking for masks," a crew member was heard saying in audio from the flight as cited in the New York Post report.</p>

<p>The plane landed safely at Washington Dulles Airport, where none of the plane's 155 passengers or its six crew members required medical help, the US publication said.</p>

<p>"The aircraft is currently undergoing a deep clean and we are working to get customers on their way to Boston soon," the airline said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 30-year-old Florida man, who miraculously survived a 244-day coma after a motorcycle crash years ago, was killed in another accident last week, reported <a href="https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/news/local/drew-kohn-hit-and-killed-by-a-truck/77-c5f5a411-f7a0-4664-824a-e8b35f58eb33 ">WLTV News</a>.</p>

<p>Drew Kohn was 22 years old when he was involved in the crash in 2017, which left him with a traumatic brain injury and in a deep coma. At one point, his condition was so severe that doctors considered harvesting his organs, but his mother, Yolanda Osborne-Kohn, refused to give up hope.</p>

<p>Mr Kohn's mother recalled the miraculous moment her son first spoke to her after his long coma. "Yeah Mom, I'm OK," he said. "I love you, mom." After years of gruelling rehab, Mr Kohn managed to walk again, earning him the title of "modern-day miracle".</p>

<p>Mr Kohn eventually woke up after eight months and began the long recovery process. However, his life was cut short when he was struck and killed by a pickup truck on July 26.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, Mr Kohn was walking on Collins Road in Jacksonville around 5:30 am on Friday when the accident occurred. The driver, who claimed not to have seen the victim, pulled over and called 911, but Mr Kohn was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>

<p>His mother said she was grateful for the seven extra years she had with her son. "I'm grateful for the borrowed time I had with him," she said. "God honoured my request, and I'm not mad. I'm not angry. I'm at peace," she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Osborne-Kohn reflected on the moment she surrendered her son's fate to God, recalling a moment when she sat on his hospital bed and prayed, "Thy will be done."</p>

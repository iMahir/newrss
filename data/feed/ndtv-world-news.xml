       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 30-year-old Iranian dissident was gang-raped in Germany by four men believed to be loyalists of Iran's Islamic Republic, a report said. The assault, which took place on Saturday night at an abandoned brewery in the town of Iserlohn in North Rhine-Westphalia is being treated as a politically motivated crime, according to reports from <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/sexualdelikt-in-iserlohn-mutmassliche-taeter-sind-offenbar-regimetreue-iraner-a-9eb13a1f-a2ac-42f4-a71f-c03fcab97c1b">Der Spiegel </a>and other German media outlets.</p>

<p>The attackers, aged 24 to 46, were arrested shortly after the incident by local law enforcement, who deployed helicopters and multiple patrol units in a swift search of a nearby forest. One of the suspects sustained injuries while trying to escape capture. According to local media, witnesses had alerted authorities after hearing the victim's screams, leading to the discovery of the man in a severely abused state, tied up and in need of medical care.</p>

<p>German investigators have confirmed that the attack was not only violent but carried a specific political message. The victim, an Iranian refugee known for his opposition to Tehran's regime, was targeted with the intention of "sexual humiliation."</p>

<p>The attackers are reported to be staunch supporters of Iran's Islamic Republic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This latest attack follows a trend of Iranian dissidents being targeted on foreign soil. Earlier this year, an Iranian dissident in the Netherlands narrowly escaped an assassination attempt. Other incidents include the stabbing of Iran International presenter Pouria Zeraati in London and threats against Iranian journalists in the UK.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Mass expulsions? Political revenge? World peace? A new golden age? As Donald Trump vies for another term in the White House, the country is abuzz with speculation over how life might look with the ex-president back at the helm.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mass expulsions? Political revenge? World peace? A new golden age? As Donald Trump vies for another term in the White House, the country is abuzz with speculation over how life might look with the ex-president back at the helm.</p>

<p>Here are Trump's plans for the United States and the world, in five emblematic measures.</p>

<h2>Mass deportations</h2>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris's rival in November's election has pledged to launch the biggest deportation operation of illegal migrants in US history on his first day in office.</p>

<p>"We're going to get them out as fast as we can," he has said, accusing undocumented migrants of "poisoning the blood of our country."</p>

<p>The 78-year-old, known for his unfinished US-Mexico border wall project, has said he would be happy to "use the military" as part of the effort and would open detention camps to process targets for expulsion.</p>

<p>"On day one of my new term in office, I will sign an executive order making clear to federal agencies that under the correct interpretation of the law, going forward the future children of illegal aliens will not receive automatic US citizenship," he said in a campaign video.</p>

<p>He has confirmed he also plans to reinstate his ban on entries from several Muslim-majority countries, as a means of "keeping terrorists the hell out of our country."</p>

<h2>'Drill, baby, drill!'</h2>

<p>Trump slammed the door on the 2015 Paris climate accords during his first term, and his campaign has said he intends to end US participation again if reelected.</p>

<p>He told supporters at a rally earlier in the summer that he would "stop Biden's wasteful spending and rapidly terminate the green new scam" -- a reference to the funding committed by his successor to mitigating climate change.</p>

<p>"I will repeal crooked Joe Biden's insane electric vehicle mandate and we will 'drill, baby, drill,'" Trump said in Wisconsin, using an old Republican slogan.</p>

<p>"Energy costs will come down very quickly," he vowed. "In many cases we'll be cutting your energy costs in half."</p>

<h2>Crypto-a-go-go</h2>

<p>Trump has pledged to make the United States the "Bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world," and to put tech billionaire and right-wing conspiracy theorist Elon Musk in charge of a wide-ranging audit of governmental waste.</p>

<p>Trump also envisages tariffs of "more than 10 percent" on all imports. US companies -- and eventually their customers -- pay for import tariffs, not the companies exporting the goods.</p>

<p>He insists that the revenue collected will finance a "middle class, upper class, lower class, business class big tax cut."</p>

<p>Having waged a fierce trade war with China during his first term, he also plans to revoke the Asian giant's "most favored nation" status, granted to promote trade.</p>

<h2>Abortion ambiguity</h2>

<p>Trump never misses an opportunity to point out that it is partly thanks to him -- and his three conservative Supreme Court appointments -- that abortion rights have been considerably weakened in the United States.</p>

<p>But he is more ambiguous about the future of access to reproductive health care.</p>

<p>Insisting it should be an issue for the individual states, the Republican has balked at pushing a nationwide abortion ban, a commitment that would win him support from the religious right.</p>

<p>"You must follow your heart on this issue but remember, you must also win elections," he has said.</p>

<p>And he promised: "My Administration will be great for women and their reproductive rights."</p>

<h2>Ukraine war 'plan'</h2>

<p>Trump has been saying for months he could end the war in Ukraine within "24 hours," without explaining how.</p>

<p>Critics suggest his plan would involve pressuring Kyiv to cede territory illegally occupied by Russia in both 2014 and 2022.</p>

<p>"I have a very exacting plan how to stop Ukraine and Russia, And I have a certain idea -- maybe not a plan, but an idea -- for China," he said in an interview.</p>

<p>"But I can't give you those plans, because if I give you those plans, I'm not going to be able to use them, they'll be very unsuccessful. You know, part of it's surprise, right?"</p>

<p>Trump presented himself as an unconditional defender of Israel when the war with Hamas broke out. But he has since appeared more critical in his comments about the US ally's military offensive in Gaza, saying: "I'm not sure that I'm loving the way they're doing it."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A difficult operation to remove a small amount of radioactive debris from Japan's stricken Fukushima nuclear plant began Tuesday, after technical issues suspended an earlier attempt. Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) said in a statement that its "pilot extraction operation" had started. It will take about two weeks, according to the company.</p>

<p>The tiny sample will be studied for clues about conditions inside the reactors -- a crucial step towards decommissioning the Fukushima Daiichi plant.</p>

<p>Around 880 tons of extremely hazardous material remain 13 years after a tsunami caused by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake triggered one of the world's worst nuclear accidents.</p>

<p>Removing the debris from the reactors is regarded as the most daunting challenge in the decades-long decommissioning project.</p>

<p>TEPCO originally planned to start its first trial removal on August 22, aiming to collect just three grams (0.1 ounces) for analysis -- if the extraction process is successful.</p>

<p>But the company had to stop the work at a preliminary stage after detecting a problem involving the installation of the necessary equipment.</p>

<p>Three of the Fukushima plant's six reactors were operating when the tsunami hit on March 11, 2011, sending them into meltdown.</p>

<p>The debris within has radiation levels so high that TEPCO had to develop specialised robots able to function inside.</p>

<p>TEPCO deployed two mini-drones and a "snake-shaped robot" into one of the three nuclear reactors in February, as part of the preparations for the removal task.</p>

<p>Separately, last year Japan began releasing treated wastewater from the Fukushima plant into the Pacific Ocean, sparking a diplomatic row with China and Russia.</p>

<p>Both countries have banned Japanese seafood imports, although Tokyo insists the discharge is safe, a view backed by the UN atomic agency.</p>

<p>And in a TEPCO initiative to promote food from the Fukushima area, swanky London department store Harrods on Saturday began selling peaches that were grown in the region.</p>

<p>Fukushima peaches are renowned for their juicy, sweet taste -- but they aren't cheap, with one box of three reportedly going for 80 pounds ($100).</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Assuring Secretary-General Antonio Guterres of India's commitment to revitalising the global organisation, Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish presented his credentials to take over as the Permanent Representative.</p>

<p>Ambassador Harish hit the ground running, making the case before the Security Council soon after the ceremony on Monday for major troop-contributing countries to be actively involved in the decision-making process of peacekeeping operations.</p>

<p>Earlier, prepping for the assignment ahead which takes off with the summit starting on September 22 with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's participation, he had made a round of consultations with several diplomats on cooperating on issues that India shared with their countries.</p>

<p>In posts on X after presenting his credentials, Mr Harish wrote that he and&nbsp; Mr Guterres “agreed on the need to strengthen and reform multilateralism in both its political and economic dimensions to deal with contemporary challenges and harness new opportunities”.</p>

<p>He added that he assured him of India's commitment under PM Modi's “leadership to reformed multilateralism and revitalisation of the UN”.</p>

<p>Mr Harish met with Philemon Yang, who will become the president of the General Assembly this month. He assured the former prime minister of Cameroon of India's support in his new role.</p>

<p>Coming from his latest assignment as the ambassador to Germany, Mr Harish brings 34 years of diplomatic experience having represented India from Southeast Asia through the Middle East and Europe to the US.</p>

<p>He has special expertise in the issue currently consuming the UN, Gaza, as he served as India's representative to the Palestine Authority based in Gaza City and had also been deputed to work for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine.</p>

<p>His assignments included ambassador to Vietnam and postings in Houston, Riyadh, and Cairo, where he studied Arabic.</p>

<p>Mr Harish started at the UN on Thursday with a floral tribute to Mahatma Gandhi at his statue on the UN campus.</p>

<p>He followed that with meetings with General Assembly President Dennis Francis and Amandeep Singh Gill, the secretary-general's envoy on technology.</p>

<p>Francis posted on X that he was “grateful for India's continued support throughout my presidency”.</p>

<p>The next day, India's mission said he discussed “Special Strategic and Global Partnership” with Yamazaki Kazuyuki, the permanent representative of Japan, a member of G4, the group that advocates for expanding the Security Council's permanent membership.</p>

<p>He met Sergio Franca, the permanent representative of another G4 member, Brazil, who took over the presidency of the G20 group from India last year.</p>

<p>Osama Abdelkhalek, the permanent representative of Egypt which has a role in the Gaza peace process, also had a meeting with Harish and they “agreed to work closely in the UN”, according to an Indian Mission post on X.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congress leader and Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, took a jibe at the Bharatiya Janata Party with a veiled reference to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) stating that the ruling party doesn't understand that the country is for everyone, whereas for them whose headquarters are in Nagpur, only one ideology is important.</p>

<p>Interacting with the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-pm-narendra-modi-i-dont-hate-mr-modi-rahul-gandhis-latest-at-us-university-chat-6530361">Indian diaspora at an event</a> in Herndon, Virginia, the Congress leader made a reference to the different dishes on a food plate to highlight India's diversity. The LoP reiterated that India is a "union of states," adding that it means a union of different traditions and histories.</p>

<p>"In India, everything works together...if someone sits in front of Thali and says chawal (rice) is more important than Dal (pulses) and sabji (vegetable) is the least important, then what will happen? That's what BJP does," Rahul Gandhi said.</p>

<p>"BJP doesn't understand that this country is of everyone...India is a union. In the Constitution, it is written clearly... India that is Bharat is a union state. It means it is a union of languages, it's a union of traditions, a union of histories, music and dance...they (BJP) say it is not a union, it is different Only one ideology is important and its headquarters are in Nagpur. That is what the fight is about," he added.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-on-indians-in-us-says-youre-bridge-between-two-nations-6529750">Rahul Gandhi further alleged that the RSS</a> believes that certain states and communities are inferior to others.</p>

<p>"The RSS is saying that certain states, languages, religions and communities are inferior to others. This is what the fight is about. We are of the opinion that... all of you have your history, tradition and language. Every single one of them is as important as any other one. What would you do if somebody told you that you cannot speak Tamil? How would you feel? How would you react? That is the ideology of the RSS -- That Tamil, Marathi, Bengali, Manipuri- are all inferior languages," he said.</p>

<p>The Congress leader said, "It ends up in the polling booth, Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha. But the fight is about what type of India we are going to have. Are we going to have an India where people are allowed to believe what they want to believe?... Or we are going to have an India where only few people can decide what is going to happen."</p>

<p>Rahul Gandhi is on a three-day visit to the US. In his speech at Dallas, he termed the Indian diaspora in the US a "vital bridge" between two nations and stated that Dallas has provided a "fantastic start" to his US visit.</p>

<p>Mr Gandhi, who arrived in Dallas on Sunday, interacted with students and teachers at the University of Texas. He also addressed the members of the Indian diaspora in Dallas. He also visited Washington DC.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has dismissed concerns around Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Russia visit, saying that the US can't hold India to a loyalty test every five minutes.</p>

<p>Speaking at Indus X (India-United States Defence Acceleration Ecosystem), she categorised the India-US ties as enduring and bipartisan and stressed that whoever comes to the White House knows the importance of the relationship.</p>

<p>"Countries wish to, as India says, have strategic autonomy and I have no problem with that. But it is our (US and India's) deep interests that will ultimately lead to a stronger partnership," she added.</p>

<p>Rice, Director at the Hoover Institute at Stanford, called Russian military equipment "junk" and said PM Modi's Moscow visit won't lead to much on the defence side. This even as she indicated that the US believes it has been slow on stepping up military cooperation with India and lost some vital time and opportunity.</p>

<p>She also added that PM Modi was aware of the no-limits relationship between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and that it could pose a huge challenge to India.</p>

<p>Describing China as formidable rival for the US, Rice said the situation is graver than the Cold War since Moscow was a military giant but a technological and economic midget, whereas China has leveraged technology and is so well integrated into the global networks and supply chains that it is a tough situation to deal with.</p>

<p>Rice was instrumental in getting the Indo-US civil nuclear deal going under the George W Bush administration.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited both Russia and Ukraine in the last three months. He also spoke to Putin on August 27, shortly after his trip to Ukraine where he met President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>

<p>India has asserted it will support any <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-to-support-any-feasible-mutually-acceptable-solution-mea-on-russia-ukraine-war-6456803">feasible and mutually acceptable solution</a> or format that could restore peace between the two warring countries. Sources have said National Security Advisor <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/nsa-ajit-doval-to-visit-moscow-for-russia-ukraine-peace-talks-sources-6516112">Ajit Doval will visit Moscow</a> this week to hold discussions aimed at resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A Gaza civil defence official told AFP early Tuesday that "40 martyrs and 60 injured were recovered and transferred" to nearby hospitals following an attack inside the Al-Mawasi humanitarian zone in Khan Yunis.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaza's civil defence agency said Tuesday that an Israeli strike on a humanitarian zone in the south of the Palestinian territory killed 40 people and wounded 60 others, with the Israeli army saying it had targeted a Hamas command centre in the area.</p>

<p>The strike hit Al-Mawasi -- in Gaza's main southern city of Khan Yunis -- which was designated a safe zone by the Israeli military early in the war, with tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians seeking refuge there.</p>

<p>However, Israel's military has occasionally carried out operations in and around the area, including a strike in July that it said killed Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif, and which Gaza health authorities said killed more than 90 people.</p>

<p>Gaza civil defence official Mohammed Al-Mughair told AFP early Tuesday that "40 martyrs and 60 injured were recovered and transferred" to nearby hospitals following the overnight strike.</p>

<p>"Our crews are still working to recover 15 missing people as a result of targeting the tents of the displaced in Mawasi, Khan Yunis," Mughair added.</p>

<p>In a separate statement, civil defence spokesman Mahmoud Basal said that people sheltering in the camp had not been warned of the strike, adding a shortage of tools and equipment was hindering rescue operations.</p>

<p>"More than 20 to 40 tents were completely damaged," he said, adding the strike left behind "three deep craters".</p>

<p>"There are entire families who disappeared under the sand in the Mawasi Khan Yunis massacre."</p>

<p>The Israeli military said in a statement early Tuesday that its aircraft had "struck significant Hamas terrorists who were operating within a command and control center embedded inside the Humanitarian Area in Khan Yunis".</p>

<p>"The terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip continue to systematically abuse civilian and humanitarian infrastructure, including the designated Humanitarian Area, to carry out terrorist activity against the State of Israel and IDF troops," it added.</p>

<p>Hamas said in a statement on Tuesday that claims its fighters were present at the scene of the strike were "a blatant lie".</p>

<p>Over the course of the war, Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields, an accusation the group denies.</p>

<h2><strong>Shrinking safe zone</strong></h2>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, including some hostages killed in captivity, official Israeli figures show.</p>

<p>Militants seized 251 hostages during the attack, 97 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive in the Gaza Strip has so far killed at least 40,988 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.</p>

<p>The UN human rights office says most of the dead are women and children.</p>

<p>The vast majority of Gaza's 2.4 million people have been displaced at least once during nearly a year of war, according to the United Nations.</p>

<p>From 1,200 inhabitants per square kilometre before the war, the Al-Mawasi humanitarian zone now houses "between 30,000 and 34,000 people per square kilometre", and its protected area shrank from 50 square kilometres to 41, the UN has calculated.</p>

<p>The United States, Qatar and Egypt have been mediating in efforts to forge a ceasefire and hostage-prisoner exchange deal between Israel and Hamas, but talks remain stalled.</p>

<p>Hamas is demanding a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza as part of any deal, but Israel insists troops must remain along the Gaza-Egypt border.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaking at Washington DC metro area on Monday (local time), Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said that the Indians in the US are the bridge between the two countries.</p>

<p>The Congress leader said that the Indian diaspora has two identities- that of the US and India. They can transfer the US and Indian ideas back and forth.</p>

<p>"You are the bridge between these two great unions of states. And you make us very proud because we understand that what it meant for you to come here. We understand the difficulties and struggles you faced. But when you came here, you came with humility, respect and affection... You did not say that United States is inferior to us, or that you hate the United States... You are proud of India and proud of the United States," he said.</p>

<p>The Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha said that the Congress's message is to spread love, not hatred.</p>

<p>"As per the BJP, you cannot have two identities. You cannot be an Indian, and at the same time an American. That is what the fight is about... We are saying that don't spread hatred, spread love. Don't be arrogant, be humble. Don't disrespect people, communities, religions, traditions, languages... If you don't do this, you will never be successful... You will take American ideas and values back home and will bring Indian values, traditions and ideas to the United States. You will help both states by doing this," he said.</p>

<p>He alleged that the RSS does not understand India.</p>

<p>"And the problem is, these people don't understand India... India is called a union of states. In the Constitution it is written clearly- India, that is Bharat, is a union of states. It means it is a union of languages, traditions, histories, music, or dance," he said.</p>

<p>Rahul Gandhi alleged that the RSS believes that certain states and communities are inferior to others.</p>

<p>"The RSS is saying that certain states, languages, religions and communities are inferior to others. This is what the fight is about. We are of the opinion that... all of you have your history, tradition and language. Every single one of them is as important as any other one. What would you do if somebody told you that you cannot speak Tamil? How would you feel? How would you react? That is the ideology of the RSS- That Tamil, Marathi, Bengali, Manipuri- are all inferior languages. It ends up in the polling booth, Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha. But the fight is about what type of India we are going to have. Are we going to have an India where people are allowed to believe what they want to believe?... Or we are going to have an India where only few people can decide what is going to happen," the Congress leader said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US woman senator, who has been accused of forcing her former chief of staff to perform sexual acts on her, had introduced a bill against sexual assault in the California Senate just months after firing him for allegedly refusing her advances.</p>

<p>In a video posted on X, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/california-state-senator-used-her-male-chief-of-staff-as-sex-slave-claims-lawsuit-6526899">Senator Marie Alvarado-Gil </a>talked of the prevalence of sexual assault and violence in the US while seeking support for her bill.</p>

<p>"April is National #SexualAssaultAwarenessMonth, and I am leading the charge with Senate Bill 268 - my bill will address a critical gap in the state's criminal justice system by reclassifying the rape of an intoxicated person as a violent felony," she wrote.</p>

— Senator Marie Alvarado-Gil (@AlvaradoGilSD4) <a href="https://twitter.com/AlvaradoGilSD4/status/1778826051487207653?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 12, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p></p>

<p>In the video, Alvarado-Gil said an American is sexually assaulted every 73 seconds and the crime affects people of all genders and sexuality.</p>

<p>"If you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, please know that it is not your fault," she said in the video, asking citizens to help "end sexual violence".</p>

<p>The bill which sought to make rape of an intoxicated person a violent felony and sought stricter punishment for sex crimes was passed in the senate on August 31.</p>

<h2><strong>"Sexual quid pro quo"</strong></h2>

<p>Alvarado-Gil's former chief of staff, Chad Condit, has alleged that she maintained a "sexual quid pro quo relationship" with him that left him injured in the back and hip.</p>

<p>Mr Condit started working for Alvarado-Gil when she contested for Senate in 2022 and was appointed chief of staff when she was elected.</p>

<p>He alleged that the senator pressured him into performing sex acts on her while they went on work trips over the years to protect his job.</p>

<p>On one such occasion last year, Condit alleges, he suffered a severe back injury when he was forced to "twist and contort" as he performed oral sex on her in a car. The act left him with three herniated discs and a collapsed hip, the suit alleges.</p>

<p>When Alvarado-Gil continued to seek sexual favours, he used the back injury as an excuse to reject her advances which made her retaliate, he alleges. She issued a disciplinary letter that accused him of inappropriate behavior.</p>

<h2><strong>"Erratic, controlling" boss</strong></h2>

<p>After he repeatedly turned down her sexual advances, Condit alleges he was fired in December. He told her he was undergoing back surgery for the injuries he sustained, he added.</p>

<p>"This was a sex-based quid pro quo relationship of unwelcome advances and sexual behaviors coupled with punishment and flexing of power," he says in the lawsuit.</p>

<p>In the lawsuit, Mr Condit details his harrowing ordeal trying to navigate a professional relationship marred by "sexually dominating abuse of authority and power" by an "erratic" and "controlling" boss.</p>

<p>Alvardo-Gil's lawyer has rubbished the allegations and hit back at the former aide, calling him "disgruntled".</p>

<p>"A disgruntled former employee has fabricated an outlandish story, presented without evidence, to get a payday. We expect that the senator will be fully cleared of any wrongdoing of these bogus, financially motivated claims," he told the New York Post.</p>

<p>Alvarado-Gil made the switch from her Democratic party to the Republican party last month after claiming that the party had become unrecognisable under its current leadership.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stars of the screen are mourning the death of James Earl Jones, the voice of "Star Wars" villain Darth Vader, on Monday at the age of 93.</p>

<p>Jones, who also voiced King Mufasa in Disney's animated feature "The Lion King," had a prolific and varied career.</p>

<p>Over six decades he worked with some of the greatest figures in cinema and theater, including Stanley Kubrick in his 1964 Cold War satire "Dr Strangelove."</p>

<p>He also had roles in the Arnold Schwarzenegger film "Conan The Barbarian" and the 1989 Kevin Costner movie "Field of Dreams."</p>

<p>But it was for his role as one of cinema's most famous villains that he became most widely known.</p>

<p>While Darth Vader's immense physicality was the result of the towering British actor David Prowse, the sinister voice that appeared to emanate from inside the reconstructed man-in-a-mask was that of Jones.</p>

<p>And it was Jones who gave the "Star Wars" franchise some of its most memorable lines, including when he reveals to Luke Skywalker –- played by a young Mark Hamill -– "I am your father."</p>

<p>Hamill took to social media on Monday to share news of Jones' death, writing simply: "#RIP dad" with a broken heart emoji.</p>

<p>"Rustin" star Coleman Domingo wrote on social media that Jones was "a master of our craft."</p>

<p>"We stand on your shoulders. Rest now. You gave us your best."</p>

<p>Lydia Cornell, whose 1982 debut "Bloodtide," was opposite Jones, said: "Oh no!! I can't believe it!! I thought he was going to live forever."</p>

<p>"Adored working with him. Such a generous spirit, and so humble. Taught me the power of stillness and using my voice."</p>

<p>"Selma" Director Ava DuVernay posted images of Jones, accompanied by a heartfelt message.</p>

<p>"Thank you for showing us ourselves. Our complicated selves, our dignified selves, our smiles, our pain. A job well done. A gift beautifully shared. Bless you as you journey on."</p>

<p>Alongside a clip of Jones' 1974 film, "Claudine," she urged fans to seek it out if they have never seen it.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jones crying in a scene of this film is one of the most exquisite cinematic images of a Black man I've ever seen. Don't miss it. He gave us so much," she wrote.</p>

<p>"The Help" star Octavia Spencer posted a black and white photograph of Jones, alongside a tribute that nodded to his indelible role in "Star Wars."</p>

<p>"Legendary doesn't even begin to describe his iconic roles and impact on cinema forever," she wrote.</p>

<p>"His voice and talent will be remembered always. Sending love to his family, friends and countless fans in all the galaxies, far, far away."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's Foreign Ministry Spokesman Nasser Kanaani has said that diplomatic opportunities still exist to revive the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers.</p>

<p>Kanaani stated on Monday that the path to an agreement remains open if other involved parties show a practical commitment to fulfilling their obligations, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>"We believe that the diplomatic opportunity still exists for all parties, especially those that refrained from implementing the agreement," Kanaani told reporters in Tehran.</p>

<p>He noted that Iran's Foreign Minister Seyyed Abbas Araghchi recently had a "good phone conversation" with the European Union (EU)'s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, expressing optimism about potential talks between Iran and the EU.</p>

<p>Iran signed the nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), with several major countries in 2015. The agreement imposed restrictions on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.</p>

<p>However, the US government under former President Donald Trump withdrew from the agreement in May 2018, reinstating sanctions and prompting Iran to scale back some of its nuclear commitments.</p>

<p>Efforts to revive the JCPOA began in April 2021 in Vienna, but no significant progress has been reported since the latest round of talks in August 2022.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anthony Albanese, the Prime Minister of Australia, said that they will legislate a minimum age for social media to keep children safe.</p>

<p>Albanese said that it's about supporting parents and keeping kids safe.</p>

<p>In a post on X, he said, "We'll legislate a minimum age for social media to keep children safe."</p>

<p></p>

<p>On August 21 last year, the University of Michigan Health C.S. Mott Children's Hospital National Poll on Children's Health, more than half of parents rank mental health issues as the top health concern for their children and teens.</p>

<p>Overall, mental health and technology use topped this year's top ten list of parent worries about health-related issues for children in the United States, surpassing childhood obesity, which parents ranked as the top children's health issue a decade ago.</p>

<p>"Parents still view problems directly impacting physical health, including unhealthy eating and obesity, as important children's health issues. But these have been overtaken by concerns about mental health, social media and screen time," said Mott Poll co-director and Mott pediatrician Susan Woolford, MD, MPH.</p>

<p>Two-thirds of parents are worried about children's increased time on devices, including overall screen time and use of social media, taking the No.1 and No.2 spots on the list of children's health concerns this year, according to the nationally representative poll.</p>

<p>"Children are using digital devices and social media at younger ages, and parents may struggle with how to appropriately monitor use to prevent negative impacts on safety, self-esteem, social connections and habits that may interfere with sleep and other areas of health," Woolford said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The iPhone 16, starting at $799, comes in two sizes -- 6.1 inches and 6.7 inches. The phones are powered by the new A18 chips, which feature a 16-core neural engine designed for generative AI-linked tasks and Apple Intelligence.</p>

<p>The phones also come with a customizable action button, allowing users to perform a variety of functions such as recording voice memo, identifying songs, and translating phrases.</p>

<p>APPLE WATCH UPGRADES</p>

<p>Apple unveiled its latest Watch Series 10 starting at $399, which the company claims is its thinnest and fastest charging watch ever.</p>

<p>The Series 10 will be powered by Apple's new S10 chip, which includes a four-core neural engine that will allow machine learning activities and power features such as double tapping on device, Siri dictation, along with crash and fall detection.</p>

<p>Apple also highlighted the health-linked features of its watch, such as sleep apnea detection. The watch will monitor a new metric during sleep called breathing disturbances and will notify users if they display signs of sleep apnea.</p>

<p>AIRPOD MODELS</p>

<p>Apple's AirPods 4, powered by a new custom H2 chip, start at $129 and come with improved audio quality and personalized spatial audio.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple on Monday announced a new iPhone built for generative artificial intelligence as it seeks to boost sales and show it is keeping up in the technology race.</p>

<p>The tech giant has a lot riding on what would be the iPhone 16 and will hope that customers are enticed to buy the latest models, attracted by new AI powers.</p>

<p>"We are thrilled to introduce the first iPhones designed from the ground up for Apple Intelligence and its breakthrough capabilities," Apple chief executive Tim Cook said at an event at the iPhone-maker's Silicon Valley headquarters.</p>

<p>With $39 billion in sales last quarter, the iPhone counts for roughly 60 percent of Apple's revenue, and remains the main entryway to the company's services, such as the App Store or Apple TV, which are becoming a growing part of its business.</p>

<p>Apple is only just coming out of a long sales slump as users increasingly stick with older models longer.</p>

<p>"This iPhone 16 release is all about Apple Intelligence and the unleashing of the consumer AI Revolution through Cupertino," Wedbust analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors, referring to Apple's home city.</p>

<p>"In essence Cupertino will be the gatekeeper of the consumer AI Revolution."</p>

<p>"Apple Intelligence" is a new suite of software features for all devices that was announced in June at the company's annual developers conference, where it also announced a partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.</p>

<p>"For years, artificial intelligence and machine learning have been essential in delivering so many of the features and experiences you love," Cook said.</p>

<p>"In June, we launched Apple Intelligence, our powerful new personal intelligence system, which will have an incredible impact."</p>

<p>In the short-term, these include AI-infused image editing, translation, and small, creative touches in messaging, but not more ambitious breakthroughs promised by other AI players, such as OpenAI or Google.</p>

<p>Ives expects software makers to begin cranking out apps and services tuned with generative AI capabilities, fueling sales of iPhones.</p>

<p>Apple is expected to tailor new AirPod ear buds and smart watches to take advantage of AI capabilities and Siri digital assistant.</p>

<p>The company announced new models of Apple Watch and AirPods at the event.</p>

<p>By adding AI capabilities, Apple is looking to "shake that expectation" that iPhone launches are "just steady improvements in hardware and software," said Techsponential analyst Avi Greengart.</p>

<p>Longer term, Apple could dramatically change the iPhone experience with a "super-powered Siri" working across all the apps, Greengart said.</p>

<p><strong>Pixel power</strong></p>

<p>Apple's announcement closely follows Google, which last month unveiled AI-infused Pixel 9 smartphones, its challenge to the iPhone.</p>

<p>Pixels account for a tiny sliver of the global smartphone market dominated by Samsung and Apple, but Google argued its new line is a chance to answer what -- after all the hype -- AI can actually do for customers.</p>

<p>"There have been so many promises, so many 'coming soons,' and not enough real world helpfulness when it comes to AI -- which is why today we're getting real," Google senior vice president of devices Rick Osterloh said at the Pixel 9 launch.</p>

<p>Samsung has also showcased AI across a range of its consumer electronic products as it looks to extend its leadership in global smartphone sales.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Canadian fashion mogul Peter Nygard was sentenced to 11 years in prison on Monday after being convicted of four counts of sexual assault in attacks on women in his Toronto office building that in some cases date back for decades.</p>

<p>The 11-year sentence is reduced to take into account time he has already spent behind bars. Nygard has about 6.7 years left to serve and will be eligible for full parole after one-third of that.</p>

<p>Nygard, 83, was found guilty by a Toronto jury on four counts of sexual assault last November. He was acquitted of a fifth count of sexual assault and one count of forcible confinement.</p>

<p>During the six-week trial, the Ontario Superior Court heard testimony from five complainants who said during a period between the late 1980s to around 2005 Nygard had attacked them in a private bedroom suite on the top floor of the building.</p>

<p>Canadian police arrested Nygard in late 2020 at the request of the United States, where he was accused of using his businesses to lure women and girls to sexually gratify himself and his associates.</p>

<p>Toronto police laid their own charges against him about a year later. Nygard also faces charges of sexual assault and forcible confinement in Manitoba and Quebec.</p>

<p>He is fighting extradition to the U.S. where he faces federal charges in New York for nine offences including conspiracy to commit racketeering, transportation of a minor for purpose of prostitution, and sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion.</p>

<p>Born in Finland, Nygard grew up in the Canadian province of Manitoba, eventually running his namesake clothing company and becoming one of the wealthiest people in the country.</p>

<p>"Peter Nygard is a sexual predator. He is also a Canadian success story gone very wrong," Justice Robert Goldstein said Monday.</p>

<p>"He used his wealth and his power to commit four sexual assaults."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Kate, Britain's Princess of Wales, said on Monday she had finished her course of preventative chemotherapy for cancer and would be carrying out a handful of public engagements later this year, but said her path to full recovery would be long.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kate, Britain's Princess of Wales, said on Monday she had finished her course of preventative chemotherapy for cancer, saying the treatment had given her a new perspective and made her grateful for "simply loving and being loved".</p>

<p>Kate, 42, wife of heir-to-the-throne Prince William, underwent major abdominal surgery in January which revealed the presence of cancer and has been undergoing treatment since then.</p>

<p>In a personal message accompanying a unique video of her with her husband and their three young children, Princes George and Louis and Princess Charlotte, Kate said she would be carrying out a handful of public engagements later this year, but said her path to full recovery would be long.</p>

<p>"As the summer comes to an end, I cannot tell you what a relief it is to have finally completed my chemotherapy treatment," she said in her message.</p>

<p>"The last nine months have been incredibly tough for us as a family. Life as you know it can change in an instant and we have had to find a way to navigate the stormy waters and road unknown."</p>

<p>Kate made her first public appearance since her health issues emerged in June at the annual military parade to mark the official birthday of King Charles. In July, she appeared at the Wimbledon tennis championships.</p>

<p>Her office, Kensington Palace, has declined to give any further details about the type of cancer or other specifics about her treatment, other than to say the preventative chemotherapy began in February.</p>

<p><strong>'SCARY'</strong></p>

<p>"The cancer journey is complex, scary and unpredictable for everyone, especially those closest to you," she said.</p>

<p>"With humility, it also brings you face to face with your own vulnerabilities in a way you have never considered before, and with that, a new perspective on everything.</p>

<p>"This time has above all reminded William and me to reflect and be grateful for the simple yet important things in life, which so many of us often take for granted. Of simply loving and being loved."</p>

<p>In the video, which was filmed in Norfolk, eastern England last month, the princess looked well and healthy.</p>

<p>The film showed the family walking through woods, carrying a cricket bat and ball, and Kate lying on a beach next to William. In other footage she was shown pushing Louis on a swing and being joined by her parents as they played a board game.</p>

<p>She and William were grateful for the global messages of support, she said, adding she was looking forward to returning to public duties when she was able, although her programme for the remainder of the year will remain light.</p>

<p>"Doing what I can to stay cancer free is now my focus. Although I have finished chemotherapy, my path to healing and full recovery is long and I must continue to take each day as it comes," said the princess, often referred to by her maiden name Kate Middleton.</p>

<p>"Despite all that has gone before, I enter this new phase of recovery with a renewed sense of hope and appreciation of life ... To all those who are continuing their own cancer journey - I remain with you, side by side, hand in hand. Out of darkness, can come light, so let that light shine bright."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi today visited Rajghat in New Delhi to pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi and planted a tree sapling, making him the third generation leader from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to plant a sapling at Rajghat.</p>

<p>He planted an Amaltas (Cassia Fistula) sapling as part of a unique tradition which previous leaders from the UAE have also followed.</p>

<p>In 1992, Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the founding father of the UAE, had also planted an Amaltas sapling during his visit to India.</p>

<p>In 2016, his son, Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the current President of UAE, continued this tradition by planting a Molshri (Mimusops Elengi) sapling.</p>

<p>This marks the first time in the history of Rajghat that three generations of leaders from a single nation have planted trees honouring the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi, signifying the deep-rooted and growing relationship between India and the UAE.</p>

<p>Crown Prince Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan arrived in New Delhi on Monday on his first official visit to India.</p>

<p>He met Prime Minister Narendra Modi today at the Hyderabad House in New Delhi. The two leaders signed multiple pacts on nuclear energy, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), oil, and food.</p>

<p>The Crown Prince later called on President Droupadi Murmu at the Rashtrapati Bhawan. "The President expressed satisfaction that during the Crown Prince's visit, India and UAE have further expanded the historic yet forward looking partnership through several agreements in new areas of cooperation," the President of India wrote on X.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The new school year in the Palestinian territories officially began on Monday, with all schools in Gaza shut after 11 months of war and no sign of a ceasefire.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new school year in the Palestinian territories officially began on Monday, with all schools in Gaza shut after 11 months of war and no sign of a ceasefire.</p>

<p>As fighting continued, Israel announced new orders to residents of the north Gaza Strip to leave their homes, in response to rockets fired into Israel.</p>

<p>Umm Zaki's son Moataz, 15, was supposed to begin 10th grade. Instead he woke up in their tent in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza and was sent to fetch a container of water from more than a kilometre away.</p>

<p>"Usually, such a day would be a day of celebration, seeing the children in the new uniform, going to school, and dreaming of becoming doctors and engineers. Today all we hope is that the war ends before we lose any of them," the mother of five told Reuters by text message.</p>

<p>The Palestinian Education Ministry said all Gaza schools were shut and 90% of them had been destroyed or damaged in Israel's assault on the territory, launched after Hamas gunmen attacked Israeli towns in October last year.</p>

<p>The U.N. Palestinian aid agency UNRWA, which runs around half of Gaza's schools, has turned as many of them as it can into emergency shelters housing thousands of displaced families.</p>

<p>"The longer the children stay out of school the more difficult it is for them to catch up on their lost learning and the more prone they are to becoming a lost generation, falling prey to exploitation including child marriage, child labour, and recruitment into armed groups," UNRWA Director of Communications Juliette Touma told Reuters.</p>

<p>In addition to the 625,000 Gazans already registered for school who would be missing classes, another 58,000 six-year-olds should have registered to start first grade this year, the education ministry said.</p>

<p>Last month, UNRWA launched a back-to-learning programme in 45 of its shelters, with teachers setting up games, drama, arts, music and sports activities to help with children's mental health.</p>

<p><strong>'THE SPECIFIED AREA HAS BEEN WARNED'</strong></p>

<p>Nearly all of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been forced from their homes at least once, and some have had to flee as many as 10 times.</p>

<p>In the latest evacuation order, Israel told residents of an area in the northern Gaza Strip they must leave their homes, following the firing of rockets into southern Israel the previous day.</p>

<p>"To all those in the specified area. Terrorist organisations are once again firing rockets at the State of Israel and carrying out terrorist acts from this area. The specified area has been warned many times in the past. The specified area is considered a dangerous combat zone," an Israeli military spokesperson said in Arabic on X.</p>

<p>The United Nations urged Palestinians in the northern Gaza Strip to attend medical facilities to get children under the age of 10 years old vaccinated against polio. Limited pauses in fighting have been held to allow the vaccination campaign, which aims to reach 640,000 children in Gaza after the territory's first polio case in around 25 years.</p>

<p>U.N. officials said the campaign in the southern and central Gaza Strip had so far reached more than half of the children there needing the drops. A second round of vaccination will be required four weeks after the first.</p>

<p>Later on Monday, Touma said 450,000 of the children targeted with the campaign were vaccinated.</p>

<p>"Tuesday is the hardest part when we roll out the campaign in the north. Hopefully, that will work so we complete the first stage of the campaign The second and final stage is planned for the end of the month when we have to do all of this all over again," said Touma.</p>

<p>Health officials said on Monday two separate Israeli airstrikes had killed seven people in central Gaza, while another strike killed one man in Khan Younis further south.</p>

<p>The armed wings of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad said they fought against Israeli forces in several areas across the Gaza Strip with anti-tank rockets and mortar fire.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said forces continued to dismantle military infrastructure and killed dozens of militants in the past days, including senior Hamas and Islamic Jihad commanders.</p>

<p>The war was triggered on Oct. 7 when the Hamas group that ran Gaza attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's subsequent assault on Gaza has killed more than 40,900 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry.</p>

<p>The two warring sides each blame the other for the failure so far to reach a ceasefire that would end the fighting and see the release of hostages.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

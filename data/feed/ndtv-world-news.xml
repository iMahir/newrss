       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A student at the Arizona State University was hospitalised after being stabbed several times by a classmate. Mara Daffron, 19, was attacked by Kaci Sloan, also 19, who reportedly chose her as an "easier target," reported The New York Post.</p>

<p>This occurred last week, when Sloan, seated in the classroom, suddenly lunged at Daffron and stabbed her twice. Sloan selected Daffron from among two potential victims, believing her to be an easier attack, according to 12 News.</p>

<p>"Kaci Sloan was immediately detained and arrested on suspicion of first-degree attempted murder; aggravated assault with a deadly weapon; interfering with an educational institution; and disorderly conduct. She is being held on a $250,000 cash-only bond," PEOPLE magazine quoted an ASU spokesperson as saying.</p>

<p>Daffron was rushed to hospital, where she underwent surgery for non-life-threatening injuries, said police. She is now recovering, with her family sharing updates about her condition.</p>

<p>Sloan has admitted that she "came to class to hurt somebody" and had been planning the attack since the previous night prior, court documents revealed. The planning included placing the knife that she used in her backpack.</p>

<p>She told the cops she knew the victim's first name and had shared only one class with her this semester.</p>

<p>Daffron reportedly had no idea why she was targeted, nor did she know her attacker prior to the incident.</p>

<p>Her family and neighbours have organised a GoFundMe campaign to assist them during this challenging time.</p>

<p>"We know Mara will come out stronger than ever from this unimaginable attack. We thank everyone who is able to contribute! We will share more updates as we receive them from their family," the GoFundMe campaign states.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Children's lives in the UK are changing.</p>

<p>They are <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/children-vitamins-diet-food-poverty-babies-b2564470.html">becoming shorter</a> in height. More of them are <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9209/">going hungry</a> than they were a few years ago. Recently, more <a href="https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/news/2024/number-of-births-continues-to-fall#:%7E:text=The%20infant%20death%20rate%20was,the%20final%20quarter%20of%202023.">have died</a> <a href="https://www.ncmd.info/publications/child-death-data-2023/">each year</a> than they did a few years ago. Increased poverty, more destitution and the <a href="https://www.bma.org.uk/what-we-do/population-health/addressing-social-determinants-that-influence-health/cutting-away-at-our-children-s-futures-how-austerity-is-affecting-the-health-of-children-young-people-and-families">effects of ongoing austerity</a> are the clear culprits.</p>

<p>But why did this happen to our children? This rise in child poverty is a change that has not been found to have occurred to the same extent anywhere else in the world, among all the places that the United Nations measures in the same way.<br />

This graph tells a story of hope and success. In much of Eastern Europe, child poverty has fallen by between as much as a third – and often at least a quarter – in a mere seven years.</p>

<p>But it also shows that child poverty has risen the most in the UK. The poorest fifth of households in the UK are <a href="https://www.dannydorling.org/books/shatterednation/slides_all_files/page5-1053-full.html">poorer than the poorest fifth</a> in most of Eastern Europe. For many people in the UK, this will come as a surprise. Some will refuse to believe it can be this bad.</p>

<p>The evidence for this poverty is seen in the declining heights of five-year-olds since 2010.<br />

A 5-year-old in 1990 would have been born in 1985 and their height influenced mostly by nutrition in the years 1985–1990. Those were hard years for the UK: mass poverty resulting from <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/26/newsid_2506000/2506335.stm">over three million people being out of work</a> in the early 1980s. But the average height of children was still increasing.</p>

<p>It was not until 2010, for those children who had lived between 2005 and 2010, that we first saw heights plateau and then fall, coinciding with the post-2010 austerity years.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://dannydorling.org/books/sevenchildren">forthcoming book</a> attempts to make sense of what has happened to the UK: why, in 2024, it is not merely one of the countries in Europe with a high rate of child poverty, but the one country above all others that the UN has singled out as having had the greatest rises in child poverty among all those it surveyed.</p>

<h2>Seven children</h2>

<p>To try to understand more about children's lives in the UK, I constructed <a href="http://dannydorling.org/books/sevenchildren">seven typical children</a>. I divided all 14 million children living in the UK into seven groups of 2 million, according to the income of their families in 2018 and 2019. I then chose the middle child of each 2 million. I next looked at what had happened to those families between 2018 and 2024.</p>

<p>The graph below shows the annual income of each of <a href="https://www.dannydorling.org/books/sevenchildren">the seven households the children were drawn from</a>.</p>

<p><br />
The first thing to note is just how incredibly well-off the children are who are better-off than our <a href="https://www.dannydorling.org/books/sevenchildren">seven typical children</a>.</p>

<p>Some 6% of all children in the UK live in households richer than the best-off typical child <a href="https://www.dannydorling.org/books/sevenchildren/page-7/statistics.html">in my analysis</a>. Those 6% of children, the best-off children of all, live in families that each year receive and spend <a href="https://www.dannydorling.org/books/sevenchildren/page-7/statistics.html">a third of all the income</a> in the UK.</p>

<p>These 6% are not typical, and neither are the 6% poorest: those most destitute, those whose families are most likely to use food banks. If you pick seven typical children, equally spaced out across the income scale, then these extremes are not part of what you see.</p>

<p>But four of our <a href="https://www.dannydorling.org/books/sevenchildren">typical seven children</a> now live lives that most better-off people would consider to be in poverty. The other three are hardly well-off.</p>

<p>The least well-off are in families struggling to pay bills and making sacrifices others do not have to think about. For instance, whether to save £10 a month, or have insurance against the effects of flood, fire or theft. Increasingly often they cannot afford both.</p>

<p>But even the most well-off of our seven children lives in a family that worries about paying for an annual holiday. That is rare among the most affluent two million families, but possible.</p>

<p>The UK in 2024 demonstrates to the world what living with high inequality means in a once affluent country. It means a few using up far more resources than the vast majority of other children, such as having access to many more school teachers – per child – as compared to the rest, better food, better shelter, more warmth, more toys, better material everything; often more than you might think any child needed.</p>

<p>In future, almost all our children will tell <a href="https://www.dannydorling.org/books/sevenchildren">their stories of growing up in the UK</a> of the 2020s and – hopefully – what changed to make things better. It is hard to imagine them becoming much worse.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

<p>The Middle East is once again on a boil. Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah has been killed in a strike on Beirut, the Israeli military said today. The flare-up this time is truly alarming and could be apocalyptic in its potential.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Beginning Of The Recent Strikes</strong></h2>

<p>On September 17-18, the world was astonished by what seemed to be back-to-back attacks in Lebanon involving exploding pagers and walkie-talkies belonging mostly to the Iran-backed Hezbollah. The attacks were allegedly an Israeli operation. &nbsp;Almost 30 people lost their lives, with thousands reported injured. Soon after, Israel launched airstrikes on settlements in southern and eastern Lebanon in what it called 'targeted assassinations' to eliminate Hezbollah leaders and operatives. According to estimates from the Lebanese health ministry, more than 1,000 people have died in these strikes, with more than 5,000 injured. Many of them are civilians given how Hezbollah is well-integrated into the local population. A number of other Hezbollah leaders, like Ibrahim Aqil, have been confirmed dead.</p>

<p>To be fair, it was Hezbollah that had begun the attacks on northern &nbsp;Israel in response to Hamas's multipronged strikes in Israel on October 7 last year. Hezbollah's rationale was to open a second front against Israel and force it to declare a ceasefire with Hamas in Gaza.&nbsp;Hundreds of thousands of Israelis in the north of the country have been displaced by Hezbollah's assault.</p>

<h2><strong>The Destruction In Gaza</strong></h2>

<p>Almost a year has passed since the war in Gaza started. Large parts of the enclave have been flattened, much of Hamas degraded, and many of its leaders killed. The overall death toll stands at 40,000; at least a third of them are women and children. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In May this year, Israel launched relentless air strikes in Rafah and followed it up with a ground incursion. Yet, it has not been able to realise its objective of freeing all hostages taken captive by Hamas on October 7. While some have been released, others have died in captivity, and many others continue to be held hostage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For a large part, Israel's retaliation against Hezbollah had been calculated as it wanted to preempt any large-scale conflagration. However, since July end, when Hezbollah strikes on Israel killed 12 children, its attacks have steadily intensified. Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, has said that what Israel was doing was conducting "precise strikes" in Lebanon against Hezbollah command centres, weapons stores and leadership.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Why Is Israel Feeling So Confident?</strong></h2>

<p>Hezbollah, after all, is not Hamas. It is entirely dependent on Iran and has a larger, more professional and sophisticated army. It even has seats in the Lebanese parliament. It is battle-hardened and has fought wars with Israel earlier. In 2000, it managed to drive the Israeli Defense Forces out of Southern Lebanon, and in 2006, the group forced it to retreat. The organisation has often been called "a state within a state". &nbsp;While many Lebanese despise the Shiite group - and many would be happy with Nasrallah's elimination as he has brought to Lebanon one disaster after the other while carrying out what they say was the 'Iranian' agenda - within the community, it is admired and has contributed to keeping Syrian President Bashar Al Assad in power in Syria.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In spite of all this, Israel's actions betray a belief that perhaps it can now do to Lebanon what it did to Gaza. After all, Lebanon is a politically dysfunctional state; its currency has collapsed, its economy is in tatters and as per World Bank data, 44% of its population is living in poverty. A war will be catastrophic for the country. Already, Israel has demonstrated that in spite of widespread condemnation of its use of disproportionate force in the Gaza Strip - where it seems Israel is now winding down operations - it has been able to stay intent on its course, with the international community incapable of or unwilling to halt its assault.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Iran Is On The Fence</strong></h2>

<p>Next, Hezbollah's mentor, Iran, is not in a comfortable position either. It's facing both internal and external challenges. In fact, with its direct strikes on Israel in April, Tehran in a way demonstrated that it did not have the appetite for a direct war with Israel, which has both a superior economy and military. Thus, while Iran might not throw its favourite protege under the bus, it may also not be in a position to shore up Hezbollah's arsenal. Also, the numerous recent assassinations - Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh included - point to a breach within the ranks of both Iran and Hezbollah. This is sure to lead to further internal rupture and dissonance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fact that Iran's new president Masoud Pezeshkian has also declared his intention to cooperate with the West over the nuclear deal is also added motivation for Israel. Pezeshkian perhaps sees a window of opportunity while the Democrats still hold power in Washington. He may not wish to jeopardise this opportunity by rushing to aid Hezbollah.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yet another factor for Israel's emboldening may be the looming US presidential elections. &nbsp;In case of a war breaking out in the region that pits Israel against one or other of its adversaries, there is sure to be bipartisan support for Israel in America. The US has stationed 12 warships in the region, and the IDF just this week announced that the US was disbursing another $8.7 billion in military aid. It's doubtful whether such similar aid will be forthcoming for Iran from any of its friends.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Israel's Actions Have A Cost</strong></h2>

<p>All these factors may have spurred Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but his actions come at a great cost for Israel too. The Israeli economy is suffering. Foreign investments have dropped, tourism, one of the country's mainstays, has waned, about 46,000 businesses have gone bankrupt, and the country's credit rating has dwindled. On the military front as well, while Israelis still continue to be held captive by Hamas, the IDF has suffered serious losses too. Reports say that around 10,000 reservists have sought mental health support and a significant number failed to show up when called up a second or third time, citing "burnout". Israel's own resources are depleting fast and will need time to be replenished. Nevertheless, the public approval for a war with Lebanon seems much higher than that for its actions in Gaza.&nbsp;Nasrallah's assassination will go a long way in shoring up support for the Netanyahu government.</p>

<p>Beyond all this, however, the bottom line is that there are no permanent military solutions to the conflict in the region because the problem is essentially a political one. Israel may flatten Gaza and it may even go on to repeat that repertoire in Lebanon. It may destroy Hamas and Hezbollah. But the hatred will live on. With time, new avatars of Hamas and Hezbollah will continue to spring up.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military said on Saturday Israel is on high alert for a broader conflict after it claimed to have killed Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, and also said it hoped his reported death will cause the group to change course.</p>

<p>"We hope this will change Hezbollah's actions," Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani said in a media briefing after the military said it had killed Nasrallah.</p>

<p>But he said it would still take time to degrade the Iran-backed Hezbollah's capabilities.</p>

<p>"We've seen Hezbollah carry out attacks against us for a year. It's safe to assume that they are going to continue carrying out their attacks against us or try to," he said.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani said that there had been no new instructions given to Israeli civilians regarding home front readiness, as current guidelines already put much of the country on high alert.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This development has sparked significant concern and speculation regarding the future of the militant group. Killing Nasrallah, who has led Hezbollah for 32 years, would deliver a substantial blow to the organisation.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>READ</strong> | <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hezbollah-chief-hassan-nasrallah-killed-in-strikes-on-beirut-says-israel-army-6669105#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll_Imagetopscroll">Israel Says Hezbollah Chief Dead: "Will No Longer Terrorise The World"</a></p>

<p>If he is out of the picture, who will lead Hezbollah's charge against Israel and what does it mean for the armed group's future?&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Nasrallah's Legacy</strong></h2>

<p>"Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah does not hold any public office, but he is the de facto ruler of Lebanon. He rules by televised speech. The rest of the state (even when there was a president and prime minister), learn the fate of their country and tailor their policies in accordance with what they hear Nasrallah saying," Hussain Abdul-Hussain, veteran journalist, Middle East expert and research fellow at the Foundation For Defense of Democracy in Washington DC, told NDTV.</p>

<p><strong>READ</strong> | <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hezbollah-inside-lebanon-politics-hezbollah-iran-and-a-larger-battle-for-hegemony-6588884">Inside Lebanon Politics: Hezbollah, Iran And A Larger Battle For Hegemony</a></p>

<p>Born in 1960 in East Beirut, Hassan Nasrallah's early life was shaped by the Lebanese Civil War, which prompted his family to return to their ancestral village. At 15, he joined the Amal movement, a Shia political and paramilitary group. His educational journey took him to Iraq for Quranic studies, but he returned to Lebanon in 1978 due to government pressures against Shia radicals.</p>

<p>In 1982, following the Israeli invasion, he transitioned from Amal to join Hezbollah, which was formed by Iran's Revolutionary Guards. His leadership began in earnest after the assassination of his predecessor, Abbas al-Musawi, in 1992. Under Nasrallah, Hezbollah transformed from a militia focused on resistance to Israeli occupation into a political force in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's operations in southern Lebanon contributed to Israel's withdrawal in 2000, a momentous event that significantly bolstered Nasrallah's reputation. His opposition to Israel remained a cornerstone of his leadership, as he famously stated, "I don't believe in the state of Israel as a legal state because it was founded on occupation."</p>

<h2><strong>Implications of Nasrallah's Death</strong></h2>

<p>Replacing Nasrallah would present an unprecedented challenge, especially given Israeli military successes that have already decimated Hezbollah's leadership structure. The loss of Nasrallah would compound these issues, as the group faces questions about its internal security following the assassination of several key commanders and the recent pager blast attacks the shook the group across Lebanon. While Hezbollah is not expected to collapse entirely if Nasrallah were to die, his removal would undoubtedly damage the group's morale and serve as a potent symbol of Israel's military dominance.</p>

<p>"Hezbollah will not collapse if Nasrallah is killed or incapacitated, but this will be a major blow to the group's morale. It would also underline Israel's security and military superiority and access," Analyst Lina Khatib of the Chatham House Policy Institute said as quoted by news agency Reuters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The potential ramifications extend beyond morale; they may also affect Hezbollah's military capabilities.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has engaged in a year-long exchange of fire with Israel across the Lebanese border, which has escalated into its worst conflict since 2006. Hezbollah increased its rocket fire into Israel since the October 7 attack on Israel by the Palestinian group Hamas. In the aftermath of the recent Beirut airstrike, Hezbollah launched several attacks on Israeli positions, indicating an effort to demonstrate its operational capacity despite the ongoing Israeli offensive.</p>

<h2><strong>A Leadership Vacuum</strong></h2>

<p>The question of succession looms large. Any new leader would need to be acceptable to both Hezbollah's internal factions and its Iranian backers. Currently, Hashem Safieddine is viewed as the likely heir to Nasrallah.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Safieddine, who oversees Hezbollah's political affairs and is a member of the group's Jihad Council, is also Nasrallah's cousin and shares a clerical background. The US State Department designated him a terrorist in 2017.</p>

<p>Nasrallah had been grooming Safieddine for leadership through various positions within the organisation. His familial ties, physical resemblance to Nasrallah, and religious status would all contribute to his potential leadership.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah was killed in a strike on Beirut, the Israeli military said today.&nbsp;A source close to Hezbollah told news agency AFP that communication with the 64-year-old Nasrallah was lost since Friday night.</p>

<p>"Hassan Nasrallah is dead," military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani announced on X.</p>

<p>The Israeli strikes targeted dozens of Hezbollah sites in eastern and southern Lebanon following intense rocket fire by the group into northern Israel. Israeli jets bombarded Hezbollah strongholds in southern Beirut overnight, flattening several residential buildings.</p>

<p>"Hassan Nasrallah will no longer be able to terrorise the world," the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said in a statement.</p>

<p>"This is not the end of our toolbox. The message is simple, anyone who threatens the citizens of Israel -- we will know how to reach them," Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said in a statement.</p>

<p>This wave of retaliatory strikes occurred just hours after Hezbollah claimed responsibility for launching rockets into northern Israel. One such attack targeted the kibbutz Kabri using Fadi-1 rockets, which Hezbollah stated was in defence of Lebanon against Israeli "barbaric" aggression.</p>

<p>Nasrallah, who holds immense power in Lebanon, particularly among his Shiite supporters, is widely seen as the only figure capable of waging war or brokering peace.</p>

<p>The 64-year-old's daughter Zainab was killed in one of the airstrikes targeting Hezbollah strongholds in southern Beirut, Israel's Channel 12 reported, however, there has been no confirmation from Hezbollah or Lebanese media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nasrallah was rumoured to have been killed in 2006 following Israel's invasion of Lebanon. However, the Shiite leader reemerged days later unhurt. The Israeli strikes also killed Ali Karake, commander of Hezbollah's southern front, and other Hezbollah members.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"During Hassan Nasrallah's 32-year reign as the Secretary-General of Hezbollah, he was responsible for the murder of many Israeli civilians and soldiers, and the planning and execution of thousands of terrorist activities," an Israeli statement read. &nbsp;"He was responsible for directing and executing terrorist attacks around the world in which civilians of various nationalities were murdered. Nasrallah was the central decision-maker and the strategic leader of the organisation."</p>

<p>Air raid sirens were heard across northern Israel, signalling an imminent threat from rockets launched across the Lebanese border. According to Israeli military reports, two surface-to-surface missiles were fired from Lebanon, one falling in an open area, while the other was intercepted.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry ordered the evacuation of hospitals in Beirut's southern suburbs, bracing for further escalation. The ministry urged unaffected hospitals to stop admitting non-emergency patients to make room for those being relocated from the conflict-hit areas.</p>

<p>The Israeli bombing of Lebanon has killed more than 700 people and displaced around 118,000.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Both Bradley, 22, and Antonia, 20, pleaded guilty this week to a charge of outraging public decency by committing a sexual act in a public place.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A British couple recently had their court hearing after being kicked off from an EasyJet flight in March for a lewd act. Bradley Smith and Antonia Sullivan were caught in the act while engaging in a sexual act in public view, leading to their escort of the flight.</p>

<p>The couple was returning to Bristol from a holiday in Tenerife, Spain, on March 3 when multiple witnesses reported their inappropriate behaviour to the crew. During the 7 a.m. flight, Bradley sat in seat 16A while Antonia occupied 16B.</p>

<p>According to reports from British newspaper <em>The Sun</em>, a fellow passenger in seat 16C was among three witnesses to their NSFW act, along with a mother and daughter sitting in the row behind them.</p>

<p>Witnesses stated that shortly after takeoff, Bradley asked Antonia to perform a sexual act. They then draped clothing over Bradley's lap and began their explicit actions on the crowded flight.</p>

<p>"After a few minutes, the witness noticed that the couple had rearranged some coats over Smith's lap, followed by vigorous hand movements beneath the coat," prosecutor Maree Doyle told Bristol magistrates' court.</p>

<p>"The witness next to them could see what was happening, as could a mother and teenage daughter seated behind the couple," the prosecutor added.</p>

<p>When the angry mother alerted the cabin crew, Antonia initially claimed she was merely rubbing her boyfriend's leg. However, the couple was eventually escorted off the plane by police for questioning.</p>

<p>Both Bradley, 22, and Antonia, 20, pleaded guilty this week to a charge of outraging public decency by committing a sexual act in a public place.</p>

<p>They were ordered to pay 100 pounds (approximately Rs 11,000) as compensation to each of the three witnesses. Additionally, Bradley was sentenced to complete 300 hours of community service, while Antonia received 270 hours.</p>

<p>Judge Lynne Matthews chastised the couple for their explicit behaviour in public, stating, "You showed no regard for the feelings of other passengers. There was a child sitting behind you who was able to see what was happening.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Who do you think you are, and what right do you believe you have to behave in such a way in full view of people on that flight?" the judge questioned.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two consecutive Russian attacks on a medical centre in Sumy in northeastern Ukraine on Saturday morning killed six people, Ukraine's interior minister said.</p>

<p>"The first attack killed 1 person and damaged the ceilings of several floors of the hospital. The evacuation of patients and staff began," Ihor Klymenko said on Telegram.</p>

<p>As people were being evacuated, the Russians struck again, killing a further five people, he said.</p>

<p>Attacks on Sumy city and the Sumy region have become much more frequent since Ukrainian forces launched an operation in Russia's neighbouring Kursk region in August and captured dozens of settlements.</p>

<p>Sumy city is located just 32 km (20 miles) from the Russian border and Russian forces have been attacking the region and the city with drones and guided bombs.</p>

<p>Klymenko did not specify what weapons were used in Saturday's attacks but the regional administration said the strike was carried out by drones.</p>

<p>Ukrainian air forces earlier on Saturday said its troops shot down 69 of 73 drones during an overnight Russian attack that included two ballistic and two cruise missiles.</p>

<p>About 15 Russian attack drones were destroyed by air defences on the outskirts and in the capital Kyiv, the military administration there said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Princess Diana's hairdresser has weighed in on the controversy surrounding Prince Harry and her riding instructor James Hewitt.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After years of rumours and speculations that Princess Diana's riding instructor James Hewitt, and not King Charles, is the biological father of Prince Harry, a new memoir has shed some light on the nature of their relationship. For years, a few similarities between Hewitt and Harry -- ginger hair and freckles -- led to such rumours.<br />
<br />
Richard Dalton, Diana's hairdresser, has now weighed in on the controversy and even detailed his friendship with the late Princess in a new memoir, “It's All About the Hair”.<br />
<br />
“It's not possible,” Dalton told <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/princess-dianas-friend-devastating-prince-harry-paternity-rumors-not-possible">Fox News Digital</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It was tough... Harry was already born a while before her relationship with Hewitt. And I don't think it's possible.” To support his statement, Dalton claimed even Princess Diana's brother and sister had "bright red hair".<br />
<br />
“Harry and the Spencer family have red hair. Charles, Diana's brother, had bright red hair when he was (in) college,” he said, adding he used to cut his hair back then.<br />
<br />
He added that Sarah, Diana's sister, also has bright red hair, while her other sister Jane was "more or less the same colouring as Diana."<br />
<br />
In his book, Dalton said that Diana “used to get very upset” over the reports of Hewitt being called Harry's father, adding that the "red hair was a trait from the Spencer family".<br />
<br />
Diana and Hewitt met each other for the first time in 1986, two years after Harry's birth in 1984, according to reports.<br />
<br />
Harry was born “long before Diana even met James Hewitt,” Dalton wrote in his book, adding the two had a "love affair," which lasted three years between 1989 and 1991.&nbsp;Both Harry and Hewitt have addressed the rumour in the past.<br />
<br />
Last year, Harry sued an outlet for apparently using unlawful techniques "on an industrial scale" to score on his life.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"Numerous newspapers had reported a rumour that my biological father was James Hewitt, a man my mother had a relationship with after I was born," Harry said in a written statement.<br />
<br />
"At the time of this article and others similar to it, I wasn't actually aware that my mother hadn't met Major Hewitt until after I was born," he added.<br />
<br />
In 2002, Hewitt himself addressed the gossip and said, "There really is no possibility whatsoever that I am Harry's father. I can understand the interest, but Harry was already walking by the time my relationship with Diana began."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Asia's strongest storm this year, Typhoon Yagi, caused damages estimated at 81.5 trillion dong ($3.31 billion) across northern Vietnam, or twice as much as previous estimates, state media said on Saturday.</p>

<p>The typhoon, which killed 299 with 34 missing, devastated export-oriented industrial hubs, destroying factories and facilities, besides flooding farmland, damaging homes, and tearing up a bridge.</p>

<p>"The total economic damage is initially estimated at over 81.5 trillion dong, with most damage triggered by landslides and flash floods," state-run Vietnam News Agency quoted Agriculture Minister Le Minh Hoan as saying.</p>

<p>The figure exceeds a preliminary estimate of $1.6 billion made this month by the planning ministry that threatened to chip 0.15 percentage point from a forecast for economic growth of 6.8% to 7% this year.</p>

<p>Hoan urged authorities to help people resume production while ensuring supplies and holding down prices, as farm and agricultural land were among the areas hit hardest.</p>

<p>Live pig prices in Vietnam have risen steadily since Typhoon Yagi and subsequent flooding affected several pig farms, Reuters has reported.</p>

<p>On Thursday, rating agency S&amp;P Global said Vietnamese banks' profitability would be hit because of typhoon debt relief measures ordered by the central bank.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has vowed to impose tougher security measures at the border and fix America's broken immigration system]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has vowed to impose tougher security measures at the border and fix America's broken immigration system, as she sought to counter frequent political attacks on the issue from her Republican rival Donald Trump ahead of the November election.</p>

<p>Vice President Harris' comments came during her visit to the US-Mexico border in Douglas, Arizona, on Friday.</p>

<p>Despite taking a hardline stance on border security, Harris said she also supports a "pathway to citizenship" for undocumented migrants currently in the US.</p>

<p>"As President, I will work with Congress to create, at long last, a pathway to citizenship for hardworking immigrants who have been here for years," Harris said.</p>

<p>Harris was in Arizona to get a first-hand assessment of the security situation at the southern borders.</p>

<p>Slamming former President Trump, she said politicians have refused to come together and fix the broken immigration system.</p>

<p>Illegal immigration is an issue that Americans have grown increasingly worried about in recent years amid record levels of migrant crossings at the southern border.</p>

<p>"Well, as President, I will put politics aside to fix our immigration system and find solutions to problems which have persisted for far too long...These issues are highly consequential for our nation," she said.</p>

<p>Harris, 59, will take on Trump, 78, in the November 5 presidential election.</p>

<p>Observing that the contrast in the 2024 election is clear, Harris said it is a choice between common sense solutions and the same old political games.</p>

<p>"In the four years that Donald Trump was President, he did nothing to fix our broken immigration system. He did not solve the shortage of immigration judges and border agents or create lawful pathways into our nation. He did nothing to address our outdated asylum system. And did not work with other governments in our hemisphere to deal with what is clearly a regional challenge," she alleged.</p>

<p>Harris slammed Trump for wanting to run on a problem instead of fix a problem.</p>

<p>"The American people deserve a President who cares more about border security than playing political games," she said.</p>

<p>As a former border state Attorney General, Harris noted that she understands what security and enforcing the law at the border means, prosecuting transnational criminal organizations for the trafficking of guns, drugs, and human beings.</p>

<p>As such she unveiled her approach to "target the entire global fentanyl supply chain" to "significantly reduce the flow of precursor chemicals from China" and protect Americans from the "unimaginable destruction" it is causing.</p>

<p>"On behalf of all communities across our nation that want to see these problems solved I say: We cannot accept Donald Trump's failure to lead. We should not permit scapegoating instead of solutions. Or rhetoric instead of results," she said.</p>

<p>In his remarks earlier in the day, Trump hammered Harris for having an unsecured border.</p>

<p>"This is bad timing for Kamala to show up today at the border. She didn't go there for four years. Today, she shows up," Trump said.</p>

<p>Trump said Harris had betrayed her oath.</p>

<p>"She let our cities fail violent gangs. She let our American sons and daughters be raped and murdered at the hands of vicious monsters. She let American communities be conquered. You go out to Aurora in Colorado, where they're taking over with AK-47s. They're taking over real estate. Kamala turned cherished small towns into blighted refugee camps," he said.</p>

<p>"What Kamala Harris has done is unforgivable. It's a crime what she did. It's got to be criminal. There's no greater act of disloyalty than to extinguish the sovereignty of your own nation, and that's what she's done. She's ruined our nation. She's ruined our nation," Trump alleged.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Oliver Bromley had just completed a treatment session at King's College Hospital in southeast London and decided to grab lunch at a nearby eatery.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man with a facial disfigurement has spoken out about the moment he was asked to leave a London restaurant after staff claimed he was “scaring customers.”</p>

<p>Oliver Bromley, 42, had just completed a treatment session at King's College Hospital in southeast London and decided to grab lunch at a nearby eatery. However, after attempting to place his order, he was told to leave the place because patrons allegedly complained about his appearance, according to a report in The New York Post.<br />
<br />
Bromley, who has Neurofibromatosis Type 1, a genetic disorder causing benign tumours to grow on nerves, expressed shock at being asked to leave so abruptly.</p>

<p>“I hadn't even sat down,” he said, adding that when he went to place his order, he was asked to leave. A man behind the counter told him there were complaints about him, asking him to leave, Bromley said. "I asked him to repeat himself, and he said I was scaring customers," he added.<br />
<br />
Though upset by the encounter, Bromley hoped his experience would lead to increased awareness and education about his condition within the hospitality industry. “There's a lot of naivety around the issue,” he said, expressing a desire to help people better understand his condition.</p>

<p>Bromley said that there was nothing to be afraid of, adding, "It's just something some individuals have to live with".<br />
<br />
"I am hoping this raises awareness and that, going forward, there might be a positive outcome and prevent it happening again," The New York Post quoted him as saying.<br />
<br />
Bromley also reached out to the restaurant, which he chose not to name, but said he received no response. Then he reported the matter to the Metropolitan Police, who classified the incident as a hate crime. The Met told BBC that officers had visited Bromley and, while no arrests were made, the force emphasised that they take “reports of hate crime seriously.”<br />
<br />
Bromley, however, said that this was the first time he had faced such direct discrimination. “People stare — young children, especially — but I've never been treated as directly as that,” he told the New York Post.<br />
<br />
Trading Standards have also been informed of the incident, and the charity Nerve Tumours UK is set to meet with UKHospitality to discuss improving staff education.<br />
<br />
Karen Cockburn, the charity's director, said that they have written to both the restaurant concerned, and to UKHospitality, the trade association body. "Whilst we have not received any response from the restaurant, I am delighted to say that UKHospitality has offered to work with us to raise awareness of the condition in the hospitality sector, and I am meeting with them shortly to kick start this joint venture."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India issued a stern warning to Pakistan today at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) following Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's speech, in which he raised the Jammu and Kashmir issue. India firmly responded by stating that Pakistan's continued support for cross-border terrorism will "inevitably invite consequences."</p>

<p>India's First Secretary to the UN, Bhavika Mangalanandan, delivered a pointed rebuttal alleging Pakistan's complicity in global terrorism and citing its long history of using cross-border terrorism as a state policy. Ms Mangalanandan's statement came in response to Mr Sharif's call for India to reverse its 2019 abrogation of Article 370, which revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, and his demands for a dialogue between the two countries.</p>

<p>"This Assembly regrettably witnessed a travesty this morning. A country run by the military, with a global reputation for terrorism, narcotics trade and transnational crime has had the audacity to attack the world's largest democracy," Ms Mangalanandan said. "The world can see for itself what Pakistan really is."</p>

<p>The First Secretary described Mr Sharif's speech as audacious, given Pakistan's international "reputation for terrorism", narcotics trade, and transnational crime. "A country run by the military, with a global reputation for terrorism...has had the audacity to attack the world's largest democracy," she said, referencing attacks orchestrated by Pakistan-based terror groups, including the 2001 Indian Parliament attack and the 2008 Mumbai attacks.</p>

<p>Ms Mangalanandan said Pakistan's "fingerprints" are on many terrorist incidents across the world. &nbsp;"Perhaps it should come as no surprise that its prime minister would so speak in this hallowed hall. Yet we must make clear how unacceptable his words are to all of us. We know that Pakistan will seek to counter the truth with more lies. Repetition will change nothing. Our stand is clear and needs no reiteration," she said.</p>

<p>India reiterated that any discussion of a "Strategic Restraint Regime" with Pakistan is moot unless terrorism is eradicated. Ms Mangalanandan noted, "There can be no compact with terrorism." She also spoke of Pakistan's past, including its hosting of Osama bin Laden and connections to various terrorist incidents worldwide.</p>

<p>Mr Sharif, in his speech, linked the Kashmir issue with regional peace. He also alleged that India's military expansion was directed against Pakistan. However, Ms Mangalanandan pointed out Pakistan's history of meddling in Jammu and Kashmir through terrorism, seeking to disrupt the democratic process in the region.</p>

<p>India's response extended beyond terrorism to Pakistan's internal issues. Ms Mangalanandan accused Pakistan of human rights abuses, referring to the genocide of 1971 in Bangladesh and its persecution of minorities. She called it "ridiculous" for Pakistan to lecture the world about intolerance, given its own record.</p>

<p>Pakistan responded with a Right of Reply, rejecting India's claims as "baseless and misleading," and reiterated its call for a referendum in Jammu and Kashmir, as per UN Security Council resolutions.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Mini-moons have been spotted before, and many more are likely to have gone unnoticed.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stargazers are in for a celestial surprise this autumn. A small asteroid is set to be captured by Earth's gravitational pull, temporarily becoming a "mini-moon." This object will orbit the planet from September 29 to November 25 before escaping again.</p>

<p>The news has sparked excitement among stargazers and space enthusiasts eager to glimpse this cosmic visitor. However, the mini-moon, a small and dim rock, will not be visible to the naked eye. Viewing it will require professional equipment, as binoculars or home telescopes are insufficient.</p>

<p>According to Dr Jennifer Millard, host of the Awesome Astronomy podcast, professional telescopes will capture images of the mini-moon. "You'll be able to see wonderful pictures online of this little dot speeding past the stars," Millard told the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3dvxgrmk95o" rel="nofollow, noindex">BBC</a></em>.</p>

<p>The asteroid, named 2024 PT5, originates from the Arjuna asteroid belt, which contains rocks with orbits similar to Earth's. It was first detected on August 7 by NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) and measures around 33 feet wide.</p>

<p>"It won't complete a full revolution around Earth. Its orbit will be slightly altered by our planet before it continues on its way," Millard explained.</p>

<p>Some asteroids get close to Earth, coming as near as 2.8 million miles (4.5 million km). If an asteroid, like 2024 PT5, moves at a relatively slow speed-around 2,200 mph (3,540 km/h)-Earth's gravity can temporarily trap it, which is exactly what's about to happen this weekend.</p>

<p>Mini-moons have been spotted before, and many more are likely to have gone unnoticed. Some even return for repeat visits, like asteroid 2022 NX1, which became a mini-moon in 1981 and again in 2022.</p>

<p>If you miss this event, don't worry-2024 PT5 is expected to return to Earth's orbit in 2055.</p>

<p>"This story shows just how busy our solar system is and how much remains undiscovered. This asteroid was only detected earlier this year," Millard added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>While some male victims were included, the online group revealed on Friday that approximately 99 per cent of the 173 cases involved women.</p>

<p>The group noted that most victims were doused with suspicious liquids, and many reported feelings of depression and anxiety following the incidents.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, a court fined 26-year-old PhD student Lai Changwei HK$5,000 (US$642) for squirting a liquid containing his semen onto a woman's buttocks at a Hong Kong university. Lai blamed his actions on stress.</p>

<p>CCTV footage from the Kowloon Tong campus showed Lai following the woman after spotting her inside a university building at around 3:30 p.m. on June 6, before using a plastic pipette to squirt the liquid onto her, the court heard.</p>

<p>Earlier,&nbsp;Hong Kong police arrested 43 individuals, including 31 students, in a crackdown on four criminal syndicates that used money and free illicit drugs as incentives to lure teenagers into illegal activities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stood at the podium of the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Friday, holding two maps. &nbsp;In his right hand was a map of the Middle East with Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen painted in black and dubbed "The Curse" while in his left hand was a map showing countries painted green, including Egypt, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, and even India, termed "The Blessing."</p>

<p>However, what was most conspicuous about both maps was the complete erasure of Palestine. There was no reference to its existence in the green "blessing" map nor the black "curse" one.</p>

<p>Netanyahu drew a direct link between "The Curse" and Iranian influence, stressing that Iran and its allies were the source of the ongoing conflict in the region.</p>

<p><strong>READ</strong> | <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-nasrallah-as-israel-burns-lebanon-diplomats-walk-out-during-netanyahus-un-address-6667247#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll">Israel Pounds Beirut But No Sign Of Hezbollah Chief Hassan Nasrallah</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, the countries marked in green, which included Egypt, Sudan, and Saudi Arabia, represented allies or potential allies who had either normalised relations with Israel or were in the process of doing so.</p>

<p>In his UN address, he squarely blamed Iran for the violence that continues to unfold in Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen. He cited Tehran's financial and military support to Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, and the Houthis in Yemen as evidence of its destabilising influence. Israel, he argued, was defending itself on multiple fronts against Iranian-backed fighters across the region.</p>

<p><strong>Explained </strong>| <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hamas-palestine-gaza-explained-axis-of-resistance-and-irans-proxy-network-across-middle-east-4534061">Axis Of Resistance And Iran's Proxy Network Across Middle East</a></p>

<p>"If you strike us, we will strike you," Netanyahu warned Iran, adding that Israel's reach could extend throughout the Middle East if necessary. As Netanyahu addressed the UN General Assembly, scores of diplomats walked out in protest.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said that Israel's military actions, particularly in Lebanon and Gaza, were a necessary response to Iranian aggression. "As long as Hezbollah chooses the path of war, Israel has no choice but to remove this threat," he declared.</p>

<p>Jordan's foreign minister Ayman Safadi today said that Netanyahu has to be stopped because he was driving the entire region into open war. Safadi even went as far as saying that Jordan would guarantee Israel's security if it allowed the creation of an independent Palestinian state.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I can tell you here very unequivocally, all of us are willing to right now, guarantee the security of Israel in the context of Israel ending the occupation and allowing for the emergence of a Palestinian state, independent state," Safadi said, as quoted by news agency Reuters. "(But) he (Netanyahu) is creating danger because he simply does not want the two-state solution."&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Who Are The Greens, And Why</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Saudi Arabia</strong></p>

<p>One of the more complex figures on Netanyahu's green "blessing" map was Saudi Arabia. Before the eruption of hostilities between Israel and Hamas in October 2023, the Biden administration had been working to broker a normalisation deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Such a deal, which many saw as potentially transformative for the region, appeared to be on the horizon. The deal included the US entering a defence treaty with Saudi Arabia. In return, Saudi Arabia had to normalise its ties with Israel and the latter would give concessions to Palestinians and reap the dividends of having one of the major players of the Middle East as one of its allies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia, however, has maintained that normalisation with Israel would not be possible without the establishment of a Palestinian state. The war between Hamas and Israel has further complicated these discussions, though Netanyahu's inclusion of Saudi Arabia in the green zone on his map suggests that he remains optimistic, or at least, publicly projects optimism about future ties with Riyadh.</p>

<p><strong>Egypt</strong></p>

<p>Egypt's presence on the green "blessing" map was hardly surprising. Since the 1979 peace treaty, Egypt has maintained a formal yet often strained relationship with Israel. Despite years of what many call a "cold peace," Egypt has continued to play a key role in regional stability, particularly regarding Gaza.</p>

<p>Energy and security cooperation between the two nations have strengthened in recent years, with Egypt importing Israeli gas and co-managing Gaza's security through the joint enforcement of a blockade. While Egypt may not publicly endorse Israel's aggressive tactics in Gaza, its vested interests in preventing the spread of Islamist extremism and managing border security ensure its continued cooperation with Israel.</p>

<p><strong>Sudan</strong></p>

<p>In 2021, Sudan signed the Abraham Accords, which were brokered by the US to facilitate diplomatic ties between Israel and Arab states. This was a big shift for a country that, under the leadership of former President Omar al-Bashir, had been hostile toward Israel for decades.</p>

<p>The transitional government in Sudan has used normalisation with Israel as a way to strengthen ties with the US and regional powers like the UAE, which have distanced themselves from Islamist movements.</p>

<p><strong>India</strong></p>

<p>India's presence in the green "blessing" map was a nod to its evolving relationship with Israel under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. India has moved closer to Israel in recent years, especially in the areas of defence and technology. While India has historically been a supporter of Palestinian self-determination, its ties with Israel have strengthened as part of its broader strategic recalibration.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel continued ferocious rounds of airstrikes on Hezbollah's key strongholds in southern Beirut in Lebanon today. These strikes, which began last night in the heart of the capital city, sent plumes of thick smoke billowing into the sky, sparking fear and chaos in densely populated civilian areas. The operations marked Israel's most intense strikes on Beirut since shifting its military focus from Gaza to Lebanon earlier this week.</p>

<p>The targets of these attacks were alleged Hezbollah strongholds scattered throughout Lebanon, with devastating consequences, including the deaths of hundreds of people. While Israeli television networks reported that Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was the primary target, a Hezbollah source, according to news agency AFP, later claimed Nasrallah was "fine," though he has remained in hiding for years to evade assassination attempts. Nasrallah, who holds immense power in Lebanon, particularly among his Shiite supporters, is widely seen as the only figure capable of waging war or brokering peace.</p>

<p>Although Nasrallah's whereabouts are unknown at the moment, his daughter Zainab was killed in one of the airstrikes targeting Hezbollah strongholds in southern Beirut, Israel's Channel 12 reported, however, there has been no confirmation from Hezbollah or Lebanese media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) claimed that the strikes resulted in the deaths of Muhammad Ali Ismail, the commander of Hezbollah's missile unit in southern Lebanon, his deputy, and other senior officials of the Iran-backed militia. Ahmad Ahmad, a local resident who fled from his home in southern Beirut during the strikes, described the attack as feeling "like an earthquake", as quoted by news agency AFP.</p>

<p>The strikes continued into a second bombing wave, during which Israel claimed to have targeted Hezbollah's weapons depots stored within buildings in southern Beirut. Hezbollah denied this claim, while reports emerged of six buildings being levelled and 91 people wounded, with six confirmed dead. Following the strikes, Hezbollah retaliated by launching rockets into Israel, which prompted warnings from the Israeli military for civilians in Hezbollah strongholds to evacuate immediately.</p>

<p>Benjamin Netanyahu's Warning</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Friday, vowing that Israel would continue its military campaign against Hezbollah until the northern border was fully secured. He claimed that Israel has the right to defend itself, declaring that no reprieve would be given to Hezbollah, and hinting at a possible ground offensive in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Netanyahu also issued a stern warning to Tehran, accusing Iran of fueling the violence through its support of Hezbollah. "If you strike us, we will strike you," Netanyahu warned, adding that Israel's reach could extend throughout the Middle East if necessary.</p>

<p>As Netanyahu addressed the UN General Assembly, scores of diplomats walked out in protest. The devastating toll of the ongoing war in Gaza has drawn widespread condemnation, with more than 42,000 people reported dead in the besieged enclave. Entire neighbourhoods in Gaza have been reduced to rubble, with hundreds of thousands displaced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nasrallah Targeted In Beirut&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Friday evening Israeli airstrikes on southern Beirut were unprecedented in scale, reportedly involving tens of tons of explosives. Hezbollah's top officials were thought to be present at the underground headquarters that were bombed, though reports from Hezbollah claimed that Nasrallah survived the strikes. Despite the extensive destruction, with entire buildings flattened, there was no immediate confirmation of Nasrallah's death, though speculation continued to swirl.</p>

<p>Israeli officials, however, expressed confidence that the strikes had seriously compromised Hezbollah's command structure. In a televised statement, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari claimed that the strike targeted Hezbollah's central headquarters in the Dahiyeh suburb of Beirut. The IDF also revealed it had notified the US about the airstrikes while the operation was underway, but the United States was not involved.</p>

<p>Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian in response to the Beirut strikes, condemned the attack as a "flagrant war crime," further intensifying the already volatile situation.</p>

<p>The United Nations and international humanitarian organisations have sounded alarms over the deadly situation in Lebanon. "We are witnessing the deadliest period in Lebanon in a generation, and many fear that this is only the beginning," said UN humanitarian coordinator Imran Riza, as quoted by news agency AFP.&nbsp;<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday congratulated Donald Trump, who claimed victory in the US presidential election, calling it "history's greatest comeback" and a new beginning in the US-Israel alliance.</p>

<p>The United States is Israel's top ally and military backer, and the election came at a critical time for the Middle East amid wars in Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

<p>"Congratulations on history's greatest comeback! Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America. This is a huge victory!" Netanyahu said in a statement issued by his office.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Dear Donald and Melania Trump,<br />
<br />
Congratulations on history's greatest comeback!<br />
<br />
Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America.<br />
<br />
This is a huge victory!<br />

In true friendship,… <a href="https://t.co/B54NSo2BMA">pic.twitter.com/B54NSo2BMA</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Other Israeli officials also congratulated Trump, including Israel Katz who was named defence minister on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"Congratulations to President-elect @realDonald Trump on his historic victory. Together, we'll strengthen the US-Israel alliance, bring back the hostages, and stand firm to defeat the axis of evil led by Iran," Katz said on X.</p>

<p>President Isaac Herzog also applauded Trump and said he looked forward to strengthen US-Israel ties.</p>

<p>"Congratulations to President @realDonaldTrump on your historic return to the White House... I look forward to working with you to strengthen the ironclad bond between our peoples, to build a future of peace and security for the Middle East, and to uphold our shared values," Herzog said in a statement.</p>

<p>The statements came a day after Netanyahu sacked defence minister Yoav Gallant, following public differences over the war with Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>The removal of Gallant -- a hawk on the war with Hezbollah in Lebanon who also pushed for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza -- was announced on the same day as the presidential election in the United States, Israel's top military backer.</p>

<p>Netanyahu and Gallant have frequently clashed over Israel's retaliatory military offensive against Hamas following the Palestinian group's deadly attack on Israel on October 7 last year.</p>

<p>Shortly after Gallant's removal, thousands of people took to the streets of commercial hub Tel Aviv, chanting slogans against Netanyahu and demanding the return of 97 hostages held in Gaza.</p>

<p>Gideon Saar, who has been appointed as the new foreign minister to replace Katz, also welcomed Trump.</p>

<p>"We welcome your strong and dedicated leadership as we work to build a better future of security and cooperation for the Middle East," Saar said on X.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, whose Gulf monarchy is a key mediator in the Gaza conflict and hosts the largest US military base in the Middle East, said he looked forward to "working together again in promoting security and stability both in the region and globally".</p>

<p><strong>- Turkey: 'my friend' Trump -</strong></p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the projections for the US Presidential elections indicate a win for Republican candidate Donald Trump, the people of Kamala Harris' ancestral Thulasendrapuram village in Tamil Nadu expressed their disappointment since they had planned to celebrate the Democrat's victory by bursting crackers and organising a special victory prayer at the local temple.</p>

<p>Trump is set to become the 47th US President. Harris' supporter, Joy, who came to stay in the Thulasendrapuram village from Chicago earlier expressed confidence about the Democrat candidate winning the US elections.</p>

<p>"If Donald Trump wins, I hope he is given the wisdom to lead us with unity. My hope is that he changes his ways and becomes the one who unites and not a divider. My expectations are different though. I think our country will be in chaos for the next four years," Joy said.</p>

<p>"Just now I watched the result of the US elections. It is a little disappointing for us. Anyway, I hope that Donald Trump will change (his ways) and will not govern like he did earlier. Last time when Kamala won as the Vice Presidential candidate, we celebrated. This time we had planned to celebrate more. But we have to accept the mandate," a resident of the village said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Trump early on Wednesday morning hailed his countrymen as results of the high stakes presidential elections projected his victory which set poised to return him to the White House after securing an electoral college victory.</p>

<p>Speaking at an address to supporters in West Palm Beach, Florida, Trump affirmed that his win will help the country "heal."</p>

<p>Addressing the crowd accompanied by his running mate, JD Vance, and family members Trump called his projected win the "greatest political movement of all time" which will help in making "America great again."</p>

<p>"This is a movement like nobody has seen before. This was the greatest political movement of all time. There's nothing like this ever in this country...we are gonna help our country heal. We have a country that needs help and needs help very badly. We are gonna fix our borders, we are gonna fix everything about our country," Trump said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Democratic Campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond said that the Vice President will not address supporters tonight, but is expected to speak tomorrow.</p>

<p>While addressing a gathering, Richmond said that the votes are yet to be counted and there were states that have not been called. "We still have votes to count. We still have states that have not been called yet," Cedric Richmond said.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, special prayers were offered for the success of US Vice Presidential candidate JD Vance in Andhra Pradesh's Godavari district. The Vice Presidential candidate is the husband of Usha Vance who originally belonged to Vadluru village in the Nidadavolu assembly constituency.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Officials clarified that this test, planned years in advance, highlights nuclear readiness and US commitment to defense amid global security shifts.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shortly before former President Donald Trump made a statement regarding his lead in the US presidential election, the US defence forces reportedly conducted a test launch of a Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), a move that underscored ongoing strategic defence readiness.</p>

<p>Launched from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, the unarmed missile travelled more than 4,000 miles across the Pacific Ocean in the direction of the Kwajalein Atoll in the North Pacific. With a top speed of 15,000 miles per hour, the Minuteman III shows that the US military can hit targets anywhere in the world in 30 minutes.</p>

<p>However, the defence officials have clarified that the test was planned years in advance as part of regular drills, aimed at showcasing the "readiness of nuclear US forces." The launch underscores the US commitment to maintaining a state of readiness for its strategic arsenal amidst evolving global security landscapes.</p>

<p>"This test launch marks the start of a remarkable week for our Guardians and Airmen at Vandenberg, with two test launches scheduled from the Western Range," Colonel Bryan Titus, Space Launch Delta 30 vice commander, told<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/11/06/us-military-decides-test-hypersonic-nuke-just-hours-ballots-close-21937103/"><em> The Metro.</em></a></p>

<p>"These tests hold immense significance, not only for our nation's defence but also serve as a pivotal moment in showcasing the exceptional capabilities and expertise of our dedicated team."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Donald Trump, who is on the brink of a landslide win in the US election, Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump thanked his supporters today and described it as a "magnificent victory for the American people". He also referred to the July 13 assassination attempt and said "God spared my life for a reason".</p>

<p>The 78-year-old is currently projected to win 267 electoral college votes, three short of the magic figure of 270. The opponent, incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris is trailing at 224.</p>

<p>Describing the Republican campaign as the "greatest political movement of all time", Trump said, "We are going to help our country heal, fix our borders, we made history for a reason tonight. We have achieved the most incredible political win. I want to thank the American people. I will fight for you and your family with every breath in my body."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China said Wednesday it hoped for "peaceful coexistence" with the United States as Donald Trump neared a decisive victory over Kamala Harris in the country's presidential election.</p>

<p>"We will continue to approach and handle China-US relations based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation," foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told Global Times, Chinese state tabloid.</p>

<p>"Our policy toward the United States has been consistent," she told the tabloid, which is owned by the ruling Communist party's flagship newspaper the People's Daily.</p>

<p>Donald <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/magnificent-victory-for-american-people-donald-trump-on-us-election-result-6955510">Trump claimed a "magnificent" victory </a>over Kamala Harris in the fight for the presidency on Wednesday as results put him on the verge of one of the most stunning comebacks in US political history.</p>

<p>"This is a magnificent victory for the American people that will allow us to make America great again," the 78-year-old told cheering supporters at his campaign headquarters in Florida.</p>

<p>Beijing as a matter of principle does not comment on other countries' elections, though it said it opposes China being used as an issue on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>In response to another question related to the election result and potential additional US tariffs on Chinese goods, Mao said the US presidential election is an internal affair of the US. "We respect the choice of the American people. As for the tariffs, we do not answer hypothetical question," she said. &nbsp;</p>

<p>During his time as president, Trump launched a gruelling trade war with China, imposing swingeing tariffs on Chinese goods for what he said were unfair practices by Beijing, such as theft of US technology and currency manipulation.</p>

<p>Tensions did not abate under his Democratic successor, Joe Biden, with relations at their lowest levels in decades and Washington introducing sharp tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, EV batteries and solar cells.</p>

<p>World leaders rushed to congratulate Trump before the final results were in, with Ukraine's president in particular urging Trump to help achieve a "just peace" against Russia.</p>

<p>US networks called the swing states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina for Trump, and he led the Democratic vice president Kamala Harris in the others although they have not been called yet.</p>

<p>Gloom swiftly descended on Harris's camp as she canceled a watch party for supporters who dreamed of seeing her elected as America's first woman president.</p>

<p>In a further blow to Democrats, Trump's Republican Party also seized control of the Senate, flipping two seats to overturn a narrow Democratic majority.</p>

<p>Trump even appeared to be nearing victory in the popular vote -- something he never achieved in his 2016 victory or in 2020.</p>

<p>For the Democrats, the soul-searching will begin.</p>

<p>Trump's promises of economic bounty and his dark rhetoric on migrants also appear to have resonated with voters who were tired of Biden and Harris's administration.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Kremlin said Wednesday it would judge Donald Trump, who claimed victory in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/magnificent-victory-for-american-people-donald-trump-on-us-election-result-6955510">US presidential election</a>, on his actions and that President Vladimir Putin had no plans to congratulate him.</p>

<p>Relations between Russia and the US have been at an all-time low since the end of the Cold War, with Moscow angered by Western support to Ukraine.</p>

<p>"We will draw conclusions based on concrete steps and concrete words," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists.</p>

<p>If elected, Trump has claimed that he would end the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-election-results-2024-what-donald-trump-said-about-wars-in-trump-2-0-victory-speech-6956202#pfrom=home-uselections_uselexhome">fighting in Ukraine</a> within 24 hours.</p>

<p>The US is "capable of helping bring about the end of this conflict" in Ukraine, but is also "the country that is inflaming the conflict", Peskov said.</p>

<p>Peskov said that Trump had made some "quite harsh statements" during his campaign, but that he also spoke of "his aspirations for peace on the international arena, about his aspirations to end politics based on continuing old wars."</p>

<p>He added that: "But after victory, preparing to enter the Oval Office, sometimes statements take on a different tone."</p>

<p>The Kremlin also said it would be "practically impossible" for the next administration to make Russia-US relations worse since they are "at their lowest point in history".</p>

<p>He rejected accusations that Russia had interfered in the US elections.</p>

<p>Peskov said he was "not aware" of Putin's plans to congratulate Trump, since the US is an "unfriendly country that is directly and indirectly involved in a war against our state", referring to the conflict in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Putin was one of the last leaders to congratulate Joe Biden on his 2020 election victory, sending his congratulatory message six weeks after the vote.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With Republican nominee Donald Trump just three votes short of a victory in the Presidential election, wishes from world leaders began pouring in even as he promised a "golden age for America".</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed confidence that with Mr Trump at the helm, India-US ties will reach greater heights.&nbsp;"As you build on the successes of your previous term, I look forward to renewing our collaboration to further strengthen the India-US Comprehensive Global and Strategic Partnership. Together, let's work for the betterment of our people and to promote global peace, stability and prosperity," he wrote on X.</p>

<p>China's&nbsp;foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning expressed hope for&nbsp;"peaceful coexistence" with the United States, while Kremlin&nbsp;spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the US is an&nbsp;"unfriendly country" and Russia would judge Mr Trump on his actions.</p>

<p>Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel, said Mr Trump's "historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America".</p>

<p>Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recalled a meeting with the president-elect in September, where they both discussed the Ukraine-US strategic partnership to end Russian aggression.&nbsp;"I appreciate President Trump's commitment to the "peace through strength" approach in global affairs. This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer. I am hopeful that we will put it into action together. We look forward to an era of a strong United States of America under President Trump's decisive leadership. We rely on continued strong bipartisan support for Ukraine in the United States," the Ukraine President wrote in a post on X.</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, among the first world leaders to issue a congratulatory message, said&nbsp;the "special relationship" between the UK and the US would continue to prosper under the new American administration. "As the closest of allies, we stand shoulder to shoulder in defence of our shared values of freedom, democracy and enterprise. From growth and security to innovation and tech, I know that the UK-US special relationship will continue to prosper on both sides of the Atlantic for years to come," he said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz&nbsp;vowed that Berlin would work with him for "prosperity and freedom". On the potential working relationship with the US, French President Emmanuel Macron said,&nbsp;"With your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity."</p>

<p>Anthony Albanese, Prime Minister of Australia, reaffirmed the friendship between the two countries as he congratulated Mr Trump.&nbsp;"Congratulations to President Donald Trump on his election victory. Australians and Americans are great friends and true allies. Working together, we can ensure the partnership between our nations and peoples remains strong into the future," he said in a post on X.</p>

<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that European Union (EU) and the US are more than just allies. "We are bound by a true partnership between our people, uniting 800 million citizens.So let's work together on a strong transatlantic agenda that keeps delivering for them," she wrote on X.</p>

<p>NATO chief Mark Rutte said Mr Trump's return to power will help keep the alliance "strong".&nbsp;"His leadership will again be key to keeping our Alliance strong. I look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength through NATO," Rutte said in a statement.</p>

<p>As per Associated Press, 267 electoral votes have gone to Republican candidate Trump and 224 to Democratic Party's Kamala Harris. Trump is just three votes short of a victory.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump claimed victory in the US presidential election 2024 today as according to results he is on the verge of defeating Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. In his victory speech, he thanked tech tycoon Elon Musk, who has backed him throughout his campaign.</p>

<p>However, even before the results started trickling in, a claim was doing the rounds online that social media platform X, owned by Musk, had changed its 'like button' for the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/magnificent-victory-for-american-people-donald-trump-on-us-election-result-6955510#pfrom=home-uselections_uselexhome">US presidential election</a>. The claim, which has not got any confirmation or denial from the company, was that the like button changed to a ballot box animation whenever it was clicked. Several users posted videos on X that showed the like button spinning into an animated ballot box featuring the US flag on it.</p>

<p>It was also alleged that the like button meant a vote for <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/in-donald-trumps-victory-speech-borders-taxes-wars-take-centrestage-6955924">Trump</a> while the retweet function signified support for Harris.</p>

<p>When ndtv.com checked the feature, it was found that the like button had not changed.</p>

<p>Many users also reported not noticing any changes on the like button.</p>

<p>The claim drew condemnation from a section of social media users, mostly from the Democratic supporters, claiming Musk was trying to influence the US voters.</p>

<p>Republican candidate Trump, addressing a crowd of supporters at the West Palm Beach convention centre in Florida, claimed a "magnificent" victory over Harris. "This is a magnificent victory for the American people that will allow us to make America great again," the 78-year-old told cheering supporters.</p>

<p>During the speech, he praised <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-election-results-live-elon-musk-says-game-set-and-match-as-donald-trump-takes-big-lead-6954331">Elon Musk</a>, saying America has a "new star" in him. "We have a new star... a star is born - Elon!" twice-impeached Trump said.</p>

<p>Elon Musk, also the owner of Tesla and SpaceX, congratulated Trump as he edged closer to victory after winning some key swing states. "The people of America gave @realDonaldTrump a crystal-clear mandate for change tonight," posted the tech billionaire amid a record usage of his platform.</p>

<p>"Sure it was a lot of pressure, but it pales by comparison with President @realDonaldTrump, who they tried to kill twice, bankrupt and imprison for eternity," the X owner further said.</p>

<p>Million of Americans had lined up throughout Election Day and millions more voted early in a race with momentous consequences for the United States and the world.</p>

<p>Polls for weeks had shown a knife-edge race between Harris and Trump, who would be the oldest-ever president at the time of inauguration, the first felon president and only the second in history to serve non-consecutive terms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congress leader Shashi Thaoor, who heads the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, told NDTV today Donald Trump is a familiar politician who India has engaged with before, and so the Trump 2.0 administration should not have any surprises for India.</p>

<p>In a short conversation with NDTV, the diplomat-turned-politician from Kerala explained briefly the areas that India already understands about Mr Trump's style of working, and how India can keep those in mind while engaging with him again.</p>

<p>"We know him very well. He has already been president for four years. I don't think there will be any surprise as to what kind of politics he will do. He's a transactional politician, 'what can you do for me, and what can I do for you' type of leader," Mr Tharoor, the Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram, told NDTV.</p>

<p>"He's very tough on trade. If we apply tariffs on American goods coming to India, he'd say the US would also apply high tariffs on Indian goods. This is not good for our companies that are exporting to America," Mr Tharoor said.</p>

<p>"There could be difficulties in immigration issues. He has a very strong stand on immigration. If some of our people who have gone to the US want to take their families, and there's a shortage of visas, they may face problems," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Tharoor called for a balanced approach to China, considering the tough stand the US takes on the Asian giant's rise.</p>

<p>"In security matters, he doesn't like China at all. The US taking a tough stand on China is in our interest. But everything needs a balance. We have known Trump for some years. As I said, there are no surprises. We can engage with him, keeping these things in mind," Mr Tharoor said.</p>

<p>Mr Trump claimed a "magnificent" victory today over Kamala Harris in the fight for the presidency as results put him on the verge of one of the most stunning comebacks in US political history.</p>

<p>The Republican former president's address to a crowd of jubilant supporters came despite the fact that only Fox News had so far declared him the winner of the presidential election.</p>

<p>World leaders rushed to congratulate him before the final results were in, with Ukraine's president in particular urging Mr Trump to help achieve a "just peace" against Russia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As US election counting trends pointed to Donald Trump's comeback as President, his niece Mary L Trump said she was "deeply sorry". "I am so deeply sorry. I thought better of us," she said on X.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old is the daughter of Donald Trump's brother Fred Trump Jr., who died early. A psychologist, she has written a book an unauthorised biography of Donald Trump, titled: "Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man".</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I am so deeply sorry. I thought better of us.</p>
— Mary L Trump (@MaryLTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaryLTrump/status/1854059265415410166?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>A known Trump critic, she had backed Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election which Trump won. After the 2021 Capitol Hill riot, she said her uncle should be "barred from ever running for public office again".</p>

<p>Donald Trump is on the brink of a historic victory in an election that was expected to be a close fight, but ended up being an easy feat for the Republicans.</p>

<p>Addressing his supporters, he described it as a "magnificent victory for the American people". He also referred to the July 13 assassination attempt and said "God spared my life for a reason". He is currently winning 267 electoral college votes, three short of the magic figure of 270. The opponent, incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris is trailing at 224.</p>

<p>Describing the Republican campaign as the "greatest political movement of all time", Trump said, "We are going to help our country heal, fix our borders, we made history for a reason tonight. We have achieved the most incredible political win. I want to thank the American people. I will fight for you and your family with every breath in my body."</p>

<p>A massive factor in Trump's victory was the Republican sweep in seven swing or battleground states. From a 6-1 score in favour of Democrats in the 2020 polls, these seven states swung to a 7-0 advantage for Trump. The Republican leader has already won three swing states -- Georgia, Pennsylvania and North Carolina -- and is leading in Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan and Nevada.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA's Parker Solar Probe is all set to complete its final Venus gravity assist manoeuvre on Wednesday. It will pass within 233 miles (376 km) of the planet's surface. The US space agency said the flyby will adjust the spacecraft's trajectory into its final orbital configuration, bringing it to within 3.86 million miles of the solar surface by December 24, 2024. It will be the closest a human-made object has ever been to the Sun.</p>

<p>The Parker Solar Probe was launched in 2018 on the mission to "touch" the Sun. It is just about the size of a small car.</p>

<p><a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/final-venus-flyby-for-nasas-parker-solar-probe-queues-closest-sun-pass/" rel="nofollow,noindex">NASA said</a> Parker Solar Probe's flybys around the planet have been a major success for new Venus science, especially with the chance discovery from its Wide-Field Imager for Parker Solar Probe, or WISPR.</p>

<p>At the time of its third Venus flyby on July 11, 2020, the scientists turned the instrument towards Venus hoping to track the changes in the planet's thick cloud cover.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The WISPR cameras can see through the clouds to the surface of Venus, which glows in the near-infrared because it's so hot,” Noam Izenberg, a space scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland said.</p>

<p><strong>What next?</strong></p>

<p>The images from WISPR in 2020 and 2021 flyby revealed Venus' surface in a new light. With the November 6 flyby, the scientists are planning to seek answers to the puzzling questions of previous flybys.</p>

<p>Izenberg said the upcoming event will help scientists "evaluate whether WISPR can help us distinguish physical or even chemical properties of Venus' surface".</p>

<p>Post the Venus flyby on November 6, the spacecraft will be on course coming within 3.8 million miles of the solar surface, the primary objective of the mission first conceived more than 65 years ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During this time, the spacecraft is expected to cut through plumes of plasma still connected to the Sun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On December 24, 2024, the closest approach to the Sun will take place. During this time, the mission control will be out of contact with the spacecraft.&nbsp;After this, the spacecraft will send a beacon tone on December 27, 2024, to check on its health and confirm whether or not it was successful. It will continue to remain in this orbit for the remaining time in the mission and complete two more perihelia at the same distance.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US elections are such that American people take the call to elect the president, but the impact ripples through the world. China has a lot at stake when it comes to who comes to power in the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whether it's a Democrat or a Republican, the outcome of US-China relations will be similar as both the parties regard China as their adversary.</p>

<p>China is calling for "peaceful coexistence" with the United States as Donald Trump inches closer to winning the presidential election against Kamala Harris.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning emphasized China's commitment to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation in handling China-US relations, stating, "We will continue to approach and handle China-US relations based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation".</p>

<p>Mao Ning refrained from directly commenting on Trump's potential re-election but acknowledged the US presidential election as an internal US affair, saying, "We respect the choice of the American people".&nbsp;</p>

<p>When asked if Chinese President Xi Jinping would congratulate Trump on his win, Mao Ning replied, "After the US election results are released and officially announced, we will handle related matters in accordance with usual practice".</p>

<p>The US presidential election has been a hot topic on China's Weibo platform, with both Trump and Harris pledging to take a tougher stance on Beijing. Trump has promised tariffs of 60 per cent on all Chinese goods entering the country, which analysts believe could lead to a larger stimulus package in China.</p>

<p>Trump's stance on China has been remarkably consistent since his 2016 campaign. Back then, he claimed that China's growth came at the expense of the United States' economic interests and vowed to launch a trade war, which he ultimately did. Fast-forward to the present, Trump still maintains that China's success is rooted in "theft of intellectual property rights" and "unfair trade practices" that harm American interests.</p>

<p>China's relations with the US have been strained since Trump's presidency, marked by a trade war and tariffs imposed on Chinese goods due to alleged unfair practices, such as theft of US technology and currency manipulation. These tensions have persisted under Joe Biden's administration, with Washington introducing new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, EV batteries, and solar cells.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[2024 US Elections: Elon Musk's control over X (formerly Twitter) grants him a platform with unparalleled influence, allowing him to broadcast messages and shape opinions with an audience numbering in the hundreds of millions.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seven decades ago, a young Rupert Murdoch inherited a newspaper in Australia. The family-run publication would transform over the decades into the world's most influential media empire, guiding political direction in multiple countries. However, in the 21st century, the perception war, especially in the West, is largely fought on social media. Today, Murdoch is retired at 93, and a new figure has risen as the master of perception: Elon Musk.</p>

<p>Musk's control over X (formerly Twitter) grants him a platform with unparalleled influence, allowing him to broadcast messages and shape opinions with an audience numbering in the hundreds of millions. As Musk aligns his views with Donald Trump's "Make America Great Again" (MAGA) movement, he amplifies far-right rhetoric much like Murdoch once did. But Musk's methods and ambitions differ from those of his predecessor. His platform, X, functions as a digital megaphone broadcasting ideas that reach across the political spectrum, unlike Murdoch's newspapers, news channels or radio stations that catered to a specific subscriber base.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To understand Musk's influence, it is essential to first look at Murdoch's legacy. Fox News, his crowning achievement, became a mouthpiece of the Republican Party and a centre of conservative ideology in the US. In recent years, Murdoch's influence over the Republicans has waned. Attempts to make Trump politically irrelevant were unsuccessful, and as seen in the 2024 US Presidential election results, Trump's grip on the party has never been stronger. With Murdoch's declining control, another figure has stepped in.</p>

<p>As Trump sailed to victory in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world/elections">2024 presidential election</a>, Musk emerged as a powerful and vocal ally. Musk's acquisition of X has allowed him to shape the information ecosystem in ways that align with his ideology. Musk's controversial moderation policy changes have weakened X's ability to regulate harmful content, amplifying incendiary rhetoric and spreading misinformation.</p>

<p>Engaging with far-right accounts, the self-proclaimed "free speech absolutist" Musk has inadvertently provided these figures with a "personal algorithm booster," amplifying their reach and influence on the platform.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For Musk, X is more than a platform, it's a tool to challenge the establishment, and rally support for conservative ideals.</p>

<p>Musk's involvement in US politics raised alarm bells for election officials across critical battleground states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Arizona - three states where Trump is expected to win. The spread of misinformation has surged as X, under Musk's leadership, has become a key conduit for false narratives that undermine public trust in the electoral process. Officials, overwhelmed by the volume of falsehoods, are struggling to keep up. An election official in Arizona, even personally reached out to Musk, imploring him to curb the spread of election lies.</p>

<p>In Michigan, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson was forced to fact-check Musk directly on X after he shared inaccurate claims about voter registration. While her rebuttal garnered 33 million views, Musk responded by accusing her of lying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania, a wave of disinformation from X falsely suggested that incomplete voter registration forms were evidence of election fraud. This lie was spread by far-right accounts with large followings, casting doubt on the legitimacy of the election process. According to Common Cause, a nonpartisan organisation, election officials have struggled to debunk these claims, which continue to circulate unchallenged on X.</p>

<p>The intense campaigning for Trump on X, which Musk personally headed, paid dividends as Trump is set for a landslide victory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Musk's empire spans Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and X, all of which benefit from government contracts, subsidies, and favourable policies. Should Trump return to the White House, Musk's enterprises stand to gain even more.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At a drone testing field in southwestern Taiwan, university students watch anxiously as unmanned aerial vehicles they designed take off, land and, occasionally, crash in a simulated battlefield scenario.</p>

<p>They are taking part in a competition that is helping Taiwan's efforts to boost domestic drone production.</p>

<p>With Beijing sustaining military pressure on the island, Taipei is ramping up investment in unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, as it seeks to bolster a more agile defence against a potential Chinese attack.</p>

<p>Both Ukraine and Russia have used UAVs extensively throughout their conflict, for surveillance and striking targets deep behind frontlines.</p>

<p>The UAVs flying in the National Defense Application UAV Challenge could potentially be adopted by drone companies and procured by the government.</p>

<p>"We can see drone applications in many current conflicts happening around the world," said competition organiser Jan Shau-Shiun, a professor in the space systems engineering department at National Cheng Kung University.</p>

<p>"Taiwan is in a position where we may also face such an issue, so based on this theme, we aim to strengthen our drone capabilities."</p>

<p>China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and has refused to renounce the use of force to bring it under its control.</p>

<p>Now in its second year, the competition was held over two days last month at the Asia UAV AI Innovation Application R&amp;D Center in Chiayi county.</p>

<p>Twenty teams from across Taiwan gathered to put their drones to the test. The field will be whittled down to a shortlist this month for another challenge before the winner is declared next year.</p>

<p>Multi-rotor and fixed-wing drones were required to fly autonomously to a height of at least 60 metres (around 200 feet), take images of a remote target, and return to base within 10 minutes.</p>

<p>To make the scenario more realistic -- and difficult -- organisers this year used a jammer to disrupt satellite signals to the UAVs, making it harder for them to stay airborne.</p>

<p>"From observing the war in Ukraine and other conflicts, we can see that there's often interference on the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) before any fighting," said Jan.</p>

<p><strong>'Hands-on skills'</strong></p>

<p>After spending countless hours designing and building their drones, with help from local drone or electronic component companies, teams watched nervously as their UAVs took flight.</p>

<p>Some drones failed to reach the required height or crashed due to the jamming.</p>

<p>Cheng Yong-jen, 24, breathed a sigh of relief after the drone he helped design ascended, soared into the distance and safely returned.</p>

<p>"It crashed, we repaired, it crashed again and we repaired again," said Cheng, a graduate student from National Formosa University.</p>

<p>"When the drone finally descended, I was in tears."</p>

<p>Lin Chun-Liang, lead judge and professor in electrical engineering at National Chung Hsing University, said the competition helped students develop "hands-on skills" not taught in schools.</p>

<p>Taiwan is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to buy and develop drones, and also nurture local talent to work in the sector, as it races to upgrade its military capabilities.</p>

<p>President Lai Ching-te has pledged to make Taiwan "the Asian hub of unmanned aerial vehicle supply chains".</p>

<p>Keeping workers in the industry, however, is a challenge in Taiwan where the huge semiconductor sector can offer higher salaries to top graduates.</p>

<p>Cheng said he planned to join a drone company after finishing his master's thesis on defence drones, insisting "this is the path we must take".</p>

<p>"We cannot stop moving forward just because we are behind others," said Cheng.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Haunted by the daily violence ravaging the Middle East, Soujoud Hamade, a registered Democrat, felt compelled to back Green Party candidate Jill Stein in the US presidential election.</p>

<p>"It is very emotional," the 32-year-old real estate lawyer told AFP after casting her ballot Tuesday at a school in Dearborn, the nation's largest Arab-majority city, where voters could prove decisive in the key battleground of Michigan.</p>

<p>"Every time I watch the news or get on social media, I see my people being decimated, I see my home country being destroyed," added the Lebanese-American, disillusioned by the Biden-Harris administration's unwavering support for Israel.</p>

<p>Hamade says she's clear-eyed about the two-way nature of the race between Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican former President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Still, she insists her vote is far more than just a protest.</p>

<p>She's banking on helping Stein crack five percent of the national popular vote, a threshold that would unlock future federal funding for the Green Party and "move the needle forward" toward breaking the two-party hold on US politics.</p>

<p>Dearborn, a Detroit suburb famous as the birthplace of Henry Ford and the home of Ford Motor Company's headquarters, has a population of around 110,000, with 55 percent of residents claiming Middle Eastern or North African heritage.</p>

<p>The city overwhelmingly backed President Joe Biden in 2020, helping him narrowly flip Michigan blue.</p>

<p>But recent polling shows a shift away from the Democratic Party among Muslim and Arab-Americans.</p>

<p>That trend was evident in conversations with voters around the city on Election Day.</p>

<p><strong>'Single-issue voter'</strong></p>

<p>Stein, a Jewish physician and the Green Party's perennial left-wing candidate is predicted to do well among Muslims, as well as progressives and youth voters nationwide -- potentially acting as a spoiler for Harris.</p>

<p>"She's the only one who's anti-genocide," said Muhammad Hijazi, a 28-year-old engineer who described himself as a "single-issue voter" who had previously voted Democrat but had now "lost faith."</p>

<p>The Democrats, he argued, don't have a plan to bring peace to the Middle East, and he doesn't trust Trump to do any better.</p>

<p>Yet signs suggest Trump, too, may fare better than in past cycles. Unlike Harris, he visited Dearborn, addressing a modest-sized audience last week.</p>

<p>His outreach to Michigan's Muslim community secured endorsements from the Muslim mayors of Hamtramck and Dearborn Heights, while his newfound connection to the community -- through Lebanese-American son-in-law Michael Boulos, husband of Tiffany Trump -- has further endeared him.</p>

<p>Harris' decision to campaign with former Republican lawmaker Liz Cheney, a staunch supporter of the Iraq War, was the final straw for Dearborn Heights Mayor Bill Bazzi, he told Trump supporters at the former president's final Michigan rally.</p>

<p>Charles Fawaz, a 29-year-old first-grade teacher of Lebanese descent who voted for Trump, told AFP he was impressed that the former president "showed up."</p>

<p>"When Trump was president, everything was fine with our foreign policy because other leaders respected our country," Fawaz said.</p>

<p>Even if Trump doesn't deliver on Middle Eastern peace, he hopes Republicans will manage the economy better.</p>

<p>Former Democrats here say they know some liberals will blame them if Harris loses, but they reject the accusation.</p>

<p>"To put the onus on Arab Americans to vote for someone who's directly contributing to the genocide of other people is outrageous," Hamade said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump is set to enter the White House again. In his victory speech, he indicated one of the major policy decisions he will make will likely be about working to end wars around the world. Though he did not say where, Ukraine and Israel have been cited by geopolitical experts as the likely focus of Trump 2.0.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to start wars, I'm going to stop wars," the Republican US presidential nominee said in his victory speech.</p>

<p>"We had no wars, for four years we had no wars. Except we defeated ISIS," Mr Trump said.</p>

<p>During his last reign from 2016 to 2020, the billionaire businessman had become the first sitting US President to meet a North Korean leader when Mr Trump shook hands with Kim Jong Un at a historic summit in Singapore.</p>

<p>As the US election results unfolded today, Ukrainians nervously followed the news, some fearing that a victory for Mr Trump could halt Washington's vital aid to the nation fighting Russian forces.</p>

<p>The outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian army is on the backfoot against Russia's advancing troops. Moscow's alliance with North Korea also appears more solid than ever, with Washington and Seoul saying thousands of North Korean troops have been sent to Russia.</p>

<p>By contrast, Ukraine's war-fatigued backers could be further disheartened by the return to the White House of Mr Trump, who has given no assurance of support to Kyiv.</p>

<p>"A Trump victory would create grave risks. The situation would be alarming," former Ukrainian ambassador to the US Oleg Shamshur told news agency AFP.</p>

<p>Washington has driven NATO-wide support to Ukraine, with Kyiv receiving billions of dollars in financial and military aid enabling it to keep up the fight against a much more powerful Russia. That support has however been eroded in Europe and the United States over the past few months.</p>

<p>Mr Trump's repeated criticism of US support for Ukraine and claims that he would end the fighting within 24 hours, have only raised Ukraine's fears.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump is the second US president after Grover Cleveland to get elected for two non-consecutive terms.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump has become only the second President in the history of the United States to get elected for two non-consecutive terms.</p>

<p>His projected victory over Democratic nominee Kamala Harris comes after his defeat against Joe Biden in 2020.</p>

<p>Trump defeated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for his first term in the White House. Before Trump, only Grover Cleveland was elected the US President for two non-consecutive terms.<br />
<br />
<strong>Who Was Grover Cleveland?</strong><br />
<br />
Grover Cleveland, a lawyer and anti-corruption reformer, entered politics in his forties, initially serving as mayor of Buffalo and then governor of New York. In 1884, he overcame a scandal involving allegations of an affair and an illegitimate child to win the presidency. He was the first Democrat elected to the White House after the Civil War.<br />
<br />
In his first term, there were some critical moments, including the Haymarket Riot of 1886, a major event in the workers' rights movement, and the establishment of the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1887, which brought federal regulation to railroads.<br />
<br />
Despite his accomplishments, Cleveland's presidency was not without controversy. He angered some groups by vetoing pension bills for Civil War veterans and denying federal aid to farmers suffering from drought. In 1888, he ran for re-election but lost to Republican Benjamin Harrison, despite winning the popular vote.<br />
<br />
<strong>Grover Cleveland's Second Term</strong><br />
<br />
Grover Cleveland's defeat didn't mark the end of his political career. He was dissatisfied with the direction his party was taking under Harrison and worried that another nominee might lead to cronyism, something Cleveland had fought against. In 1892, he decided to run for a second term. This time, with the nation struggling through an economic crisis, his message of tariff reform gained significant traction, leading to a decisive victory.<br />
<br />
His second term was dominated by economic challenges, most prominently the Panic of 1893 and the Pullman Strike. Although his support within his own party waned, Cleveland's return to the White House remains one of the most unique chapters in American political history.<br />
<br />
Much like Cleveland, Trump's bid for a second term is fuelled by dissatisfaction with his successor, Joe Biden. Grover Cleveland and now Donald Trump's non-consecutive terms remain a rare feat in American history. Other presidents, like Martin Van Buren and Theodore Roosevelt, attempted comebacks but never succeeded.<br />
<br />
As of the latest updates, <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-results-2024-live-updates-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump-presidential-election-results-6948523#435030 ">Donald Trump</a> is on the brink of a landslide victory in the 2024 presidential election, securing 267 electoral votes compared to Kamala Harris' projected 224. This came after the former President swept the seven swing states. Having already won Georgia and North Carolina, the 79-year-old is leading in the other five -- Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Nevada.<br />
<br />
In <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-election-2024-swing-states-donald-trump-kamala-harris-is-trump-winning-all-7-battleground-states-democrats-scored-6-1-in-2020-6955140">his victory speech</a>, Trump described the Republican campaign as the "greatest political movement of all time", adding, "We are going to help our country heal, fix our borders, we made history for a reason tonight. We have achieved the most incredible political win. I want to thank the American people. I will fight for you and your family with every breath in my body."<br />
<br />
Harris has yet to concede.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
	<li>America's borders will be sealed immediately, allowing no illegal immigrants to enter the country.</li>
	<li>Hinting at the ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas-Lebanon conflict, Mr Trump said, "Won't start a war, will end one."</li>
	<li>Referring to federal income tax, he said his administration will be reducing taxes.</li>
	<li>Amid chants of "Bobby, Bobby", Mr Trump said vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr would&nbsp;“make America healthy again.” “He wants to do some things, and we're going to let him go to it,” he said, while looking at&nbsp;Kennedy, who has said in the past that&nbsp;he expects a prominent role in overseeing federal health agencies.</li>
	<li>"Leave the oil to me," Mr Trump quipped, referring to Robert F Kennedy Jr's career as an environmental lawyer who opposed big oil. "He's a great guy, and he really means that he wants to do some things, and we're going to let him go to it. I just said, 'But Bobby, leave the oil to me,'" he told his supporters.</li>
	<li>Referring to the two assassination attempts on him during the election campaign, he said, "Many people have told me that God spared my life for a reason, and that reason was to save our country."</li>
	<li>Mr Trump promised a golden age of America and vowed to fight for the country "every single day". "America's future will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer, and stronger than it has ever been before," he said.</li>
	<li>In a shoutout to tech billionaire Elon Musk, he called the SpaceX and Tesla founder a "new star".&nbsp;“We have to protect our geniuses. We don't have that many of them. We have to protect our super geniuses," he said.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of the US Election Day, Google CEO Sundar Pichai sent a company-wide memo reaffirming Google's commitment to providing trustworthy information. The tech giant, on numerous occasions, has faced accusations of bias from figures such as former US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Google has consistently denied these claims. Mr Pichai, however, reassured employees of their ongoing efforts to uphold Google's reputation as a neutral and reliable source.<br />
<br />
“Let's remember the role we play at work, through the products we build and as a business: to be a trusted source of information to people of every background and belief. We will and must maintain that,” Mr Pichai said in the memo obtained by the Washington Post.<br />
<br />
As Americans prepared to head to the polls, Mr Pichai said all employees should be “proud” of the work being done by Google and YouTube teams to ensure voters receive accurate and reliable information. The memo also acknowledged the company's efforts to keep campaigns secure, provide voters with accurate details on where and how to vote, and deliver advertising solutions for political campaigns.<br />
<br />
In his memo, Mr Pichai also recognised the global scope of these efforts, noting that elections in various countries such as France, India, the UK, and Mexico had been supported by Google in 2024, with over a billion people participating in elections this year alone.<br />
<br />
“Thanks to everyone working around the clock on these efforts throughout the campaign season and as votes are tallied,” Mr Pichai added.<br />
<br />
Looking ahead, Mr Pichai urged employees to continue adhering to Google's Community Guidelines and Personal Political Activity Policy, especially as the election's outcome will spark discussion all over. He stressed that the company's mission to organise and make the world's information universally accessible and useful would continue beyond Election Day.<br />
<br />
“Beyond election day, our work to organise the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful will continue,” he said. “Our company is at its best when we're focused on that.”<br />
<br />
Earlier, Donald Trump claimed that <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-claims-great-guy-sundar-pichai-praised-his-mcdonalds-visit-as-google-hit-6883854 ">Sundar Pichai</a> called him to compliment his visit to McDonald's. Mr Trump said that Mr Pichai told him the visit was “one of the biggest things we've ever had on Google.” Trump had visited the fast-food chain in Pennsylvania as a political move, targeting Vice President Kamala Harris, who had previously discussed her time working at McDonald's.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-results-2024-live-updates-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump-presidential-election-results-6948523#435030">latest update</a>, the US presidential race remains too close to call. Republican Donald Trump has secured 267 electoral votes, leading over his Democratic counterpart Kamala Harris, who trails with 224 votes. A total of 270 electoral votes are needed to win.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As US election counting trends pointed to a clear win for Republicans, Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Donald Trump on his comeback as President. Describing Trump as "my friend", the Prime Minister said in a post on X, "Heartiest congratulations my friend @realDonaldTrump on your historic election victory."</p>

<p>"As you build on the successes of your previous term, I look forward to renewing our collaboration to further strengthen the India-US Comprehensive Global and Strategic Partnership. Together, let's work for the betterment of our people and to promote global peace, stability and prosperity," he added.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) <a href="https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1854075308472926675?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Donald Trump is on the brink of a massive victory in what was predicted to be a close election. The Republicans managed to swing all seven battleground states to their advantage -- a stunning feat considering the Democrats won them 6-1 in the 2020 election.</p>

<p>Addressing his supporters as the poll projections pointed to his victory, Trump said it was a "magnificent victory for the American people". He also referred to the July 13 assassination attempt and said "God spared my life for a reason".</p>

<p>Describing the Republican campaign as the "greatest political movement of all time", Trump said, "We are going to help our country heal, fix our borders, we made history for a reason tonight. We have achieved the most incredible political win. I want to thank the American people. I will fight for you and your family with every breath in my body."</p>

<p>Trump said the Democrats are now looking at a massive electoral votes score of 315.</p>

<p>What makes the Republican victory bigger is the fact that they have also taken control of the Senate and are leading in the election for the House of Representatives.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Though Nostradamus' prophecies more often than not miss the mark, they do provide a certain thrill to the people reading them.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As 2024 draws to an end, social media users have once again turned to the 'prophet of doom', Nostradamus, for their fill of 2025 predictions. Born Michel de Nostredame, Nostradamus was a French astrologer and physician who lived in the 1500s and predicted some of the modern-day epochal moments such as Adolf Hitler's rise to power, the September 11 attacks and the COVID-19 pandemic. He is best known for his book Les Prophetis (The Prophecies), published in 1555, which contains 942 poetic quatrains that are widely interpreted for global events.</p>

<p>Researchers analysing his work have hinted that 2025 may have some hard-hitting events in store, ranging from an asteroid collision to another plague-like outbreak in the UK. Though Nostradamus' prophecies more often than not miss the mark, they do provide a certain thrill to the people reading them.</p>

<h3><strong>End of Russia-Ukraine war?</strong></h3>

<p>Nostradamus' 2024 prediction included the continuation of a continent-wide war but as per his vague writings, 2025 may witness a potential end to one of the long-running wars. The astrologer said owing to the exhaustion of the war, perhaps referring to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict that started in 2022, both sides may call it quits.</p>

<p>"Through long war all the army exhausted,so that they do not find money for the soldiers; instead of gold or silver, they will come to coin leather, Gallic brass, and the crescent sign of the Moon," he wrote.</p>

<p>The mention of "Gallic brass" and "sign of the moon" has led social media users to believe that France and Turkey may get involved in the conflict.</p>

<h3><strong>Plague and war</strong></h3>

<p>Nostradamus has predicted that the new year will weigh heavily on England which will be beset by "cruel wars' and face an "ancient plague" outbreak that would be "worse than enemies". Since his COVID-19 pandemic prediction came true, experts have put a pin on this prophecy.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/living-nostradamus-claims-four-prophecies-fulfilled-predicts-more-unforeseen-events-6564988" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Also Read | 'Living Nostradamus' Claims Four Prophecies Fulfilled, Predicts More Unforeseen Events</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>Asteroid collision with Earth?</strong></h3>

<p>While other events may not cause civilisation loss, Nostradamus has predicted that 2025 may witness a giant asteroid collodion with the Earth, or coming in dangerous proximity to the planet. Though the prediction might suggest a wipeout of life from Earth, asteroids coming close to the planet is not a new phenomenon. Several hundred asteroids whiz past Earth every year with the majority of them maintaining a safe distance.</p>

<h3><strong>Natural disasters in Brazil</strong></h3>

<p>The prophecy also stated that the South American country of Brazil, which Nostradamus refers to as the "Garden of the World", may face flooding and potential volcanic activity, linked to climate change.</p>

<p>"Garden of the world near the new city, In the path of the hollow mountains: It will be seized and plunged into the Tub, Forced to drink waters poisoned by sulfur," read the eerie piece.</p>

<p>According to reports, Nostradamus' bleak worldview stems from heavy consumption of the Old Testament and the trauma of losing his wife and young children to illness, presumably the plague. Unable to save his loved one, Nostradamus sought solace in predicting doom and gloom that may befall humanity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The toll for 2024 is down on the 129 deaths in 2023 but still makes it "one of the worst years" on record, IFJ general secretary Anthony Bellanger told AFP.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year has been "particularly deadly" for journalists with 104 killed worldwide, over half of them being in Gaza, the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) said Tuesday.</p>

<p>The toll for 2024 is down on the 129 deaths in 2023 but still makes it "one of the worst years" on record, IFJ general secretary Anthony Bellanger told AFP.</p>

<p>According to the figures collated by the press group 55 Palestinian media workers were killed in 2024 in the face of Israel's offensive in Gaza.</p>

<p>"Since the start of the war on 7 October 2023, at least 138 Palestinian journalists have been killed," the federation said.</p>

<p>Bellanger condemned the "massacre that is happening before the eyes of the world".</p>

<p>He said that "many journalists were targeted" in Gaza deliberately, while others had found themselves "in the wrong place, at the wrong time" in the fighting.</p>

<p>After the Middle East, the second most dangerous region for journalists was Asia with 20 killed, including six in Pakistan, five in Bangladesh and three in India.</p>

<p>In Europe, the war in Ukraine continued to claim journalist victims with four killed in 2024.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the IFJ said that across the globe 520 journalists were in prison -- a sharp uptick on the 427 being held behind bars last year.</p>

<p>China topped the list as the worst jailer of reporters with 135 being detained, including in Hong Kong, where the authorities have been criticised by Western nations for imposing national security laws quashing dissent and other freedoms.</p>

<p>The IFJ's count for the number of journalists killed is typically far higher than that of Reporters Without Borders, due to different counting methods.</p>

<p>In 2023 Reporters Without Borders said 54 journalists and two collaborators were killed in the course of their work. The NGO will publish its own figure for 2024 later this week.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old Ivy League graduate who is "person of interest" in the Manhattan killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, was reportedly carrying a manifesto railing against "corporate America" at the time of his arrest.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old Ivy League graduate who is a "strong person of interest" in the Manhattan killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, was reportedly carrying a manifesto railing against "corporate America" at the time of his arrest. The two-page handwritten document criticized the healthcare industry for putting profits above care and suggested that violence is the answer, according to senior law enforcement officials.</p>

<p>"I do apologize for any strife and trauma, but it had to be done," a police official who has seen the document told CNN.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the note, Mangione said he acted alone and that he was self-funded. "These parasites had it coming," it added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The document also included a screed against the healthcare industry, with Mangione lamenting the costs of healthcare, asking why the United States has the most expensive healthcare in the world but is rated poorly for life expectancy.</p>

<p>The US reportedly ranked 49 in life expectancy in 2022, per a report by the Associated Press story from August 2007. However, the country is expected to drop to 66th position globally in 2050, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the motive of Thompson's killing is still unknown, reports suggest Mangione's alleged actions could have been a political act. If &nbsp;Mangione is found guilty of Thompson's murder, the manifesto would be the second message from him. Earlier, it was found that the killer engraved 'Deny, defend, depose' on the casings of the bullet used in the UnitedHealthcare CEO's killing. &nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Luigi Mangione's Arrest</strong></h2>

<p>In addition to the manifesto, Mangione was also found carrying a gun, and a silencer, among other items at the time of his arrest in an Altoona, Pennsylvania, McDonald's. He has been charged with possession of an illegal weapon, forgery and other crimes in Pennsylvania after being arrested at a McDonald's on Monday morning.</p>

<p>Mangione was caught after an employee at the fast-food chain recognized him and alerted the police. "He was sitting there eating," The Guardian reported Joseph Kenny, the New York City police department's chief of detectives as saying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was reportedly found carrying identification with his name on it, along with a fake New Jersey ID - the same that police believe the gunman showed when he checked into a hostel on the Upper West Side of Manhattan on 24 November after Thompson's murder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The UnitedHealthcare CEO's killing in broad daylight shocked many Americans but also sparked an outrage at the US's profit-driven healthcare industry.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>About Luigi Mangione</strong></h2>

<p>Mangione social media presence shows that he belongs to a well-to-do family. Per his LinkedIn page, he has a bachelor's and master's degree in science engineering from the University of Pennsylvania. The claims were confirmed by a university spokesperson.</p>

<p>The suspect was reportedly born and raised in Maryland and has lived in San Francisco and Honolulu. As per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/09/unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-suspect-arrested" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">The Guardian </a>report, he was a valedictorian at Gilman High School in 2016, where he had expressed his desire to study at the University of Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/us/live-news/brian-thompson-unitedhealthcare-death-investigation-12-9-24#cm4hdmno4000b3b6mea2l9cef" rel="No Follow, Ni Index" target="_blank">CNN</a> reported that Mangione is the grandson of Nicholas Mangione, a prominent Baltimore real estate developer. The Mangione family reportedly owns Lorien Health Systems, a nursing home chain in Maryland, where the suspect volunteered in 2014, according to his LinkedIn page.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US detectives have arrested a 26-year-old suspect - a former Ivy League student - from Pennsylvania after a nationwide manhunt over UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson's killing in New York. Luigi Mangione was found with a "ghost gun" that was capable of firing 9MM rounds. He has been charged with the possession of fake IDs and a gun. Thompson, 50, was shot dead by the gunman last week when he was attending an investors' conference.</p>

<h2><strong>How the suspect was identified</strong></h2>

<p>The cops obtained his image from a youth hostel where he had stayed before the murder. Reports suggest he had lowered his mask to flirt with a receptionist, during which he got clicked.</p>

<p><strong>Read:&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/26-year-old-man-arrested-over-unitedhealthcare-ceos-murder-police-7211564">Ex-Ivy League Student, 26, Arrested For UnitedHealthcare CEO's Murder</a></p>

<p>New York mayor Eric Adams said he matched the description of the suspect they have been looking for. He was also found carrying many items that the cops believe are connected to the murder.</p>

<h2><strong>How cops caught Mangione</strong></h2>

<p>The staff at the Altoona McDonald's branch had tipped off the cops about Mangione. He was wearing a mask and a beanie and working on a laptop at that time.</p>

<p>When the officers approached him, he gave them a fake ID.</p>

<p>Mangione, who studied at the Ivy League University of Pennsylvania, had used one of the fake IDs to check in to a hotel in Manhattan in New York before the murder, the police said.</p>

<p>He "became quiet and started to shake" when the officers asked him if he had been to New York recently, they added.</p>

<p>Cops say material recovered from Mangione suggested he had "ill will towards corporate America." Reports suggest the suspect had raised the high cost of healthcare in the US in the two-page note, adding that&nbsp;"these parasites had it coming."</p>

<h2><strong>How he fled crime scene</strong></h2>

<p>The suspect approached Thompson from behind, wearing a hooded top and his lower face covered, and fired at him several times, video footage showed last week. Several bystanders were present during the murder and the attack was captured on CCTV.</p>

<p>As the UnitedHealthcare CEO fell on the ground, the suspect fled on foot and then rode a bike to Central Park. From there, he took a bus and disappeared, sparking a nationwide manhunt.</p>

<p>Murder charges would follow against Mangione in New York state, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro told reporters, adding that people don't kill others in cold blood to resolve policy differences. He must be extradited to New York to face the murder charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Human Rights Day 2024: The UN  has decided to dedicate the theme of Human Rights Day this year to "Our Rights, Our Future, Right Now".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Human Rights Day 2024:</strong> Human Rights Day is celebrated every year on December 10 to commemorate the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 1948. The day is intended to celebrate and promote rights that protect against abuses, violations and other harms, ensuring everyone can live in dignity and respect -- irrespective of their race, gender, religion, nationality or any other factor. As per the UN, "upholding human rights is not only about addressing present injustices, it's about reshaping unjust societies and empowering marginalised groups".</p>

<h3><strong>Theme for Human Rights Day 2024</strong></h3>

<p>This year's theme for Human Rights Day is: "Our Rights, Our Future, Right Now" which reinforces how human rights affect people everywhere, every day.</p>

<p>"Human rights have a tangible positive impact and offer practical solutions. By embracing the full power of human rights as the path to the future we want, the world can become more peaceful and equal," the UN said announcing the theme.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-says-us-report-on-alleged-human-rights-abuses-reflects-deep-biases-very-poor-understanding-of-india-5520822" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Also Read | "Poor Understanding": India Trashes US Report On Alleged Rights Abuse</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>History and significance</strong></h3>

<p>Human rights are protected by international and national laws and treaties globally. The mission to protect human rights around the world has been tasked to a 47-member grouping known as the Human Rights Council.</p>

<p>These UN member-states are empowered to prevent inequality, abuses and discrimination, protect the most vulnerable, and punish the perpetrators of human rights violations.</p>

<h3><strong>Why are human rights necessary?</strong></h3>

<p>Human rights are necessary and their defence even more so to prevent harm befalling any marginalised individual or group. They have a preventative, protective as well as a transformative role to play in civil society.</p>

<h3><strong>India reaffirms its commitment</strong></h3>

<p>On the eve of Human Rights Day, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) Acting Chairperson, Vijaya Bharathi Sayani said India remained committed to upholding the human rights of every individual.</p>

<p>"This significant day, observed every year on 10th December since 1950, commemorates the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) by the United Nations in 1948. For India, this day holds special significance, as Indian representatives made a pivotal contribution to the drafting of this landmark document, which embodies humanity's shared commitment to dignity, justice, and equality," said Mr Sayani.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A criminology student in the UK has been accused of killing a woman while injuring another as he wanted to "know what it would be like to take a life", according to the prosecutors.&nbsp;Nasen Saadi, 20, killed Amie Gray, 34, and seriously injured 38-year-old Leanne Miles on Durley Chine Beach in Bournemouth in&nbsp;May, earlier this year.&nbsp;Saadi started his pursuit to kill someone in April as he looked for a place for the attack. After researching beaches in the south of England, he settled on Bournemouth, according to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceqlnpg0gr1o" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>BBC </em></a>report.</p>

<p>"He seems to have wanted to know what it would be like to take life, &nbsp;perhaps he wanted to know what it would be like to make women feel afraid, perhaps he thought it would make him feel powerful, make him interesting to others," Sarah Jones KC, the prosecutor told the jury at the Winchester Crown Court.</p>

<p>On the night of the stabbings, the two women were sitting on the sand where they had lit a fire and were watching the full moon. Both were chatting and sharing stories when Saadi, 20, 'hovering at the edges of the promenade" stepped up and executed the knife attack on the two unsuspecting women.</p>

<h3><strong>Fascinated by true crime</strong></h3>

<p>Ms Gray suffered 10 thrusts from the knife, including one to her heart and succumbed to the injuries on the beach. Ms Miles suffered about 20 wounds but managed to survive.</p>

<p>"In an act horrifying in its savagery and in its randomness he stabbed them both multiple times, chasing after them as they tried to escape or divert him from the other and continued his attack," Ms Jones said.</p>

<p>"He left them on the sand to bleed to death while he moved away and tried to disappear back into the shadows, away from the glare of the streetlights or the moonlight and back into anonymity. He got rid of his weapon. He changed his clothes and shoes and got rid of them," the barrister added.</p>

<p>Saddi told the police he was fascinated by true crime and was in Bournemouth at the time of the attacks but denied any involvement. He left the area the next day and was arrested on May 28 with the police finding knives in his bedside drawer and hidden between a wall and wardrobe.</p>

<p>Despite the overwhelming evidence against him, Saadi has pleaded not guilty to murder and attempted murder as the trial continues.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump on Monday nominated Indian-American Harmeet K Dhillon as Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at the Department of Justice.</p>

<p>“I am pleased to nominate Harmeet K. Dhillon as Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at the US Department of Justice,” Trump announced on Truth Social, a social media platform owned by him.</p>

<p>“Throughout her career, Harmeet has stood up consistently to protect our cherished civil liberties, including taking on big tech for censoring our free speech, representing Christians who were prevented from praying together during COVID, and suing corporations who use woke policies to discriminate against their workers,” he said.</p>

<p>“Harmeet is one of the top election lawyers in the country, fighting to ensure that all, and ONLY, legal votes are counted. She is a graduate of Dartmouth College and the University of Virginia Law School, and clerked in the US Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals,” Trump said.</p>

<p>“Harmeet is a respected member of the Sikh religious community. In her new role at the DOJ, Harmeet will be a tireless defender of our constitutional rights, and will enforce our civil rights and election laws FAIRLY and FIRMLY,” said the President-elect.</p>

<p>Dhillon was subject to racial attack after she recited Ardas at the Republican National Convention in July this year. Last year she unsuccessfully ran for the position of Republican National Committee chairmanship.</p>

<p>Chandigarh-born Dhillon, 54, moved to the United States when she was a child along with her parents. In 2016, she was the first Indian-American to appear on the stage of the GOP Convention in Cleveland.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anoushka Kale has been elected president of the University of Cambridge's renowned Cambridge Union Society for the Easter term following an uncontested race. The 20-year-old British Indian student will reportedly become the first female Union president since last Easter term. She is the fourth candidate in five elections to become president unopposed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Kale is reading English Literature at Sidney Sussex College at Cambridge University. She is among the few South Asian heritage female members to take on the prestigious role. As the serving Debates Officer of the society, she ran on a platform of strengthening ties with cultural societies of the university such as the India Society.</p>

<p>The president-elect won 126 votes to be elected uncontested for the next 2025 Easter term, with 25 members balloting to re-open nominations. Her campaign centred around improving "diversity and access" at the Union. She has promised to strengthen "ties with cultural and access-based societies" and reduce access ticket costs, according to a report by Variety.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Kale's pledges find root in the Cambridge Union's decision to increase their membership fees earlier this year amid financial pressures and increasing "upkeep costs" of its Grade-II listed heritage building.</p>

<p>After her victory, Ms Kale told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/28700" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Varsity</a>, "I am absolutely delighted and honoured to have been elected as President of the Cambridge Union Society for Easter 2025 and grateful for the membership's support,"</p>

<p>"For my term, I will seek to expand diversity and access at the Union through greater collaboration with cultural groups, like the university's India Society. I am also especially passionate about continuing to host international speakers and global debate motions, as I did as Debates Officer of the society," she added.</p>

<p>She further said that she's looking forward to delivering on her manifesto promises, "particularly on expanding diversity through society collaborations and reduced access tickets for the summer garden party."</p>

<p>"A key component of my platform was delivering more for members, which I will prioritise throughout the term with a members' motion and debate dinner ballots. Bringing new faces onto committees and increasing membership engagement is crucial to making our elections more contested again, which I pledge to push for," she added</p>

<h2><strong>About Cambridge Union Society</strong></h2>

<p>Cambridge Union Society is one of the world's oldest debating societies founded in 1815, known for its commitment to free speech.</p>

<p>Former presidents and officers of the Cambridge Union Society have included celebrated English economist and philosopher John Maynard Keynes, novelist Robert Harris and, in recent years, British Indian peer and founder of Cobra Beer Karan Bilimoria.</p>

<p>Like the Oxford University's Oxford Union Society, the Cambridge Union has a long tradition of hosting prominent figures from all areas of public life in its chamber, from US presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and UK Prime Ministers Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher and John Major, to Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates and the Dalai Lama.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli troops that have moved into the buffer zone on the edge of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights "constitute a violation" of the 1974 disengagement agreement between Israel and Syria, a UN spokesman said Monday.</p>

<p>The UN peacekeeping force deployed in the Golan Heights, known as UNDOF, "informed the Israeli counterparts that these actions would constitute a violation of the 1974 disengagement agreement," said Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.</p>

<p>Stephane Dujarric said that the Israeli forces that entered the zone were still present in at least three locations.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Sunday he had ordered the army to "seize" the demilitarized zone in the Syrian-controlled part of the Golan Heights after rebels swept Syrian president Bashar al-Assad from power.</p>

<p>Most of the Golan Heights plateau has been occupied since 1967 by Israel, which later annexed it in a move not recognized by most of the international community.</p>

<p>In 1974 a buffer zone was established to separate the Israeli-held and Syrian territories, with UN peacekeepers stationed there.</p>

<p>Amid the downfall of Assad, Israel announced a troop deployment to the Golan Heights citing "the possible entry of armed individuals into the buffer zone."</p>

<p>Israeli forces "will continue to operate as long as necessary in order to preserve the buffer zone and defend Israel," it added.</p>

<p>Israeli troops "have entered the area of separation and have been moving within that area where they remain in at least three locations throughout the area of separation," Dujarric said.</p>

<p>"There should be no military forces or activities in the area of separation. And Israel and Syria must continue to uphold the terms of that 1974 agreement, and preserve stability in the Golan," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is set to take the stand on Tuesday for the first time in his long-running corruption trial under a court order that is likely to force him to juggle between the courtroom and war room for weeks.</p>

<p>Israel has been waging war against the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza for more than a year, during which Netanyahu had been granted a delay for the start of his court appearances. But on Thursday, the judges ruled that he must start testifying.</p>

<p>Charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust, Netanyahu will testify three times a week, the court said, despite the Gaza war and possible new threats posed by wider turmoil in the Middle East, including in neighbouring Syria.</p>

<p>Netanyahu was indicted in 2019 in three cases involving gifts from millionaire friends and for allegedly seeking regulatory favours for media tycoons in return for favourable coverage. He denies any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>In the run-up to his court date, Netanyahu revived familiar pre-war rhetoric against law enforcement, describing investigations against him as a witch hunt. He denies the charges and has pleaded not guilty.</p>

<p>"The real threat to democracy in Israel is not posed by the public's elected representatives, but by some among the law enforcement authorities who refuse to accept the voters' choice and are trying to carry out a coup with rabid political investigations that are unacceptable in any democracy," he said in a statement on Thursday.</p>

<p>At a Monday night press conference Netanyahu said he had waited eight years to be able to tell his story and expressed outrage at the way witnesses had been treated during investigations.</p>

<p>Before the war, Netanyahu's legal troubles bitterly divided Israelis and shook Israeli politics through five rounds of elections. His government's bid last year to curb the powers of the judiciary further polarised Israelis.</p>

<p>The shock Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and the ensuing Gaza war swept Netanyahu's trial off the public agenda as Israelis came together in grief and trauma. But as the war dragged on, political unity crumbled.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, while fighting abated on one front after Israel reached a ceasefire with Hamas' Lebanese ally Hezbollah, members of Netanyahu's cabinet, including his justice and police ministers, have clashed with the judiciary.</p>

<p>In power almost consecutively since 2009, Netanyahu, 75, is Israel's longest serving leader and its first sitting prime minister to be charged with a crime.</p>

<p>His domestic legal battles were compounded last month when the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for him and his former defence chief Yoav Gallant along with a Hamas leader, for alleged war crimes in the Gaza conflict.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A 26-year-old man was arrested Monday after the targeted killing of a top health insurance executive on the streets of New York, police said, crediting a McDonald's employee in Pennsylvania who spotted a suspicious-looking customer.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 26-year-old man was arrested Monday over the targeted killing of a health insurance executive on the streets of New York, with investigators charging him with possession of fake IDs and a gun.</p>

<p>Investigators continued to interrogate Luigi Mangione in connection with last week's brazen murder, which triggered a nationwide manhunt and global headlines.</p>

<p>He arrived at a Pennsylvania court wearing a dark sweatshirt after 6:00 pm (2300 GMT) Monday and was led inside by Altoona police flanked by NYPD detectives where he was arraigned, broadcasters showed.</p>

<p>Mangione is next due to appear in court on December 23.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said that murder charges in New York state would follow, telling a media briefing "we do not kill people in cold blood to resolve policy differences or express a viewpoint."</p>

<p>Police have not confirmed reports the words "delay" and "deny" -- language used by insurers to reject claims -- were written on casings found at the scene, hinting at a possible political motive for the crime.</p>

<p>Mangione was apprehended by officers following a tip from staff at an Altoona McDonald's branch, where he was found wearing a mask and a beanie while using a laptop, and gave officers a fake ID, charging documents show.</p>

<p>They then searched him and found what police called a "ghost gun" capable of firing 9MM rounds and equipped with a suppressor that could have been made on a 3D printer.</p>

<p>When officers asked if he had been to New York recently, Mangione "became quiet and started to shake," according to the criminal complaint.</p>

<p>One of the fake IDs found was that used to check in to a Manhattan hostel ahead of the attack, discovered alongside a document that spoke to Mangione's "motivation and mindset," New York police said.</p>

<p>Mangione was born and raised in Maryland, studied at the Ivy League University of Pennsylvania, and had been living in Hawaii ahead of the killing.</p>

<p>"He matches the description of the identification we've been looking for. He's also in possession of several items that we believe will connect him to this incident," said New York mayor Eric Adams.</p>

<p>Police told reporters that Mangione possessed material that suggested he had "ill-will towards corporate America."</p>

<p>Mangione's LinkedIn profile showed he worked as a data engineer at TrueCar, a California-based online auto marketplace that said he left their employment in 2023.</p>

<p><strong>Fled by bike</strong></p>

<p>In last Wednesday's shooting, the gunman walked up behind Brian Thompson, a senior executive at UnitedHealthcare -- one of the country's largest medical insurers -- and shot him dead in front of bystanders.</p>

<p>The attack was captured by a surveillance camera and the footage seen by millions around the world as interest in the manhunt and mystery over the killer's motives built to a frenzy.</p>

<p>Thompson, 50, was attending an investor conference in the Midtown business district.</p>

<p>Detectives said the suspect fled the crime scene on foot before riding a bike to Central Park and later boarding a bus from a terminal in the north of the city connecting New York to surrounding states and beyond.</p>

<p>Video footage shows Thompson on the sidewalk outside the New York Hilton Midtown when a man in a hooded top, his lower face covered, approaches from behind and fires several shots at the father-of-two, who crumples to the ground.</p>

<p>An image released of the suspect was obtained from a youth hostel where the gunman apparently stayed before the hit, with media reporting he had lowered his mask to flirt with a receptionist.</p>

<p>A photo on what appeared to be one of Mangione's social media accounts includes an X-ray of an apparently injured spine, though no explicit political affiliation has emerged.</p>

<p>The highly profitable US medical insurance system is the source of deep frustration and anger among many Americans due to its steep costs and limited coverage, and Thompson's death was greeted with an absence of sympathy by some.</p>

<p>A Facebook post mourning his loss, shared by UnitedHealth Group, racked up more than 71,000 laugh emojis within two days before the counter was disabled.</p>

<p>Mangione must now be extradited from Pennsylvania to New York to face murder charges, police said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday he would not stop the war in Gaza "now", with renewed efforts towards a ceasefire underway.</p>

<p>Speaking at a press conference in Jerusalem 14 months into the war against Hamas Palestinian operatives, he said "if we end the war now, Hamas will return, recover, rebuild and attack us again -- and that is what we do not want to go back to".</p>

<p>Netanyahu reiterated that he had set the goal of "the annihilation of Hamas, the elimination of its military and administrative capabilities" to prevent future attacks but said that the objective was not yet complete.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on October 23 that Israel had "managed to dismantle Hamas's military capacity" and eliminated its senior leadership. With those successes, he said, it was time to "get the hostages home and bring the war to an end with an understanding of what will follow."</p>

<p>In recent days, there had been signs that months of failed ceasefire and hostage release negotiations might be revived and achieve a breakthrough.</p>

<p>Qatar, a main mediator, said on Saturday there was new "momentum" for negotiations created by the election of Donald Trump in the United States.</p>

<p>A source close to the Hamas delegation said at the same time that Turkey as well as Egypt and Qatar had been "making commendable efforts to stop the war," and a new round of talks could begin soon.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the prime minister met with the families of hostages held in Gaza and said that Israel's wars on Hezbollah and Hamas would facilitate negotiations for their release.</p>

<p>Protesters, including relatives of the hostages, have repeatedly called for a deal to free the captives and accused him of prolonging the war.</p>

<p>The war in Gaza was sparked by Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack which resulted in the deaths of 1,208 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official data.</p>

<p>During the attack, operatives also kidnapped 251 hostages, 96 of whom remain in Gaza, including 34 who the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed at least 44,758 people, mostly civilians, according to data from the Hamas-run health ministry that is considered reliable by the UN.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities on Monday detained a man in central Pennsylvania in connection with last week's murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson after finding him in possession of a gun, a silencer and false identification cards similar to those used by the killer, several media outlets reported.</p>

<p>Investigators received a tip about the man after he was spotted at a McDonald's in Altoona by someone who thought he looked like the suspected killer, CNN reported, citing unnamed officials.</p>

<p>The man being questioned had a handwritten "manifesto" criticizing healthcare companies for prioritizing profits over care, the New York Times reported, citing a law enforcement official.</p>

<p>One of the false cards found on the man also matched the ID used by the suspect to check into a hostel in Manhattan before the shooting, the Times reported.</p>

<p>The man has been arrested on local charges, possibly in connection with presenting a false ID to police, and New York detectives are headed to Altoona, according to the Times.</p>

<p>Neither the New York City Police Department nor the Altoona Police Department responded to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Thompson, 50, was gunned down outside a Manhattan hotel early on Wednesday morning by a masked man who appeared to wait for his arrival before shooting the executive from behind.</p>

<p>Police have not publicly identified a motive but have said Thompson appeared to be deliberately targeted.</p>

<p>The words "deny," "defend" and "depose" were carved into shell casings found at the scene, several news outlets have reported. The words evoke the title of a book critical of the insurance industry published in 2010 titled "Delay, Deny, Defend: Why Insurance Companies Don't Pay Claims and What You Can Do About It."</p>

<p>The suspect, who has not been identified by police, ran from the scene and then rode a bike into Central Park. Surveillance video captured him exiting the park and taking a taxi to a bus station in northern Manhattan, where police believe he used a bus to flee the city.</p>

<p>Thompson, a father of two, had been CEO of UnitedHealth Group's insurance unit since April 2021, part of a 20-year career with the company. He had been in New York to attend the company's annual investor conference.</p>

<p>A UnitedHealth spokesperson declined to comment on the latest reports.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US unveiled sanctions Monday against Bashar al-Assad's father-in-law, a day after the former Syrian president reportedly fled to Russia as rebels took over the capital Damascus.</p>

<p>Assad's abrupt departure brought to a spectacular end five decades of brutal rule by his clan over a country ravaged by one of the deadliest wars of the century.</p>

<p>He oversaw a crackdown on a pro-democracy movement that erupted in 2011, sparking a civil war that killed 500,000 people and forced half the country to flee their homes.</p>

<p>The Treasury Department announced in a statement that Fawaz al-Akhras was being designated for providing "support and facilitation to Bashar al-Assad related to financial matters, sanctions evasion and attempts by Bashar al-Assad to achieve international political engagement."</p>

<p>Akhras was born in the Syrian city of Homs in September 1946, and is a dual Syrian and UK national, according to the Treasury's list of sanctioned individuals.</p>

<p>He trained as a cardiologist, and practised medicine in London, where his daughter Asma -- who is married to the toppled former president -- was born.</p>

<p>Akhras, whose registered address is an unassuming house in west London, was previously sanctioned by the US in 2020 along with Asma, his wife Sahar, and several other family members.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Extreme heat poses a greater risk to younger populations than the elderly, according to a new analysis which revealed that 75 per cent of heat-related deaths in Mexico from 1998-2019 occurred among those aged under 35 years.</p>

<p>Researchers, including those from Columbia University, US, said the findings challenge the conventional belief that the elderly population are especially vulnerable to extreme heat on its head.</p>

<p>"It's a surprise. The young are physiologically the most robust people in the population. I would love to know why this is so," co-author Jeffrey Shrader of the Center for Environmental Economics and Policy, Columbia University's Climate School, said.</p>

<p>Published in the journal Science Advances, the team analysed excess deaths -- the number of deaths more or less than the average -- with 'wet-bulb' temperatures, a metric that combines heat and humidity or humid-heat to measure their intensified effects.</p>

<p>They found that over the two decades, the country suffered about 3,300 deaths a year related to heat, with nearly a third occurring in people aged 18-35 years. Children aged under five years, especially infants, too were found to be highly vulnerable.</p>

<p>However, people aged 50 years and above, usually considered at high risk in a warmer future, suffered the least levels of heat-related death. Instead, people in the age group died predominantly from modest cold, the team found.</p>

<p>They explained that while Mexico is mainly tropical and subtropical, there are many climate zones, including high-elevation areas, that can get relatively chilly.</p>

<p>The authors said, younger people are predominantly vulnerable to heat, with 35 years old accounting for 75 per cent of recent heat-related deaths and 87 per cent of heat-related lost life years.</p>

<p>Those 50 and older account for 96 per cent of cold-related deaths and 80 per cent of cold-related lost life years, the authors wrote.</p>

<p>According to researchers several factors are at work, for instance young adults are more likely to be engaged in outdoor labour, such as farming and construction activities, and thus could be more exposed to dehydration and heat stroke.</p>

<p>The same could go for indoor manufacturing in spaces lacking air conditioning, they said.</p>

<p>"These are the more junior people, low on the totem pole, who probably do the lion's share of hard work, with inflexible work arrangements," Shrader said.</p>

<p>Young adults are also more likely to participate in strenuous outdoor sports, the researchers said.</p>

<p>They cited a previous study by Mexican researchers which has shown that death certificates of working-age men were more likely to list extreme weather as a cause than those of other groups.</p>

<p>"We project, as the climate warms, heat-related deaths are going to go up, and the young will suffer the most," co-lead author, R. Daniel Bressler, a PhD candidate at Columbia University's Sustainable Development program, said.</p>

<p>Mexico was chosen for the analysis as the country collects highly granular geographical data on both mortality and daily temperatures, the team said.</p>

<p>They added that despite attention given to global warming and its dangers, extensive research has revealed that cold, not heat, is currently the world's number one cause of temperature-related mortality, including in Mexico.</p>

<p>However, heat-related deaths have been climbing in proportion since at least 2000, a trend that is expected to continue, the authors said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The downfall of Syria's Bashar al-Assad, found to have used chemical weapons against his own people on multiple occasions during the civil war, creates an opportunity to rid the country of banned munitions, diplomatic sources said on Monday.</p>

<p>The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it was following the situation in Syria with "special attention" to chemical weapons-related sites and had reminded Syria, through its embassy, of its continued obligation to declare and destroy all banned chemical weapons.</p>

<p>A team at OPCW has spent more than a decade trying to clarify what types of chemical weapons Syria still possesses, but has made little progress due to obstruction by Assad's government, it said.</p>

<p>"To date, this work has continued, and the Syrian declaration of its chemical weapons programme still cannot be considered as accurate and complete," the OPCW statement said.</p>

<p>A diplomatic source said Assad's government had been "playing cat and mouse with us for years" and that "we are convinced that they still had an ongoing programme."</p>

<p>"It costs millions and millions of dollars without making any progress," said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity. "So it really is a great opportunity now to get rid of (chemical weapons) for good. This is the moment."</p>

<p>Security guarantees will need to be arranged before any deployment by OPCW inspectors. That would require contacting new power brokers in Syria, possibly rebel forces in the alliance that toppled Assad, such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a former al Qaeda affiliate labelled a terrorist group by some governments.</p>

<p>Past missions have not been free of risk. Members of a United Nations-OPCW mission to Syria were hit by explosives and AK-47 fire while trying to reach the site of a chemical attack in the northern town of Kafr Zita in May 2014.</p>

<p>Assad's government and its Russian allies always denied using chemical weapons against opponents in the civil war, which erupted in March 2011.</p>

<p>Three different investigations - a joint UN-OPCW mechanism, the OPCW's Investigation and Identification team, and a UN war crimes investigation - concluded that Syrian government forces used the nerve agent sarin and chlorine barrel bombs in attacks during the civil war that killed or injured thousands.</p>

<p>A French court issued an arrest warrant for Assad which was upheld on appeal over the use of banned chemical weapons against civilians.</p>

<p><strong>EVIDENCE</strong></p>

<p>Syria declared 1,300 tons of banned chemical weapons after joining the OPCW in 2013. The weapons were destroyed by the international community, but weapons inspectors have since found evidence of an ongoing programme that violated the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention overseen by the OPCW.</p>

<p>The OPCW has conducted 28 rounds of consultations with Assad's government since 2013, but a list of unexplained inconsistencies has only grown.</p>

<p>A recent assessment said 19 outstanding issues included "potentially undeclared full-scale development and production of chemical weapons at two declared chemical weapons-related facilities," OPCW chief Fernando Arias said in November.</p>

<p>"The facilities were previously declared as having never been in operation," he said. But inspectors found evidence contradicting that claim, sources said.</p>

<p>Among thousands of victims of suspected chemical weapons attack were more than 1,000 killed in a sarin gas attack on Aug. 21, 2013 in the Damascus suburb Ghouta, and around 100 killed in an April 4, 2017 gas attack on the Khan Sheikhoun in northern Syria. The systematic use of chlorine barrel bombs has killed and injured hundreds more, the OPCW has found.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite the years-long war between Russia and Ukraine, Moscow and Kiev worked separately for a common cause - to manufacture an Indian Navy warship, which was handed over to New Delhi on Monday when Defence Minister Rajnath Singh arrived in Moscow for a top-level visit.</p>

<p>The frigate - INS Tushil - is one of two naval ships for which India placed an order with Russia in 2016. It is a Krivak III-class warship, which is an advanced stealth missile frigate. India currently operates six such warships - all manufactured in Russia.</p>

<p>Besides the two that is being made in Russia, two more similar ships have been ordered to be manufactured in India and will likely be manufactured at the Goa Shipyard.</p>

<p>What is interesting is that the primary engines - the gas turbines of these frigates - is manufactured in Ukraine. A Russian warship with a Ukrainian engine, made for India - which shares close ties with both countries.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-12/u4eqkrd8_ins-tushil-ceremony_625x300_09_December_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>A majority of the ships in the Indian navy fleet use gas turbines made by the Ukrainian company Zorya-Mashproekt - which is a recognised globally as a leader in marine gas turbine production.</p>

<p>What is unique however, is that this order has been delivered while the war is on between Russia and Ukraine, and it is significant to note that both countries have delivered the order in spite of the conflict. However, there was a bit of a challenge involved - India had to physically procure these engines from Ukraine and have them delivered to Russia before they could be installed on this warship, so it has been somewhat delayed.</p>

<h2><strong>ALL ABOUT THE INS TUSHIL</strong></h2>

<p>INS Tushil is the Indian Navy's latest multi-role, stealth-guided missile frigate. The name 'Tushil' means a 'protector shield' and its crest represents the 'Abhedya Kavacham' (Impenetrable Shield). It has a motto - 'Nirbhay, Abhedya aur Balsheel' (Fearless, Indomitable, and Resolute). The ship stands as a symbol of the Indian Navy's undying commitment to safeguarding the nation's maritime frontiers.</p>

<p>The INS Tushil is an advanced Russian Krivak III-class warship under 'Project 11356'.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">

</div>

<p>Project 11356 is the code name for the Talwar-class frigates, which are a class of stealth, guided-missile frigates designed and built by Russia for the Indian Navy. The design for the Talwar Class frigates have been developed as an advanced version of the Admiral Grigorovich-class frigates that Russia uses. So far, six such ships have been built and delivered by Russia to India between 1999 and 2013.</p>

<p>The six Krivak class warships that are already in service are 3 Talwar Class ships built at Baltiysky shipyard in St. Petersburg, and three Teg Class ships constructed at the Yantar shipyard in Kaliningrad.</p>

<p>'INS Tushil' will be the seventh in the series, and the first of the two upgraded, advanced warships for which the Indian government and the Indian Navy had signed a contract with Russia's JSC Rosoboronexport, in October 2016.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-12/hp6vc2b_ins-tushil_625x300_09_December_24.jpeg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The construction of the 125-metre-long warship, weighing 3,900 tonnes, was under constant monitoring by experts of India's Warship Overseeing Team stationed permanently in Russia's Kaliningrad throughout its construction. The warship is fitted with advanced Indian missiles, details of which are not revealed by the Indian Navy.</p>

<p>The warship has undergone a series of sea trials, factory sea trials, and state committee trials starting January 2024, during which it clocked an impressive speed of more than 30 knots (55 kmph). It is now being delivered to India in a combat-ready condition.</p>

<p>Russia is delivering the warship to India at Kaliningrad on Monday, and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh along with Indian Navy Chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi will be commissioning it.</p>

<p>Upon commissioning, INS Tushil will join the 'Sword Arm' of the Indian Navy, the Western Fleet, under the Western Naval Command.</p>

<h2><strong>THE CHINA CHALLENGE</strong></h2>

<p>While the first of the two warships have been delivered on Monday, the delivery date for the second ship might take a while. The warship is an important addition to the Indian Navy which is faced with the challenge of the fast-growing Chinese Navy in the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>The Chinese Navy is the fastest-growing navy in the world, and according to some reports the Chinese Navy might have already outnumbered the US Navy to become the largest naval fleet globally. Nowhere is this felt more significantly that the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>While India has the geographical advantage over China in the Indian Ocean and its strategic location close to key choke points leading to it, China has the advantage in terms of number of vessels in the naval fleet.<br />

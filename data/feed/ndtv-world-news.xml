       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The "extremely dangerous" Hurricane Helene made landfall in the US state of Florida on Thursday, with officials warning of "unsurvivable" conditions and a potentially catastrophic storm surge high enough to swamp a two-story house.</p>

<p>More than a million people were without power and roads were already flooded ahead of what is expected to be one of the largest Gulf of Mexico storms in decades.</p>

<p>Fast-moving Helene strengthened to an "extremely dangerous" Category 4 hurricane Thursday, with the eye hitting near the town of Perry at approximately 11:10 pm local time (0310 GMT Friday), the US National Hurricane Center said.</p>

<p>It was packing winds of 140 miles (225 kilometres) per hour as it passed over the Gulf's warm waters and began hitting the Big Bend area south of Tallahassee.</p>

<p>"EVERYONE along the Florida Big Bend coast is at risk of potentially catastrophic storm surge," the NHC said on social media.</p>

<p>Tampa and Tallahassee airports have closed, with parts of St Petersburg, downtown Tampa, Sarasota, Treasure Island and other cities on Florida's west coast already flooded.</p>

<p>About 1,036,553 homes and businesses were without power, according to tracking site PowerOutage.us.</p>

<p>"We're expecting to see a storm surge inundation of 15 to 20 feet above ground level," NHC director Mike Brennan said. "That's up to the top of a second-story building. Again, a really unsurvivable scenario is going to play out here in this portion of the Florida coastline."</p>

<p>The accompanying waves "can destroy houses, move cars, and that water level is going to rise very quickly," Brennan added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden urged people to heed official evacuation warnings.</p>

<p>"I urge everyone in and near the path of Helene to listen to local officials and follow evacuation warnings," he said. "Take this seriously, and be safe."</p>

<h3><strong>'I'm stuck with them'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Authorities in Florida's Taylor County asked residents who did not act on mandatory evacuation warnings to write their names on their bodies with permanent marker, to aid in identification if they are killed.</p>

<p>In Alligator Point, a coastal town on a picturesque peninsula in the storm's path, David Wesolowski was taking no chances.</p>

<p>"I just came to button up a few things before it gets too windy," the 37-year-old real estate agent told AFP as he boarded up his house on stilts.</p>

<p>"If it stays on course, this is going to look different afterwards, that's for sure," he said.</p>

<p>Patrick Riickert refused to budge from his small wooden house in Crawfordville, a town of 5,000 people a few miles inland.</p>

<p>Most residents have bolted, but Riickert, his wife and five grandchildren were "not going anywhere," the 58-year-old insisted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I am going to hunker down" and ride out the hurricane, as he did in 2018 when deadly Hurricane Michael, a Category 5 mega-storm, blew through the Florida panhandle.</p>

<p>At a gas station in Panacea, John Luper said he was reluctantly staying put because his mother and brother refused to flee to higher ground.</p>

<p>"They're not going to leave," he said, filling jerry cans with fuel. "I'm stuck with them."</p>

<p>The NHC warned of up to 20 inches (51 cm) of rain in some spots and potentially life-threatening flooding, as well as numerous landslides across the southern Appalachians.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The National Weather Service said the region could be hit extremely hard, with floods not seen in more than a century.</p>

<p>"This will be one of the most significant weather events to happen in the western portions of the area in the modern era," it warned.</p>

<p>Tornado warnings went out across northern Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas.</p>

<p>More than 55 million Americans were under some form of weather alert or warning from Hurricane Helene.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Multi-state event'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"This is going to be a multi-state event with the potential for significant impacts from Florida all the way to Tennessee," Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator Deanne Criswell told reporters.</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris said the White House was watching.</p>

<p>"The President and I, of course, are monitoring the case and the situation closely, and we urge everyone who is watching at this very moment to take this storm very seriously," she told reporters.</p>

<p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis mobilized the National Guard and ordered thousands of personnel to be ready for search-and-rescue operations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He warned that the powerful storm would be dangerous and urged everyone to take precautions.</p>

<p>"We can't control how strong this hurricane is going to get. We can't control the track of the hurricane, but what you can control is what you can do to put yourself in the best chance to be able to ride this out in a way that's going to be safe," DeSantis said.</p>

<p>Helene could become the most powerful hurricane to hit the United States in over a year -- and almost certainly the biggest, at nearly 500 miles across.</p>

<p>Scientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of hurricanes because there is more energy in warmer oceans for them to feed on.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For nearly four years, the United States has been experiencing its worst border crisis in the history of the world, Republican presidential candidate and former president Donald Trump said.</p>

<p>The remarks by Trump on Thursday came on the eve of his Democratic rival Vice President Kamala Harris's visit to the US-Mexico border down South on Friday.</p>

<p>"For nearly four years, we have been living through the worst border crisis in the history of the world. There's never been anything like it, which has brought untold suffering, misery, and death upon our land. The architect of this destruction is Kamala Harris," Trump told reporters at a news conference in New York.</p>

<p>"When you look at the four years that have taken place after being named border czar, Kamala Harris tomorrow (Friday) will be visiting the southern border that she has completely destroyed. Why would she go to the border now, playing right into the hand of her opponent. There can be no justification for what she's done. Nobody is saying, oh, gee, she's done a fabulous job. She's done the worst job probably in the history of any border, not just our border. She keeps talking about how she supposedly wants to fix the border," Trump said.</p>

<p>"We would merely ask, why didn't she do it four years ago? She's got no plans, got no talent, got no ability to do it. I'm here today to present you with the facts and only the facts about how comrade Kamala Harris willfully threw open our border, helping to virtually destroy our country. Our country has never been under siege like this," Trump said.</p>

<p>Four years ago, he said, Harris inherited the most secure border in US history with the lowest illegal immigration on record.</p>

<p>"Those who violated our borders were captured, detained, and quickly sent back home under the Trump administration," he said.</p>

<p>"But on her first day in office, Kamala Harris terminated every single Trump policy that sealed and secured the border. She ordered an immediate stop to the completion of the border wall. It was almost complete. We built hundreds and hundreds of miles of wall, and it worked. She suspended all deportations. She instituted catch and release across the entire southern border," Trump alleged.</p>

<p>"She sent Congress a bill demanding amnesty for all illegal aliens, every single illegal alien, even if they're criminals, murderers, drug dealers, human traffickers. She wanted amnesty for everybody. This is a radical left person," he said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at an election rally in Pennsylvania, Harris told her supporters that Trump was an unserious man.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump has a very different plan based on a very different vision of who we are and the needs of the American people. I've said this before and I'll say it again. In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man. The consequences of putting him back in the White House are extremely serious," she said.</p>

<p>"Look, for example, at Project 2025, a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if elected president again. He intends to cut social security and Medicare; repeal our climate investments and send thousands of good-paying clean energy jobs overseas; and he wants to impose what I call a Trump sales tax, a 20 per cent tax on everyday necessities, which will cost the average American family an additional USD 4,000 a year," Harris said.</p>

<p>Trump is headed to Michigan on Friday to speak on manufacturing.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump is one of the biggest losers of manufacturing in American history. He makes empty promises after empty promises to American workers but never delivers. As President, he cut taxes for corporations, encouraged outsourcing, and lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs, including auto jobs. He has joked about firing workers, supported state anti-union laws, and suggested companies move jobs out of Michigan," Harris alleged on Thursday night.</p>

<p>"Enough is enough. American workers deserve a leader who keeps their promises and stands with workers when it matters, and as President, I will bring autoworker jobs back to this country and create an economy that strengthens manufacturing and unions and builds prosperity and security for America's future. I will always stand with the UAW. Trusting Donald Trump again is a risk America's autoworkers cannot afford," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The discovery has excited historians, as it offers insights into past excavation methods and the history of the area. The bottle, typically used for smelling salts, has been described as a rare archaeological "time capsule."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of student volunteers working on an archaeological site in France recently made an incredible discovery. While excavating the remains of a Gaulish town, they unearthed a little glass bottle hidden inside an earthenware pot, according to <em>the BBC.</em></p>

<p>The bottle, which had been hidden for nearly 200 years, carried a note from a prior archaeologist who had worked at the same location. Guillaume Blondel, the chief of Eu's Regional Archaeology Service, was sent in to investigate the findings. Blondel opened the bottle and read the note.</p>

<p>The message reads: "PJ Feret, a native of Dieppe, member of various intellectual societies, carried out excavations here in January 1825. He continues his investigations in this vast area known as the Cite de Limes or Caesar's Camp."</p>

</div>

<p>PJ Feret was a local notable, and municipal records confirm that he conducted a first dig at the site 200 years ago.</p>

<p>Archaeologists and historians are both excited and fascinated by the discovery. The message could provide insight into the history of the Gaulish village as well as the archaeological procedures used in the early nineteenth century.</p>

<p>"It was the kind of vial that women used to wear around their necks containing smelling salts," team leader Guillaume Blondel, who heads the archaeological service for the town of Eu, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yj7kg3zd1o"><em>BBC News.</em></a></p>

<p>"It was an absolutely magical moment," said Mr Blondel. "We knew there had been excavations here in the past, but to find this message from 200 years ago... it was a total surprise.</p>

<p>"Sometimes you see these time capsules left behind by carpenters when they build houses. But it's very rare in archaeology. Most archaeologists prefer to think that there won't be anyone coming after them because they've done all the work."&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday backed India for a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), days after US President Joe Biden and France's Emmanuel Macron made the same pitch. Addressing the general debate of the United Nations General Assembly's seventy-ninth session in New York, Mr Starmer said the UNSC has to change to become a "more representative body, willing to act - not paralysed by politics".</p>

<p>At present, the UNSC comprises five permanent members and 10 non-permanent member countries which are elected for a two-year term by the General Assembly of the United Nations. The five permanent members are Russia, the UK, China, France, and the United States, which have the power to veto any substantive resolution.</p>

<p>"We want to see permanent African representation on the Council, Brazil, India, Japan, and Germany as permanent members, and more seats for elected members as well," Mr Starmer said.</p>

<p>Earlier on Wednesday, French President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/french-president-emmanuel-macron-backs-india-for-permanent-un-security-council-membership-6655596" target="_blank">Emmanuel Macron</a> had also voiced strong support for India's inclusion as a permanent member of the UNSC.</p>

<p>"As long as we have a Security Council that is blocked, I would say, reciprocally according to the interests of each party, we will have difficulty moving forward. So let's just make these United Nations more effective, first by perhaps making them more representative. That is why France, and I repeat here, is in favor of the Security Council being expanded," he told the UN General Assembly.</p>

<p>"Germany, Japan, India, and Brazil should be permanent members, as well as two countries that Africa will decide to represent it," he added.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris has taken the lead over her Republican presidential rival Donald Trump in several key battleground states like Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania, according to various polls released here.</p>

<p>Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, enjoys a slight lead over former president Trump in Michigan, as per the latest poll released by UMass Lowell's Center for Public Opinion and YouGov. Harris is slightly leading 48 per cent to 43 per cent in the Great Lakes State against Trump, it said.</p>

<p>"For a swing state, this margin is good news for the vice president's campaign," Rodrigo Castro Cornejo, UMass Lowell political science assistant professor and Center for Public Opinion associate director, said.</p>

<p>If Trump wants to beat this margin, he has an uphill battle to fight in the Great Lakes State. "The Trump campaign," Castro Cornejo said, "has a negative favorability in Michigan that needs to be overcome if they want to remain competitive in the state." Harris stands at 48 per cent against Trump's 46 per cent in Pennsylvania, the UMass Lowell's Center for Public Opinion said.</p>

<p>"The presidential race remains very close in Pennsylvania with the coming weeks a crucial time for both campaigns," Cornejo said.</p>

<p>"As can be expected in a highly competitive race with few undecided voters, get-out-the-vote strategies will become increasingly important to mobilise supporters and ensure they go to the polls on Election Day," he said.</p>

<p>According to a new poll from Fox News, Harris has a slight lead over Trump in Georgia but trails behind in Arizona.</p>

<p>In Georgia, Harris has 51 per cent of votes against Trump's 48 per cent, the poll said. However, in Arizona, as per the Fox News poll, Trump leads Harris by a similar margin. He has the support of 51 per cent against Harris' 48 per cent.</p>

<p>According to Real Clear Politics, which tracks all major polls, Trump trails Harris by two percentage points nationally, while in the battleground states, it is a statistical tie. Harris leads Trump by 0.3 percentage points in battleground states, it said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's X told Brazil's Supreme Court it has complied with orders to stop the spread of misinformation and asked a judge to lift a ban on the platform, according to a document seen by Reuters, in a major retreat by the billionaire battling "censorship".</p>

<p>A decision from the court on X's return is still pending, but people close to Musk in Brazil believe service could be restored in a matter of days.</p>

<p>The request to resume activities in Brazil, one of X's largest and most coveted markets, followed a series of conciliatory moves by the social media platform signalling a dramatic backdown in Musk's months-long feud with Justice Alexandre de Moraes.</p>

<p>The judge, who has spearheaded a local crusade against perceived attacks on democracy and the political use of disinformation, had shut down Brazilians' access to the platform formerly known as Twitter in late August.</p>

<p>The draconian move followed Musk's decision to shutter X's offices in Brazil as he resisted complying with Moraes' orders.</p>

<p>The judicial battle eventually affected another prominent business controlled by Musk, satellite Internet provider Starlink, whose accounts Moraes froze in a move leading Musk to brand him a "dictator."</p>

<p>The Brazil spat was just one of a series of recent face-offs between Musk, who views himself as a champion of free speech, and governments including Australia and the UK seeking to prevent the spread of online misinformation.</p>

<p>Brazil was X's sixth-biggest market globally, with about 21.5 million users.</p>

<p>"Musk was afraid to lose market share, he also realized that this was a nonsense battle and that Brazilians were not turning their backs on Justice Alexandre de Moraes as he had expected," said Thiago de Aragao, a senior researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</p>

<p>In a final attempt at circumventing Moraes' ban, X used cloud services offered by third parties, allowing Brazilians to access its platform in spite of the prohibition, but the attempt was short-lived, especially after Moraes threatened to impose heavy fines on the company.</p>

<p>Late last week, X moved in a more conciliatory direction, appointing a local legal representative as Moraes had demanded.</p>

<p>In the document sent to the Brazilian Supreme Court, the company controlled by Musk said it had blocked nine accounts under investigation in a hate speech and misinformation probe.</p>

<p>"His backtracking is very positive. Whether one agrees with it or not, the law is to be respected not defied," Rubens Barbosa, a former Brazilian ambassador to the United States, told Reuters.</p>

<p>According to two people familiar with Musk´s thinking, the billionaire will take a very different approach once X comes back to Brazil, adding he may still be combative but will likely try to respect the law. "From now on, he will fight in the courts," one of the people said.</p>

<p>X did not reply to a request for comment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dell Technologies said on Thursday that their global sales team employees who are able to work from the company offices must do so five days a week, starting Sept. 30, according to a memo seen by Reuters.</p>

<p>The change is to leverage collaborative environment and "grow skills", which requires the team to be in the office, the memo said. "Working remotely should be the exception rather than the routine," it added.</p>

<p>The field representatives from the sales team are expected to spend five days a week with customers and partners, or in the office. The team was previously required to work from the office for three days per week, according to the memo.</p>

<p>"Remote sales team members who can't go into a Dell office should continue to work remotely," Dell added.</p>

<p>The company also mentioned that it will provide more information related to remote workers in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Since the pandemic, many companies have permitted employees to work from home. Some tech firms, however, now want employees to return to the office for two to three days each week.</p>

<p>Last week, e-commerce giant Amazon.com said it would require employees to return to working at company offices five days per week, beginning next year, toughening a prior three-day mandate.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden has signed a three-month government funding bill, averting an imminent shutdown and delaying a fuller conversation about government spending until after the November elections, media reported.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden has signed a three-month government funding bill, averting an imminent shutdown and delaying a fuller conversation about government spending until after the November elections, media reported.</p>

<p>The stopgap spending bill, known as a continuing resolution or CR, will extend government funding until December 20, The Guardian reported.</p>

<p>It will also provide an additional $231m for the Secret Service "for operations necessary to carry out protective operations, including the 2024 presidential campaign and national special security events," following the two recent assassination attempts against former President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Biden's signing of the bill came one day after the House and Senate passed the legislation with sweeping bipartisan majorities in both chambers.</p>

<p>"The passage of this bill gives Congress more time to pass full-year funding bills by the end of this year," Biden said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"My administration will work with Congress to ensure these bills deliver for America's national defence, veterans, seniors, children and working families, and address urgent needs for the American people, including communities recovering from disasters."</p>

<p>The Republican House Speaker, Mike Johnson, had initially tried to pass a more right-wing proposal that combined a six-month stopgap funding measure with the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (Save) Act, a controversial proposal that would require people to show proof of citizenship when they register to vote.</p>

<p>That effort failed last week, when 14 Republicans and all but two Democrats opposed Johnson's bill. The failure forced Johnson to take up a three-month spending bill that was narrow enough to win Democrats' support. The House passed that bill on Wednesday in a vote of 341 to 82, with all of the opposition to the legislation stemming from Republicans.</p>

<p>"Our legislative work before November has now been officially done, and today the House did the necessary thing," Johnson told reporters on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"We took the initiative and passed a clean, narrow, three-month CR to prevent the Senate from jamming us with another bloated bill while continuing resolutions."</p>

<p>Johnson nodded at the widespread opposition to the bill within his conference, as 82 Republicans voted against it amid complaints of wasteful government spending, The Guardian reported.</p>

<p>"While a continuing resolution is never ideal -- none of us like them; that's not a way to run a railroad -- it allows Congress to continue serving the American people through the election," Johnson said.</p>

<p>Once the House passed the continuing resolution on Wednesday noon, the Senate moved immediately to take up the bill. The Upper Chamber passed the bill just two hours after the House did in a bipartisan vote of 78 to 18.</p>

<p>The Democratic Senate Majority Leader, Chuck Schumer, thanked Johnson for his work to avoid a shutdown, but he lamented that it took Congress until the last minute to pass a funding package when it seemed evident for weeks that a narrow stopgap would be necessary.</p>

<p>"Tonight the American people can sleep easier knowing we have avoided an unnecessary government shutdown at the end of the month," Schumer said before the vote.</p>

<p>"It is a relief for the country that, once again, bipartisanship prevailed to stop another shutdown threat. It took much longer than it should have, but because House Republicans finally, finally chose to work with us in the end, Congress is getting the job done tonight."</p>

<p>Schumer had previously blamed Donald Trump for the delay, as the former President had implored Republican lawmakers to reject any funding bill unless it was tied to "election security" measures. The newly signed bill did not meet that demand, but Johnson insisted that Trump backed Republicans' efforts to keep the government funded.</p>

<p>"Former President Trump understands the current dilemma and the situation that we're in," Johnson told reporters on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"So we'll continue working closely together. I'm not defying President Trump. We're getting our job done, and I think he understands that."</p>

<p>Both Chambers of Congress now stand adjourned for six weeks, meaning members will not return to Capitol Hill until after election day. Johnson's decision to rely on Democratic support to pass the funding package has raised questions about his future as Speaker, but he voiced confidence on Wednesday about his leadership and his party's prospects for expanding its narrow House majority.</p>

<p>"I would be a fool to project a certain number of seats, but let me just say I'm very optimistic," Johnson told reporters.</p>

<p>"I believe we're going to hold the House. And I intend to be the Speaker in the new Congress."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli army said it intercepted a missile that was fired from Yemen after sirens and explosions were heard early on Friday.</p>

<p>"Following the sirens that sounded in central Israel, the surface-to-surface missile that was launched from Yemen was intercepted by an 'Arrow' interceptor outside of Israeli territory," the army said in a statement.</p>

<p>"There is currently no change to the IDF Defensive guidelines," it said, using the acronym for the Israel Defense Forces.</p>

<p>Yemen's Houthi militants have fired missiles and drones at Israel repeatedly in what they say is solidarity with the Palestinians, since the Gaza war began with a Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7.</p>

<p>In July, the Houthis fired a drone at Tel Aviv for the first time, killing a man and wounding four people. Israeli airstrikes in response on Houthi military targets near the port of Hodeidah killed six and wounded 80.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, they reached central Israel with a missile that Israel said was hit by an interceptor and fragmented in the air.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A powerful hurricane was barreling towards Florida on Thursday, with officials warning of "unsurvivable" conditions and a potentially catastrophic storm surge high enough to swamp a two-story house.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of people were without power and roads were already flooded ahead of what is expected to be one of the largest Gulf of Mexico storms in decades.</p>

<p>Fast-moving Helene strengthened to an "extremely dangerous" Category 4 hurricane Thursday evening, ahead of landfall expected around 11pm (0300 GMT), the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.</p>

<p>It was packing winds of 130 miles (215 kilometers) per hour as it churned over the Gulf's warm waters towards the Big Bend area south of Florida's capital city Tallahassee.</p>

<p>"EVERYONE along the Florida Big Bend coast is at risk of potentially catastrophic storm surge," the NHC said on social media.</p>

<p>Tampa and Tallahassee airports have closed, with parts of St. Petersburg, downtown Tampa, Sarasota, Treasure Island and other cities on Florida's west coast already flooded.</p>

<p>About 125,000 homes and businesses were without power.</p>

<p>"We're expecting to see a storm surge inundation of 15 to 20 feet above ground level," NHC director Mike Brennan said. "That's up to the top of a second story building. Again, a really unsurvivable scenario is going to play out here in this portion of the Florida coastline."</p>

<p>The accompanying waves "can destroy houses, move cars, and that water level is going to rise very quickly," Brennan added.</p>

<p>- Evacuate or hunker down? -<br />
In Alligator Point, a coastal town on a picturesque peninsula in the storm's path, David Wesolowski was taking no chances.</p>

<p>"I just came to button up a few things before it gets too windy," the 37-year-old real estate agent told AFP as he boarded up his house on stilts.</p>

<p>"If it stays on course, this is going to look different afterwards, that's for sure," he said, before taking his family to higher ground in Tallahassee.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Patrick Riickert refused to budge from his small wooden house in Crawfordville, a town of 5,000 people a few miles inland.</p>

<p>As in Alligator Point, most residents have bolted and it looked like a ghost town, but Riickert, his wife and five grandchildren were "not going anywhere," the 58-year-old insisted.</p>

<p>"I am going to hunker down" and ride out the hurricane, as he did in 2018 when deadly Hurricane Michael, a Category 5 megastorm, blew through the Florida panhandle.</p>

<p>The NHC warned of up to 20 inches (51 cm) of rain in some spots, and potentially life-threatening flooding as well as numerous landslides across the southern Appalachians.</p>

<p>The National Weather Service said the region could be hit extremely hard, with floods not seen in more than a century.</p>

<p>"This will be one of the most significant weather events to happen in the western portions of the area in the modern era," it warned.</p>

<p>Tornado warnings went out across northern Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas.</p>

<p>Georgia's sprawling capital Atlanta was forecast to experience tropical storm-force winds and flash flooding from up to 12 inches of rain.</p>

<p>And Tennessee -- more than 300 miles from the Gulf Coast -- braced for tropical storm conditions statewide.</p>

<p>More than 55 million Americans were under some form of weather alert or warning from Hurricane Helene.</p>

<p>- 'Life-threatening impacts' -<br />
"This is going to be a multi-state event with the potential for significant impacts from Florida all the way to Tennessee," Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator Deanne Criswell told reporters.</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris said the White House was watching.</p>

<p>"The President and I, of course, are monitoring the case and the situation closely, and we urge everyone who is watching at this very moment to take this storm very seriously," she told reporters.</p>

<p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis mobilized the National Guard and ordered thousands of personnel to ready for search-and-rescue operations.</p>

<p>He warned that the powerful storm would be dangerous, and urged everyone to take precautions.</p>

<p>"We can't control how strong this hurricane is going to get. We can't control the track of the hurricane, but what you can control is what you can do to put yourself in the best chance to be able to ride this out in a way that's going to be safe."</p>

<p>Helene could become the most powerful hurricane to hit the United States in over a year -- and almost certainly the biggest.</p>

<p>Hurricane specialist Michael Lowry called Helene "extreme," noting its tropical storm winds of 39 mph or higher stretched nearly 500 miles across.</p>

<p>Researchers say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of hurricanes, because there is more energy in warmer oceans for them to feed on.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump said he would meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday in New York, one day after the White House hopeful slammed Ukraine's leader for refusing to strike a deal with Russia over the war.</p>

<p>"President Zelensky has asked to meet with me, and I will be meeting with him tomorrow morning at around 9:45 in Trump Tower," the Republican told reporters in New York.</p>

<p>"And it's a shame what's happening in Ukraine. So many deaths, so much destruction. It's a horrible thing."</p>

<p>Trump spoke hours after the Ukrainian president met with his US counterpart Joe Biden and Trump's November election rival Kamala Harris at the White House.</p>

<p>Zelensky is in the United States this week participating in the UN General Assembly in New York.</p>

<p>Trump said "I look forward to seeing him tomorrow."</p>

<p>But the Republican also suggested he was displeased with Zelensky's recent comments to The New Yorker magazine in which Ukraine's leader said he believed Trump "doesn't really know how to stop the war."</p>

<p>When asked about Zelensky's comments by a reporter at the press conference, Trump said "I do believe I disagree with him. He doesn't know me."</p>

<p>"I believe I will be able to make a deal" to end the war, Trump added, repeating a longstanding claim that he would swiftly bring about an end to the conflict which began when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>He proceeded to accuse Israel of perpetrating a "full-scale war of genocide," dismissing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claim that Israel didn't kill civilians in Gaza.</p>

<p>"I ask you, who is it then that killed more than 15,000 children?" he said on Thursday.</p>

<p>"Stop this crime. Stop it now. Stop killing children and women. Stop the genocide. Stop sending weapons to Israel. This madness cannot continue. The entire world is responsible for what is happening to our people," Abbas said.</p>

<p>During his speech, Abbas called on the international community to impose sanctions on Israel and also its exclusion from the United Nations following the "genocide in Gaza".</p>

<p>"We call for sanctions against Israel. Israel does not deserve to be part of this organisation. I don't know how the US can insist on depriving us of our rights," the Palestinian President said.</p>

<p>He also touched upon the situation with settlers in the West Bank, specifying that 600,000 settlers currently live there.</p>

<p>"We want ICJ (the International Court of Justice) ruling on Israel to be implemented," he noted.</p>

<p>"Palestine will be free, despite anyone who objects. Our people will live in the land of their fathers and grandfathers... The occupation will end," Abbas concluded.<br />

<p>Meanwhile, Netanyahu instructed his military to keep fighting "with full force" on Thursday, as a high-stakes international diplomatic effort was underway to pause the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel.</p>

<p>Netanyahu is heading to New York for the UNGA, even as members of his government dismissed a ceasefire proposal that the US, European allies and several Arab nations put forward.</p>

<p>Israel's military carried out new strikes in Lebanon, including one in Beirut, the capital, that targeted the commander of Hezbollah's drone unit.</p>

<p>The UNGA adopted a resolution on May 10 supporting the Palestinian bid to become a full UN member and recommending that the Security Council "reconsider the matter favourably".</p>

<p>The resolution was adopted with 143 votes in favour and nine against, including the US and Israel, while 25 countries abstained. China voted for the resolution.</p>

<p>The resolution states, "The State of Palestine... should therefore be admitted to membership" and "recommends that the Security Council reconsider the matter favourably".<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Weeks before his term as US President comes to an end, Joe Biden signed a new executive order today to address the problem of gun violence in the US.</p>

<p>"Join Vice President Kamala Harris and me as we deliver remarks on addressing the scourge of gun violence in America," President Biden posted on social media website X.</p>

<p>"In order to end the problem of gun violence in America, we need to first talk about the problem of guns in America," the President said, before he gave a sad and worrying statistic - that "The number one cause of deaths of children in America is gun violence - even more than disease or accidents."</p>

<p>"It is sickening," the President said.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, the President shared a post on his official X account stating that "Today, I'll sign an Executive Order to crack down on emerging firearm threats like unserialized, 3D-printed guns and machine gun conversion devices."</p>

<p>President Biden further said that the order will "Also direct my Cabinet to help improve school-based active shooter drills," adding that "It is our job to do better."</p>

<p>Data shows that the average number of civilian guns per 100 persons in America was 120.5 guns, which is more than double that of the next country on that list - Yemen (52.8 guns).</p>

<h2><strong>AMERICA'S GUN VIOLENCE PROBLEM</strong></h2>

<p>The United States has a serious gun violence problem, especially with an ever-increasing number of school and university shootings. According to a research conducted by the American Academy of Pediatrics last year, child gun deaths in the US have hit record highs.</p>

<p>According to the data, 4,752 children died from gun-related injuries in 2021, the latest year for which data was available, up from 4,368 in 2020 and 3,390 in 2019. In fact, gun violence has been the number one cause of death for children in the United States since 2020.</p>

<p>The study further showed that Black children accounted for around 67% of firearm homicides while white children made up about 78% of gun-assisted suicides.</p>

<p>As recently as a fortnight ago, at least four people were killed in a school shooting in Georgia. The suspect, now arrested, turned out to be a 14-year-old.</p>

<p>The US has seen hundreds of shootings inside of schools and colleges in the past two decades, with the deadliest resulting in over 30 deaths at Virginia Tech in 2007. The carnage has sparked pitched debate over the US gun laws and the US Constitution's Second Amendment, which enshrines the right "to keep and bear arms."</p>

<h3><strong>PRESIDENT BIDEN'S EXECUTIVE ORDER</strong></h3>

<p>In 2023, Vice President Kamala Harris was given charge of the department which looks into gun legislation. She was made responsible to help curb gun violence in America and to bring an end to the use of firearms in schools and other educational institutions.</p>

<p>Now, six weeks before the 2024 US Presidential election, President Biden has decided to bring in a legislation by Presidential Order - the highest authority in the US - to curb the menace of firearms and shootings at schools and colleges.</p>

<p>Under the order, the first part will focus on "emerging firearm threats", including machine gun conversion devices - which turns a handheld gun or pistol into an automatic firearm or weapon. Such devices are already illegal, but since law enforcement agencies have found indiscriminate use of such equipment, the new legislation will ensure a crackdown on its availability.</p>

<p>The other threats that this legislation aims to tackle are unlicensed guns, or guns without serial numbers, that are 3D printed, which have a potential to go undetected even by scanners and metal detectors.</p>

<p>In the second part of the two-part Presidential order, Mr Biden has appealed to various departments, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State and even the Department of Education and other key departments involved to jointly draft Standard Operating Procedures or SOPs to ensure that there are regular drills in schools and vulnerable locations where similar incidents have occurred.</p>

<p>Under this order, the law enforcement authorities in the US will also have to check the sale of guns, ammunition, and other automatic and sub-automatic weapons.</p>

<p>More details of the the Presidential order will emerge once Mr Biden signs it and it is ratified.</p>

<h3><strong>AN APPEAL BEFORE THE ORDER</strong></h3>

<p>Earlier this month, President Biden called for a complete ban on assault weapons. "As a nation, we cannot continue to accept the carnage of gun violence," he had said.</p>

<p>He had also urged the US Congress to take strong action for gun control in the country. President Biden even reached out to Republican lawmakers, saying some of its leaders should "finally say enough is enough", adding that "We have to do something together. Let's ban assault weapons."</p>

<p>He had acknowledged that these steps "won't bring back those children," however, it would "help save lives if we do the things we're talking about." He further said, "We can do if we do it together...and I really think we can."</p>

<p>President Biden also called for thorough&nbsp; checks and balances over the sale of arms and ammunition, calling for detailed background checks. He also appealed to end the immunity for gun manufacturers as well as for parents who allow their children to have weapons to be held accountable.</p>

<h3><strong>RECENT SCHOOL SHOOTINGS</strong></h3>

<p>The school shooting in Georgia two weeks ago was the latest among dozens across the US in recent years, including deadly ones in Connecticut, Parkland, Florida, Newtown, and Uvalde, Texas.</p>

<p>So far, at least 385 mass shooting incidents have taken place in the US in 2024 alone, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which considers mass shootings as those in which four or more victims are shot. That's an average of more than 1.5 mass shootings every day in the United States of America.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[The Kremlin said Thursday that an updated nuclear doctrine that will allow Moscow to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states should be seen as a warning to the West.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Kremlin said Thursday that an updated nuclear doctrine that will allow Moscow to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states should be seen as a warning to the West.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday announced plans to broaden Russia's rules on the use of its nuclear weaponry, allowing it to unleash a nuclear response in the event of a "massive" air attack.</p>

<p>The proposals would also permit Moscow to respond with nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear powers -- a clear reference to Ukraine and its Western backers.</p>

<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the planned changes "must be considered a specific signal".</p>

<p>"A signal that warns these countries of the consequences if they participate in an attack on our country by various means, not necessarily nuclear," Peskov told reporters.</p>

<p>Without mentioning Ukraine by name, Peskov said Russia's "nuclear deterrence is being adjusted on account of elements of tension that are developing along the perimeter of our borders".</p>

<p>He also said there was "no question" of Russia boosting its nuclear arsenal.</p>

<p>Moscow residents on Thursday told AFP they were worried by the announcement.</p>

<p>"Using the threat of nuclear weapons is always bad. We don't need another Cuban missile crisis," said Dimitri, a 21-year-old student who declined to give his surname.</p>

<p>Vadim, a 43-year-old artist who also only gave his first name, said: "An escalation is underway, of course, it is alarming."</p>

<p>For others, like 60-year-old pensioner Vladimir, the new doctrine could be beneficial and "bring pretentious Europeans to reason".</p>

<p>The move "can reinforce security and force people in Ukraine and the United States to think", said Igor Diakov, also a retiree in Moscow.</p>

<p>"Europe will tremble because all the red lines have been crossed and they think they cannot be punished for it. But we won't let them get away with it."</p>

<p>Tatiana Nikiforova, a 49-year-old Russian teacher, deferred to her country's leadership.</p>

<p>"We must have faith in our leaders, there is no other way," she said.</p>

<p>The proposed changes to Russia's nuclear doctrine, which Putin himself has the power to approve, come as Ukraine is seeking permission from Western allies to use long-range precision weaponry to strike targets deep inside Russia -- so far to no avail.</p>

<p>Kyiv says it is necessary to target Russia's airfields and military infrastructure that it uses to launch attacks on Ukraine, though the White House is cautious about enabling further escalation.</p>

<p>The West has accused Putin of irresponsible nuclear sabre-rattling throughout the Ukraine conflict, with the Kremlin leader having issued multiple apparent threats about Moscow's willingness to deploy its nuclear weapons.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met Joe Biden at the White House Thursday to present his wartime "victory plan," after the US president announced an $8 billion surge in military aid for Kyiv's fight against Russia.</p>

<p>But Zelensky's visit was clouded by a blazing row with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that underscored how November's US election could upend the support that Kyiv receives from its biggest backer.</p>

<p>"Russia will not prevail. Ukraine will prevail, and we'll continue to stand by you every step of the way," Biden said as he hosted Zelensky in the Oval Office, after thanking him for presenting the so-called victory plan.</p>

<p>Dressed in his trademark military-style outfit, Zelensky replied that "we deeply appreciate that Ukraine and America have stood side by side."</p>

<p>Zelensky is looking to shore up support for his war effort at the same time as Biden tries to lock in aid for Ukraine, ahead of the white-knuckle vote pitting Biden's Vice President Kamala Harris against firebrand Trump.</p>

<p>The Democrat pledged nearly $8 billion in military aid in his announcement on Thursday, including $5.5 billion to be authorized before it expires at the end of the US fiscal year on Monday.</p>

<p>Biden said in a statement that the "surge in security assistance for Ukraine" would "help Ukraine win this war."</p>

<p>Biden also announced Washington would provide Ukraine with the Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) long-range munition and called a summit of allies in Germany in October.</p>

<p>The White House however played down Ukraine's hopes that Zelensky's visit would achieve his long-held goal of getting permission to fire long-range Western-made missiles into Russian territory.</p>

<p>"I'm not expecting there to be any new announcements on this particular action or a decision coming out of this meeting," Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters.</p>

<p>Harris was due to meet Zelensky separately at the White House on Thursday.</p>

<p>Zelensky also visited the US Congress -- where his government said he had also presented his victory plan -- and gave a defiant address at the UN General Assembly on Wednesday.</p>

<p>- 'Greatest salesman on earth' -</p>

<p>But Zelensky's visit has prompted fresh nuclear saber rattling from Moscow, which has repeatedly warned the West against giving Ukraine long-range arms.</p>

<p>President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday announced plans to broaden Moscow's rules on the use of its atomic weaponry in the event of a "massive" air attack.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the nuclear threat "totally irresponsible" while EU foreign policy spokesman Peter Stano said Putin was making a "gamble with his nuclear arsenal."</p>

<p>Kyiv faces an increasingly difficult battlefield situation two and a half years into Russia's invasion, with Russian forces continuing to push into eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>But the US presidential election means Washington's support now hangs on the balance -- and with Zelensky apparently at odds with Trump and the Republicans.</p>

<p>Trump had also been due to meet Zelensky during his US visit, but their talks now appear to be on ice.</p>

<p>Trump accused Zelensky on the eve of the visit of refusing to strike a deal with Moscow and once again questioned why the United States was giving billions of dollars to Kyiv.</p>

<p>At an election rally on Wednesday, the Republican called the Ukrainian president "probably the greatest salesman on Earth."</p>

<p>Republicans were livid after Zelensky visited an arms factory in Biden's hometown in the battleground state of Pennsylvania earlier this week, with House Speaker Mike Johnson calling for the Ukrainian ambassador to be sacked.</p>

<p>Zelensky also sparked fury in Republican ranks when he told The New Yorker magazine this week that Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance did not understand the war's complexity.</p>

<p>Trump has echoed many of Putin's talking points about previous US policy being to blame for the Russian invasion, and has been critical of Zelensky for years.</p>

<p>The United States has provided around $175 billion in both military and economic assistance to Ukraine during the war, despite frequent opposition from Republicans.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in an interview Thursday that Washington's economic ties with Beijing are closer now despite recent tariff hikes, with both sides cooperating in areas like financial stability.</p>

<p>"I do believe it's gotten closer," she told CNBC of the relationship between the world's two biggest economies.</p>

<p>"We've found ways to constructively discuss and address our differences."</p>

<p>This is in spite of intensifying competition between the United States and China in recent years.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden's administration has taken moves to limit Chinese firms' access to cutting-edge equipment, especially for military uses, and added on to tariffs on Chinese-made products introduced by his predecessor, Donald Trump.</p>

<p>In the run-up to the November election, in which Trump is facing off with Vice President Kamala Harris, both candidates have taken a firm stance on China.</p>

<p>But Yellen said of the current relationship: "We're cooperating in areas that the world needs us to work together. Financial stability is one of these areas."</p>

<p>On the US economy, Yellen told CNBC that all indications, ranging from the jobs market to growth figures, "suggest we're on a path to a soft landing" even if there remain risks.</p>

<p>"The last mile on inflation involves housing costs, and I believe there's good reason to think that they will fall," she said.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Yellen also called for regulation to boost the resilience of the US financial system.</p>

<p>"A resilient financial system is critical to a strong economy," she said at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</p>

<p>"And strengthening it requires insisting on thoughtful regulation, including in the face of challenges from those who advocate to roll back policies and regulations," she said.</p>

<p>Taking aim at Trump's first term in office, she said the Treasury's focus on financial stability "had all but disappeared" when she took office in 2021.</p>

<p>"Appropriate regulation is critical to supporting a resilient financial system that serves as an engine for innovation and growth," Yellen said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Japanese man said to have spent the world's longest time on death row was acquitted of murder on Thursday, his legal team said, ending his family's search for justice after a wrongful conviction for crimes committed nearly 60 years ago.</p>

<p>The Shizuoka district court cleared Iwao Hakamada, 88, in a retrial of the murders of four people in the central Japanese region in 1966.</p>

<p>It was sweet to hear the words "not guilty" in the courtroom, said Hideko Hakamada, who has battled for decades to clear her younger brother's name.</p>

<p>"When I heard that, I was so moved and happy, I couldn't stop crying," she told a televised briefing.</p>

<p>Hakamada spent 45 years on death row before a court ordered his release and a retrial in 2014 amid doubts about the evidence on which his conviction was based.</p>

<p>The former boxer, who has lived with his sister since his release, had been accused of stabbing to death his former boss and family before burning down their home.</p>

<p>Though he briefly admitted to the killings, he retracted the confession and pleaded innocent during his trial, but was nevertheless sentenced to death in 1968, a penalty upheld by Japan's Supreme Court in 1980.</p>

<p>Norimichi Kumamoto, one of the Shizuoka court's three judges who had sentenced Hakamada to death, petitioned the Supreme Court for a retrial in 2008, but was rejected.</p>

<p>Hakamada's lawyers had argued that DNA tests on bloodstained clothing said to belong to their client showed the blood was not his.</p>

<p>Rights group Amnesty International hailed the exoneration as a "pivotal moment for justice" and urged Japan to scrap the death penalty.</p>

<p>"After enduring almost half a century of wrongful imprisonment and a further 10 years waiting for his retrial, this verdict is an important recognition of the profound injustice he endured for most of his life," Amnesty said.</p>

<p>"It ends an inspiring fight to clear his name," it added in a statement.</p>

<p>The government's top spokesperson, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, declined comment on individual cases, but acknowledged the Shizuoka court's ruling.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine and Russia are to exchange 13 children, displaced by Moscow's invasion, reuniting them with their families following mediation by Qatar, officials in the Gulf state said Thursday.</p>

<p>Russia has been accused of forcibly deporting thousands of Ukrainian children from schools, hospitals and orphanages in parts of the country controlled by its forces.</p>

<p>The "family reunification process involves the safe reunification of nine minors and one adult with their families in Ukraine," a Qatari official said.</p>

<p>"It will also include the reunification of four minors with their families in Russia."</p>

<p>The nine Ukrainian children, aged between 12 and 17, with one 19-year-old sibling accompanying them, include a child who lost his one remaining parent following the invasion and others who were staying with relatives when they were separated from their family.</p>

<p>Also among the Ukrainian minors are two teenagers with cerebral palsy, one of whom was placed in a children's home before the war. Both are accompanied by medical teams for their return.</p>

<p>The Russian children, aged between two and seven, include two who were in care centres before the war started, while the other two had been staying with relatives.</p>

<p>Qatari representatives will host the children at the embassy in Moscow before they are reunited with their families in Ukraine or elsewhere in Russia.</p>

<p>Ukraine has said some 20,000 children were taken to Russia following Moscow's February 2022 invasion.</p>

<p>Ukraine says the invading forces took them illegally to Russia and accuses the Russian authorities of trying to wipe out their Ukrainian identity.</p>

<p>Teenagers who returned to Ukraine have said they were subjected to Russian patriotic education and made to praise the Russian army.</p>

<p>Moscow has denied forcibly taking children to Russia, saying that minors were moved for their own safety if they were without parental care.</p>

<p>The exchange is the latest in a series of family reunifications brokered by Qatar that has seen scores of children returned to Ukraine and Russia following visits by Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani to Kyiv and Moscow last year.</p>

<p>"Qatar remains committed to its efforts to support the reunification of separated families and to ensure the safety, welfare and the reunification of children with their families," the Qatari official said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Thanksgiving is one of the most celebrated holidays across the country as families come together to prepare festive meals and enjoy time together.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Thanksgiving 2024 in the US: </strong>Thanksgiving is a national holiday in the United States, celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November, which means this year it will be celebrated on November 28. It is one of the most celebrated holidays across the country as families come together to prepare festive meals, enjoy time together and express gratefulness for the blessings. On Thanksgiving Day, traditionally, the farmers thanked god for their autumn harvest. However, beyond the coming of family together, Thanksgiving has a deep historical and cultural significance.</p>

<h3><strong>When was Thanksgiving first celebrated?</strong></h3>

<p>The origin of Thanksgiving dates back to 1621 when a harvest feast was held between the Wampanoag, a Native tribe who occupied the land long before, and the newly settled English colonists in America.</p>

<p>In 1789, following Congress' recommendation, President George Washington issued a proclamation naming Thursday, November 26, 1789, as a day of public Thanksgiving -- the first time it was celebrated under the new constitution, as per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.whitehousehistory.org/press-room/press-timelines/thanksgiving-at-the-white-house" rel="noindex, nofollow">White House.</a></p>

<p>Later in 1863, Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the USS, who guided the country through the Civil War, declared Thanksgiving a holiday and a day off for employees. He also implored the citizens to heal its wounds and restore peace, and harmony across the country.</p>

<h3><strong>How is Thanksgiving celebrated?</strong></h3>

<p>Families and friends gather for a meal, play games and have fun on Thanksgiving Day. Pumpkin pie, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes, stuffing, and roast turkey are all staples. Other customs of the day include Thanksgiving Day parades, especially the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade, donating essentials to those in need and the presidential turkey pardons.</p>

<p>This year, President Joe Biden gave reprieve to two white-plumed turkeys, Peach and Blossom, at the White House in continuation of a long tradition. It is believed that the tradition began during the Civil War when president Abraham Lincoln's son, Tad, requested him to spare a turkey named "Jack" from their holiday and he obliged.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/why-do-us-presidents-pardon-turkeys-on-thanksgiving-day-history-and-significance-7106387" rel="nofollow, noindex"><strong>Also Read | Why Do US Presidents Pardon Turkeys On Thanksgiving Day? History And Significance</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>Controversy around Thanksgiving</strong></h3>

<p>While the majority of Americans enjoy carving up a turkey and sharing it with family on Thanksgiving, the Native Americans and Alaska Natives believe that the holiday masks the true history of oppression and bloodshed. In the years following the first harvest feast, many Native Americans died due to foreign-born diseases brought from Europe. Others died during the conflict with English settlers who sought to gain control of the Native lands.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Florida TikTok influencer has been arrested after flaunting stolen goods in her videos. Marlena Velez, 22, was charged with petty theft for allegedly shoplifting items worth over $500 from a Target store in Cape Coral on October 30, according to the <em>Fort Myers News-Press</em>.</p>

<p>Velez, who has more than 300,000 followers on TikTok, is accused of stealing 16 items, including household goods and clothing, valued at $500.32. The Cape Coral Police Department stated that Target's loss prevention team alerted authorities to a shoplifter using a fake barcode at a self-checkout to scan items at reduced prices.</p>

<p>After reviewing security footage from the store, police shared an image of the suspect on their social media accounts. A tip from an anonymous caller, claiming to be one of Velez's followers, led authorities to her Instagram account, which linked to her TikTok profile.</p>

<p></p>

<p>According to <em>Fox 4 Now</em>, one of Marlena Velez's TikTok videos featured her wearing the same outfit and glasses seen in the Target security footage. The now-deleted "Get Ready With Me" (GRWM) video showed her documenting a shopping trip at Target and loading her "purchases" into her car.</p>

<p>"She essentially incriminated herself," said Officer Riley Carter, spokesperson for the Cape Coral Police Department, in a statement to The Express Tribune.</p>

<p>"Social media provided us with an unexpected lead, which sped up her identification and subsequent arrest," Carter added.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Velez was charged one count of petit theft for stealing goods between $100 and $750. Authorities also discovered her prior criminal record following her arrest.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms urged the Australian government on Tuesday to delay a bill that will ban most forms of social media for children under 16, saying more time was needed to assess its potential impact.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's centre-left government wants to pass the bill, which represents some of the toughest controls on children's social media use imposed by any country, into law by the end of the parliamentary year on Thursday.</p>

<p>The bill was introduced in parliament last week and opened for submissions of opinions for only one day.</p>

<p>Google and Meta said in their submissions that the government should wait for the results of an age-verification trial before going ahead.</p>

<p>The age-verification system may include biometrics or government identification to enforce a social media age cut-off.</p>

<p>"In the absence of such results, neither industry nor Australians will understand the nature or scale of age assurance required by the bill, nor the impact of such measures on Australians," Meta said.</p>

<p>"In its present form, the bill is inconsistent and ineffective."</p>

<p>The law would force social media platforms, and not parents or children, to take reasonable steps to ensure age-verification protections are in place. Companies could be fined up to A$49.5 million ($32 million) for systemic breaches.</p>

<p>The opposition Liberal party is expected to support the bill though some independent lawmakers have accused the government of rushing through the entire process in around a week.</p>

<p>A Senate committee responsible for communications legislation is scheduled to deliver a report on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Bytedance's TikTok said the bill lacked clarity and that it had "significant concerns" with the government's plan to pass the bill without detailed consultation with experts, social media platforms, mental health organisations and young people.</p>

<p>"Where novel policy is put forward, it's important that legislation is drafted in a thorough and considered way, to ensure it is able to achieve its stated intention. This has not been the case with respect to this Bill," TikTok said.</p>

<p>Elon Musk's X raised concerns that the bill will negatively impact the human rights of children and young people, including their rights to freedom of expression and access to information.</p>

<p>The US billionaire, who views himself as a champion of free speech, last week attacked the Australian government saying the bill seemed like a backdoor way to control access to the internet.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A major fire erupted Tuesday at a Japan space agency site as it tested a solid-fuel Epsilon S rocket, television footage showed.</p>

<p>There were no reports of any injuries in the incident in the remote Kagoshima region of southern Japan.</p>

<p>Towering balls of fire and white fumes rose from the Tanegashima Space Center, according to the footage from national broadcaster NHK.</p>

<p>"There was an abnormality during today's combustion test. We are trying to assess what happened," the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) told AFP in a statement.</p>

<p>"No injuries have been reported at this point. The cause is also under investigation."</p>

<p>NHK says the fire happened during a combustion test that began at around 8:30 am (2330 GMT), with media stationed around 600 metres (yards) away.</p>

<p>About 30 seconds later, a large explosion was heard, and what appeared to be something on fire flew toward the sea, NHK said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Sankei Shimbun reported that orange flames burst out from the rocket engine placed on a horizontal platform before the explosion.</p>

<p>Tuesday's fire is not the first time JAXA has experienced setbacks in its rocket programmes.</p>

<p>In July 2023 one engine of an Epsilon S exploded during a test around 50 seconds after ignition.</p>

<p>That was one in a string of failures for the country's space agency JAXA, including launch attempts for its next-generation H3 rocket.</p>

<p>JAXA managed a successful blast-off in February this year for the H3, its new flagship rocket that has been mooted as a rival to SpaceX's Falcon 9.</p>

<p>That followed Japan successfully landing in January an unmanned probe on the Moon -- albeit at a crooked angle -- making it just the fifth country to achieve a "soft landing" on the lunar surface.</p>

<p>In March a rocket made by a private Japanese company exploded seconds after launch.</p>

<p>Tokyo-based Space One's 18-metre (60-foot) Kairos rocket blasted off in the coastal Wakayama region of western Japan, carrying a small government test satellite.</p>

<p>But around five seconds later, the solid-fuel rocket erupted in fire, sending white smoke billowing around the remote mountainous area as orange flames raged on the ground, live footage showed.</p>

<p>Burning debris fell onto the surrounding slopes as sprinklers began spraying water, in dramatic scenes watched by hundreds of spectators gathered at public viewing areas including a nearby waterfront.</p>

<p>Space One said at the time that it had taken the decision to "abort the flight" and details were being investigated.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Passengers aboard an American Airlines plane to Texas were forced to take matters into their own hands and duct-tape a man who posed a physical threat to flight attendants and attempted to open one of the doors mid-flight. The incident transpired last week when flight 1915 took off from Milwaukee as the unruly man approached the cabin crew and asked to open the aircraft door. After receiving a prompt rejection, the man started growing agitated, according to a reporter issued by the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport Department of Public Safety. He then rushed towards the door, hitting the attendant as she attempted to block him.</p>

<p>A passenger named Dough McCright, who saw the events unfolding in front of him, quickly assessed the situation and started planning his next move.</p>

<p>“I could tell that the conversation was not going very well,” Mr McCright told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.fox4news.com/news/american-airlines-passenger-duct-taped-dfw-airport" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Fox4</em></a>, adding that the man ignored the flight attendant despite her repeated attempts to reason and talk sense. After the attendant signalled for help, Mr McCright jumped in and addressed the man.</p>

<p>"I said, ‘Sir, she wants you to go back to your seat. You need to go back to your seat'. He turns and he says, ‘I'm getting off this flight! I want off this flight!'”</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/video-terrifying-footage-shows-passengers-fleeing-runway-as-plane-catches-fire-7099749" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Video: Terrifying Footage Shows Passengers Fleeing Runway As Plane Catches Fire</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>Investigation underway</strong></h3>

<p>As the situation escalated, Mr McCright grabbed the heckler from behind and held him back. Several other passengers, including one Charlie Boris, came to aid Mr McCright in pinning the man. The two men, alongside another passenger, dropped the heckler to the ground and taped his hands and feet while holding him for the last half an hour of the flight.</p>

<p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (GBI) have started their probe into the incident. The accused has not been charged with a crime but was taken to a hospital for mental health evaluation. He has not been named by the authorities so far.</p>

<p>"The safety and security of our customers and team members is our top priority and we thank our team members and customers for managing a difficult situation," read a statement by American Airlines.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Israel Cabinet is set to vote on a ceasefire deal with Lebanon on Tuesday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly gave his "in principle" approval to the plan after a security consultation with Israeli officials.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">The Israeli officials will meet on Tuesday evening to decide on the ceasefire deal as the United States, European Union, and United Nations have been pushing in recent days for a truce in the long-running hostilities between&nbsp;Israel&nbsp;and Hezbollah.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Benny Gantz, who had resigned from Israel's war cabinet in June over Netanyahu's handling of the war in Gaza, has called on the Prime Minister to make the details of the ceasefire public. "Netanyahu, present the agreement. It is the right of the residents of the north, the fighters, and the citizens of Israel to know," he wrote in a post on X.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The deal that would end the fighting calls for an&nbsp;initial two-month ceasefire during which Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon, and Hezbollah would end its armed presence south of the Litani River - over 28 kilometers from the border with Israel, The Israel Times reported.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Reportedly, the Israeli forces would also withdraw from&nbsp;southern Lebanon after the ceasefire deal.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The US, which has repeatedly voiced for a truce in the Gaza war, expressed optimism over the prospects of a ceasefire. "We believe we've reached this point where we're close to a ceasefire," US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Earlier this month, Qatar - which was a key part of the ceasefire negations in the Israel-Hamas war, withdrew as a mediator. It also warned Hamas that&nbsp;its Doha office "no longer serves its purpose".</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Amid the talks for a ceasefire, Iran's&nbsp;supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, on Monday, said that&nbsp;a war crimes case against Netanyahu&nbsp;was insufficient and that he deserved a "death sentence". This comes after the&nbsp;International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu last week.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Israel and Lebanon have been engaged in a prolonged conflict that began on October 7&nbsp;last year after Hezbollah attacked Israeli-controlled territory in solidarity with Hamas and Palestinians in Gaza. This sparked a series of tit-for-tat border attacks between Israel and Lebanon.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Heavy exchange of fire is continuing between Israel and Hezbollah as&nbsp;Lebanese media reported intense fighting in the border area. On Sunday,&nbsp;Iran-backed Hezbollah fired about 250 rockets and other projectiles into Israel in one of the group's&nbsp;heaviest barrages in months.&nbsp;The latest Israeli strikes also hit around two dozen Hezbollah targets across Lebanon.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">According to Lebanon's health ministry, over 3,700 people have been killed in the strikes since October last year.</li>

       <description><![CDATA[The tradition of pardoning the turkeys reportedly began during the Civil War when president Abraham Lincoln's son requested him to spare a turkey.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden on Monday (Nov 25) pardoned two white-plumed turkeys, Peach and Blossom, in his final participation in the annual reprieve event before he vacates the White House for President-elect Donald Trump. The Democrat joked about the fate of the two birds who have been named after the Delaware state flower, the peach blossom, which symbolises resilience. Speaking in front of a crowd of around 2,500 people, gathered in the South Lawn, Mr Biden expressed contentment as his half-a-century career in the power corridors of Washington neared the end.</p>

<p>"This event marks the official start of the holiday season here in Washington. It's also my last time to speak here as your president during this season and give thanks and gratitude. So let me say to you - it's been the honour of my life, I am forever thankful," Mr Biden said.</p>

<p>The two turkeys, who gobbled in the background as Mr Biden delivered the speech, were brought from a farm in the southern Minnesota city of Northfield, run by John Zimmerman, the president of the National Turkey Federation, which has gifted Thanksgiving turkeys to US presidents since the Harry Truman administration.</p>

<h3><strong>Why are the turkeys pardoned?</strong></h3>

<p>The tradition of pardoning the turkeys reportedly began during the Civil War when president Abraham Lincoln's son, Tad, requested him to spare a turkey named "Jack" from their holiday and he obliged. Lincoln's 1863 clemency to the turkey, recorded in an 1865 dispatch by reporter Noah Brooks led to the start of the tradition, according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.whitehousehistory.org/pardoning-the-thanksgiving-turkey" rel="Noindex, nofollow">White House.</a></p>

<p>However, the true beginning of what has evolved into the current tradition of turkey pardoning dates back to the Truman presidency in 1947. The official tradition began in 1989 at the White House when then-president George H.W. Bush offered the first official presidential pardon.</p>

<p>"Let me assure you, and this fine tom turkey, that he will not end up on anyone's dinner table, not this guy, he's granted a presidential pardon as of right now -- and allow him to live out his days on a children's farm not far from here," said Mr Bush in his speech back then.</p>

<h3><strong>How many turkeys are pardoned by the president?</strong></h3>

<p>The president pardons one or two turkeys each year. Akin to this year, Mr Biden pardoned two turkeys, Liberty and Bell, in 2023.</p>

<h3><strong>What happens to the pardoned turkeys?</strong></h3>

<p>After being granted the reprieve, the fortunate turkeys are sent to farms to live a life full of food and relaxation. This year, Peach and Blossom are expected to retreat at Farmamerica, an agricultural interactive centre in Minnesota, as per the National Turkey Federation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump vowed Monday to impose a 25 percent tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada as one of his first actions upon becoming US president in January.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump said Monday he intends to impose a 25 percent tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada, along with a 10 percent tariff on imports from China in response to the illegal drug trade and immigration.</p>

<p>In a series of posts to his Truth Social social media account, Trump vowed to hit some of the United States' largest trading partners with sweeping tariffs on all goods entering the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders," he wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In another post moments later, the past and future president said he would also be slapping China with a 10 percent tariff, "above any additional Tariffs," on all of its products entering the US in response to its failure to tackle fentanyl smuggling. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Tariffs are a key part of Trump's economic agenda, with the Republican president-elect vowing wide-ranging duties on allies and adversaries alike while he was on the campaign trail ahead of his November 5 victory.</p>

<p>Many economists have warned that tariffs would hurt growth and push up inflation, since they are primarily paid by importers bringing the goods into the US, who often pass those costs on to consumers.</p>

<p>But those in Trump's inner circle have insisted that the tariffs are a useful bargaining chip for the US to use to push its trading partners to agree to more favorable terms, and to bring back manufacturing jobs from overseas.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli strikes pummelled south Beirut on Monday, Lebanese official media said, and health authorities reported 31 people killed across the war-hit country, most of them in the south.</p>

<p>Israel's military said in a statement Monday afternoon it had hit "approximately 25 terror targets" belonging to Hezbollah across Lebanon, including in Nabatiyeh, Baalbek, the Bekaa Valley and southern Beirut and the city's outskirts.</p>

<p>AFPTV images showed palls of smoke over the capital's southern suburbs after strikes that began in the morning after successive Israeli military warnings to evacuate.</p>

<p>Lebanon's state-run National News Agency (NNA) reported a fourth wave of Israeli raids in south Beirut on Monday evening, saying "enemy warplanes launched strikes on (the) Haret Hreik and Shiyah" districts.</p>

<p>The attacks came after a weekend of heavy raids in the area, despite ongoing international ceasefire efforts.</p>

<p>Early Saturday, a deadly strike on central Beirut's densely populated Basta neighbourhood killed at least 29 people, the health ministry said.</p>

<p>Israel's army said Monday it had struck a Hezbollah command centre there, though an official with the Iran-backed group denied reports that a senior member had been targeted.</p>

<p>The NNA reported Israeli strikes on Tyre and Nabatiyeh after Israel issued evacuation warnings for parts of the main southern cities.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry said Israeli strikes killed at least 31 people on Monday.</p>

<p>A statement listed "the casualty toll of Israeli enemy strikes on a number of Lebanese cities and towns" in the east, south and near Beirut, with most people killed in the south and four killed in the east.</p>

<p><strong>'Dangerous conditions'</strong></p>

<p>The NNA also reported "a drone strike that targeted a residential complex" in a Druze-majority town on the outskirts of Beirut, without prior evacuation calls.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Druze community follows an offshoot of Shiite Islam, and its heartland around Mount Lebanon has largely been spared in the current hostilities.</p>

<p>The education ministry suspended classes on Monday in schools, technical institutes and private higher education institutions in Beirut and a number of surrounding areas, citing "the current dangerous conditions".</p>

<p>Hezbollah on Sunday claimed a higher than average 50 attacks on Israeli troops, military positions and towns across the border and in southern Lebanon. The Israeli army reported 250 projectiles launched into Israel.</p>

<p>On September 23, Israel intensified its air campaign in Lebanon, mainly targeting Hezbollah bastions in the south and east and in south Beirut, later sending ground troops across the border.</p>

<p>Israeli ground forces have entered several south Lebanon villages and towns near the border, including Khiam, where the NNA Monday reported fierce clashes with Hezbollah fighters.</p>

<p>The United Nations peacekeeping mission in Lebanon's south (UNIFIL), meanwhile, said Monday it was "seriously concerned" by recent deadly strikes on Lebanese soldiers, which Beirut has blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>While Lebanon's army is not engaged in the Israel-Hezbollah war, it has suffered multiple fatalities among its ranks, including one on Sunday.</p>

<p>The war has killed at least 3,799 people in Lebanon since October 2023, according to the health ministry, most of them since September.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, authorities say at least 82 soldiers and 47 civilians have been killed.</p>

<p>The United States, European Union and United Nations have all been actively pushing in recent days for parties to accept a truce in the war.</p>

<p>An Israeli official told AFP on condition of anonymity that Israel's security cabinet "will decide on Tuesday evening on the ceasefire deal".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden will attend Donald Trump's inauguration in January, the White House said Monday, calling it a "commitment to our democratic values" despite Trump skipping Biden's own swearing-in.</p>

<p>Then-president Trump refused to attend Biden's inauguration in 2021, after falsely claiming his election win was fraudulent and whipping up a mob of supporters who&nbsp;rushed into the US Capitol.</p>

<p>"The president promised that he would attend the inauguration of whomever won the election," Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates told reporters flying with Biden on Air Force One.</p>

<p>"He and the first lady are going to honor that promise and attend the inauguration."</p>

<p>Bates added: "He views that as an important demonstration of commitment to our democratic values and to honoring the will of the people, as we continue to provide an orderly and effective transition."</p>

<p>Despite repeatedly describing Trump as a threat to democracy during the 2024 campaign, Democrat Biden has made a point of providing Trump with the smooth transition that the Republican denied him.</p>

<p>Biden invited President-elect Trump to the White House the week after the November 5 vote, in which Trump beat Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris to win a historic comeback.</p>

<p>Biden, 82, dropped his own bid for a second term in July and endorsed Harris after a disastrous debate performance against Trump triggered fears among Democrats about his age and mental acuity.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A judge on Monday granted a request by prosecutors to dismiss the election subversion case against Donald Trump because of a Justice Department policy of not prosecuting a sitting president.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge on Monday granted a request by prosecutors to dismiss the election subversion case against Donald Trump because of a Justice Department policy of not prosecuting a sitting president.</p>

<p>Judge Tanya Chutkan agreed to the request by Special Counsel Jack Smith to dismiss the case against the president-elect "without prejudice," meaning it could potentially be revived after Trump leaves the White House four years from now.</p>

<p>"Dismissal without prejudice is appropriate here," Chutkan said, adding in the ruling that "the immunity afforded to a sitting President is temporary, expiring when they leave office."</p>

<p>Trump, 78, was accused of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election he lost to Joe Biden and removing large quantities of top secret documents after leaving the White House, but the cases never came to trial.</p>

<p>Smith also moved on Monday to drop his appeal of the dismissal of the documents case filed against the former president in Florida. That case was tossed out earlier this year by a Trump-appointed judge on the grounds that Smith was unlawfully appointed.</p>

<p>The special counsel paused the election interference case and the documents case this month after Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in the November 5 presidential election.</p>

<p>Smith cited the long-standing Justice Department policy of not indicting or prosecuting a sitting president in his motions to have the cases dismissed.</p>

<p>"The Government's position on the merits of the defendant's prosecution has not changed," Smith said in the filing with Chutkan. "But the circumstances have."</p>

<p>"It has long been the position of the Department of Justice that the United States Constitution forbids the federal indictment and subsequent criminal prosecution of a sitting President," Smith said.</p>

<p>"As a result this prosecution must be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated."</p>

<p>In a separate filing, Smith said he was withdrawing his appeal of the dismissal of the classified documents case against Trump but pursuing the case against his two co-defendants, Trump valet Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira.</p>

<p><strong>'Empty and lawless'</strong></p>

<p>Trump, in a post on Truth Social, said the cases were "empty and lawless, and should never have been brought."</p>

<p>"Over $100 Million Dollars of Taxpayer Dollars has been wasted in the Democrat Party's fight against their Political Opponent, ME," he said. "Nothing like this has ever happened in our Country before."</p>

<p>Trump was accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding -- the session of Congress called to certify Biden's win, which was violently attacked on January 6, 2021 by a mob of the then-president's supporters.</p>

<p>Trump was also accused of seeking to disenfranchise US voters with his false claims that he won the 2020 election.</p>

<p>The former and incoming president also faces two state cases -- in New York and Georgia.</p>

<p>He was convicted in New York in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels on the eve of the 2016 election to stop her from revealing an alleged 2006 sexual encounter.</p>

<p>However, Judge Juan Merchan has postponed sentencing while he considers a request from Trump's lawyers that the conviction be thrown out in light of the Supreme Court ruling in July that an ex-president has broad immunity from prosecution.</p>

<p>In Georgia, Trump faces racketeering charges over his efforts to subvert the 2020 election results in the southern state, but that case will likely be frozen while he is in office.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Online dictionary platform Dictionary.com has very mindfully chosen their word of the year as “demure”.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The word is a part of a phrase that became a viral sensation in August. It was brought into vogue by TikToker Jools Lebron whose phrase “very demure, very mindful” whose series of videos were later replicated by other influencers and creators.</p>

<p>According to Dictionary.com Demure saw a 200 times increase in searches and a 1200% increase online. It is defined as “characterized by shyness and modesty; reserved,” but it means something quite different when it comes to the usage on the internet.</p>

<p>It means being confident quietly, or an action otherwise submissive that gives confidence to a person or is empowering.</p>

<p>Jools Lebron, who identifies as a transgender woman, said TikTok has changed her life. “One day, I was playing cashier and making videos on my break, and now I'm flying across countries to host events, and I'm gonna be able to finance the rest of my transition," she added.</p>

<p>The phrase spread like forest fire on the internet after she made videos on how to be demure and mindful at the airport, at workplace, at a grocery store, or any situation one finds themselves in.</p>

<p>After the trend went viral, many other trans women joined in the trend, urging their followers and subscribers to act “mindful” and “demure”.</p>

<p>“See how I look very presentable? The way I came to the interview is the way I go to the job,” she said in a TikTok titled, “demure and modest and respectful at the workplace,” which gained over 54 million views.</p>

<p>This trend also roped in celebrities like Jenna Ortega, Jennifer Lopez, Penn Badgley, Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apart from the word ‘demure', Dictionary.com also announced their Word of the Year shortlist, with words like Brainrot, Brat, Extreme Weather, Midwest Nice, and Weird in the list.</p>

<p>Oxford University Press has also opened voting for its word that encapsulates 2024. The contenders are: slop, romantasy, lore, brainrot, demure and dynamic pricing and Cambridge Dictionary officially picked its Word of the Year as ‘Manifest'.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire Elon Musk, tapped by US President-elect Donald Trump to slash federal government spending, lashed out at modern fighter jets on Monday, saying that drones were the future of air combat.</p>

<p>"Manned fighter jets are obsolete in the age of drones anyway. Will just get pilots killed," said the head of SpaceX, Tesla and X, in a post on his social media platform.</p>

<p>Musk singled out the F-35 -- a next-generation fighter jet manufactured by US-based Lockheed Martin that entered service in 2015 -- for criticism.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, some idiots are still building manned fighter jets like the F-35," he posted, alongside a video of hundreds of drones hovering in formation in the sky.</p>

<p>The F-35, the world's most advanced fighter, is stealth capable and can also be used to gather intelligence.</p>

<p>Germany, Poland, Finland and Romania have all recently signed deals for the aircraft.</p>

<p>Its development, however, has suffered from issues, notably in the design of its computer programs, and its very high operating costs are regularly criticized by its detractors.</p>

<p>"The F-35 design was broken at the requirements level, because it was required to be too many things to too many people," said Musk on Monday, calling it "an expensive (and) complex jack of all trades, master of none."</p>

<p>For Mauro Gilli, a researcher at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, "what makes the F-35... expensive is the software and the electronics, not the pilot per se."</p>

<p>This is significant "because a reusable drone would need to get all that flashy electronics of an F-35," he said on X.</p>

<p>He also pointed out that the existence of the F-35 had forced US rivals to develop their own aircraft and advanced radar to match it.</p>

<p>"By simply existing, the F-35 and the B-1 force Russia and China into strategic choices they would not have to make otherwise (i.e. budget allocations)," Gilli said, referring to B-1 heavy bomber aircraft.</p>

<p>"Even if Musk were right (and he is not), deleting the programs would relax these constraints on them."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States believes a ceasefire deal between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah is "close" but negotiations are still ongoing, the White House said on Monday.</p>

<p>"We believe we've reached this point where we're close," National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters, adding however that "we're not there yet."</p>

<p>"We believe that the trajectory of this is going in a very positive direction -- but again nothing is done until everything is done, nothing is negotiated until everything is negotiated."</p>

<p>Kirby said it would be "irresponsible" to confirm press reports about the contents of any deal, adding that he did not want to do "anything that might torpedo our chances."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most people in Karachi city of Pakistan's Sindh province feel unsafe as the metropolitan city reported about 45,000 incidents of street crimes and mugging in the first eight months of 2024, the police said on Monday.</p>

<p>Last year, 118 people were killed in street crimes and mugging incidents while this year the figure is close to 100, the Police Citizens Liaison Committee said.</p>

<p>Most people in Karachi feel unsafe as the rate of violent crime has soared in the metropolitan city of nearly 20 million population, said Bashir Babu, a factory worker who has been a mugging victim twice.</p>

<p>"Criminals are operating brazenly during daytime or night and one doesn't feel safe going out as the fear of mugging hangs over you," claimed Babu.</p>

<p>The spread of social media has only added to the environment of anxiety and fear in the city as every day new videos are uploaded showing criminals snatching valuables in broad daylight on busy streets, at restaurants, at traffic lights, outside ATMs, at barbershops, even at mosques.</p>

<p>In such an environment, the people of Karachi are now faced with a new crime menace, the "Auto-Rickshaw gang".</p>

<p>"Auto-rickshaws remain an affordable and main mode of public transport for many people but in recent days there have been several cases of passengers, including ladies, being robbed of their valuables and belongings while using these rickshaws," police officer Abid Fazal said.</p>

<p>Fazal said they investigated cases where some criminal gangs were linked up with some auto-rickshaw drivers and teamed up to rob passengers.</p>

<p>"The modus operandi is the driver after carefully studying his passengers makes a call on whether they have cash and valuables with them," he said.</p>

<p>Fazal said the driver then uses his phone to either text the drop-off location or give the impression to the unsuspecting passenger he is talking to his family and lays out all the details of where he is.</p>

<p>Sumayya Firdous, a bank teller who was robbed of all her belongings just the other day while returning home, reported to the police that she never suspected the driver was informing his gang about where she was headed.</p>

<p>"As soon as we neared my drop-off location, two people on motorbikes with guns told the driver to stop the rickshaw to the side and one of them came in and sat with me and calmly took everything. I never suspected the driver was involved until the public had gathered there and stopped the driver from leaving. A police mobile, which arrived later, checked his phone," she recalled.</p>

<p>No wonder ineffective policing, growing corruption in police ranks, and general apathy from government and police officials in response to complaints about the law and order situation in Karachi has led citizens to now resort to mob justice, she said.</p>

<p>On Saturday, one robber was lynched and killed in the densely populated Federal B area after he and two others tried to rob a house.</p>

<p>Two of the robbers managed to escape with their lives.</p>

<p>There have been other incidents of vigilante justice where people have used firearms to kill robbers or beat them to death if any of them are caught.</p>

<p>This month itself there have been at least four recorded incidents of mob justice by people enraged by robberies.</p>

<p>In one incident, people chased down two fleeing men, killing one and injuring the other, before police rescued them.</p>

<p>Dr Humaira Yousuf, an expert on crime and violence who works for a Karachi-based Centre for Research and Security, said mob justice was a worrying trend in Karachi.</p>

<p>"People are frustrated when public trust in the law enforcement agencies is low."</p>

<p>This year, dozens of police officers and constables have been fired or suspended after being implicated with criminal gangs involved in street crime.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav is on a week-long visit to the United Kingdom (UK) and Germany from November 24 to November 30 to attract investment to the state.</p>

<p>On Monday, CM Yadav paid floral tributes to Mahatma Gandhi at the Parliament Square Gardens in London, UK.</p>

<p>"Today, we paid floral tributes at the statue of Mahatma Gandhi here. During the freedom movement, Gandhiji demonstrated a unique feat that the entire country is proud of. He defeated the world's most powerful empire through non-violence, which played a vital role in the country's independence. We remember him with great humility. I also pray that God enables the country and the state to progress on the path of non-violence shown by him," CM Yadav told ANI.</p>

<p>He further emphasised Madhya Pradesh's potential to attract large-scale investment from across the country and the world.</p>

<p>"MP has immense potential to attract investors, both nationally and globally, across various sectors including tourism, education, and healthcare. To ensure the state's development and create a robust system for public amenities, we need significant investment. For this, we must actively invite investors," CM Yadav said.</p>

<p>He highlighted that following the success of the Regional Industry Conclaves in Madhya Pradesh, many investors, particularly from the UK and Germany, have shown interest in investing in the state.</p>

<p>"After the success of our Regional Industry Conclaves, many investors from India and abroad, especially the UK and Germany, are keen to invest in our state. We are organising the Global Investors' Summit in Bhopal to provide an ideal platform for these investors. It is our responsibility to present our vision to them. From the UK, I will proceed to Germany to continue these efforts," he said.</p>

<p>He also mentioned his intention to visit other countries, should time permit.</p>

<p>"Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, we are consistently working to advance Madhya Pradesh. I am pleased to see our efforts yielding results," he added.</p>

<p>According to a release by the MP government, during his visit, the Chief Minister will hold one-on-one discussions with industrialists and investors to secure investments in key sectors such as the automobile industry, electric vehicles, renewable energy, education, and food processing. The focus will be on forming partnerships with major industries and MSMEs in both countries, highlighting Madhya Pradesh's advantages as a cost-effective and efficient manufacturing hub.</p>

<p>CM Yadav's UK visit will continue from November 24 to November 27, during which he will meet British MPs and business leaders. Efforts will also be made to expand the "Friends of MP" network. The visit includes interactive sessions, round-table meetings, and one-to-one discussions with prominent industrialists. Additionally, he will study the UK's expertise in urban redevelopment and technological innovation.</p>

<p>From November 27 to November 30, CM Yadav will visit major industrial cities in Germany, including Munich and Stuttgart. He will tour leading facilities such as SFC Energy, Berlocher, and Lepp Group, and hold round-table meetings with key industrialists. He will also encourage NRIs to invest and reside in Madhya Pradesh.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India supports an immediate ceasefire in West Asia and favours a two-state solution in the long-term, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Monday as he condemned terrorism, hostage-taking and civilian casualties in military operations.</p>

<p>Speaking at the 10th edition of the MED Mediterranean Dialogue in Rome, Mr Jaishankar said that the situation in West Asia is deeply concerning, both for what has happened and what may still come.</p>

<p>"India unequivocally condemns terrorism and hostage-taking. It also regards large-scale civilian casualties in military operations to be unacceptable. International humanitarian law cannot be disregarded," he said.</p>

<p>"In immediate terms, we should all support a ceasefire. India has also extended relief directly and through UNRWA. In the longer term, it is imperative that the future of the Palestinian people be addressed. India favours a two-State solution," he said.</p>

<p>Voicing concerns over the widening of the conflict in West Asia, Mr Jaishankar said that India has been in regular touch with both Israel and Iran at the highest levels to advocate restraint and enhance communication.</p>

<p>"Where Lebanon is concerned, there is an Indian contingent like Italy, that is part of UNIFIL. With regard to the Gulf of Aden and the northern Arabian Sea, Indian naval ships have been deployed since last year to protect commercial shipping. Given our capacity to engage various parties, we are always willing to contribute meaningfully to any international diplomatic endeavours, " he said.</p>

<p>United Nations Interim Force in South Lebanon (UNIFIL) has around 10,500 peacekeepers drawn from 50 troop-contributing countries. India has more than 900 people as part of UNIFIL in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Noting that the Ukraine-Russia conflict is in its third year, Mr Jaishankar said that the continuation of this conflict has serious destabilizing consequences, including for the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>"What is clear is that no solution is going to emerge from the battlefield. India has consistently held the view that disputes in this era cannot be settled by war. There must be a return to dialogue and diplomacy; the sooner the better. This is a widespread sentiment in the world today; especially in the Global South," he asserted.</p>

<p>Since June, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has personally engaged leaders of both Russia and Ukraine. This has included his visiting Moscow and Kyiv, he said.</p>

<p>"Our senior officials remain in continuous touch. We firmly believe that those who have the ability to explore finding common ground must step up to that responsibility," the minister said.</p>

<p>Talking about the growing challenges of these two major conflicts, he said the world is experiencing severe stress.</p>

<p>"Two major conflicts are underway. Supply chains are insecure. Connectivity, especially maritime, stands disrupted. Climate events are more extreme and frequent. And the Covid pandemic has left deep scars," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said the Mediterranean presents both opportunities and risks in an uncertain and volatile world. "Beyond extrapolating current trends, the new element of our relationship will be connectivity," he said.</p>

<p>He said that the conflict underway currently in West Asia has undoubtedly been a major complication. But the IMEEC (India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor), which can be a game changer, is proceeding ahead on the Eastern side, especially between India, UAE and Saudi Arabia, he added.</p>

<p>He also talked about the I2U2 grouping of India, Israel, UAE and the US, saying it is expected to be more active in times to come.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said India's trade with the Gulf alone is in the range of USD 160 to 180 billion annually. The rest of MENA (Middle East and North Africa) adds about another USD 20 billion. More than nine million Indians live and work in West Asia.</p>

<p>"Whether it is energy, technology, industrial projects or services, we have big stakes. It is also a region to which we are connected in history, culture and security," he said.</p>

<p>Talking about opportunities, Mr Jaishankar said a closer and stronger relationship between India and the Mediterranean will serve them well.</p>

<p>"We are today on the threshold of a new era. It is one of re-globalizing, re-balancing and multi-polarity. It is also a more technology-centred future, with a premium on the mobility of talent and greener growth. Opportunities in this world are as indivisible as anxieties. A closer and stronger relationship between India and the Mediterranean will serve both of us well," he said.</p>

<p>"Our annual trade with the Mediterranean nations is about USD 80 billion. We have a diaspora here of 460,000. About 40% of that in Italy. Our key interests are in fertilizers, energy, water technology, diamonds, defence and cyber," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said that India has significant projects underway as airports, ports, railways, steel, green hydrogen, phosphates and submarine cables.</p>

<p>"Our political relations with the Mediterranean are strong and our defence collaboration is growing, including more exercises and exchanges," he added.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar, who arrived here on Sunday on a three-day visit, will participate in the Outreach session of the G7 Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Fiuggi, where India has been invited as a guest country.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[The deadliest place for women is at home because a staggering 140 women and girls are killed every day by an intimate partner or family member.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The deadliest place for women is home because a staggering 140 women and girls are killed every day by an intimate partner or family member, according to a report released by UN Women and the UN Office of Drugs and Crime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This translates to approximately 51,100 victims globally in 2023, a slight increase from the previous year.</p>

<p>But the two agencies stressed that "Women and girls everywhere continue to be affected by this extreme form of gender-based violence and no region is excluded." And they said, "the home is the most dangerous place for women and girls."</p>

<p>The report, released on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, highlights the alarming rates of domestic violence worldwide. Africa recorded the highest number of intimate partner and family killings, with an estimated 21,700 victims in 2023. Africa also had the highest number of victims relative to the size of its population - 2.9 victims per 100,000 people.</p>

<p>The Americas and Oceania also reported high rates of domestic violence, with 1.6 and 1.5 female victims per 100,000 people, respectively.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In contrast, Asia and Europe reported significantly lower rates, with 0.8 and 0.6 victims per 100,000 people, respectively.</p>

<p>However, the majority of male homicides happen outside of home.</p>

<p>"Even though men and boys account for the vast majority of homicide victims, women and girls continue to be disproportionately affected by lethal violence in the private sphere," the report said.</p>

<p>"An estimated 80% of all homicide victims in 2023 were men while 20% were women, but lethal violence within the family takes a much higher toll on women than men, with almost 60% of all women who were intentionally killed in 2023 being victims of intimate partner/family member homicide," it said.</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://apnews.com/article/un-killing-women-girls-partners-family-global-c2f26290b8158e1d97b1b16ef76e85a8" rel="noindex,nofollow">Associated Press</a>, despite steps being taken to prevent the killing of women, the killings "remain at alarmingly high levels."</p>

<p>The report emphasises that domestic violence is a preventable crime, often resulting from repeated episodes of gender-based violence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The UN agencies urge countries to take timely and effective interventions to prevent domestic violence and protect women and girls from lethal violence in the private sphere.<br />

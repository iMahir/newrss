       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Jordanian man has returned to his home country after spending 38 years in Syrian jails, an official said on Tuesday, after the fall of president Bashar al-Assad ended an agonising wait for his family.</p>

<p>The man, named as Osama Bashir Hassan al-Bataynah, was found in Syria "unconscious and suffering from memory loss", Jordanian Foreign Ministry Soufian al-Kodat told AFP.</p>

<p>Kodat said the man's relatives reported his disappearance in 1986, when he was just 18, and that he had been in jail ever since.</p>

<p>"He was transferred from Damascus to the Jaber border crossing (with Jordan) where he was handed over to border guards," added Kodat, saying the man had been reunited with his family on Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>The rebels who swept Assad from power on Sunday also opened the prisons and released thousands of detainees.</p>

<p>Civil society groups had long accused Assad of presiding over a brutal regime of arbitrary arrests, torture and murder in prisons.</p>

<p>Many foreigners were being held, including Suheil Hamawi from Lebanon who returned to his country on Monday after being locked up for 33 years.</p>

<p>The Arab Organization for Human Rights in Jordan said Tuesday there were still 236 Jordanians detained in Syria.</p>

<p>Amnesty International has documented thousands of killings at Saydnaya prison, whose name has become synonymous with the worst atrocities of Assad's rule, and dubbed it a "human slaughterhouse".</p>

<p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimated in 2022 that more than 100,000 people had died in the jails since the start of an uprising in 2011 that led to the civil war.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Rajnath Singh and his top delegation of defence personnel continue their Russia visit, there are talks of a mega defence agreement between Moscow and New Delhi being in advanced stages. The deal - reportedly worth $4 billion will give a massive boost to India's air defence infrastructure.</p>

<p>The equipment being discussed by both sides is the advanced 'Voronezh' series radar which is manufactured by Russia's Almaz-Antey Corporation, which is a specialist organisation for manufacturing anti-aircraft missile systems and radars.</p>

<p>The Voronezh radar is a very-long-range early warning radar system with a range well over 8,000 kilometers. It is capable of identifying and tracking threats like ballistic missiles, fighter jets, and ICBMs. Should India acquire it, the advanced radar system will be able to detect any air threat from anywhere in China, South and Central Asia, and most of the Indian Ocean region.</p>

<p>The Voronezh radar can detect more than 500 objects simultaneously. While its overall range can go up to 10,000 kilometers, it's vertical range exceeds 8,000 km and horizon range is over 6,000 km. Moscow claims that the Voronezh radar system can even track stealth aircraft. Due to its massive vertical range, it can provide complete data about ICBMs and situational awareness of near-Earth objects in space.</p>

<p>According to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.rt.com/india/609068-india-russia-long-range-radars/" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">Russia Today</a>, talks between Moscow and New Delhi have been on for a while and last month, a team from Almaz-Antey even visited India to interact with possible offset partners who will be part of the project.</p>

<p>In another report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://sundayguardianlive.com/news/india-may-acquire-advanced-russian-radar-system" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">The Sunday Guardian</a>, there is a push under the 'Make in India' initiative for at least 60 per cent of the radar system to be manufactured locally, for which offset partners are being sought in India.</p>

<p>Should the deal be finalised, the advanced radar system will likely be set up in Karnataka's Chitradurga district, and the designated location for it has also reportedly been surveyed. Chitradurga is already home to some of India's most advanced and top secret defence and aerospace facilities.</p>

<p>The radar system, once acquired, will significantly improve India's threat-detection and surveillance capabilities in Asia and the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). It will also enhance India's air defence infrastructure to fulfil its needs amid ever-growing regional and global challenges.</p>

<p>On day 2 of his visit today, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and his Russian counterpart Andrey Belousov will co-chair a top-level meeting on military-technical cooperation between New Delhi and Moscow. India and Russia share a special, privileged, and strategic defence partnership.</p>

<p>Mr Singh will also take stock of the deliveries of the two remaining S-400 Triumph missile systems that New Delhi is yet to receive. India had signed a deal in 2018 for Russia to supply its advanced S-400 missile systems.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Dr. Aseem Malhotra, a British Indian Consultant Cardiologist, has written an open letter to the General Medical Council (GMC) of the UK, stating that the vaccines cause greater harm than benefit.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Doctors and healthcare professionals across the world have signed a petition calling for the immediate suspension of all COVID-19 mRNA products due to concerns that the vaccines may be contributing to an alarming rise in excess deaths.</p>

<p>"A growing body of evidence suggests that the widespread rollout of the novel Covid-19 mRNA vaccine products is contributing to an alarming rise in disability and excess deaths," reads the Hope Accord petition.</p>

<p>The petition, known as the HOPE Accord, has attracted signatures from several healthcare professionals and highlights the need for a comprehensive re-evaluation of the vaccines.</p>

<p>The vaccines use "gene-based technology" and were given emergency medical authorisation to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>"This new technology was granted emergency use authorisation to address a situation that no longer exists. Going forward, the burden of proof falls on those still advocating for these products to compellingly demonstrate that they aren't resulting in net harm. Until such evidence is presented, regulators should suspend their use as a matter of standard medical precaution," the petition mentions.</p>

<p>It demands full transparency from government bodies and the pharmaceutical industry, including access to previously undisclosed anonymised patient-level data from clinical trials and surveillance programs.</p>

<p>It also highlights the need to mitigate publication bias, where unfavourable results are often rejected or withheld due to fears of reputational damage.</p>

<p>Dr. Aseem Malhotra, a British Indian Consultant Cardiologist, has written an open letter to the General Medical Council (GMC) of the UK, stating that the vaccines cause greater harm than benefit.</p>

<p>"Serious harms from the vaccine have been confirmed from a combination of clinical, mechanistic, randomised controlled trials, observational, pharmacovigilance, and autopsy data. In these studies, the majority of deaths that occurred within two weeks of taking the vaccine died as a result of the mRNA product," he writes.</p>

<p>According to the petition, calls for independent investigations should be properly resourced to allow a comprehensive re-evaluation of all COVID-19 vaccine products.</p>

<p>"There must be a full exploration of mechanisms of harm to provide insight into their impact on the human body, both short and long term", the petition states.</p>

<p>It also urges for a comprehensive review of the actual clinical impact on illness and mortality, rather than relying on synthetic results based on modeled assumptions.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 23-year-old man in the United States has been arrested for allegedly murdering his father and attempting to kill his mother in Bartow, Florida. According to <em>The Independent,</em> Joseph Voigt on Monday admitted to shooting his mother, 58-year-old Susan Voigt, and killing his father, 63-year-old Marvin Voigt, over the weekend. Authorities said they arrived at the scene after Ms Susan called the cops and said she and her husband had been shot by their son who took off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After reaching the scene, police found Marvin Voigt dead in the driveway from apparent gunshot wounds. Susan Voigt, inside the family's home, had sustained a "serious gunshot wound" but was given "life-saving measures" by a fire and emergency medical service team and is now in "critical condition, but stable" in an area hospital, police said, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/jospeh-voigt-florida-shooting-charges-b2661648.html" rel="noindex,nofollow">outlet</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 23-year-old fled the scene after the shooting and was later arrested in Orlando, officials said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the authorities, Joseph Voigt said that he shot his parents because his father was upset with him about "spending the majority of his time playing video games" and "riding his ass about making something himself and getting a job".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Everything we've heard about this couple was that they were really good people," Stephen Walker of the Bartow Police Department said. "It's sad, you know, to see something like this happen," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Thanks to the rapid response of the Bartow Police Department this violent and dangerous suspect was quickly apprehended," Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said in a statement. "My detectives will continue their thorough investigation into this crime to ensure Voigt will face the full consequences of his actions," the sheriff continued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Joseph Voigt appeared in court in Orange County on Monday morning. He will be brought back to jail in Polk County, where he'll face murder and attempted murder charges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.fox13news.com/news/bartow-man-kills-father-injures-mom-because-dad-wanted-him-stop-playing-video-games-get-job-pcso" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>Fox News</em></a>, his criminal history includes arrest for firing a weapon in a residential area and battery. He was released from jail on December 1.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A wife has lost her husband and basically lost a son also, at the end of the day," Mr Walker said. "So, it's going to be a real tough, tough road for her. I feel really bad for her... We are deeply saddened by this tragic and senseless shooting," he added.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Award-winning US poet Nikki Giovanni, who was at the forefront of the Black Arts Movement, died aged 81 after a long battle with cancer, local media reported Tuesday.</p>

<p>Widely regarded as one of the most prolific African-American poets, Giovanni received numerous awards and a Grammy nomination for her work on civil rights, gender and race issues.</p>

<p>Giovanni, whose most famous poems included 'Knoxville, Tennessee' and 'Nikki-Rosa', died following her third cancer diagnosis, the media reported.</p>

<p>She "died peacefully on December 9, 2024, with her life-long partner, Virginia (Ginney) Fowler, by her side," her friend and fellow writer Renee Watson said in a statement to CNN.</p>

<p>"We will forever be grateful for the unconditional time she gave to us, to all her literary children across the writerly world," poet Kwame Alexander told US media.</p>

<p>The Black Arts Movement, which flourished between 1965 and 1974, saw a wave of Black culture and literature championed by writers including Maya Angelou, James Baldwin and Audre Lorde.</p>

<p>In her writing, Giovanni reflected on her childhood growing up in Tennessee and Ohio, pushed for Black and civil rights, and described her long struggle with lung cancer.</p>

<p>"As one of the cultural icons of the Black Arts and Civil Rights Movements, she became friends with Rosa Parks, Aretha Franklin, James Baldwin, Nina Simone, and Muhammad Ali, and inspired generations of students, artists, activists, musicians, scholars and human beings, young and old," Watson said in her statement.</p>

<p>Giovanni went on to teach creative writing and literature at Virginia Tech and received numerous awards including the NAACP Image Award, the Rosa Parks Award and the Langston Hughes Award for Distinguished Contributions to Arts and Letters.</p>

<p>In 2004, she received a Grammy Best Spoken Word Album nomination for 'The Nikki Giovanni Poetry Collection'.</p>

<p>In a brief biography on her website, Giovanni wrote: "I wanted to be a writer who dreams or maybe a dreamer who writes but I knew one book does not a writer make."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former BBC journalist has been jailed for eight years for a string of child abuse offences, including paying money to watch live streams of children being sexually exploited in the Philippines. According to the BBC, 52-year-old Duncan Bartlett was sentenced at Wood Green Crown Court in London after pleading guilty to 35 offences in August. The police said Bartlett, who worked as a BBC journalist for 14 years until 2015, was first arrested in September 2021, after they received intelligence which linked him to accessing indecent images of children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Metropolitan Police seized Bartlett's electronic devices which uncovered 6,000 indecent images, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cje9xjywjdwo" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>BBC</em></a>. They also found evidence he made payments to people in the Philippines who would arrange live films of children being sexually exploited for Bartlett to watch. The cops said that some of the victims have been identified and put under safeguarding measures in the Philippines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bartlett was the BBC's correspondent in Tokyo and presented "World Business Report" on the BBC World Service.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/bbc-journalist-duncan-bartlett-jailed-b2661577.html" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>The Independent</em></a>, the 52-year-old pleaded guilty to 11 counts of causing a girl under 13 to engage in sexual activity, nine counts of causing a girl 13-15 to engage in sexual activity, 10 counts of paying for the sexual services of a girl under 13, three charges of making indecent images of children, and two offences of encouraging the commission of either way offences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Over a period of seven years, Bartlett made multiple payments to people in the Philippines asking that they arrange children to be sexually exploited for his own gratification. With close liaison work with our counterparts in the Philippines, we managed to identify and safeguard some of these children while several adults were arrested," said Detective Constable Emily Dawson.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Bartlett's behaviour was utterly abhorrent but thanks to the painstaking work of detectives, a case documenting his offending was put together - this left him with no option but to admit his guilt," she added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>BBC </em>reported that Bartlett continued working as a researcher and expert in China at London's SOAS University until after his guilty plea. He apparently did not tell his employer about his offending and the university did not discover the details of the case until yesterday, December 9. A spokeswoman for SOAS confirmed Bartlett was a research associate and contractor at the London University's China Institute between 1 January 2021 and 30 September 2024.</p>

<p>"Although not a permanent member of staff or in a student-facing role, he was paid as a contractor to produce a series of podcasts about China, producing his last edition in September 2024. Neither SOAS nor the SOAS China Institute were aware of any legal proceedings before we were contacted by the media about this case today," the spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The protoplanetary disk, designated as 114-426, is situated in the Orion Nebula, a vast star-forming region approximately 1,300 light-years away from Earth.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a groundbreaking finding, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered frozen water in a distant protoplanetary disk, located outside our Solar System. This remarkable detection was made possible by the JWST's advanced Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), which captured high-resolution images of the disk. The protoplanetary disk, designated as 114-426, is situated in the Orion Nebula, a vast star-forming region approximately 1,300 light-years away from Earth. The disk, which spans over 1,000 times the Earth-Sun distance, is thought to be a nursery for planet formation.</p>

<p>The JWST's <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2412.04356v1">NIRCam images </a>revealed the presence of frozen water in the form of ice grains, which coat the disk's dust particles. This detection was made at a wavelength of 3 micrometres, a range that is uniquely accessible to the JWST.</p>

<p>The protoplanetary disk's central band blocks the star's light, creating an eerie silhouette against the nebula's radiant backdrop. However, the disk's material scatters light, forming vibrant lobes that illuminate the surrounding space.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">JWST finds water-ice in the protoplanetary disk 114–426 in Orion.<a href="https://t.co/BQc1ikRY7K">https://t.co/BQc1ikRY7K</a> <a href="https://t.co/PE0tM7oUJR">pic.twitter.com/PE0tM7oUJR</a></p>

<p>The presence of water ice in such environments is a promising indicator of the potential for planet formation. Water is a critical ingredient for life as we know it, and its availability during the early stages of planetary formation suggests that habitable conditions might arise elsewhere in the universe.</p>

<p>The Edge-On Orion Silhouette Disk is particularly intriguing due to its unique edge-on orientation, which offers an unobstructed view of the disk's composition and structure. JWST's observations revealed not only the presence of water ice but also other volatile compounds, such as carbon dioxide and methane, which are essential for building organic molecules.</p>

<p>The discovery of frozen water in this distant protoplanetary disk has significant implications for our understanding of planet formation and the origins of water in our Solar System.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards said on Tuesday that the Islamic Republic had not been weakened following the fall of its ally Bashar al-Assad in Syria, Iranian media reported.</p>

<p>"We have not been weakened and Iran's power has not diminished," Hossein Salami was quoted as telling members of parliament in a closed session.</p>

<p>Iran and Russia had propped up Assad's rule since Syria's civil war erupted in 2011 with military support, men and airpower. Tehran deployed its Revolutionary Guards to Syria to keep its ally in power to maintain Tehran's "Axis of Resistance" to Israel and U.S. influence in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Assad's exit has eroded Tehran's ability to project power and sustain its network of militia groups across the region, particularly to its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon, which agreed a ceasefire with Israel last month.</p>

<p>"The overthrow of the Zionist regime (Israel) is not off the agenda," Salami said in the session which met to discuss the latest developments in Syria.</p>

<p>Salami said no Iranian forces remained in Syria.</p>

<p>Following Assad's fall from power, Iran's foreign ministry called for a national dialogue to form an inclusive government representing all segments of Syrian society. Iran's government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani on Tuesday called for "respect for Syria's territorial integrity", saying the Syrian people should decide their own fate.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[By 2030, this pollution could lead to 1,300 premature deaths annually in the US and public health costs of nearly $20 billion.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the exponential rise of AI in many professional sectors, there has been a boom in gadgets powered by AI. This revolution in technology will definitely make life easier with much advancement; however, there is a new environmental footprint as well. There are significant concerns related to increased air pollution through the emissions of power plants and diesel backup generators, which are a requirement for maintaining steady electricity supplies for the increasing network of data centres and computer processing centers. These facilities are critical for AI operations and contribute increasingly to the level of air pollution; hence, sustainable solutions to innovation need to be developed to maintain environmental responsibility.</p>

<p>As per a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2024/12/09/ais-deadly-air-pollution-toll"><em>release by the University of California</em></a>, this air pollution is expected to result in as many as 1,300 premature deaths a year by 2030 in the United States. Total public health costs from cancers, asthma, other diseases, and missed work and school days are approaching an estimated $20 billion a year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Such are the findings of a study by UC Riverside and Caltech scientists published online this week. Yet, these human and financial costs appear overlooked by the tech industry.</p>

<p>"If you look at those sustainability reports by tech companies, they only focus on carbon emissions, and some of them include water as well, but there's absolutely no mention of unhealthful air pollutants, and these pollutants are already creating a public health burden," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2024/12/09/ais-deadly-air-pollution-toll">said Shaolei Ren</a>, a UCR associate professor of electrical and computer engineering and a corresponding author of the study.</p>

<p>The authors, including Caltech professor and computer scientist Adam Wierman, recommend that standards and methods be adopted that require tech companies to report the air pollution caused by their power consumption and backup generators.</p>

<p>They further recommend that communities hit hardest by air pollution from data processing centre electricity production be properly compensated by the tech companies for the health burden.</p>

<p>The authors also found that air pollution stemming from AI disproportionately affects certain low-income communities, partly because of their proximity to power plants or backup generators at the data processing centers. Additionally, the pollution drifts across county and state lines, creating health impacts on communities far and wide, Ren said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The data centres pay local property taxes to the county where they operate," Ren said. "But this health impact is not just limited to a small community. Actually, it travels across the whole country, so those other places are not compensated at all."&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has shared an old video in which he predicted that the internet would “revolutionise traditional media”. Mr Musk's 1998 prophecy&nbsp;has come true; the internet has indeed transformed the way we consume media today.</p>

<p>In the reposted video from 26 years ago, the Tesla CEO responded to an interviewer's question about the future of the internet. “I think the internet is the superset of all media,” Mr Musk said. “It is the fuel and end all of the media. One will see print, broadcast, arguably, radio... essentially all media falling into the internet.”</p>

<p>He explained the internet's unique ability to facilitate interactive “two-way communication medium that is intelligent.” “It allows consumers to choose what they want to see, when they want to see it, whether that be radio, whether that be print, whether that be television, broadcast,” he added.</p>

<p>“I think it's going to revolutionise all traditional media,” he concluded.</p>

<p>He now revealed that many once thought his vision was “crazy,” for pointing out “this super obvious prediction.”</p>

<p>Elon Musk aims to provide high-speed internet globally through his <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/starlink-in-india-soon-elon-musk-takes-on-mukesh-ambanis-reliance-jio-7003416 ">SpaceX Starlink project</a>, which uses a network of satellites in low-Earth orbit. The service is designed to serve remote and underserved regions, offering unlimited data, no contracts, and low-latency connections. Starlink is user-friendly, with customers receiving a dish and modem that can be self-installed. Starlink is also reportedly seeking to enter the Indian market to provide satellite internet, challenging major players like Jio and Airtel.</p>

<p>Earlier, the SpaceX CEO predicted that artificial intelligence (AI) will eventually eliminate all jobs, but he doesn't view this as a negative development. Speaking remotely at the Viva Tech event in Paris, Mr Musk said, “Probably none of us will have a job,” in a future where work becomes “optional.”<br />
<br />
He explained that people could choose to work if they wanted to, describing jobs as something one could do “like a hobby.” He believes AI and robots will provide all the goods and services people need. Mr Musk also mentioned the need for a “universal high income” to make this vision a reality, though he clarified that this is different from universal basic income (UBI), a concept where the government provides money to everyone, regardless of their earnings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet, engaged with his Tesla counterpart Elon Musk after the announcement of Google's latest quantum computing advancement, Willow. The conversation, which unfolded on X (formerly Twitter), quickly went viral, capturing the attention of tech enthusiasts and industry professionals.</p>

<p>On X, Mr Pichai introduced Willow, calling it a “state-of-the-art quantum computing chip with a breakthrough that can reduce errors exponentially.” He added, “In benchmark tests, Willow solved a standard computation in &lt;5 mins that would take a leading supercomputer over 10^25 years, far beyond the age of the universe(!).”</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Musk replied, “That will probably happen,” before steering the conversation into a broader discussion on cosmic philosophy, referencing the Kardashev scale, a method of measuring a civilisation's technological advancement based on energy consumption. He added, “Any self-respecting civilization should at least reach Kardashev Type II. In my opinion, we are currently only at &lt;5% of Type I. To get to ~30%, we would need to place solar panels in all desert or highly arid regions.”<br />
<br />
To this, the Google CEO said, “Indeed. We should scale solar so much more, amazing that we keep looking at alternatives when the most obvious path is staring at our eyes, literally!”</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast, has spent $14 million to construct a city for his upcoming game show, <em>Beast Games.</em> The highly-anticipated series will premiere on Prime Video on December 19 and promises a spectacle of massive proportions. The custom-built city, reportedly located in Toronto, has been designed to accommodate 1,000 contestants who will compete for a $5 million grand prize.</p>

<p>MrBeast, known for his extravagant stunts and giveaways, revealed on X that the city serves as both a living space and a competition venue. He shared his excitement writing, “We spent $14,000,000 building a city in a field for the contestants in <em>Beast Games.”</em></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>In the pictures shared on MrBeast's X, we see the custom-built city for <em>Beast Games. </em>One image shows a sprawling locality with a garden, complete with umbrellas, lawn chairs, and tables set for four.</p>

<p>Another photo features the contestants' living quarters, centred around a glass box containing $5 million in cash placed on the lawn in front of a high-tech house. The house itself stands out with sleek architecture, illuminated lights, and a glowing signboard reading “<em>Beast Games.”</em></p>

<p>The compound is surrounded by water, giving it an island-like appeal. A long driveway lined with palm trees leads to the main building, while smaller cottages encircle the central structure. A dedicated cycle path adds to the city's modern charm. This self-contained setting sets the stage for what MrBeast promises to be “the most insane competition show you've ever seen.”</p>

<p>The production has already set over 40 Guinness World Records, including the largest cash prize and the most contestants in a game show. The show's trailer teases a range of jaw-dropping challenges, featuring monster trucks, Navy SEALs, daring stunts, and even a massive pirate ship as part of the set.</p>

<p>MrBeast previously described the project as “the largest game show in history,” with a teaser released on November 25. His team has also said to have donated items like mattresses, sleeping bags, and clothing used during the show to local organisations.</p>

<p>However, <em>Beast Games </em>has faced criticism and legal troubles. Reports surfaced alleging unsafe conditions during filming, including crew members being hospitalised due to falling set pieces and contestants experiencing "inhumane" working conditions, as per the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/style/mrbeast-reality-show-lawsuit.html " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">NYT</a>.</p>

<p>Some participants claimed they were deprived of sufficient food, medication, and hygiene supplies, with delays spanning hours or even days. Several contestants also reported injuries sustained during the challenges, requiring medical attention. At least five contestants are planning to file a class-action lawsuit against MrBeast.</p>

<p>The YouTuber has dismissed some claims as “disinformation.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just over a year ago, China gave Bashar al-Assad and his wife a warm welcome during their six-day visit to the country, offering the former Syrian leader a rare break from years of international isolation since the start of a civil war in 2011.</p>

<p>As the couple attended the Asian Games, President Xi Jinping vowed to support Assad in "opposing external interference" and in Syria's rebuilding, while his wife Asma was feted in Chinese media.</p>

<p>But the abrupt end to the rule of the authoritarian leader so explicitly backed by Xi only last year has dealt a blow to China's diplomatic ambitions in the Middle East and exposed the limits of its strategy in the region, analysts say.</p>

<p>A coalition of rebels seized Syria's capital Damascus on Sunday after a lightning offensive that toppled&nbsp;Assad's&nbsp;regime and ended his family's 50-year dynasty.</p>

<p>"There's been a lot of an exaggerated sense of China's ability to shape political outcomes in the region," said Jonathan Fulton, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.</p>

<p>While the collapse of the Assad regime was seen reducing the influence in the Arab world of his main backers, Iran and Russia, it was also a blow for China's global ambitions, said Fulton.</p>

<p>"A lot of what (China has) been doing internationally has relied on support with those countries, and their inability to prop up their biggest partner in the Middle East says quite a lot about their ability to do much beyond the region."</p>

<h3><strong>TACKLING HOTSPOTS</strong></h3>

<p>After China brokered a deal between long-time rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran in 2023, Chinese media praised Beijing's rising profile in a neighbourhood long dominated by Washington.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wang Yi, China's top diplomat, said the country would play a constructive role in handling global "hotspot issues".</p>

<p>China also brokered a truce between Fatah, Hamas and other rival Palestinian factions earlier this year and has made repeated calls for a ceasefire in Gaza.</p>

<p>But despite bringing Middle Eastern leaders to Beijing and rounds of "shuttle diplomacy" by its Middle Eastern envoy, Zhai Jun, in the months since, Palestinians have not formed a unity government and the conflict in Gaza continues.</p>

<p>"Assad's&nbsp;sudden downfall is not a scenario Beijing wishes to see," said Fan Hongda, a Middle East scholar at Shanghai International Studies University. "China prefers a more stable and independent Middle East, as chaos or a pro-American orientation in the region does not align with China's interests."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The response by China's foreign ministry to&nbsp;Assad's&nbsp;fall has been muted, focusing on the safety of Chinese nationals and calling for a "political solution" to restore stability in Syria as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Ministry of foreign affairs spokesperson, Mao Ning, on Monday appeared to leave an opening for engagement with the future government: "China's friendly relations with Syria are for all Syrian people," she said.</p>

<p>Chinese experts and diplomats say Beijing will now bide its time before recognising a new government in Damascus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It could use its expertise and financial muscle to support reconstruction, they say, but its commitments are likely to be limited because China has sought to minimise financial risks overseas in recent years.</p>

<p>Syria joined China's flagship Belt and Road Initiative in 2022, but there have been no significant investments by Chinese firms since, partly due to sanctions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China is "not really able to fundamentally replace the West either as an economic partner, or diplomatic or military force in the region," said Bill Figueroa, assistant professor at the University of Groningen and an expert in China-Middle East relations.</p>

<p>"China in 2024 has way less money than China in 2013 - 2014, when the BRI was launched," Figueroa said. There is "an obvious reassessment going on in the direction of safer investments and reducing China's risks overall," he added.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[After 60 years of research, scientists have discovered the gene responsible for orange fur in cats, finding that it is linked to a missing DNA segment that affects melanocyte-specific gene expression.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After six decades of research, scientists have discovered the gene responsible for the orange fur seen in domestic cats. Two separate research teams found that the characteristic ginger, calico, and tortoiseshell colours in cats are due to a missing piece of DNA in a part of the cat's genome that doesn't make proteins. This breakthrough explains why some cats have their distinctive fiery fur.</p>

<p>"The sex-linked orange mutation in domestic cats causes variegated patches of reddish/yellow hair and is a defining signature of random X-inactivation in female tortoiseshell and calico cats. Unlike the situation for most coat colour genes, there is no apparent homolog for sex-linked orange in other mammals," the authors of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.21.624608v1"><em>the study</em></a> wrote.</p>

<p>"We show that the sex-linked orange is caused by a 5 kb deletion that leads to ectopic and melanocyte-specific expression of the Rho GTPase Activating Protein 36 (Arhgap36) gene. Single-cell RNA-seq studies from foetal cat skin reveal that red/yellow hair colour is caused by reduced expression of melanogenic genes that are normally activated by the melanocortin 1 receptor (Mc1r)-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, but the Mc1r gene and its ability to stimulate cAMP accumulation are intact."</p>

<p>"Instead, we show that increased expression of Arhgap36 in melanocytes leads to reduced levels of the PKA catalytic subunit (PKAC); thus, sex-linked orange is genetically and biochemically downstream of Mc1r. Our findings solve a comparative genomic conundrum, provide in vivo evidence for the ability of Arhgap36 to inhibit PKA, and reveal a molecular explanation for a charismatic colour pattern with a rich genetic history."</p>

<p>"I am fully convinced this is the gene and am happy," Carolyn Brown, a University of British Columbia geneticist who was not involved in either study, told Science. "It's a question I've always wanted the answer to."</p>

<p>As per a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.science.org/content/article/gene-behind-orange-fur-cats-found-last"><em>release, </em></a>scientists have long been fascinated by tortoiseshell and calico cats: the offspring of a black cat and an orange cat. Multicoloured cats from such a cross are almost always female, suggesting the gene variant that makes fur orange or black is located on the X chromosome. The male offspring of such a cross are typically unicolor because they inherit just one parent's X chromosome: We can guess, for instance, that Garfield's mother is orange because he inherited his only X chromosome from her.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has hit again after joking about making Canada the "51st state" of the US. This time, he has dubbed Justin Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, as "Governor", a post referring to the executive head of a US state. Trump made the remarks on Truth Social, a social media network he owns, over a week after he attended a dinner with Trudeau at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.</p>

<p>"It was a pleasure to have dinner the other night with Governor Justin Trudeau of the Great State of Canada. I look forward to seeing the Governor again soon so that we may continue our in-depth talks on Tariffs and Trade, the results of which will be truly spectacular for all," said the Republican leader.</p>

<p>The dinner meeting on November 30, which saw Trudeau flying in from Ottawa, followed a warning by Trump to slap 25% tariffs on Canadian imports unless it acts against immigrants trying to cross its southern border.</p>

<p>Trudeau had argued that such high tariffs would "kill" the Canadian economy, after which Trump jokingly suggested that Canada become the 51st state of the US to avoid the tariffs. Trump's remark caused Trudeau to laugh nervously, Fox News had reported.</p>

<p>This would make Canada a very liberal state, someone commented at the meeting, evoking more laughter. Trump played along and told Trudeau that Canada could become two states and he could become a Governor if he cannot handle his list of demands.</p>

<p>Canada's trade is heavily dependent on the US, which alone consumes about three-fourths of its goods and services, and high tariffs would badly hurt the Canadian economy.</p>

<p>After the dinner, Trudeau said he had "an excellent conversation" with Trump, but stayed clear of any remark about tariffs and the relationship with the President-elect.</p>

<p>Trump, too, had called it a "very productive meeting", during which they discussed a range of topics. Fentanyl, a drug that threatens a severe epidemic in the US, also figured in the talks, so did illegal immigration, the trade deficit between the US and Canada, and fair trade deals, according to Trump.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Assad fled Syria as the Islamist-led rebels swept into the capital, bringing an end on to five decades of brutal rule by his clan.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syria's Islamist rebel leader on Monday began discussions on transferring power, a day after his opposition alliance dramatically unseated president Bashar al-Assad following decades of brutal rule.</p>

<p>Assad fled Syria as the Islamist-led rebels swept into the capital, bringing a spectacular end on Sunday to five decades of brutal rule by his clan.</p>

<p>He oversaw a crackdown on a democracy movement that erupted in 2011, sparking a war that killed 500,000 people and forced half the country to flee their homes, millions of them finding refuge abroad.</p>

<p>Rebel leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, now using his real name Ahmed al-Sharaa, met with outgoing prime minister Mohammed al-Jalali "to coordinate a transfer of power that guarantees the provision of services" to Syria's people, said a statement posted on the rebels' Telegram channels.</p>

<p>At the core of the system of rule that Assad inherited from his father Hafez was a brutal complex of prisons and detention centres used to eliminate dissent by those suspected of stepping out of the ruling Baath party's line.</p>

<p>Thousands of Syrians gathered on Monday outside a jail synonymous with the worst atrocities of Assad's rule to search for relatives, many of whom have spent years in the Saydnaya facility outside Damascus, AFP correspondents said.</p>

<p>Rescuers from the Syrian White Helmets group had earlier said they were looking for potential secret doors or basements in Saydnaya.</p>

<p>"I ran like crazy" to get to the prison, said Aida Taha, 65, searching for her brother who was arrested in 2012.</p>

<p>"But I found out that some of the prisoners were still in the basements. There are three or four floors underground."</p>

<p>Crowds of freed prisoners wandered the streets of Damascus distinguishable by the marks of their ordeal: maimed by torture, weakened by illness and emaciated by hunger.</p>

<p>Sharaa, the rebel leader, said Tuesday that the incoming authorities would pursue former senior officials responsible for torture and other abuses, saying they "will not hesitate to hold accountable the criminals, murderers, security and army officers involved in torturing the Syrian people".</p>

<p>While Syria had been at war for over 13 years, the government's collapse came in a matter of days in a lightning offensive led by Sharaa's Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS).</p>

<p><strong>'Nightmare'</strong></p>

<p>In central Damascus on Monday, despite all the uncertainty over the future, the joy was palpable.</p>

<p>"It's indescribable. We never thought this nightmare would end. We are reborn," Rim Ramadan, 49, a civil servant at the finance ministry, told AFP.</p>

<p>"We were afraid for 55 years of speaking, even at home. We used to say the walls had ears," Ramadan said, as people honked car horns and rebels fired their guns into the air.</p>

<p>Syria's parliament, formerly pro-Assad like the prime minister, said it supports "the will of the people to build a new Syria towards a better future governed by law and justice".</p>

<p>The Baath party said it will support "a transitional phase in Syria aimed at defending the unity of the country."</p>

<p>Syrian state television's logo on the Telegram messaging app now displays the rebel flag.</p>

<p>During the offensive launched on November 27, rebels met little resistance as they wrested city after city from Assad's control, opening the gates of prisons along the way and freeing thousands, many of them held on political charges.</p>

<p>Some, like Fadwa Mahmoud, whose husband and son are missing, posted calls for help on social media.</p>

<p>"Where are you, Maher and Abdel Aziz? it's time for me to hear your news. Oh God, please come back," wrote Mahmoud, herself a former detainee.</p>

<p>Rooted in Syria's branch of Al-Qaeda, HTS is proscribed by Western governments as a terrorist group but has sought to soften its image in recent years.</p>

<p>Germany and France said in a statement they were ready to cooperate with Syria's new leadership "on the basis of fundamental human rights and the protection of ethnic and religious minorities."</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, in Saudi Arabia on Monday, said HTS must reject "terrorism and violence" before Britain can engage with the group designated "terrorist" by London.</p>

<p>Washington's top diplomat, Antony Blinken, said the United States -- with hundreds of troops in Syria as part of a coalition against Islamic State group jihadists -- is determined to prevent IS re-establishing safe havens there.</p>

<p>"We have a clear interest in doing what we can to avoid the fragmentation of Syria, mass migrations from Syria and, of course, the export of terrorism and extremism," Blinken said.</p>

<p><strong>Israeli, Turkish strikes</strong></p>

<p>The United Nations said that whoever ends up in power in Syria must hold the Assad regime to account. But how the ousted leader might face justice remains unclear, especially after the Kremlin refused on Monday to confirm reports by Russian news agencies that he had fled to Moscow.</p>

<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, however, said that if Russia granted asylum to Assad and his family, this would be a decision taken by President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>The Syrian embassy in Moscow raised the opposition's flag, and the Kremlin said it would discuss the status of its bases in Syria with the new authorities.</p>

<p>Russia played an instrumental role in keeping Assad in power, directly intervening in the war starting in 2015 and providing air cover to the army during the rebellion.</p>

<p>Israel, which borders Syria, sent troops into a buffer zone on the east of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights after Assad's fall, in what Foreign Minister Gideon Saar described as a "limited and temporary step" for "security reasons".</p>

<p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor reported more than 100 Israeli air strikes to "destroy the former regime's military capabilities." These were against weapons depots, boats from the Assad government's navy, and a research centre that Western countries suspected of having links to chemical weapons production, the Observatory said.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Hezbollah, which had been allied to Assad, condemned the strikes late Monday and lambasted Israel for "occupying more land in the Golan Heights".</p>

<p>In northern Syria, a Turkish drone strike on a Kurdish-held area killed 11 civilians, six of them children, according to the Britain-based Observatory.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly 200 people in Haiti were killed in brutal weekend violence reportedly orchestrated against voodoo practitioners, with the government on Monday condemning a massacre of "unbearable cruelty."</p>

<p>The killings in the capital Port-au-Prince were overseen by a powerful gang leader convinced that his son's illness was caused by followers of the religion, according to civil organization the Committee for Peace and Development (CPD).</p>

<p>It was the latest act of extreme violence by powerful gangs that control most of the capital city in the impoverished Caribbean country mired for decades in political instability, natural disasters and other woes.</p>

<p>"He decided to cruelly punish all elderly people and voodoo practitioners who, in his imagination, would be capable of sending a bad spell on his son," a statement from the Haiti-based group said.</p>

<p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the "horrific" violence, which his spokesman said left at least 184 people, including 127 elderly men and women, dead.</p>

<p>Calling the bloody episode an "act of barbarity, of unbearable cruelty," the office of Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aime said "this monstrous crime constitutes a direct attack on humanity."</p>

<p>Both the CPD and UN said that the killings took place in the capital's western coastal neighborhood of Cite Soleil.</p>

<p>Reached by telephone by AFP, a resident confirmed the attacks and said that his 76-year-old father was among the victims.</p>

<p>"The bandits set fire to his body. The family cannot even organize a burial for him since we were unable to recover the body," he told AFP on condition of anonymity so as not to compromise the safety of other relatives.</p>

<p>"I also fear for their lives," he said. "I will try to get them out."</p>

<p>- Taken to be 'executed' -</p>

<p>"The gang's soldiers were responsible for identifying victims in their homes to take them to the chief's stronghold to be executed," the CPD said.</p>

<p>"Reliable sources within the community report that more than a hundred people were massacred, their bodies mutilated and burned in the street," it said.</p>

<p>One of the organization's leaders, Fritznel Pierre, told Radio Magik 9 in an interview that the number of casualties was not exhaustive, as the area was difficult to access.</p>

<p>He reported that henchmen had hunted down old people and voodoo followers living in the Wharf Jeremie section of Cite Soleil between Friday evening and Saturday.</p>

<p>"Motorcycle taxi drivers who tried to flee with targeted people were also executed," he said.</p>

<p>Voodoo was brought to Haiti by African slaves and is a mainstay of the country's culture. It was banned during French colonial rule and only recognized as an official religion by the Haitian government in 2003.</p>

<p>While it incorporates elements of other religious beliefs, including Catholicism, voodoo has been historically attacked by other religions.</p>

<p>Haiti has suffered from decades of instability but the situation escalated in February when armed groups launched coordinated attacks in the capital to overthrow then-prime minister Ariel Henry.</p>

<p>Gangs now control 80 percent of the city. Despite a Kenyan-led police support mission, backed by the United States and UN, violence has continued to soar.</p>

<p>The UN chief called on authorities to conduct a thorough investigation into the weekend massacre and also reiterated calls for more international support to assist Haitian police in their battle against the gangs.</p>

<p>More than 700,000 people are internally displaced in Haiti, half of them children; added to this are 5,000 forced from their homes by the weekend massacre, said the International Organization for Migration.</p>

<p>The latest killings bring the death toll this year in Haiti to around 5,000 people, according to the United Nations.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian students are witnessing a massive drop in study visas issued to them. The latest data from the US State Department shows there was a 38 per cent decline in F-1 student visas issued to Indian nationals in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in the previous year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Data from the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-statistics/nonimmigrant-visa-statistics/monthly-nonimmigrant-visa-issuances.html" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Bureau of Consular Affairs</a>' monthly reports show Indian students were granted 64,008 F-1 visas between January and September this year, a steep fall from 1,03,495 visas issued during the same period in 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the least number of visas issued to Indian students since the pandemic-affected 2020, when just 6,646 requests were considered during the same timeframe. In a post-pandemic rebound, a total of 93,181 Indian students were given F-1 visas between January 2022 and September 2022, while in 2021, the number stood at 65,235.</p>

<p>However, the decline is not unique to Indian students, as Chinese students, the second largest international cohort in the US, also witnessed an 8 per cent decline in the issuance of F-1 visas in 2024.</p>

<p>As per the official data, a total of 73,781 F-1 visas were issued to Chinese students in the first nine months of 2024, down from 80,603 issued during the same time frame in 2023. The number was, however, still higher than the 52,034 F-1 visas issued to Chinese students in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>About F1 Visa</strong></h3>

<p>An F-1 visa is a non-immigrant visa which permits international students from across the world to study full-time in the United States. It is the most common visa status for students from other countries in the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Interestingly, in 2024, Indians surpassed Chinese non-migrants to become the largest cohort of overseas students in the United States. As per the Open Doors 2024 report, 3,31,000 Indian students were studying in US institutions during the 2023-24 academic year, compared to 2,68,923 the previous year.</p>

<p>At the same time, the count of Chinese students declined in the US. The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://opendoorsdata.org/fact_sheets/student-mobility/" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Open Doors 2024</a> report said there were 2,77,398 Chinese students in the US in 2023-24, nearly 12,000 less than 2,89,526 in 2022-23. China also witnessed an 8 per cent decline in the issuance of F-1 visas in 2024.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>European leaders have hailed the end of Bashar al-Assad's brutal rule in Syria as a moment of hope -- but they also view his sudden toppling as fraught with dangers.</p>

<p>As the war-torn country charts a new course, Europe is anxious to avoid fresh turmoil that could send migrants and jihadists once again heading to the continent.</p>

<p>"This historic change in the region offers opportunities but is not without risks," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wrote on X.</p>

<p>"Europe is ready to support safeguarding national unity and rebuilding a Syrian state that protects all minorities."</p>

<p>For now, still just hours after the end of more than five decades of domination by the Assad family, some initial signs appear promising.</p>

<p>As jubilant Syrians celebrated what they prayed would be the end of over 13 years of civil war, streams of refugees headed back home across the border from neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Islamist-led rebels who swept into Damascus after a lightning advance have vowed to maintain state institutions, restore order and protect all citizens.</p>

<p>But it is still very early days for those yearning to heal the festering wound in the heart of the Middle East.</p>

<p>There are profound suspicions about Syria's new would-be leaders. The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group (HTS) that spearheaded the takeover is rooted in Syria's Al-Qaeda branch but broke ties with the group in 2016. It is currently listed as a "terrorist" organisation by Western governments.</p>

<p>After years of fighting the country is controlled by a rag-tag assortment of armed groups often backed by rival international powers.</p>

<p>"There are already concerns over what comes next, given the profound failure of recent regional transitions such as in Libya," said Julien Barnes-Dacey of the European Council on Foreign Relations.</p>

<p>But, he insisted: "Europeans need, first and foremost, to concentrate on the great opportunity presented by Assad's demise, recognising (that) the core driver of instability, brutal violence and refugee outflows from Syria has departed the scene."</p>

<p><strong>'Biggest hope'</strong></p>

<p>The war in Syria -- unleashed by Assad's bloody crackdown on protests in 2011 -- helped spark a migrant crisis that saw over one million people arrive in Europe in 2015.</p>

<p>The vast influx tested EU unity and continues to reverberate today, as far-right parties tap anti-migrant sentiment to rise in the polls.</p>

<p>Some in Europe were quick to jump on the changes in Syria to try to halt arrivals of asylum seekers from the country and look to start sending people back.</p>

<p>Austria on Monday said it was suspending all Syrian asylum applications and preparing the "deportation" of refugees back to Syria.</p>

<p>Germany said it was freezing asylum requests due to the "unclear situation".</p>

<p>"The situation is extremely volatile. We were taken by surprise," said one EU official.</p>

<p>"We of course want to avoid a Libyan-style scenario, which would cause a massive migration crisis."</p>

<p>Barnes-Dacey said Europe should throw its weight behind a renewed United Nations-backed political process for Syria, ramp up humanitarian support, engage key player Turkey and try to encourage HTS to be moderate.</p>

<p>"Although European states need to approach the situation with considerable caution and modesty, they should nonetheless quickly and meaningfully work to incentivise a positive trajectory," he said.</p>

<p>"The biggest hope should now lie in the agency of Syrians themselves."</p>

<p><strong>'Difficult equation'</strong></p>

<p>A key concern for Europe, the United States and other regional powers is to prevent any power vacuum in Syria allowing a resurgence of the Islamic State jihadist group.</p>

<p>IS -- which had seized control of swathes of Syria and Iraq during the civil war -- lost territorial control of its "caliphate" at the hands of US-led forces in 2019.</p>

<p>But jihadist fighters still operate in remote desert areas of Syria.</p>

<p>Foreign fighters from IS launched a string of attacks on European soil including in 2015 in Paris and 2016 in Brussels.</p>

<p>Thousands of jihadists from the West and their families, who their home countries have so far refused to repatriate, are also detained in camps in Syria run by Kurdish forces.</p>

<p>In a sign of the concern, US warplanes on Sunday carried out strikes on 75 IS targets in Syria, warning it would "remain vigilant" against the emergence of "terrorist" groups.</p>

<p>"I think there will be a continuing US-led effort to push back against a re-emergence of IS," said Ian Lesser, of the German Marshall Fund think tank.</p>

<p>Lesser said that on a broader issue, Europe faced a "difficult equation" if it sought to engage with the new leadership in Syria, given its previous links to jihadist extremists.</p>

<p>"Europe will need to balance trying to get a more secular outcome and not provoking conflict with any nascent regime," he said.</p>

<p>HTS and its leader are under EU sanctions and Brussels said Monday it was "not currently engaging" with the group.</p>

<p>"We will need to assess not just their words but also their actions," an EU spokesman said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Papua New Guinea's prime minister promised Tuesday to return to UN climate summits after boycotting this year's talks, but called for safeguarding forests to be a bigger priority.</p>

<p>The jungle-clad Pacific nation skipped November's climate talks in Azerbaijan, with its foreign minister describing them as a "waste of time" that achieved nothing.</p>

<p>Prime Minister James Marape told AFP his country intended to return to the discussion for the COP30 summit next year in year Brazil, home of the Amazon, the world's largest tropical rainforest.</p>

<p>"Next year we will be in Brazil," he said in an interview, vowing to push for countries that leave a large carbon footprint to pay for forest conservation.</p>

<p>Conversations about climate change were "totally in vain" unless they focused on forest conservation and resource management, the Pacific leader said.</p>

<p>"It is the forestry that clears the atmosphere of carbon and carbon footprints," Marape said.</p>

<p>"Forestry is close to our heart."</p>

<p>Papua New Guinea will support an Australian bid to co-host COP31 in 2026 along with Pacific nations if forest conservation and management rank highly in discussions, Marape said.</p>

<p><strong>'Lungs of the Earth'</strong></p>

<p>The island of New Guinea is home to the third-largest expanse of rainforest on the planet, according to conservation group WWF, and has long been celebrated as one of the "lungs of the Earth".</p>

<p>In November, Papua New Guinea boycotted the UN climate summit in Azerbaijan because the hosts did not "give big respect to forest business owners", Marape said.</p>

<p>Impoverished, flanked by ocean, and already prone to natural disasters, the country is considered highly vulnerable to the unfolding perils of climate change.</p>

<p>It is one of five Pacific nations involved in a pivotal International Court of Justice case that will soon test whether polluters can be sued for neglecting their climate obligations.</p>

<p>But while Pacific nations are among the most climate-threatened areas on the planet, Australia remains one of the world's leading exporters of coal and gas.</p>

<p>A decision on Australia's bid to host COP31 has been delayed because Turkey is refusing to drop its rival campaign -- dragging out the selection process into 2025.</p>

<p>The COP -- or conference of parties -- is the top United Nations climate change conference, an annual summit in which nations look to determine legally binding climate commitments.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

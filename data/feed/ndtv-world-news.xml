       <description><![CDATA[Meta's director of public affairs, Dani Lever, clarified the mistake and apologized, stating that fact-checkers had confirmed the original image's accuracy.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook has acknowledged that it mistakenly identified a widely shared image of Donald Trump as "altered." Facebook's algorithms detected the image, which depicts Trump raising his fist in the air following an assassination attempt, and labelled it as possibly deceptive. Platform X users claimed that the photo had been marked as altered on their accounts. Facebook responded by saying that unbiased fact-checkers had examined an identical image and discovered it to be false.</p>

<p>Dani Lever, the director of public affairs at Meta, explained on X that the labelling was incorrect. The Facebook's internal technical system was intended to detect a different version of the image, not the iconic photo of Trump. Facebook expressed regret for the mistake and any misunderstanding it may have created.</p>

<p>"This was an error. This fact check was initially applied to a doctored photo showing the secret service agents smiling, and in some cases our systems incorrectly applied that fact check to the real photo. This has been fixed, and we apologize for the mistake," Lever wrote.</p>

<p>Lever confirmed the mistake when Fox News Digital reached out for a comment.</p>

<p>The altered image Lever referenced featured the Secret Service members surrounding Trump smiling. Many media outlets previously fact-checked the images as "altered," though it confirmed the accuracy of the original image.</p>

<p>None of the agents in the original image are smiling as they surround Trump, who has blood on his face and his right arm in the air. The image - which was captured by <em>Associated Press </em>photographer Evan Vucci and distributed by the <em>AP </em>- appeared with coverage of the shooting by many legitimate news outlets.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple relied on chips designed by Google rather than industry leader Nvidia to build two key components of its artificial intelligence software infrastructure for its forthcoming suite of AI tools and features, an Apple research paper published on Monday showed.<br />
Apple's decision to rely on Google's cloud infrastructure is notable because Nvidia produces the most sought-after AI processors.</p>

<p>Including the chips made by Google, Amazon.com and other cloud computing companies, Nvidia commands roughly 80% of the market.</p>

<p>In the research paper, Apple did not explicitly say that it used no Nvidia chips, but its description of the hardware and software infrastructure of its AI tools and features lacked any mention of Nvidia hardware.</p>

<p>Apple did not comment on Monday.</p>

<p>The iPhone maker said that to train its AI models, it used two flavors of Google's tensor processing unit (TPU) that are organized in large clusters of chips.</p>

<p>To build the AI model that will operate on iPhones and other devices, Apple used 2,048 of the TPUv5p chips. For its server AI model, Apple deployed 8,192 TPUv4 processors.</p>

<p>Nvidia does not design TPUs but rather focuses its efforts on so-called graphics processing units (GPUs) that are widely used for AI efforts.</p>

<p>Unlike Nvidia, which sells its chips and systems as standalone products, Google sells access to TPUs through its Google Cloud Platform. Customers interested in buying access must build software through Google's cloud platform in order to use the chips.</p>

<p>Apple is rolling out portions Apple Intelligence to its beta users this week.</p>

<p>Reuters reported the use of the TPU chips in June, but Apple did not disclose the full extent of its reliance on Google hardware until Monday's research paper.</p>

<p>Google did not return a request for comment, while Nvidia declined to comment.</p>

<p>Apple's engineers said in the paper it would be possible to make even larger, more sophisticated models with Google's chips, than the two models it discussed in the paper.</p>

<p>Apple unveiled a slew of new AI features at its June developer conference, including integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT technology into its software.</p>

<p>The Cupertino, California-based company's stock ticked down 0.1% to $218.24 in regular trading on Monday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least one person died Monday in Venezuela as security forces tried to break up protests triggered by a hotly disputed election result that gave Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro a third term in power, an NGO said.</p>

<p>Venezuelan security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets Monday at irate protesters challenging the reelection victory claimed by Maduro but disputed by the opposition and questioned by many other countries.</p>

<p>Thousands of people flooded the streets of several neighbourhoods of the capital, chanting "Freedom, freedom!" and "This government is going to fall!"</p>

<p>Some ripped Maduro campaign posters from street posts and burned them.</p>

<p>Around the country, at least two statues of Hugo Chavez, the late socialist icon who led the country for more than a decade and handpicked Maduro as his successor, were knocked down by protesters.</p>

<p>At least one person died in northwest Yaracuy state and 46 more were arrested in post-election demonstrations, Alfredo Romero, head of a rights group called Foro Penal, which specializes in political prisoner issues, said on the platform X.</p>

<p>In Caracas, AFP observed members of the National Guard firing tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters, some wearing motorbike helmets and bandannas tied over their faces for protection. Some responded by throwing rocks back.</p>

<p>Protests were reported even in very poor areas of Caracas that had been bastions of support for Maduro and his socialist government. Shots were heard in some areas. Protests broke out elsewhere in Venezuela, too.</p>

<p>"We want freedom. We want Maduro to go. Maduro, leave!," Marina Sugey, a 42-year-old resident of a poor area of Caracas called Petare, told AFP.</p>

<p>Maduro, 61, attended a meeting Monday at which the National Electoral Council (CNE) certified his reelection to a third six-year term until 2031.</p>

<p>He dismissed international criticism and doubts about the result of Sunday's voting, claiming Venezuela was the target of an attempted "coup d'etat" of a "fascist and counter-revolutionary" nature.</p>

<p>But opposition leader Maria Corina Machado later told reporters that a review of voting records available so far clearly showed that the next president "will be Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia," who took her place on the ballot after she was barred by Maduro-aligned courts.</p>

<p>The records showed a "mathematically irreversible" lead for Gonzalez Urrutia, she said, with 6.27 million votes to only 2.75 million for Maduro.</p>

<p>The elections were held amid widespread fears of fraud by the government and a campaign tainted by accusations of political intimidation.</p>

<p>Pollsters had predicted a resounding victory for the opposition.</p>

<p>In the early hours of Monday, the CNE said Maduro had won 51.2 per cent of votes cast compared to 44.2 per cent for Gonzalez Urrutia.</p>

<p>The opposition cried foul, prompting Attorney General Tarek William Saab to link Machado to an alleged cyber "attack" seeking to "adulterate" the results.</p>

<h3><strong>'Another fraud'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The outcome sparked concern and calls for a "transparent" process from the United Nations, the United States, the European Union and several countries in Latin America.</p>

<p>The CNE has not provided a detailed breakdown of the result.</p>

<p>Allies including China, Russia and Cuba congratulated Maduro.</p>

<p>Gonzalez Urrutia, a 74-year-old former diplomat, on Monday acknowledged the deep discontent in society with the CNE results and vowed that "we will fight for our liberty."</p>

<p>Machado assured Venezuelans that "the leaders of the world" are validating the results, and called families to turn out Tuesday for "popular assemblies" nationwide to show support for a peaceful transition of power.</p>

<p>Nine Latin American countries called in a joint statement Monday for a "complete review of the results with the presence of independent electoral observers."</p>

<p>The US-based Carter Center, one of a few organizations allowed to bring observers into Venezuela, urged the CNE to immediately publish detailed polling station-level results.</p>

<p>Brazil and Colombia also urged a review of the numbers while Chile's president said the outcome was "hard to believe."</p>

<p>Peru recalled its ambassador and Panama said it was suspending relations with Venezuela.</p>

<p>The Organization of American States, based in Washington, called an emergency meeting for Wednesday at the request of Argentina and other countries that challenged the official election tally.</p>

<p>Caracas hit back Monday, saying it was withdrawing diplomatic staff from Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Panama, Peru, the Dominican Republic and Uruguay for "interventionist actions and statements." It also suspended flights to and from Panama and the Dominican Republic.</p>

<h3><strong>'Bloodbath' warning&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Independent polls had predicted Sunday's vote would end 25 years of "Chavismo," the populist movement founded by Chavez.</p>

<p>Maduro has been at the helm of the once-wealthy oil-rich country since 2013. The last decade has seen GDP drop by 80 per cent, pushing more than seven million of its 30 million citizens to emigrate.</p>

<p>He is accused of locking up critics and harassing the opposition in a climate of rising authoritarianism.</p>

<p>In the run-up to the election, he had warned of a "bloodbath" if he lost.</p>

<p>Ballots were cast on machines that sent electronic votes directly to a centralized CNE database.</p>

<p>The machines printed out paper receipts that were placed in a container and counted by hand as a backup measure meant to be open to public scrutiny.</p>

<p>The opposition had deployed about 90,000 volunteer election monitors nationwide.</p>

<h3><strong>Economic misery&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Sunday's election was the product of a deal reached last year between the government and the opposition.</p>

<p>That agreement led the United States to temporarily ease sanctions imposed after Maduro's 2018 reelection, rejected as a sham by dozens of Latin American and other countries.</p>

<p>Sanctions were snapped back after Maduro reneged on agreed conditions.</p>

<p>Venezuela boasts the world's largest oil reserves but has seen severely diminished production capacity in recent years.</p>

<p>Most Venezuelans live on just a few dollars a month and endure biting shortages of electricity and fuel.</p>

<p>Economic misery in the South American nation has been a major source of migration pressure on the southern border of the United States, where immigration is a major presidential election issue.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta Platforms on Monday said it will roll out a new tool called AI Studio that will allow users to create, share and design personalized AI chatbots.<br />
<br />
The AI Studio will allow users to create customized AI characters and also allow Instagram creators to use the AI characters "as an extension of themselves" that can handle common DM questions and story replies, Meta said.</p>

<p>Users can share their AI characters on the social media giant's various platforms.</p>

<p>The new tool is built with Meta's Llama 3.1, the biggest version of its mostly free artificial intelligence models released last week, which is available in multiple languages and has performance metrics that compete with paid models from rivals like OpenAI.</p>

<p>ChatGPT maker OpenAI is working on a project code-named "Strawberry," the details of which are tightly kept secret even within OpenAI, as the startup races to show that the types of models it offers are capable of delivering advanced reasoning capabilities, Reuters exclusively reported earlier in July.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Veterinarians using a stethoscope were unable to detect Nuggi's heartbeat because of his extreme weight, according to the SPCA statement.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman from New Zealand was sentenced to two months in prison after her dog, who weighed 53 kilograms (118 pounds) and was severely obese, died, as per a report in <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newsweek.com/dog-owner-jailed-obese-dog-dies-1930819">Newsweek</a></em>. According to a statement from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), the dog, named Nuggi, was found by police in 2021 weighing about 54 kilograms (120 pounds) and nearly immobile.</p>

<p>Nuggi was taken from his owner's Auckland house, where police discovered "a number of" dogs, and given over to the SPCA.</p>

<p>Nuggi died of a liver haemorrhage even though it lost 8.8 kilograms (19.6 pounds) or around 16.5 per cent of his body weight in two months while in the care of the SPCA. The organisation claims that an autopsy disclosed additional health issues, including Cushing's illness and liver problems.</p>

<p>According to the statement, the owner pleaded guilty to failing to provide for the dog's medical, behavioural, and physical needs. As a result, the Manukau District Court in Auckland sentenced the owner to two months in jail and a fine of $1,222 NZD ($720). It is also said that she will not be allowed to own dogs for a year.</p>

<p>Veterinarians using a stethoscope were unable to detect Nuggi's heartbeat because of his extreme weight, according to the SPCA statement. The dog also had a lot of skin growths, especially on contact regions like his elbows and tummy, and his claws were enlarged. Further, Nuggi had conjunctivitis as well.</p>

<p>Todd Westwood, SPCA Chief said that the dog was "drastically overfed" and "clearly" did not have proper care. "Nuggi was one of the most obese animals we've ever come across," Mr Westwood said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Sadly, we see animals on a daily basis that are underweight, starved or malnourished, but it's equally heartbreaking to see a helpless animal that's been severely overfed," he continued.</p>

<p>The SPCA added that the pet dog was fed around 10 pieces of chicken every day along with dry food. Nuggi allegedly struggled to travel around 10 meters to the car when veterinarians took him away from his owner, pausing three times to gather breath. The SPCA said, "His legs could not support his huge body."</p>

<p>"Part of being a responsible dog owner is providing your pet with an appropriate diet and daily exercise, which was clearly not the case here. Nuggi was being drastically overfed, and instead of seeking help or amending the behaviour, his owner continued to overfeed him until he could barely walk. This is unacceptable," Mr Westwood added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Burrill was forced to resign from his position after the Christian news website published a story exposing his visits to gay bars and use of the dating app.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Wisconsin priest who lost his job after being outed for using Grindr is suing the queer dating app, alleging that his data was sold without his knowledge or consent.</p>

<p>Monsignor Jeffrey Burrill, who served as the top administrator of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) until his resignation in 2021, claims that Grindr failed to inform him that his data was being sold to vendors, thereby allowing people outside the app to discover his presence on it.</p>

<p>Burrill's lawsuit, obtained by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/27/priest-grindr-privacy-lawsuit/"><em>Washington Post</em></a>, states that the release of his data caused "significant damage" to his reputation, particularly given his vow of celibacy as a priest and the Catholic Church's long-standing stance against homosexual acts.</p>

<p>Burrill was forced to resign from his position after the Christian news website "The Pillar" published a story exposing his visits to gay bars and use of the dating app, reporting that it had tracked and verified his behaviour using online data.</p>

<p>In his lawsuit, Burrill alleges that The Pillar obtained the data from Catholic Laity and Clergy for Renewal (CLCR), a Christian non-profit organization that purchased data from queer dating apps to identify Church leaders using them in violation of their vows, implying that Grindr had sold the data to the organization.</p>

<p>“We want answers so we can use that as a warning to other Grindr users,” said Gregory Helmer, an attorney for Burrill.</p>

<p>The priest said he'd never have joined the app had he known his data would be available to the public, according to the lawsuit.</p>

<p>“To have that decision forced out of your hands and into the public realm is reprehensible,” James Carr, another attorney representing Burrill, told the Washington Post.</p>

<p>Burrill, who is still "getting on his feet" following the "shame and embarrassment" of his outing, according to his lawyer Helmer, requested $5 million in damages from Grindr in June.</p>

<p>After Grindr declined his request, Burrill filed a lawsuit on July 18, seeking damages and the implementation of policies to prevent user data from being publicly available without users' knowledge.</p>

<p>Grindr told the Washington Post it would "respond vigorously to these allegations, which are based on mischaracterizations of practices relating to user data," and previously denied making user data publicly available.</p>

<p>CLCR admitted to obtaining data from Grindr in the past to expose clergy members but claimed it did not provide any data to The Pillar.</p>

<p>Burrill's ousting sparked widespread criticism, with many condemning The Pillar's use of data as dangerously homophobic.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro claimed victory in the country's presidential election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro claimed victory in the country's presidential election in the early hours of Monday morning, even as the country's opposition said its candidate Edmundo Gonzalez was the victor and it had the polling to prove it.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE COUNT?</strong></h3>

<p>The country's electoral authority (CNE) said just after midnight on Monday that Maduro had won a third six-year term with 51% of the vote.</p>

<p>The authority said Gonzalez won 44%, but opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said opposition candidate Gonzalez had secured 70% of the vote and that multiple independent exit polls and quick counts decisively showed his victory.</p>

<p>Gonzalez said he was not calling for supporters to take to the streets or commit any acts of violence and Machado said the opposition has copies of about 40% of voting records.</p>

<p>Edison Research, known for its polling of U.S. elections, had predicted in an exit poll that Gonzalez would win 65% of the vote, while Maduro would win 31%.</p>

<p>Local firm Meganalisis predicted a 65% vote for Gonzalez and just under 14% for Maduro.</p>

<h3><strong>WAS VOTING PEACEFUL?</strong></h3>

<p>The government said that except for some isolated minor incidents, voting was peaceful.</p>

<p>Motorcycle-riding ruling party supporters known as 'collectives' clashed briefly in the evening with opposition supporters outside the country's largest polling place, a school in central Caracas.</p>

<p>Armed collectives were reported in at least six other locations, according to a local NGO, which also reported the gun death of one man in the border state of Tachira during a confrontation with collective members.</p>

<p>The tense campaign was marked by arrests of opposition figures and other moves by the authorities that the opposition said were meant to prevent a fair election.</p>

<p>Maduro, a former bus driver who was the hand-picked successor of his mentor Hugo Chavez, has been in power since Chavez's death in 2013.</p>

<p>His government has presided over a sharp economic and social deterioration. The U.S. reimposed oil sanctions in April, accusing Maduro of reneging on deals reached with the opposition to ensure free elections.</p>

<h3><strong>WHO IS GONZALEZ?</strong></h3>

<p>A long-time but low-profile member of the opposition, Gonzalez, 74, a former diplomat, is known for his calm demeanor.</p>

<p>He was originally registered as a placeholder in March, after neither primary winner Machado nor her alternate were able to register. In April, he was named as the opposition's definitive candidate.</p>

<p>Machado, 56, has thrown herself into campaigning for Gonzalez.</p>

<p>The two - speaking to large crowds around the country - have employed emotional rhetoric, including about their hope for the many who have emigrated from Venezuela in recent years to return home.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT WAS THE INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE?</strong></h3>

<p>The United States has serious concerns that the results announced by the electoral authority do not reflect the votes of the people, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday, asking that a detailed tabulation of votes be published.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, reactions from Latin American leaders were mixed.</p>

<p>Argentine President Javier Milei called the official result fraud, while Costa Rica and Peru rejected it and Chile said it would not accept any result that was not verifiable.</p>

<p>Cuba, Honduras and Bolivia cheered Maduro's victory.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A deadly rocket strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights has added to concerns that Israel and the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah could be sucked into a full-scale war - something they have both previously indicated they want to avoid but for which they have also said they are ready.</p>

<p>Israel said on Sunday it would strike hard at Hezbollah after accusing the group of killing 12 children and teenagers in a rocket attack on a football field in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Hezbollah denied any responsibility for the attack on Majdal Shams, the deadliest in Israel or Israeli-annexed territory since Hamas' Oct. 7 assault sparked the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>This is the background to hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah:</p>

<p><strong>Why Are They Fighting?</strong></p>

<p>Hezbollah began trading fire with Israel on Oct. 8, a day after the Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked communities in southern Israel and sparked the Gaza war.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, a Hamas ally, says its attacks aim to support Palestinians who are under Israeli bombardment in Gaza.</p>

<p>The Gaza war has drawn in Iran-backed militants across the region. Hezbollah is widely deemed the most powerful member of the Iran-backed network, known as the Axis of Resistance.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has said repeatedly it will not halt its attacks on Israel unless a ceasefire in Gaza comes into force.</p>

<p>While linked to Gaza, the conflict has its own dynamics.</p>

<p>Israel and Hezbollah have fought numerous wars.</p>

<p>The last was in 2006.</p>

<p>Israel has long viewed Hezbollah as the biggest threat at its borders and has been deeply alarmed by its growing arsenal, and the foothold it has established in Syria.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's ideology is largely defined by conflict with Israel. It was founded by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in 1982 to fight Israeli forces that had invaded Lebanon that year, and waged years of guerrilla war that led Israel to withdraw from south Lebanon in 2000.</p>

<p>Hezbollah deems Israel an illegitimate state established on occupied Palestinian lands and wants to see it gone.</p>

<p><strong>What's The Impact So Far?</strong></p>

<p>The current conflict has already taken a toll on both sides.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes on both sides of the border. Israeli airstrikes have pounded areas where Hezbollah operates in southern Lebanon and struck the Bekaa Valley near the Syrian border.</p>

<p>Israel has also occasionally hit elsewhere, notably killing a senior Hamas commander in Beirut on Jan. 2.</p>

<p>Israeli strikes have killed some 350 Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon and more than 100 civilians, including medics, children and journalists, according to security and medical sources and a Reuters tally of death notifications issued by Hezbollah.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said after Saturday's attack the death toll among civilians killed in Hezbollah attacks had risen to 23 since October, along with at least 17 soldiers. Hezbollah denied it was responsible for Saturday's attack.</p>

<p>In Israel, the displacement of so many Israelis is a big political issue. Officials had hoped they would be able to go home for the school year beginning Sept. 1 but that has looked increasingly unlikely as the standoff has continued.</p>

<p><strong>How Much Worse Could It Get?</strong></p>

<p>A lot. Despite the ferocity of these hostilities, this is still seen as a relatively contained confrontation.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned in December that Beirut would be turned "into Gaza" if Hezbollah started an all-out war.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has previously signalled it is not seeking to widen the conflict while also saying it is ready to fight any war imposed on it and warning that it has used only a small part of its capabilities so far.</p>

<p>Any move by Israel to expand the conflict would be met by "devastation, destruction and displacement" in Israel, Hezbollah deputy leader Sheikh Naim Qassem said in an interview with Al Jazeera in June.</p>

<p>Past wars have inflicted heavy damage.</p>

<p>In 2006, Israeli strikes levelled large areas of Beirut's Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs, knocked out Beirut airport, and hit roads, bridges and other infrastructure. Nearly 1 million people in Lebanon fled their homes.</p>

<p>In Israel, the impact included 300,000 people fleeing their homes to escape Hezbollah rockets and some 2,000 homes destroyed.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has a far bigger arsenal than in 2006, including rockets it says can hit all parts of Israel.</p>

<p>It has demonstrated advances in its weaponry since October, shooting down Israeli drones, launching its own explosive drones into Israel, and firing more sophisticated guided missiles.</p>

<p>Israeli troops have invaded Lebanon several times in the past, reaching as far as Beirut in the 1982 invasion that aimed to crush Lebanon-based Palestinian guerrillas.</p>

<p><strong>Is Escalation Avoidable?</strong></p>

<p>Much will depend on what happens in Gaza, where efforts to agree a ceasefire and a return of Israeli hostages have faltered. A ceasefire there could help bring about a rapid de-escalation of tensions in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>The United States, which deems Hezbollah a terrorist group, has been at the heart of diplomatic efforts aimed at easing the conflict.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has signalled its eventual openness to an agreement that benefits Lebanon, but has said there can be no discussions until Israel halts the Gaza offensive.</p>

<p>Israel has also said it would prefer a diplomatic settlement that would restore security in the north, but says it is also prepared for a military offensive to achieve the same goal.</p>

<p>The U.S. official at the heart of diplomatic contacts, Amos Hochstein, brokered an unlikely diplomatic deal between Lebanon and Israel in 2022 over their disputed maritime boundary.</p>

<p>Hochstein said on May 30 he did not expect peace between Hezbollah and Israel but that a set of understandings could remove some of the impetus for conflict and establish a recognised border between Lebanon and Israel.</p>

<p>A French proposal submitted to Beirut in February included elite Hezbollah fighters withdrawing 10 km (6 miles) from the frontier and negotiations aimed at settling disputes over the land border.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Monday backed his running mate, Senator JD Vance, over past comments about "childless cat ladies" that have gone viral and become a political headache for their White House campaign.</p>

<p>Vance's 2021 comments criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris and other Democrats as "a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives" resurfaced after Trump selected the Ohio senator as his running mate earlier this month.</p>

<p>The comments prompted a backlash and warnings from some political strategists that they could cost the Trump campaign valuable votes in a close election that could be decided in a handful of states by a few thousand voters. Harris is the likely Democratic Party presidential nominee for the Nov. 5 election following President Joe Biden's decision to quit the race.</p>

<p>Trump said in an interview on Fox News he did not place a higher value on people with families.</p>

<p>"You know, you don't meet the right person, or you don't meet any person. But you're just as good, in many cases, a lot better than a person that's in a family situation," Trump said.</p>

<p>Harris has two stepchildren with her husband, lawyer Doug Emhoff. Emhoff's ex-wife has called such attacks "baseless" and described Harris as a "loving, nurturing, fiercely protective" co-parent.</p>

<p>Trump said Vance, who had a tough upbringing in Ohio and was largely raised by his grandmother, was simply trying to show how much he values family life.</p>

<p>"He grew up in a very interesting family situation, and he feels family is good. And I don't think there's anything wrong in saying that," Trump said.</p>

<p>In the Fox interview, Trump also did little to clear up questions over whether he will participate in a Sept. 10 debate with Harris. The event had been previously scheduled against Biden.</p>

<p>"I'll probably end up debating," Trump said. "But I can also make a case for not doing it."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump on Monday called the Olympics opening ceremony in Paris a "disgrace," after its creators came under fire for what some said was a show gone too far.</p>

<p>"I'm very open-minded but I thought what they did was a disgrace," Trump told Fox News.</p>

<p>His comments followed condemnation from Catholic groups and French bishops of a ceremony scene involving dancers, drag queens and a DJ in poses that appeared to recall depictions of the Last Supper, although creators have said it was not meant to represent the religious setting.</p>

<p>The sequence drew international criticism from Christian groups and far-right politicians on social media.</p>

<p>When asked by host Laura Ingraham what he would do if he's reelected president in time for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, Trump replied: "We won't be having a 'Last Supper' as portrayed the way they portrayed it last night."</p>

<p>Thomas Jolly, the director of the opening ceremony, later responded to criticism by saying he intended for the production to "reconcile" and "repair."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire X owner Elon&nbsp;Musk&nbsp;was facing&nbsp;criticism&nbsp;Monday for sharing a&nbsp;deepfake&nbsp;video&nbsp;featuring US Vice President&nbsp;Kamala&nbsp;Harris, which tech campaigners said violated the platform's own policies.</p>

<p>Musk&nbsp;reposted a manipulated&nbsp;Harris&nbsp;campaign&nbsp;video&nbsp;in which a voiceover mimicking her calls President Joe Biden senile, and declares that she does not "know the first thing about running the country," adding that as a woman and a person of color, she is the "ultimate diversity hire.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;video&nbsp;was originally posted by an X account linked to the conservative podcaster Chris Kohls and labeled a "parody."</p>

<p>But&nbsp;Musk's repost on Friday made no such disclosure, stating only: "This is amazing," along with a laughing emoji.</p>

<p>Musk's repost garnered more than 130 million views and comes amid growing alarm&nbsp;over&nbsp;AI-enabled political disinformation ahead of the US presidential election in November.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We believe the American people want the real freedom, opportunity, and security Vice President&nbsp;Harris&nbsp;is offering; not the fake, manipulated lies of Elon&nbsp;Musk&nbsp;and Donald Trump,"&nbsp;Harris's presidential campaign said in a statement.</p>

<p>With nearly 192 million followers,&nbsp;Musk&nbsp;is a highly influential voice on the platform, previously called Twitter, which he purchased in 2022 in a $44 billion deal.</p>

<p>Earlier this month,&nbsp;Musk&nbsp;endorsed Trump&nbsp;in a post on X shortly after the Republican narrowly escaped an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California, posted on X that the manipulated&nbsp;Harris&nbsp;video&nbsp;"should be illegal" and that he would soon sign a bill banning such media.</p>

<p>A defiant&nbsp;Musk&nbsp;responded to his post, saying "parody is legal in America," while including the original&nbsp;video&nbsp;below it.</p>

<p>Musk's repost appeared to violate X's policies, which prohibit sharing "synthetic, manipulated or out-of-context media that may deceive or confuse people and lead to harm."</p>

<p>X did not respond to AFP's request for comment.</p>

<p>"Ignoring the rules of the road (because) he bought the road," Nora Benavidez, senior counsel at the watchdog Free Press, wrote on X, referring to&nbsp;Musk's apparent violation of the site's policies.</p>

<p>Disinformation researchers are fearful of rampant misuse of AI technology in a major election year, thanks to proliferating online tools that are cheap and easy to use while lacking sufficient guardrails.</p>

<p>AI-generated content -- particularly audio, which experts say is difficult to identify -- sparked national alarm in January when a fake robocall posing as Biden urged New Hampshire residents not to vote in the state's primary.</p>

<p>"Platforms play an outsized role in election cycles," Benavidez wrote. "They must do better."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Quad foreign ministers have reinforced their call for concerted international action against Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), as well as Al-Qa'ida and the Islamic State outfit.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Warning against terrorists deploying new technologies, the Quad foreign ministers have reinforced their call for concerted international action against Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), as well as Al-Qa'ida and the Islamic State outfit.</p>

<p>After their meeting in Tokyo, the Quad ministers said in a joint statement on Monday that they were committed to working with international and regional partners to forestall "threats posed by the use of new and emerging technologies for terrorist purposes".</p>

<p>"We reiterate the call for concerted action against all UN-listed terrorist groups including Al-Qa'ida, ISIS/Daesh, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), and their proxy groups," External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Foreign Ministers Penny Wong of Australia and Yoko Kamikawa of Japan said in their statement.</p>

<p>"We deplore the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), drones, tunnels, and information and communication technologies by terrorists and terrorist entities," they said.</p>

<p>Recalling the 26/11 Mumbai and the 2016 Pathankot terrorist attacks, they called for "bringing the perpetrators of these attacks to justice without delay".</p>

<p>The ministers said the first meeting of the Quad Working Group on Counter-Terrorism established at the ministerial meeting in New Delhi last year had "fruitful discussions" at its first meeting and at the fourth tabletop exercise in Honolulu in December, and added that they looked forward to next exercise to be hosted by Japan in November.</p>

<p>The tabletop exercises look at scenarios to develop responses to an overwhelming terrorist incident in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<p>The 4,000-word joint statement ran the gamut from the conflicts in Ukraine and Palestine, and China's regional threats to cooperation on undersea cable connectivity and environment.</p>

<p>On Ukraine, where there are differences in nuances between India and the other three Quad partners who are all in on aiding Kiev, the statement said unequivocally, "We reiterate the need for a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in line with international law, consistent with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, including respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity."</p>

<p>India reiterating, this time in this forum, its joint commitment to upholding international law and the UN Charter in Ukraine comes days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Moscow which drew criticism from the West and Ukraine and underlined its independent stand on international relations.</p>

<p>The joint statement did not name Russia.</p>

<p>The ministers' statement made pointed references to the dangers to regional peace and security posed by China, but again, without naming it.</p>

<p>They reiterated their fundamental "steadfast commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, which is inclusive and resilient, and are united in our commitment to upholding the free and open rules-based international order".</p>

<p>They called for upholding "sovereignty and territorial integrity, and peaceful settlement of disputes and prohibition on the threat or use of force in accordance with the UN Charter", while also committing to "the principle of freedom, human rights, rule of law, (and) democratic values".</p>

<p>Regarding foreign manipulation through exploitation of the information infrastructure, the four ministers vowed to "leverage our collective expertise and capacity to respond" to those threats.</p>

<p>They warned of "foreign information manipulation and interference, including disinformation, which undermines trust and sows discord in the international community" which are tactics that are "intended to interfere with domestic and international interest".</p>

<p>The ministers said they would promote human rights while "supporting media freedom, addressing online harassment and abuse, and countering unethical practices".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[U.S. President Joe Biden's administration on Monday accused Venezuela of electoral manipulation and repression and said Caracas' announcement that President Nicolas Maduro had]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Biden administration said on Monday that electoral manipulation had stripped Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's claim of reelection victory of "any credibility," and Washington left the door oSpen to fresh sanctions on the OPEC nation.</p>

<p>Senior US officials, briefing reporters on Sunday's election, sharpened Washington's response to the disputed vote, in which Venezuela's electoral authority declared Maduro had won a third term, extending 25 years of socialist party rule.</p>

<p>Independent exit polls pointed to a landslide opposition win.</p>

<p>The US and a number of other governments cast doubt on the official vote count. Maduro's opposition rival, Edmundo Gonzalez, asserted that he was the true winner.</p>

<p>The US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, amplified public demands by President Joe Biden's senior aides that Maduro publish a detailed tabulation of votes and said a failure to do so would leave the international community unwilling to accept the announced outcome.</p>

<p>The officials did not unveil any new punitive measures but said Washington would assess its sanctions policy toward Venezuela based on whatever actions Maduro took going forward.</p>

<p>"We are faced with potentially a new scenario," one official said. "We are going to take that into account as we map forward where we may head with respect to sanctions toward Venezuela."</p>

<p>Washington, which rejected Maduro's 2018 reelection as a sham, broadly eased sanctions on Venezuela's oil industry last October in response to a deal between Maduro and opposition parties. But in April the US reimposed the sanctions, accusing Maduro of reneging on electoral commitments.</p>

<p>"By engaging in repression and electoral manipulation, and by declaring a winner without the detailed precinct-by-precinct polling results ... Maduro representatives have stripped the supposed election results they announced of any credibility," a U.S. official said.</p>

<p>Speaking earlier in Tokyo, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said: "We have serious concerns that the result announced does not reflect the will or the votes of the Venezuelan people."</p>

<p>Maduro early on Monday reiterated his campaign assertion that Venezuela's electoral system is transparent.</p>

<p>White House spokesperson John Kirby said the US would withhold judgment until it gets further information but would then "respond accordingly."</p>

<h3><strong>U.S. COORDINATES INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE</strong></h3>

<p>The U.S. officials did not offer many specifics of electoral misconduct it believes Maduro's side committed.</p>

<p>But one official said the electoral commission's announcement "does not track with data that we've received through quick-count mechanisms and other sources" and appeared at odds with how Venezuelans voted.</p>

<p>The officials said the U.S. was coordinating with regional allies on a response and would also work with international partners on potential consequences for Maduro's government.</p>

<p>A senior U.S. official said the administration was in contact with Brazil and other Latin American governments concerned about the political situation in Venezuela.</p>

<p>Biden will speak with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on Tuesday afternoon, the White House said.</p>

<p>They defended the Biden's administration's decision last year to re-engage with Maduro following the Trump-era "maximum pressure" campaign, despite the Venezuelan leader's history of failing to make good on his political promises.</p>

<p>Sunday's election, one official said, was a sweeping call for change from Venezuelan voters and would put the opposition in a better position to negotiate with Maduro.</p>

<p>But Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a harsh Maduro critic, chided the Democratic administration in a post on X, calling it "the latest example of how our enemies have suckered Biden and (Vice President Kamala) Harris repeatedly."</p>

<p>Analysts have suggested that a Maduro reelection or post-election upheaval could spur more Venezuelans to leave the country and head for the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>

<p>With immigration already a hot-button issue in the U.S. presidential campaign, that could create new problems for Harris, seen as the likely Democratic nominee after Biden ended his reelection bid on July 21.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Flights to and from Beirut airport were cancelled or delayed on Monday as tensions escalated between Israel and armed political group Hezbollah after a strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights killed 12 children and teenagers.</p>

<p>Air France said on Monday that due to the security situation at the destination, it will suspend flights between Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Beirut for the days of July 29 and 30, 2024.</p>

<p>"Air France is monitoring the situation in Lebanon in real time," the airline said.</p>

<p>Lufthansa, Swiss and Eurowings of the Lufthansa Group have decided to suspend their flights from and to Beirut up to and including Aug. 5 due to the current developments in the Middle East, a group spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Middle East Airlines (MEA) said disruptions to its schedule were related to insurance risks.</p>

<p>The rocket strike in the Golan Heights on Saturday has added to concerns that Israel and the Iran-backed group could engage in a full-scale war.</p>

<p>Israel's security cabinet on Sunday authorised the government to respond to the strike. Hezbollah denied any responsibility for the attack, the deadliest in Israel or Israeli-annexed territory since Hamas' Oct. 7 assault sparked the war in Gaza, which has since spread to several fronts.</p>

<p>Beirut airport's flight information board and flight tracking website Flightradar24 show Turkish Airlines also cancelled two flights overnight on Sunday.</p>

<p>Turkey-based budget carrier SunExpress, Turkish Airlines subsidiary AJet, Greek carrier Aegean Airlines, Ethiopian Air and MEA have also cancelled flights scheduled to land in Beirut on Monday, Flightradar24 shows.</p>

<p>The airlines did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport is Lebanon's only airport. It has been targeted in the country's civil war, and previous fighting with Israel, including in the last war between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006.</p>

<p>On Sunday, MEA said it had delayed the departure of some flights set to land in Beirut overnight. Additional delays to flights landing on Monday were then announced due to "technical reasons related to the distribution of insurance risks for aircraft between Lebanon and other destinations", MEA said.</p>

<p>Hezbollah and the Israeli military have increased cross-border exchanges of fire since the Gaza war began. The conflict has disrupted flights and shipping across the region, including during reciprocal drone and missile attacks between Israel and Iran in April.</p>

<p>Lufthansa has already suspended night-time flights to and from Beirut for July due to "current developments" in the Middle East.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of firefighters battling a massive northern California wildfire were working in milder temperatures and higher humidity Monday, but the blaze that has destroyed more than 100 structures since it began five days ago continues to grow.</p>

<p>The Park Fire, which officials said was started by a man who pushed a flaming car into a gully, grew slightly overnight to 368,000 acres (148,924 hectares). The sixth largest wildfire in state history is rolling through a remote area some 180 miles (290 km) northeast of San Francisco, according to Cal Fire.</p>

<p>Crews were "still in for quite a firefight today, just because (of) the sheer magnitude and the sheer size of the fire," said Dan Collins, a Cal Fire captain, noting that temperatures were to be in the high 80s with 25% percent humidity during the day.</p>

<p>Some 4,800 firefighters were building and strengthening control lines on Monday morning hoping to increase the 12% they had contained. The more favorable weather conditions compared to those they faced over the past several days were helping, Collins added.</p>

<p>Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said in a statement that the accused arson suspect, Ronnie Dean Stout II, was jailed without bond on a Butte County judge's warrant after he was identified as the person seen pushing a flaming car into a gully on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>The fire rapidly grew, doubling in size from Friday to Sunday and destroying at least 114 structures in four counties.</p>

<p>The fire has also caused officials to issue evacuation warnings and orders to several communities, including Paradise, the town that was devastated by the 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest in the state's history.</p>

<p>Cal Fire also reported on Monday that 33% of the SQF Lightning Complex was contained. That fire has raged for the past two weeks some 350 miles (563 km) to the south of the Park Fire. Part of that complex, dubbed the Borel Fire, swept through Havilah, torching much of that historic gold mining town on Friday.</p>

<p>The Park and Borel fires were just two of the 102 large active fires burning nationwide. A total of 25 had forced evacuations as of Monday morning, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.</p>

<p>A cold front in the Pacific Northwest, where many of the fires burn, was forecast to bring rain and thunderstorms to the region on Monday. However, the system will carry strong wind gusts of up to 50 miles (80 km) per hour that could hamper firefighting efforts, the center said in a statement.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who on Monday visited the site of a deadly attack in the annexed Golan Heights, vowed Israel would deliver a "severe response" to the rocket fire that killed 12 children.</p>

<p>"Like all Israeli citizens, and I must say like many around the world, we were deeply shaken by this horrific killing," Netanyahu said at the site of the attack, according to a statement issued by his office.</p>

<p>"These children are our children ... The State of Israel will not, and cannot, let this pass. Our response will come and it will be severe."</p>

<p>Scores of residents of Majdal Shams protested at Netanyahu's visit which came after the last of the victim was buried on Monday, with hundreds of Druze men and women gathering for the funeral, an AFP journalist reported.</p>

<p>Many residents of Majdal Shams have not accepted Israeli nationality since Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967.</p>

<p>The 12 children aged between 10 and 16 were killed on Saturday when a rocket fired from Lebanon struck a football pitch in the Druze Arab town of Majdal Shams where they were playing.</p>

<p>According to the Israeli military, they were hit by an Iranian-made rocket carrying a 50-kilogramme warhead, adding it was fired by Lebanese armed group Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, which has traded regular cross-border fire with Israeli forces since the Gaza war began in early October, has denied responsibility for the strike, though it claimed multiple attacks on Israeli military positions that day.</p>

<p>Hezbollah says its actions against Israeli forces are in support of Palestinians in Gaza and its ally, the Hamas group.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A knife attack in northern England on Monday wounded at least eight people, reportedly including children, emergency services said.</p>

<p>Police said armed officers detained a man and seized a knife after being called to a property in Southport, near Liverpool in northwest England.</p>

<p>"There are a number of reported casualties," police said in a statement.</p>

<p>The North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) said it had "treated eight patients with stab injuries who have been taken to Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Aintree University Hospital and Southport and Formby hospital."</p>

<p>Alder Hey Children's Hospital said: "We can confirm that the trust has declared a major incident."</p>

<p>Local business owner Colin Parry, one of the people who called police, told the domestic Press Association news agency that he believed several "young girls" had been stabbed.</p>

<p>Bare Varathan, who owns a local shop, told PA he saw "seven to 10 kids" who were "injured, bleeding", adding that he saw they had been stabbed.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the incident "horrendous and deeply shocking," adding on X, formerly called Twitter, that "my thoughts are with all those affected".</p>

<p>The area where the incident took place is located in a quiet, leafy neighbourhood of residential streets.</p>

<p>Some residents who were allowed to come out from the police cordon sealing it off looked visibly shocked, according to an AFP reporter at the scene.</p>

<p>One man who lives in an adjoining street and did not wish to be named told AFP: "It's not what you expect to see in Southport."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

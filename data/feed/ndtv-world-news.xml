       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Violence in Bangladesh has left over 130 dead as students demand reforms to a quota system governing the allocation of government jobs in the country. The protests intensified following Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's controversial remarks, where she labelled the protestors as "Razakars". This term, historically loaded and carrying a negative connotation, harks back to the East Pakistani volunteer force that opposed the creation of Bangladesh as a sovereign nation during its 1971 War of Independence.</p>

<h3><strong>The Spark</strong></h3>

<p>The protests, which began late last month, reached a boiling point earlier this week when student activists at Dhaka University, the largest university in the country, engaged in violent clashes with police and counter-protesters aligned with the ruling Awami League.</p>

<p>The controversial quota system reserves up to 30 per cent of government jobs for family members of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence against Pakistan. Protesters argue that this system is discriminatory and disproportionately benefits supporters of Prime Minister Hasina's Awami League party. They advocate for a merit-based system to replace the existing quota. Prime Minister Hasina's fiery remarks at a public gathering ignited further protests.</p>

<p>"If not the grandchildren of the freedom fighters, then who will get quota benefits? The grandchildren of the 'Razakars'?" the Bangladeshi PM asked. "This is my question. I want to ask the people of the nation. If the protesters don't comply, I can do nothing. They can continue their protest. If protesters damage properties or attack cops, the law will take its course. We can't help."</p>

<p>PM Hasina's intent was to highlight the importance of preserving benefits for the descendants of those who fought for Bangladesh's independence. However, the term "Razakar" struck a raw nerve. It is a term that conjures up memories of widespread violence from the 1971 War of Independence, during which the "Razakars" collaborated with the Pakistani army against the Bengali nationalist movement.</p>

<h3><strong>Historical Context Of The Term "Razakar"</strong></h3>

<p>The "Razakars" were a paramilitary force recruited by the Pakistani army during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. Comprised primarily of pro-Pakistani Bengalis and Urdu-speaking Biharis, the "Razakars" were involved in numerous atrocities, including mass killings, rapes, and torture. The 1971 war saw immense suffering, with estimates of civilian deaths ranging from 300,000 to 3 million. The scars of these events are still evident in the national psyche.</p>

<p>In 2010, Prime Minister Hasina's government established the International Crimes Tribunal to prosecute those accused of war crimes during the 1971 conflict. This move was part of her strategy to address historical injustices and was widely seen as a fulfilment of her party's electoral promises. The tribunal has since convicted several individuals, predominantly from the now-banned Jamaat-e-Islami party.</p>

<p>In December 2019, the government published a list of 10,789 individuals identified as "Razakars", marking the first official recognition of these collaborators. This list included prominent figures and was intended to ensure that future generations understand the historical context of their actions.</p>

<h3><strong>The Contentious Quota System</strong></h3>

<p>The current protests are rooted in the quota system for government jobs, which allocates significant portions to descendants of freedom fighters. This system, established in 1972 and abolished briefly in 2018 before being reinstated, has been a source of contention. Critics argue that it disproportionately benefits Awami League supporters and limits opportunities for other qualified candidates.</p>

<p>"They are protesting against the repressive nature of the state," said Mubashar Hasan, a Bangladesh expert at the University of Oslo in Norway, as quoted by news agency AFP. "Protesters are questioning Hasina's leadership, accusing her of clinging onto power by force. The students are in fact calling her a dictator."</p>

<p>Student protests against the quota system have a history in Bangladesh. The latest wave began after the decision to reinstate the system, which was followed by the Supreme Court suspending the order pending a government appeal. This legal limbo has left many students frustrated, feeling that their demands for a merit-based system are being ignored.</p>

<p>The students' grievances extend beyond the quota system. High youth unemployment and a stagnant economy have all contributed to a sense of frustration and despair. Public sector jobs, with their regular wages and benefits, are highly coveted in a country where economic opportunities are limited.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[What began as a protest against politicised admission quotas for sought-after government jobs snowballed this week into some of the worst unrest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's tenure.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's top court was due to rule Sunday on the future of civil service hiring rules that sparked <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bangladesh-cops-given-shoot-on-sight-orders-amid-curfew-to-quell-student-protests-6151870">nationwide clashes</a> between police and university students, killing 133 people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What began as a protest against politicised admission quotas for sought-after government jobs snowballed this week into some of the worst unrest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's tenure.</p>

<p>Soldiers are patrolling cities across Bangladesh after riot police failed to restore order, while a nationwide internet blackout since Thursday has drastically restricted the flow of information to the outside world.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court was meeting later Sunday to issue a verdict on whether to abolish the contentious job quotas.</p>

<p>Hasina, whose opponents accuse her government of bending the judiciary to her will, hinted to the public this week that the scheme would be scrapped.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But after the mounting crackdown and a rising death count, a favourable verdict is unlikely to mollify white-hot public anger.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's not about the rights of the students anymore," business owner Hasibul Sheikh, 24, told AFP at the scene of a Saturday street protest, held in the capital Dhaka in defiance of a nationwide curfew.</p>

<p>"Our demand is one point now, and that's the resignation of the government."</p>

<p>The catalyst for this month's unrest is a system that reserves more than half of civil service posts for specific groups, including children of veterans from the country's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.</p>

<p>Critics say the scheme benefits families loyal to Hasina, 76, who has ruled the country since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.</p>

<p>Hasina's government is accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including by the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.</p>

<h3><strong>'Made the situation worse'</strong></h3>

<p>With Bangladesh unable to provide adequate employment opportunities for its 170 million people, the quota scheme is a pronounced source of resentment among young graduates facing an acute jobs crisis.</p>

<p>Hasina inflamed tensions this month by likening protesters to the Bangladeshis who had collaborated with Pakistan during the country's independence war.</p>

<p>"Rather than try to address the protesters' grievances, the government's actions have made the situation worse," Crisis Group's Asia director Pierre Prakash told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hasina had been due to leave the country on Sunday for a diplomatic tour to Spain and Brazil but abandoned her plans after a week of escalating violence.</p>

<p>Since Tuesday at least 133 people, including several police officers, have been killed in clashes around the country, according to an AFP count of victims reported by police and hospitals.</p>

<p>The US State Department warned Americans on Saturday not to travel to Bangladesh and said it would begin removing some diplomats and their families from the country due to the civil unrest.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today sent a stern warning to anyone "doubting" Israel after Israeli warplanes killed three people in the Houthi-controlled Yemeni port of Hodeida.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/decision-of-lies-israel-pm-netanyahu-on-world-courts-palestine-order-6143170" target="_blank">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> today sent a stern warning to anyone "doubting" Israel after Israeli warplanes killed three people in the Houthi-controlled Yemeni port of Hodeida.</p>

<p>The strikes on the key port are the first claimed by Israel in the Arabian peninsula's poorest country and came in "direct response" to Iran-backed rebels' <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/watch-drone-whizzes-across-skyline-in-israel-hits-building-near-us-embassy-6140933" target="_blank">drone attack in Tel Aviv</a> on Friday that killed an Israeli civilian.</p>

<p>"I have a simple message for Israel's enemies: Do not doubt Israel's determination to defend itself on every front. All those who seek to harm us will pay a very heavy price for their aggression," Netanyahu said in a televised address.</p>

<p>He also said the port that was targeted was not an "innocent port". &nbsp;</p>

<p>"It was used as their (Houthis) entry point for weapons that are supplied by Iran to its Houthi terrorist proxies. The Houthis have used those weapons to attack Israel, to attack Arab states in the region, to attack many others," Netanyahu said.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening:<br />
<br />
“From the beginning of the war, I made it clear that Israel will act against all those who attack us.<br />
<br />
This is why earlier today, I asked the Israeli cabinet to back my decision to strike against the Houthi targets in Yemen. <a href="https://t.co/xWE3KXQaeV">pic.twitter.com/xWE3KXQaeV</a></p>
— Prime Minister of Israel (@IsraeliPM) <a href="https://twitter.com/IsraeliPM/status/1814763306264957160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"This strike comes in direct response to the killer drone attack that killed one person and injured several others, a hundred yards from the US Consulate in Tel Aviv. But the aggression of the Houthis goes well beyond that single attack. For the past eight months, the Houthis have launched hundreds of ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and drones against Israel," he said.</p>

<p>Netanyahu also said the "only reason those attacks have not caused a greater loss of life has been the defensive measures taken by Israel and its allies, which together have intercepted hundreds of projectiles".</p>

<p>"But the drone attack that struck Israel on Friday shows that more than defensive action is needed to curtail the Houthis. Offensive action is also needed. It's needed to ensure that Iran's terror proxies pay a price for their brazen aggression," he added</p>

<p>He thanked the United States, Britain, France, and other members of the international maritime coalition that was formed to repel Houthi attacks.</p>

<h3><strong>Israeli Jets Strike Yemen Rebels At Hodeida Port</strong></h3>

<p>The Israeli strikes killed three people and wounded 87 at <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/series-of-strikes-hit-fuel-depot-in-yemens-port-city-casualties-feared-6149828" target="_blank">Hodeida port</a>. The attack targeted "fuel storage facilities and a power plant" in Hodeida "to pressure Yemen to stop supporting" Palestinians in Gaza, top Houthi official Mohammed Abdulsalam said while referring to the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

<p>Hodeida port, which is a vital entry point for imports and international aid for rebel-held areas of Yemen, had remained largely untouched through the decade-long war between the Houthis and the internationally recognised government propped up by neighbouring Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>The Houthis' Lebanese ally, Hezbollah, has now warned that the Israeli strikes on Hodeida marked a dangerous turn nine months into the war in Gaza.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>This week's violence has killed at least 133 people so far, posing a monumental challenge to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's autocratic government after 15 years in office. Ms Hasina had been due to leave the country on Sunday for a planned diplomatic tour but abandoned her plans amid protests.</li>
	<li>With the death count climbing and police unable to contain the violent protests, the Bangladesh government on Friday imposed a national curfew and deployed the military.</li>
	<li>The curfew was lifted briefly on Saturday afternoon to allow people to run essential errands, but otherwise people have been ordered to remain at home and all gatherings and demonstrations have been banned.</li>
	<li>Authorities also imposed a nationwide internet shutdown on Thursday that remains in effect, severely hampering communication in and out of Bangladesh. Government websites remain offline and major newspapers including the Dhaka Tribune and Daily Star have been unable to update their social media platforms.</li>
	<li>Nearly 1,000 Indian students have returned to India from Bangladesh through various land transit points or by flight. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said the Foreign Ministry is fully focused on ensuring safety and well-being of the Indians in Bangladesh.</li>
	<li>The High Commission is in regular contact with more than 4,000 students still in various universities across Bangladesh. Students from Nepal and Bhutan have also been aided in crossing into India upon request.</li>
	<li>The US State Department has warned Americans not to travel to Bangladesh and said it would begin removing some diplomats and their families from the country roiled by deadly civil unrest.</li>
	<li>Violence escalated in Bangladesh's capital Dhaka and elsewhere&nbsp;over protests by students, demanding reforms to the quota system for government jobs.</li>
	<li>The protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971 against Pakistan.</li>
	<li>The quotas have caused anger among students who face high youth unemployment rates, with nearly 32 million young Bangladeshis not in work or education out of a total population of 170 million people.</li>

       <description><![CDATA[Collins Jumaisi Khalusha, 33, has been described as a "psychopathic serial killer who has no respect for human life." Khalusha's horrific acts have come to light amidst political turmoil and a rising wave of gender-based violence in the country.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When his house was searched, police found a machete, industrial rubber gloves, rolls of Sellotape, and nylon sacks, among other things. The man to whom this house belonged has confessed to killing 42 women, including his wife, and mutilating many of his victims, stuffing the body parts in sacks and dumping them in a scrapyard in Kenya's capital Nairobi.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/20/world/africa/nairobi-kenya-serial-killer.html">Collins Jumaisi Khalusha</a>, 33, has been described as a "vampire" and a "psychopathic serial killer who has no respect for human life." Khalusha's horrific acts have come to light amidst political turmoil and a rising wave of gender-based violence in the country.</p>

<h3><strong>The Discovery</strong></h3>

<p>The grisly discovery began when dismembered bodies of nine women were found at an abandoned quarry used as a rubbish dump in Nairobi's Mukuru slums. This site, a dumping ground for local residents, became the final resting place for many of Khalusha's alleged victims.</p>

<p>The suspect, who lived in a nearby decrepit room, confessed to luring, killing, and disposing of his victims on the ground.</p>

<h3><strong>The Arrest</strong></h3>

<p>The Kenyan police arrested Khalusha days after the discovery. Prosecutors confirmed that Khalusha had confessed to the murders, including that of his wife. The victims were killed between 2022 and the date of Khalusha's arrest.</p>

<p>At Khalusha's residence, detectives found several mobile phones, identity cards, and nylon sacks similar to those used to wrap the victims' bodies. This evidence pointed to a methodical and premeditated series of killings, which has prompted some to dub him the "Kenyan Ted Bundy".&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The Victims</strong></h3>

<p>Among the victims was Josephine Owino, a 26-year-old hair braider from Mukuru Kwa Njenga. Owino disappeared after receiving a phone call one morning. Her sister, Peris Keya, searched for her, eventually reaching the dumping ground, where she convinced local men to search for bodies. Their efforts uncovered sacks containing mutilated remains.</p>

<p>Forensic examination of the bodies revealed shocking details. According to Dr Johansen Oduor, a government pathologist, most sacks contained amputated limbs and torsos. Only one intact body was found, and none of the corpses bore bullet wounds. One victim had been strangled. DNA analysis has identified two of the bodies, though many remain unidentified due to advanced decomposition.</p>

<h3><strong>Police Scrutiny And A Big Allegation</strong></h3>

<p>The Kenyan police force has been criticised for failing to act on reports of missing women. The fact that the dumping ground is situated near a police station has raised questions about police oversight and competence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The revelation of these murders has rattled Kenya, a country already dealing with political unrest and economic challenges. Protests against tax hikes and government corruption have been widespread, with many fearing that the authorities are using Khalusha's case to divert attention from political issues. This skepticism is fueled by Khalusha's lawyer, John Maina Ndegwa, who claims that his client was abused by officers and coerced into confessing.</p>

<p>During his first court appearance, his lawyer demanded that Khalusha receive medical attention, alleging mistreatment by the police. The court has granted an extension for Khalusha's detention, allowing investigators more time to build their case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden, who tested positive for COVID-19 last week, has been "tolerating" treatment well and continuing his presidential duties, according to the White House physician.</p>

<p>In a memorandum to White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Saturday, Dr Kevin C. O'Connor, the physician to the president, said genomic sequencing has determined that Biden has been afflicted by the KP .2.3 variant that accounts for around 33.3 per cent of new infections in the United States.</p>

<p>"President Biden completed his sixth dose of PAXLOVID this morning. He is still experiencing a loose, non-productive cough and hoarseness, but his symptoms continue to improve steadily," Dr O'Connor said.</p>

<p>His pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate and temperature remain absolutely normal, his oxygen saturation continues to be excellent on room air and his lungs remain clear, Dr O'Connor said.</p>

<p>"The president continues to tolerate treatment well and will continue PAXLOVID (anti-Covid pill) as planned. He continues to perform all of his presidential duties," the doctor said.</p>

<p>Biden tested positive for COVID-19 on July 17 which led to halting his campaign at a critical juncture in the presidential election when he was facing increasing pressure about his health and concerns about his viability as a candidate. He returned to his home in Delaware and isolated himself.</p>

<p>It's unclear where and when the president contracted COVID-19. But the sudden diagnosis has placed him behind closed doors at a time when Democratic lawmakers have been clamouring to see him out front.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US homeland security chief hit back Saturday at <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/women-shouldnt-be-in-secret-service-says-us-right-wing-post-donald-trump-shooting-6124419">misogynistic attacks on the women Secret Service agents</a> who threw themselves into the line of fire to protect Donald Trump from a would-be assassin.</p>

<p>"These assertions are baseless and insulting," Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement after the some on the US political right accused the Secret Service of "woke" hiring practices they say nearly got the former president killed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He praised the "highly skilled and trained" women serving at every level of law enforcement across the country for risking "their lives on the front lines for the safety and security of others."</p>

<p>"They are brave and selfless patriots who deserve our gratitude and respect," he wrote.</p>

<p>The Department of Homeland Security will "with great pride, focus and devotion to mission, continue to recruit, retain and elevate women in our law enforcement ranks. Our Department will be the better for it, and our country more secure," he continued.</p>

<p>In the week since a gunman opened fire during a Trump rally in Pennsylvania, killing one bystander, wounding two others and leaving the Republican bloodied but alive, right-wingers have unleashed a torrent of criticism on the Secret Service for having women in its ranks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Several women can be seen among the black-suited, sunglasses-clad agents racing to shield Trump with their bodies as the gunshots ring out at the rally, before hustling him from the stage and into a waiting car and safety.</p>

<p>But they, along with their boss Kimberly Cheatle -- only the second-ever woman director of the federal agency tasked with protecting presidents current, former and would-be -- are now caught in the intense scrutiny over the nearly catastrophic attack.</p>

<p>"There should not be any women in the Secret Service. These are supposed to be the very best, and none of the very best at this job are women," right-wing activist Matt Walsh wrote on X, in one typical post.</p>

<p>Many of the attacks cited DEI -- diversity, equity and inclusivity -- hiring practices that some Republicans have long criticized as discriminating against white people, white men in particular.</p>

<p>"The results of DEI. DEI got someone killed," read one post on the popular Libs of TikTok account.</p>

<p>The Secret Service has defended itself against such accusations in the past, with a spokesman telling US media just weeks before the assassination attempt that agents "are held to the highest professional standards... at no time has the agency lowered these standards."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump held his first campaign rally on Saturday since he narrowly escaped an assassination attempt one week ago, poking fun at Democrats in turmoil at a heavily secured indoor arena in the election battleground state of Michigan.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump held his first campaign rally on Saturday since he narrowly escaped an assassination attempt one week ago, mocking Democrats and at one point comparing former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to a "dog."</p>

<p>Trump, who called for national unity in a speech on Thursday as he accepted his party's presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention, made no mention of that in his remarks before a raucous crowd of supporters in Grand Rapids.</p>

<p>He frequently mocked Democratic President Joe Biden as feeble. He derided senior Democrats, including Pelosi, for trying to persuade Biden to end his re-election bid.</p>

<p>Referring to Pelosi, Trump said: "She's turned on him like a dog. She's as crazy as a bed bug."</p>

<p>The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Trump comparing Pelosi to a dog.</p>

<p>Fresh from his nominating convention where his takeover of the Republican Party was cemented, Trump appeared in Grand Rapids with his new vice presidential pick, Senator J.D. Vance from Ohio. They took the stage in their first campaign event together with the Republican Party unified behind them.</p>

<p>In contrast, it is no longer certain that President Joe Biden will be the Democratic Party's nominee facing Trump in the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>Biden has faced calls from some senior Democrats to end his re-election bid after his poor debate performance last month raised concerns over whether he could beat Trump or complete another four-year term.</p>

<p>Trump attacked Democrats, saying they wanted to kick Biden off the ticket after he won their presidential nominating contest.</p>

<p>"They have a couple of problems. No. 1, they have no idea who their candidate is," Trump said to laughter and jeers. "This guy goes and he gets the votes and now they want to take it away."</p>

<p>"As you're seeing, the Democrat Party is not the party of democracy. They're really the enemies of democracy."</p>

<p>He added: "And they keep saying, 'He's a threat to democracy.' I'm saying, 'What the hell did I do for democracy?'</p>

<p>Last week, I took a bullet for democracy."</p>

<p>Trump referred to the assassination attempt several times on Saturday. "I hope I don't have to go through that again. It was so horrible," Trump said.</p>

<p>Opinion polls show a tight race between the Trump and Biden at a national level but Biden trailing Trump in the battleground states that will likely determine the winner.</p>

<p>Many Democrats fear he may not have a realistic path to victory and that the party needs a new candidate to take on Trump.</p>

<p>There was a heavy police presence at Trump's rally in Grand Rapids on Saturday, with police on every street corner for several blocks.</p>

<p>U.S. Secret Service officers were positioned on the top balconies in the Van Andel Arena, giving them a bird's eye view of the crowd inside.</p>

<p>Bag searches for those entering the indoor arena earlier in the day were long and thorough, and the Secret Service sweep of the building took about an hour longer than usual.</p>

<p>The rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last weekend was outdoors. At that event, the gunman was able to scale the roof of a building outside the Secret Service perimeter before opening fire on Trump, clipping his ear, killing a rally-goer and wounding several others.</p>

<p>The Secret Service, which is responsible for protecting Trump, declined to comment on security for the Grand Rapids event. An investigation is under way into the security failures at the Butler rally.</p>

<p>Trump gave a detailed account of his narrow brush with death in his convention speech on Thursday, telling the audience that he was only talking to them "by the grace of Almighty God."</p>

<p>Trump's former physician, Ronny Jackson, said on Saturday that the former president is recovering as expected from the gunshot wound to his right ear, but noted intermittent bleeding and said Trump may require a hearing exam.</p>

<p>The bullet fired by the would-be assassin at the July 13 rally in Pennsylvania came "less than a quarter of an inch from entering his head," said Jackson, a Republican congressman from Texas who had served as physician to Presidents Trump and Barack Obama.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Chinese President Xi Jinping wrote him a note after the Republican presidential nominee suffered a gunshot wound to his ear during an assassination attempt last week.</p>

<p>"(Xi) wrote me a beautiful note the other day when he heard about what happened," Trump told a crowd in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in his first campaign rally since narrowly escaping the July 13 assassination attempt.</p>

<p>Trump mentioned Xi's letter while discussing his economic policy toward China during his presidency, adding, "I got along very well with President Xi."</p>

<p>The former U.S. president also referenced messages from other world leaders following the shooting at a rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Republican Vice Presidential candidate J.D. Vance has criticised Vice President Kamala Harris, responding to her recent comments about him.</p>

<p>"Kamala Harris said something to the effect that I have no loyalty to this country," Mr Vance said.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know, Kamala. I served in the United States Marine Corps and built a business. What the hell have you done other than collect the check?" Mr Vance added.</p>

<p>Vance's remark came after Vice President Harris posted a 45-second video on social media platform X on Wednesday, criticising Vance for supporting a national abortion ban and voting against protecting In Vitro Fertilisation.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump has picked his new running mate, J.D. Vance. Trump looked for someone he knew would be a rubber stamp for his extreme agenda," Harris said in the video.</p>

<p>JD Vance said: "The Vice President Kamala Harris, she doesn't like me."</p>

<p>He questioned her achievement, saying that her career has mostly been about "collecting a paycheck from her political offices".</p>

<p>He added: "We have to give her credit, my friends."</p>

<p>"She did serve as the border Czar during the biggest disaster open border that we've ever had in this country," he mentioned.</p>

<p>Appealing to his supporters, Vance urged, "Let's get President Trump back there, close down that border and bring some common sense and security to this country."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump, holding his first campaign rally Saturday since surviving an assassination attempt, rejected concerns that he is a threat to democracy, triumphantly telling a cheering crowd: "Last week I took a bullet for democracy."</p>

<p>"I'm not an extremist at all," the Republican continued at the rally in swing state Michigan, dismissing his reported links to Project 2025, a shadow manifesto from figures close to him that has been characterized by opponents as an authoritarian, right-wing wish list.</p>

<p>And he mocked the rival Democratic Party, roiled by unprecedented pressure for President Joe Biden to abandon his reelection bid amid concerns over his age and fitness to serve, if reelected, until 2029.</p>

<p>"They have no idea who their candidate is... This guy goes and he gets the votes, and now they want to take it away. That's democracy," Trump told the 12,000-strong crowd of passionate supporters.</p>

<p>In the fiery but typically rambling speech, the Republican presidential riffed on his hardline immigration views, while espousing falsehoods about migrant crime.</p>

<p>He also expressed admiration for foreign autocrats including the "brilliant" Xi Jinping of China, whom he praised for controlling "1.4 billion people with an iron fist."</p>

<p>And he evoked the seconds after a gunman tried to kill him at a rally in Pennsylvania, when, bloodied and surrounded by Secret Service agents, he raised a fist and yelled for his supporters to "fight!"</p>

<p>The crowd in Grand Rapids chanted the word back to him Saturday more than once, though some appeared to tire of the lengthy address after 90 minutes and began filing out of the arena.</p>

<p>The rally represented a moment remarkable by any measure, with Trump back on stage exactly one week since the assassination attempt.</p>

<p>He appeared wearing a new, smaller, flesh-colored bandage over his right ear, grazed in the attack by a 20-year-old gunman on a rooftop who also killed one bystander.</p>

<p>Security was reportedly tight inside the Van Andel Arena in Grand Rapids, Michigan, amid questions over Secret Service lapses at the Pennsylvania rally -- though there were few visible signs of any greater law enforcement presence.</p>

<h3><strong>Biden's 'big decision'</strong></h3>

<p>Meanwhile, Biden loyalists continued to defend the embattled president as the drumbeat of calls for him to abandon his campaign grows louder.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old and his team have remained publicly adamant that he is staying in the race, though some reports suggest discussions have begun in his inner circle about how exactly he might step aside.</p>

<p>There has been massive speculation over who could replace him. As vice president, Harris appears best positioned to do so.</p>

<p>Senator Elizabeth Warren, a leading progressive who sought the party's presidential nod in 2020, gave Harris a boost Saturday without turning her back on the president.</p>

<p>"Joe Biden is our nominee," she said on MSNBC. "He has a really big decision to make.</p>

<p>"But what gives me a lot of hope right now is that if President Biden decides to step back, we have Vice President Kamala Harris, who is ready to step up, to unite the party, to take on Donald Trump, and to win in November."</p>

<p>Some Democrats, however, fear that such a late switch could trigger chaos, dooming the party at the polls.</p>

<p>Team Trump, for its part, is effervescent after an exceptional streak of luck -- from the failed assassination bid to favorable court rulings and Biden's disastrous debate performance last month.</p>

<p>Saturday was Trump's debut campaign appearance with running mate J.D. Vance, a 39-year-old US senator from Ohio who could help win over critical swing states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Vance warmed up the crowd, taking a swipe at Harris.</p>

<p>"I did serve in the United States Marine Corps and build a business. What the hell have you done, other than collect a check?" he said of the former US senator and California attorney general.</p>

<p>Trump supporters had begun lining up in their dozens in Grand Rapids on Friday, nearly a full day before the rally began.</p>

<p>Edward Young, 64, attending his 81st Trump rally, was wearing a T-shirt showing the already iconic photo of Trump pumping his fist immediately after being shot.</p>

<p>"They have turned him into a martyr and left him alive," he said.</p>

<p>"Now he's more powerful than ever."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Security experts said CrowdStrike's routine update of its widely used cybersecurity software, which caused clients' computer systems to crash globally on Friday, apparently did not undergo adequate quality checks before it was deployed.</p>

<p>The latest version of its Falcon sensor software was meant to make CrowdStrike clients' systems more secure against hacking by updating the threats it defends against. But faulty code in the update files resulted in one of the most widespread tech outages in recent years for companies using Microsoft's Windows operating system.</p>

<p>Global banks, airlines, hospitals and government offices were disrupted. CrowdStrike released information to fix affected systems, but experts said getting them back online would take time as it required manually weeding out the flawed code.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"What it looks like is, potentially, the vetting or the sandboxing they do when they look at code, maybe somehow this file was not included in that or slipped through," said Steve Cobb, chief security officer at Security Scorecard, which also had some systems impacted by the issue.</p>

<p>Problems came to light quickly after the update was rolled out on Friday, and users posted pictures on social media of computers with blue screens displaying error messages. These are known in the industry as "blue screens of death."</p>

<p>Patrick Wardle, a security researcher who specialises in studying threats against operating systems, said his analysis identified the code responsible for the outage.</p>

<p>The update's problem was "in a file that contains either configuration information or signatures," he said. Such signatures are code that detects specific types of malicious code or malware.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's very common that security products update their signatures, like once a day... because they're continually monitoring for new malware and because they want to make sure that their customers are protected from the latest threats," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The frequency of updates "is probably the reason why (CrowdStrike) didn't test it as much," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's unclear how that faulty code got into the update and why it wasn't detected before being released to customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Ideally, this would have been rolled out to a limited pool first," said John Hammond, principal security researcher at Huntress Labs. "That is a safer approach to avoid a big mess like this."</p>

<p>Other security companies have had similar episodes in the past. McAfee's buggy antivirus update in 2010 stalled hundreds of thousands of computers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the global impact of this outage reflects CrowdStrike's dominance. Over half of Fortune 500 companies and many government bodies such as the top U.S. cybersecurity agency itself, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, use the company's software.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris will headline a fundraiser in Massachusetts on Saturday as President Joe Biden faces continued pressure from fellow Democrats and big money donors to end his floundering campaign.</p>

<p>Biden and top aides on Friday vowed to continue with the campaign, even as major donors signaled they were unwilling to open their checkbooks unless the 81-year-old president stepped aside.</p>

<p>The crisis of confidence in Biden's ability to win the Nov. 5 election has placed a huge spotlight on Harris, widely believed to be the most likely replacement if he steps down.</p>

<p>Her fundraising events, including the one on Saturday in Provincetown, Massachusetts, are getting added interest from donors who want to signal they are willing to coalesce around her potential bid for the White House, according to three Democratic fundraisers.</p>

<p>The fundraiser, expected to fetch $2 million, is being hosted by celebrity wedding planner Bryan Rafanelli and is expected to draw some 800 people, according to a source familiar with the planning.</p>

<p>Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is expected to speak at the event, with celebrities and singers such as Jennifer Coolidge, Billy Porter and Darren Criss among the guests, the source said.</p>

<p>Thirty-five congressional Democrats, representing more than 10% of the party's members in Congress, have now publicly called on Biden, who is isolating at his Delaware home with a case of COVID-19, to drop out following a disastrous debate last month against Republican former President Donald Trump that raised questions about the incumbent's ability to win the election or carry out his duties for another four years.</p>

<p>Biden's doctor on Saturday said the president still has mild COVID-19 symptoms, such as a cough and hoarse voice, but his vital signs are normal and he continues to perform his duties.</p>

<p>Democratic former President Bill Clinton and former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have privately been supportive of Biden's decision to stay in the race and have been actively encouraging donors to stay with him, NBC News reported on Saturday, citing two sources familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Separately, US Representative Mark Takano of California on Saturday became the latest Democratic congressman to call on Biden to step aside as a presidential candidate.</p>

<h3><strong>More Fundraisers Scheduled</strong></h3>

<p>Biden's campaign hoped to raise some $50 million in big-dollar donations in July for the Biden Victory Fund but was on track for less than half that figure as of Friday, according to two sources familiar with the fundraising efforts.</p>

<p>The campaign called reports of a July fundraising slump overstated, noting that it anticipated a drop-off in large donations due to vacations. It said the campaign still has 10 fundraisers on the schedule this month.</p>

<p>Harris assured major Democratic donors on Friday that the party would prevail in the presidential election as more lawmakers called for Biden to stand down.</p>

<p>"We are going to win this election," she said on a call arranged on short notice to calm donors, according to a person on the call. "We know which candidate in this election puts the American people first: Our president, Joe Biden."</p>

<p>Harris attended the call "at the direct request of senior advisers to the president," one of the people said, an account confirmed by another person familiar with the matter.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli forces pounded several areas across the Gaza Strip on Saturday, killing at least 39 Palestinians, according to health officials, as tanks advanced deeper into western and northern Rafah.</p>

<p>Among those killed on Saturday were local journalist Mohammad Abu Jasser, his wife and two children in an Israeli strike on their home in the northern Gaza Strip, a medic said.</p>

<p>Gaza's Hamas-run government media office said Abu Jasser's death raised to 161 the number of Palestinian media personnel killed by Israeli fire since Oct 7.</p>

<p>Just before midnight, an Israeli air strike on an encampment housing displaced Palestinian families killed at least 10 people, medics and Hamas media said.</p>

<p>In Al-Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip, an Israeli air strike on a house on Saturday killed three people and wounded eight others, medics said.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day an Israeli missile struck a multi-floor building in the camp, and wounded several people, including two local journalists, rescue workers said.</p>

<p>In Rafah, where Israel said it aimed to dismantle the last battalions of Hamas' armed wing, residents said tanks advanced deeper into northern areas of the city and took control of a hilltop in the west, amid fierce gun battles with Hamas-led fighters.</p>

<p>The army said troops continued operations in Rafah, eliminating many gunmen over the past day in the area of Tel Al-Sultan on the western side of the city. In central Gaza, the military said it conducted raids on Hamas' infrastructure.</p>

<p>The military also said it hit a structure used by Palestinian groups in Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza Strip, saying gunmen were operating from a humanitarian area, and accused Gaza operatives of exploiting civilian structures and population for military purposes, an allegation Hamas and other groups reject as false to justify such attacks.</p>

<p>A ceasefire effort led by Qatar and Egypt and backed by the United States has so far failed due to disputes between the combatants, who blame each other for the impasse.</p>

<p>Israel vowed to eradicate Hamas after its fighters killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostage in an Oct. 7 attack, according to Israeli tallies. At least 38,919 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's retaliatory offensive since then, Gaza health authorities say.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Israel said it had eliminated half the leadership of Hamas' military wing and killed or captured about 14,000 fighters since the start of the war.</p>

<p>Israel says 326 of its soldiers have been killed in Gaza.</p>

<p>Hamas does not release casualty figures and said Israel exaggerates its reports to give the impression of a "fake victory".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's former physician said Saturday that the Republican presidential candidate sustained a two-centimeter (almost one inch) gunshot wound during last week's attempted assassination, but that his ear is starting to heal.</p>

<p>The memo from former White House physician Ronny Jackson, now a hardline right-wing lawmaker from Texas, is one of the first detailed accounts of the injury Trump sustained when a young gunman opened fire at a rally in Pennsylvania one week ago, killing one bystander and wounding two others.</p>

<p>"The bullet passed, coming less than a quarter of an inch from entering his head, and struck the top of his right ear," wrote Jackson, who said he flew to see Trump in New Jersey late on the evening of the rally, and had been treating his ear ever since.</p>

<p>"The bullet track produced a 2cm wide wound that extended down to the cartilaginous surface of the ear. There was initially significant bleeding, following by a marked swelling of the entire upper ear," he continued.</p>

<p>The swelling has since gone down, and the wound "is beginning to granulate and heal properly," he wrote in the memo, published by Trump on his Truth Social network.</p>

<p>There is still some bleeding requiring a bandage, but "given the broad and blunt nature of the wound itself, no sutures were required," Jackson wrote.</p>

<p>Trump also underwent a CT scan of his head as he was treated for the wound by doctors at the hospital in Butler, Pennsylvania, he said.</p>

<p>"He will have further evaluations, including a comprehensive hearing exam, as needed," Jackson said.</p>

<p>Jackson, who retired from the Navy as a rear admiral last year, was first appointed to the White House medical unit under former president George W. Bush, then became the president's doctor in 2013, under Barack Obama.</p>

<p>But he gained national fame after effusively praising Trump's health and "great genes" in 2018, declaring: "I told the president that if he had a healthier diet over the last 20 years, he might live to be 200 years old."</p>

<p>Soon after, Trump nominated him to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, but Jackson withdrew his name from consideration following allegations he had improperly handed out drugs and was sometimes drunk at work.</p>

<p>During his campaign for Congress, Jackson positioned himself as a close Trump supporter, endorsing the narrative that Obama had "weaponized" the government to spy on Trump.</p>

<p>He also broke ranks with public health officials on the coronavirus, saying that mask wearing should be a "personal choice," and he questioned Joe Biden's cognitive capacity to run for president.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli strikes late on Saturday targeted a depot storing ammunition belonging to Lebanese armed group Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, three security sources told Reuters.</p>

<p>The strikes on the town of Adloun, about 40 km (25 miles) north of Lebanon's border with Israel, set off a string of loud explosions heard by witnesses across the south of Lebanon.</p>

<p>At least four civilians in Adloun were wounded in the strikes, a medical source and a security source told Reuters.</p>

<p>The strikes on South Lebanon were on the same day that Israeli fighter jets struck Houthi military targets in the area of Yemen's port city of Hodeidah, which Hezbollah said will mark a "new and dangerous phase" in the region.</p>

<p>Israel launched the strikes on Yemen a day after a drone launched by the Iranian-backed Houthis hit Israel's economic hub Tel Aviv</p>

<p>Israel and Hezbollah have been trading fire since Hezbollah announced a "support front" with Palestinians shortly after its ally Hamas attacked southern Israeli border communities on Oct. 7, triggering Israel's military offensive in Gaza.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flash floods in northern and southwest China have killed at least 20 people and left dozens missing, state media said Saturday, after a week of deadly downpours across the country.</p>

<p>Several vehicles in northwestern Shaanxi province plunged into a swollen river late Friday after a bridge collapsed, with at least 12 people killed and over 30 missing, state news agency Xinhua reported.</p>

<p>Initial investigations indicated that 17 cars and eight trucks had fallen into the river in the city of Shangluo, Xinhua said.</p>

<p>Images on state television showed a partially submerged section of the bridge with the river rushing over it.</p>

<p>One witness told local media that he had approached the bridge but that other drivers started "yelling at me to brake and stop the car".</p>

<p>"A truck in front of me didn't stop" and plunged into the water, the witness, surnamed Meng, said.</p>

<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has urged "all-out rescue and relief efforts" to find those still missing, Xinhua said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in southwestern Sichuan province more than 30 people were reported missing Saturday after a violent thunderstorm caused flash flooding overnight in the town of Ya'an, according to Xinhua.</p>

<p>Eight bodies had been recovered as of Saturday evening, while four people were rescued without serious injuries, it added.</p>

<p>On Friday, state media had reported at least five people dead and eight missing after the rains sparked flooding and mudslides in Shaanxi's Baoji city.</p>

<p>State television broadcast images of neighbourhoods completely flooded by muddy water, with excavators and residents attempting to clear the damage.</p>

<h3><strong>Extreme weather</strong></h3>

<p>The semi-desert province of Gansu, which neighbours Shaanxi, and Henan in central China were also hit by heavy rains this week.</p>

<p>In Henan's Nanyang city, the equivalent of a year's worth of rain fell at the start of the week, CCTV said.</p>

<p>And in Sichuan province, two people were reported killed and seven others missing Friday after heavy rain triggered landslides, Xinhua said.</p>

<p>China is enduring a summer of extreme weather, with heavy rains across the east and south coming as much of the north has sweltered under successive heatwaves.</p>

<p>Climate change, which scientists say is exacerbated by greenhouse gas emissions, is making such extreme weather phenomena more frequent and more intense.</p>

<p>In May, a highway in southern China collapsed after days of rain, leaving 48 dead.</p>

<p>This month, a tornado passed through a town in eastern China, killing one, injuring 79 and causing major damage.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hezbollah and its Palestinian ally Hamas said they fired rockets and explosive-laden drones at Israeli positions Saturday to avenge strikes on civilians in Lebanon and Gaza fatalities.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has traded near-daily fire with Israeli forces in support of Hamas since the Palestinian group's October 7 attack on southern Israel triggered war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Earlier Saturday, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said Syrian nationals, including children, had been injured after an "enemy drone targeted an empty four-wheel drive" near their tent, near the border.</p>

<p>Doctor Mouenes Kalakesh who heads the Marjayoun government hospital said a woman and her three children, two of them minors, had been admitted for shrapnel injuries after the strike outside Burj al-Muluk.</p>

<p>Among them was an 11-year-old boy in critical condition after he sustained shrapnel injuries and a head wound, Kalakesh told AFP.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it launched "dozens of Katyusha rockets" on Dafna, an area in Israel's north that the group said it was targeting for the first time, "in response to the attack on civilians".</p>

<p>Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said they also fired a rocket salvo from south Lebanon towards an Israeli military position in the Upper Galilee "in response to the Zionist massacres against civilians in the Gaza Strip".</p>

<p>Later on Saturday, the Iran-backed Hezbollah said it also had launched "explosive-laden drones" targeting "artillery and missile positions" and Israeli troops at a site in the Golan Heights as well as Iron Dome platforms.</p>

<p>Before the drone attack, the Israeli army said a total of 45 "projectiles" had been fired from Lebanon Saturday afternoon, towards the occupied Golan Heights and the Galilee, reporting no casualties.</p>

<p>The army said it struck "the launcher... in southern Lebanon from which the projectiles were launched toward the Golan Heights," also targeting "an additional Hezbollah launcher".</p>

<p>Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had warned his Iran-backed group would hit new targets in Israel if more civilians were killed in Israeli strikes.</p>

<p>Israeli strikes on Thursday killed at least five people in Lebanon, including the commander of a Hamas-allied group, a security source and operatives groups said.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Lebanese official media said Israeli strikes on south Lebanon killed five Syrians, three of them children, with Hezbollah announcing rocket fire at Israel in retaliation.</p>

<p>The violence since October has killed at least 515 people in Lebanon, according to an AFP tally.</p>

<p>Most of the dead have been fighters, but they have included at least 104 civilians.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, 18 soldiers and 13 civilians have been killed, according to Israeli authorities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. criticized "the breadth" of the top U.N. court's opinion that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories is illegal, with Washington saying it would complicate efforts to resolve the conflict.</p>

<p>"We have been clear that Israel's program of government support for settlements is both inconsistent with international law and obstructs the cause of peace," a U.S. State Department spokesperson said on Saturday in an email.</p>

<p>"However, we are concerned that the breadth of the court's opinion will complicate efforts to resolve the conflict," the State Department added.</p>

<p>The International Court of Justice, or the World Court, said on Friday that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories and settlements was illegal and should be ended as soon as possible, delivering its strongest findings to date on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

<p>The State Department said the ICJ opinion that Israel must withdraw as soon as possible from the Palestinian territories was "inconsistent with the established framework" for resolving the conflict.</p>

<p>Washington said that framework took into account Israel's security needs, which it says were highlighted by the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. Those attacks killed 1,200, with around 250 people taken as hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<h3><strong>Two-State Solution</strong></h3>

<p>The advisory opinion by ICJ judges is not binding but carries weight under international law and may weaken support for Israel.</p>

<p>The State Department said the way forward was through direct negotiations.</p>

<p>"Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and the regime associated with them, have been established and are being maintained in violation of international law," ICJ President Nawaf Salam said on Friday while reading the findings of a 15-judge panel.</p>

<p>The court said Israel's obligations include paying restitution for harm and "the evacuation of all settlers from existing settlements".</p>

<p>Israel rejected the opinion and said a political settlement can only be reached through negotiations. The office of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas welcomed the opinion, which it called historic.</p>

<p>The State Department said it "strongly discourages" parties from using the ICJ opinion "as a pretext for further unilateral actions that deepen divisions or for supplanting a negotiated two-state solution."</p>

<p>The ICJ case stems from a 2022 request for a legal opinion from the United Nations General Assembly. It predates Israel's war in Gaza, which began after the Oct. 7 attacks and has killed almost 39,000, according to the health ministry in Gaza, which has been under Hamas rule, while causing a hunger crisis, displacing Gaza's nearly entire 2.3 million people and spurring genocide allegations that Israel denies.</p>

<p>The ICJ opinion said the U.N. Security Council, the General Assembly and all states have an obligation not to recognize the occupation as legal nor "render aid or assistance" toward maintaining Israel's presence in the Palestinian territories.</p>

<p>Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem - which the Palestinians want for a state - in the Six-Day War in 1967 and has since built and expanded settlements in the West Bank.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

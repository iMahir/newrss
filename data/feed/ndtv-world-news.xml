       <description><![CDATA[The vote was the first successful no-confidence action since a defeat for Georges Pompidou's government in 1962, when Charles de Gaulle was president.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday sought a new prime minister to prevent France from sliding deeper into political turmoil after Michel Barnier's government was ousted in a historic no-confidence vote in parliament.</p>

<p>Poised to be contemporary France's shortest-serving premier, Barnier met Macron at the Elysee Palace to submit his resignation, after the defeat in parliament on Wednesday forced his government to step down.</p>

<p>The vote was the first successful no-confidence action since a defeat for Georges Pompidou's government in 1962, when Charles de Gaulle was president.</p>

<p>Macron was to meet both upper and lower house parliament speakers before giving an address to the nation at 1900 GMT.</p>

<p>The president is believed to be in a hurry to appoint the new premier to avoid a vacuum, according to multiple sources who spoke to AFP.</p>

<p>Limiting any impression of political chaos is all the more important for Macron who on Saturday will host world leaders -- including US president-elect Donald Trump -- for the reopening of Notre Dame cathedral in Paris after the devastating 2019 fire.</p>

<p>A majority of lawmakers on Wednesday supported the no-confidence vote proposed by the hard left and backed by the far right headed by Marine Le Pen.</p>

<p>Barnier's record-quick ejection comes after snap parliamentary elections in June resulted in a hung parliament with no political force able to form an overall majority and the far right holding the key to the government's survival.</p>

<p>The trigger for Barnier's ouster was his 2025 budget plan including austerity measures that were unacceptable to a majority in parliament, but that he argued were necessary to stabilise France's finances.</p>

<p>On Monday he forced through a social security financing bill without a vote, but the ousting of the government means France is still without a budget.</p>

<p>National Assembly Speaker Yael Braun-Pivet urged Macron to quickly choose a new premier, saying that France could not be allowed to "drift" for long.</p>

<p>"Macron alone in the face of an unprecedented political crisis," said the Le Monde daily in its headline.</p>

<h2><strong>- 'Political stalemate' -</strong></h2>

<p>"France probably won't have a 2025 budget," said ING Economics in a note, predicting that the country "is entering a new era of political instability".</p>

<p>Moody's, a ratings agency, warned that Barnier's fall "deepens the country's political stalemate" and "reduces the probability of a consolidation of public finances".</p>

<p>The Paris stock exchange fell at the opening on Thursday before recovering to show small gains. Yields on French government bonds were again under pressure in debt markets.</p>

<p>Strike calls across transport, education and other public sector services were maintained on Thursday despite the disappearance of the austerity budget that has prompted anger.</p>

<p>Macron has more than two years of his presidential term left, but some opponents are calling on him to resign.</p>

<p>"We are now calling on Macron to go," Mathilde Panot, head of the parliamentary faction of the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party, told reporters.</p>

<p>She urged "early presidential elections" to solve the political crisis.</p>

<p>Macron has however vehemently rejected such a scenario, calling it "political fiction".</p>

<p>Taking care not to crow over the government's fall, Le Pen said in a television interview that, once a new premier is appointed, her party "would let them work" and help create a "budget that is acceptable for everyone".</p>

<p>She also, conspicuously, did not call on Macron to resign.</p>

<h3><strong>- Bayrou-Macron lunch -</strong></h3>

<p>Barnier is the fifth prime minister to serve under Macron since he came to power in 2017, with each premier serving a successively shorter period.</p>

<p>Given the composition of the National Assembly, there is no guarantee that Barnier's successor would last any longer.</p>

<p>Loyalist Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu and Macron's centrist ally Francois Bayrou have been touted as possible contenders, as has former Socialist premier and interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve.</p>

<p>Bayrou, who leads the MoDem party, had lunch with the president at the Elysee, a source close to him told AFP.</p>

<p>Before his address to the nation, Macron was also to meet Braun-Pivet and upper-house Senate speaker Gerard Larcher.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan's process of brewing rice wine - Sake, has been recognised as an "intangible cultural heritage" by UNESCO on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a meeting in Paraguay, UNESCO committee members voted to recognise 45 practices and items for safeguarding humanity's cultural heritage. It also includes Brazilian white cheese, Caribbean cassava bread and Palestinian olive oil soap.</p>

<p>Producers hope this will boost interest in the traditional drink worldwide amid its waning popularity back home, with youngsters preferring imported wine, domestic beer or whiskey.</p>

<p>Sake dates back centuries and is made over several weeks by fermenting a mixture of rice, water, yeast and a mold called koji, that is the essence of the drink.</p>

<p>"We are very happy," said Takehiro Kano, Japan's permanent representative to UNESCO. He also told The Associated Press, "Sake is considered a divine gift and is essential for social and cultural events in Japan."</p>

<p>"Being recognised internationally by this mechanism will renew the interest of Japanese people in this area, and that could lead to more momentum for transmitting these skills and know-how to the next generation."</p>

<p>It is interesting how despite getting notability globally, the popularity in Japan for the drink has ebbed. Sake is usually served during ceremonies and special meals.</p>

<p>Apart from Sake, UNESCO delegates also approved &nbsp;Asturian cider culture in Spain and the making of giant barrels in Guatemala, among other items and practices admitted to the list on Wednesday.</p>

<p>In Tokyo, the Japanese prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba said in a statement, that he was "delighted" by the traditional sake-making and congratulated all dedicated to preserving and promoting the tradition.</p>

<p>In other news, Cate Blanchett had become the Creative Director of Toku Sake this year, and said she has been sake-obsessed for a long time.</p>

<p>Japan's delegation celebrated the recognition in traditional Japanese style where Kano raised a cypress box full of sake to toast the alcoholic brew.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia will set up manufacturing plants across India, Vladimir Putin said today as he praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his "India-first" policies. President Putin, who spoke at an investment summit in Moscow today, said he was impressed by how PM Modi's 'Make in India' initiative was "strengthening India's position globally".</p>

<p>Expressing his admiration for Prime Minister Modi, President Putin acknowledged how New Delhi's policies have contributed to India's development by creating a a stable environment for growth.</p>

<p>Impressed with the 'Make in India' policy, Mr Putin said, "Prime Minister Modi has a program called Make in India. We are also ready to set up our manufacturing operations in India. The Indian government, under the Prime Minister's leadership, has been creating stable conditions, driven by a policy of putting India first. We believe that investing in India is profitable." He said that Russian company Rosneft has recently invested $20 billion in India.</p>

<p>Mr Putin also emphasised how India's leadership has focused on "prioritising its national interests" which has translated to India's robust growth and the well-being of its citizens, making a special mention of how India created "stable conditions" for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p>

<p>In his speech at the 15th VTB Russia Calling Investment Forum, President Putin also highlighted the significance of the evolution of the BRICS and BRICS+ forums and the contribution of Russia's import substitution program in that context.</p>

<p>President Putin also urged for greater cooperation among BRICS nations to support the growth of SMEs and encouraged member countries to identify key areas for collaboration at the upcoming summit in Brazil next year. "I urge my BRICS colleagues to evaluate the current situation in key areas of cooperation," he said.</p>

<p>Referring to the investment platform Russia is developing with partner countries in BRICS, President Putin said that it has the potential to benefit all partners and is expected to become an important instrument for supporting our economies and providing financial resources to the countries of the Global South and East.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B has put an end to rumours about her financial stability and revealed that she spends around $3 million a month. The speculation began after the 32-year-old shared a sponsored advertisement with clothing brand Shein earlier this week. In the comments section of the post, her followers questioned why she would partner with the fast fashion line if she often wears expensive brands. In response, the American rapper clarified on X that she is not just "surviving off" brand deals but spends "about $3 million in a month".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"People say that I'm surviving off Shein deals and brand deals - wait hold on," Cardi B, whose real name is Belcalis Cephus, said in a voice recording shared on X on Tuesday. "I want to let y'all know I could wake up tomorrow, sign a contract, and have half of $65 million - or half of $70 million - in my bank," she continued. The rapper also went on to say that she isn't merely "surviving" and spends "about $3 million in a month."</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>In the following post, the 32-year-old shared a screenshot of a text message that revealed an alleged tour deal she had in negotiation in September. The deal claimed that Cardi B would be paid $1 million per show for a total of $65 million. It also alleged that the rapper would be paid "half the money upfront upon signing the contract".&nbsp;</p>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>In the voice note, Cardi emphasised that the text messages were from September during her "off year". "That was on September of this year, not old shitt," she said, adding, "And mind you this my off year by the way."</p>

<p>The rapper also stated that she doesn't want to sign a tour deal until she announces her next album. "I don't want to take tour deals until I announce my album because when I announce my album I know they're going to up it," Cardi said. "You have to move smart. You can't act hungry when you're not," she added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, Cardi B released her last album "Invasion of Privacy" in 2018 and has been teasing that she's working on her next record in recent months. In October, she hosted a space session on X (formerly Twitter) and discussed plans for her long-awaited sophomore album. The rapper said, "It's gonna be amazing and unique because everything I do it gotta be amazing and unique. I'm sorry for the delay. It's not gonna be a crazy delay. It's gonna come out amazing," reported Variety.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Bangladeshi tribunal banned broadcasts of "hate speech" by autocratic ex-premier Sheikh Hasina on Thursday, weeks after indicting her over the killing of protesters during the August revolution that ousted her.</p>

<p>Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) is investigating Hasina for "mass murder", among other charges, during the weeks of unrest that forced her to flee the country for neighbouring India.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Sheikh Hasina is accused in several cases currently under investigation by the tribunal," prosecutor Golam Monawar Hossain Tamim told reporters.</p>

<p>"We sought a ban on disseminating her hate speech as it could hinder legal proceedings or intimidate witnesses and victims," he said, confirming the ICT had agreed to enact the ban.</p>

<p>"If her speeches continue to circulate, it will become difficult to bring witnesses to the tribunal."</p>

<p>It was not immediately clear what authority would determine which speeches by Hasina qualified as hateful or how the order would be enforced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The decision came days after Hasina addressed a gathering of supporters in New York by videolink, accusing Bangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus of "mass murder".</p>

<p>Hundreds of people were killed in the weeks prior to Hasina's ouster, most by police fire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scores more died in the hours after her toppling, largely in reprisal killings against prominent supporters of her Awami League party.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ICT was set up by Hasina in 2010 to probe atrocities during the country's 1971 war of independence against Pakistan.</p>

<p>Over the following years it sentenced numerous prominent political opponents to death.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The court was regularly criticised by rights groups for not meeting proper trial standards and became widely seen as a means for Hasina to eliminate her rivals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The interim government led by Yunus, winner of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, has vowed to push for Hasina's extradition from India to be tried by the tribunal.&nbsp;<br />

       <description><![CDATA[With president-elect Donald Trump promising to make the US "the crypto capital of the planet", Bitcoin price is up more than 130 per cent so far this year.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An "epic milestone" is what Bitcoin reached, with an all time high of $100,100. The currency peaked at $103,000 on Thursday.</p>

<p>With president-elect Donald Trump promising to make the US "the crypto capital of the planet", the digital currency is up more than 130 per cent so far this year. However, that indicates a shifted stance as during his first term, Trump referred to cryptocurrencies as "scam".</p>

<p>He has also promised the country - a crypto advisory council for which several crypto companies, including Ripple, Kraken, and Circle are vying for a seat.</p>

<p>Anthony Pompliano, CEO of Professional Capital Management and crypto enthusiast posted on X, "There are so many people around the world who did their homework, they thought independently and critically, and they bought this thing that no one had ever heard of before."</p>

<p>Since Trump's win, Bitcoin has seen stunning growth and is now placed among the top performing assets of 2024 and as the crowning glory, the president-elect has decided to nominate a cryptocurrency advocate as the country's SEC chair. On Wednesday, he said he would nominate Paul Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, who has been involved in crypto policy as co-chair of the Token Alliance.</p>

<p>Dan Held, a notable crypto investor said that Bitcoin surpassing $100,00 does not just represent a price, it shows that the world is gradually accepting Bitcoin as a future reserve currency. He added that this turning point represents "financial freedom".</p>

<p>"We're witnessing a paradigm shift. Bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the verge of mainstream financial acceptance," Mike Novogratz, CEO of US-based crypto firm Galaxy Digital, told Reuters.</p>

<p>Experts embrace this change as a positive step and the conviction gets stronger with Trump's personal interest in crypto. In September, he launched World Liberty Financial with his three sons.</p>

<p>Although the rise of crypto bodes well, it is interesting to recall Sam Bankman-Fried, his jailing and subsequent damage to the sector's reputation and bear in mind crypto's notorious market volatility and the industry's energy consumption.</p>

<p>Steven McClurg, founder of Canary Capital, told Reuters, "Investors may look to take profits after this milestone, which could lead to short-term dips. However, once these sell orders are cleared, bitcoin could rise even further, possibly hitting $120,000 by Christmas."<br />

       <description><![CDATA[A study from Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health reveals that consuming dark chocolate could reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by 21%, unlike milk chocolate, which is linked to long-term weight gain.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the Indian subcontinent, chocolate is often seen as a sweet indulgence, typically classified as confectionery alongside candies and sugary treats. While most people enjoy it for its taste and texture, the idea that chocolate could offer health benefits might sound unbelievable to many, especially when linked to diabetes prevention.</p>

<p>However, a recent study sheds light on the potential health perks of dark chocolate. Researchers discovered that individuals who regularly opt for dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate could reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by up to 21%.</p>

<p>As per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/387/bmj-2023-078386">the study conducted by researchers </a>of Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, increased consumption of dark, but not milk, chocolate was associated with a lower risk of Type 2 Diabetes. Increased consumption of milk, but not dark chocolate, was associated with long-term weight gain. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to replicate these findings and further explore the mechanisms.</p>

<p>"We were surprised by the clear split between dark and milk chocolate's impact on diabetes risk and long-term weight management," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20241204/Dark-chocolate-consumption-associated-with-lower-type-2-diabetes-risk.aspx">said corresponding author Qi Sun,</a> associate professor in the Departments of Nutrition and Epidemiology.</p>

<p>"Even though dark and milk chocolate have similar levels of calories and saturated fat, it appears that the rich polyphenols in dark chocolate might offset the effects of saturated fat and sugar on weight gain and diabetes. It's an intriguing difference that's worth exploring more."</p>

<p>The authors pointed out that the findings might not hold true for people who consume a lot of chocolate and that the participants' chocolate intake was modest in comparison to previously documented national norms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump's controversial nomination of TV host Pete Hegseth to run the Defense Department was teetering Wednesday as Republican senators raised questions over his fitness for the powerful role.</p>

<p>Hegseth, a former Army National Guard officer and Fox News weekend presenter, is under intense pressure over a series of misconduct allegations, including accusations of alcohol abuse and a sexual assault claim from 2017, over which no charges were filed.</p>

<p>Hegseth denies all wrongdoing but the controversy has left Trump's transition officials scrambling to avoid the embarrassment of a second Cabinet nomination collapsing amid dwindling support from Republicans in Congress.</p>

<p>Running the Pentagon is one of the biggest roles in public office. The Defense Department employs almost three million military and civilian staff, and defense spending -- including veterans' care -- topped $1 trillion in the 2023 fiscal year.</p>

<p>Up to six Senate Republicans -- including South Carolina's Lindsey Graham, one of Trump's staunchest allies on Capitol Hill -- have voiced doubts over Hegseth's ability to walk the tightrope to confirmation, according to NBC News.</p>

<p>The questions around Hegseth's character deepened as an old email emerged in which Hegseth's own mother called him an "abuser of women."</p>

<p>"I think some of these articles are very disturbing," Graham told CBS News of the media coverage around the nomination.</p>

<p>"He obviously has a chance to defend himself here, but some of this stuff is going to be difficult."</p>

<p>Republicans will have 53 seats in the incoming Senate majority, meaning Trump's nominees can afford to lose the support only three Republican votes at their January confirmation hearings, assuming all Democrats vote against them.</p>

<p>US media have floated various alternatives, with Trump said to by mulling one-time Republican primary rival and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.</p>

<p>The move would raise eyebrows in Washington, as the pair had only the most perfunctory of reconciliations after a bitter presidential nomination battle that left both bruised, although the governor did endorse Trump after dropping out.</p>

<p>On what is being seen as a day of reckoning for Hegseth, the 44-year-old was due for further meetings with influential Republicans on Capitol Hill, and his first TV interview since being nominated, on Fox News.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yoon Suk Yeol's presidency of South Korea has been a rollercoaster of scandals and disasters and now he faces impeachment after imposing martial law and sending troops and helicopters to parliament.</p>

<p>But the country's plunge back into the dark days of military rule only lasted a few hours, and after a night of protests and high drama Yoon was forced into a U-turn in the early hours of Wednesday.</p>

<p>The opposition have filed a motion to impeach Yoon, 63, who has since gone to ground, and on Thursday his political survival was hanging by a thread.</p>

<p>Yoon "gravely violated the constitution and the law" and sought to "evade imminent investigations... into alleged illegal acts involving himself and his family", according to the motion.</p>

<p><strong>Born in dictatorship&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Born in Seoul in 1960 months before a military coup, Yoon studied law and went on to become a star public prosecutor and anti-corruption crusader.</p>

<p>He played an instrumental role in Park Geun-hye, South Korea's first female president, being convicted of abuse of power, imprisoned and impeached in 2016.</p>

<p>As the country's top prosecutor in 2019, he also indicted a top aide of Park's successor, Moon Jae-in, in a fraud and bribery case.</p>

<p>The conservative People Power Party (PPP), in opposition at the time, liked what they saw and convinced Yoon to become their presidential candidate.</p>

<p>He duly won in March 2022, beating Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party, but by the narrowest margin in South Korean history.</p>

<p><strong>Halloween to handbag&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Yoon was never much loved by the public, in particular by women -- he vowed on the campaign trail to abolish the ministry of gender and equality -- and he has lurched from scandal to scandal.</p>

<p>This included his administration's handling of a 2022 crowd crush during Halloween festivities that killed more than 150 people.</p>

<p>Voters have also blamed Yoon's administration for food inflation, a lagging economy and increasing constraints on freedom of speech.</p>

<p>He was accused of abusing presidential vetoes, notably to strike down a bill paving the way for a special investigation into alleged stock manipulation by his wife Kim Keon Hee.</p>

<p>Yoon suffered further reputational damage last year when his wife was secretly filmed accepting a designer handbag worth $2,000 as a gift. Yoon insisted it would have been rude to refuse.</p>

<p>His mother-in-law, Choi Eun-soon, was sentenced to one year in prison for forging financial documents in a real estate deal. She was released in May 2024.</p>

<p>Yoon himself was the subject of a petition calling for his impeachment earlier this year, which proved so popular the parliamentary website hosting it experienced delays and crashes.</p>

<p><strong>You can sing!&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Local media have reported that Yoon is particularly enamoured of British wartime prime minister Winston Churchill.</p>

<p>As president, Yoon has maintained a tough stance against nuclear-armed North Korea and bolstered ties with Seoul's traditional ally, the United States.</p>

<p>Last year, he sang Don McLean's "American Pie" during a visit to the White House, prompting US President Joe Biden to respond: "I had no damn idea you could sing."</p>

<p>But his efforts to restore ties with South Korea's former colonial ruler, Japan, did not sit well with many at home, as the issue remains sensitive in the country.</p>

<p><strong>Lame duck</strong></p>

<p>Yoon has been a lame duck president since the opposition Democratic Party won a majority in parliamentary elections this year. They recently slashed Yoon's budget.</p>

<p>In his Tuesday night televised address to the nation, Yoon railed against "anti-state elements plundering people's freedom and happiness" and his office has subsequently cast his imposition of martial law as a bid to break through legislative gridlock.</p>

<p>But to use his political difficulties as justification for imposing martial law for the first time in South Korea since 1980 is absurd, an analyst said.</p>

<p>"(This) is typically reserved for situations like war, emergencies, or other similar concerns regarding threats to national security," said Gi-Wook Shin, a professor at Stanford University.</p>

<p>"This situation will test the strength of Korea's liberal democratic institutions and their ability to counter such actions," Shin told AFP.</p>

<p>"It also sends a broader message to Korean politicians and democracies worldwide that political goals cannot be pursued through such undemocratic means."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Vladimir Putin praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'India-first' policy and the 'Make in India' initiative and expressed Russia's willingness to establish manufacturing operations in India.</p>

<p>Addressing the 15th VTB Russia Calling Investment Forum in Moscow, President Putin drew parallels between Russia's import substitution programme and India's 'Make in India' initiative.</p>

<p>The two-day forum started in Moscow on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"Prime Minister Modi has a similar programme called Make in India. We are also ready to set up our manufacturing operations in India. The Indian government, under the Prime Minister's leadership, has been creating stable conditions, driven by a policy of putting India first. We believe that investing in India is profitable," the Russian President said.</p>

<p>He highlighted that Russian oil giant Rosneft has invested $20 bn in India recently.</p>

<p>The 'Make in India' initiative, aimed at boosting manufacturing and attracting foreign investment, has played a key role in strengthening India's position in the global economy, he observed.</p>

<p>President Putin's remarks underscored India's economic progress under PM Modi's leadership. He lauded the Indian government and its efforts in creating "stable conditions" for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), particularly highlighting the economic initiatives spearheaded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with a special focus on the 'Make in India' programme.</p>

<p>President Putin also highlighted the significance of Russia's import substitution programme in the context of BRICS' evolution, focusing on the growth of SMEs and the necessity for a rapid dispute resolution mechanism to facilitate smooth business transactions for SMEs in BRICS countries.</p>

<p>He pointed out the rise of new Russian brands that are replacing Western brands that have exited the market, noting the success of local Russian manufacturers in sectors such as consumer goods, IT, high-tech, and agriculture.</p>

<p>"For us, this is particularly important as part of our import substitution programme. The emergence of new Russian brands is helping replace those of Western companies that have voluntarily left our market. Our local manufacturers have achieved significant success, not only in consumer goods but also in IT and high-tech industries," he said.</p>

<p>President Putin also underlined the need for greater cooperation among BRICS nations to support the growth of SMEs and encouraged member countries to identify key areas for collaboration at the upcoming summit in Brazil next year.</p>

<p>Referring to the investment platform Russia is developing with BRICS, President Putin said that it has the potential to benefit all partner countries and is expected to become an important instrument for supporting our economies and providing financial resources to the countries of the Global South and East.</p>

<p>"I urge my BRICS colleagues to evaluate the current situation in key areas of cooperation, and we will certainly bring this to the attention of our Brazilian counterparts, who will be leading BRICS next year," Putin added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>German police are broadening their probe into a Berlin palliative care doctor suspected of killing eight elderly patients by looking at another 40 suspicious deaths, media reports said Wednesday.</p>

<p>The Berlin prosecution service did not confirm the reports when contacted by AFP about the case of the 40-year-old medic who has been in custody since August.</p>

<p>Prosecutors had reported in late November that the doctor was suspected of killing eight elderly patients under his care and setting fire to some of their homes to cover up his crimes.</p>

<p>He stood accused of giving his elderly patients lethal drug cocktails motivated purely by a "lust for murder", they said last week.</p>

<p>Bild daily reported on Wednesday that a team of police investigators are now searching through the files of some 40 other deceased patients for more possible victims of the doctor.</p>

<p>Berlin public broadcaster RBB also said a special police unit was studying another 40 suspicious cases, with both media outlets partially identifying the suspect as Johannes M.</p>

<p>RBB said on its website that "if the investigation team's lead is confirmed, this would be one of the largest series of murders in nursing and medicine in German post-war history".</p>

<p>The developing case, if confirmed, recalls that of the notorious German nurse Niels Hoegel, who was sentenced in 2019 to life in prison for murdering 85 patients in his care.</p>

<p>Hoegel, believed to be Germany's most prolific serial killer, murdered hospital patients with lethal injections between 2000 and 2005 before he was eventually caught in the act.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, speaking in Parliament today, reaffirmed India's long-standing support for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict by calling for the establishment of a "sovereign, independent, and viable Palestinian state" alongside Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar, responding to a claim during Question Hour in the Rajya Sabha on India allegedly abstaining from all United Nations resolutions on Gaza, said that since the onset of the Israel-Hamas conflict on October 7 last year, 13 resolutions concerning Palestine have been presented in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Since the beginning of the Israel- Hamas conflict, 13 resolutions concerning Palestine were brought in UNGA out of which India voted in favour of 10 resolutions and abstained from three resolutions," Mr Jaishankar said. &nbsp;</p>

<p>India has provided significant humanitarian assistance to Palestine during the ongoing crisis. Since the conflict began, the Centre has delivered approximately 70 metric tonnes of aid, including 16.5 metric tonnes of medicines and medical supplies in two tranches. Additionally, $5 million was disbursed to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in 2024, matching a similar contribution made in 2023.</p>

<p>"India's policy towards Palestine has been long-standing and we have always supported a negotiated two-State solution, towards the establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable State of Palestine within secure and recognised borders, living side by side in peace with Israel," Mr Jaishankar said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recent shipments in October and November 2024 included 65 tonnes of medical supplies sent to UNRWA and the Palestinian Ministry of Health.</p>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs in a statement said that India has undertaken extensive diplomatic engagements to promote peace in the region. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr Jaishankar have communicated with leaders across the region and beyond, including high-level discussions with Israeli and Palestinian counterparts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On September 22, PM Modi met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas during the Summit of the Future in New York, reiterating calls for a ceasefire, the release of hostages, and renewed diplomatic talks.</p>

<p>India has also advocated for its position in international forums, including the United Nations, BRICS, the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), and the Voice of Global South.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his outgoing US counterpart Antony Blinken are due to face off over the war in Ukraine on Thursday at an annual meeting of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Malta.</p>

<p>While Ukraine will be the dominant political issue, the meeting is due to formally approve last-minute agreements reached on issues including senior staff positions at the security and rights body where Western powers often accuse Russia of flouting human rights and other international norms.</p>

<p>The gathering of foreign ministers and other officials from 57 participating states in North America, Europe and Central Asia is overshadowed this year by the return of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, whose advisers are floating proposals to end the war that would cede large parts of Ukraine to Russia.</p>

<p>With Trump due to take office in just over a month, Western powers plan to reiterate their support for Ukraine while Russia is likely to renew its criticism of the organisation. Lavrov said last year the OSCE was "essentially being turned into an appendage of NATO and the European Union".</p>

<p>It is Lavrov's first trip to the European Union since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>

<p>The OSCE is the successor to a body set up during the Cold War for the east and west to engage with each other. In recent years, however, and especially since it invaded Ukraine, Russia has used what is effectively a veto each country has to block many key decisions, often crippling the organization.</p>

<p>This year, however, the countries blocking agreement on the OSCE budget are Armenia and Azerbaijan rather than Russia, diplomats say, over issues related to their conflict in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>

<p>Diplomats say a deal was reached this week to fill four senior OSCE positions including that of secretary general, which will be taken up by Turkey's Feridun Sinirlioglu, who was foreign minister in a caretaker government in 2015.</p>

<p>The most important annual decision at the OSCE - which country will next hold its annually rotating chairmanship - has long been settled, since Finland will hold it for the 50th anniversary of the Helsinki Final Act that lay the foundation for the current OSCE.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) have released a Spotify Wrapped-inspired list to showcase their 2024 “operational accomplishments”.&nbsp;Known for its viral popularity, Spotify Wrapped is a feature that lists users' top songs, artists, and listening habits over the year. The IDF, however, reimagined the format as a “playlist” to detail the killings of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar.<br />
<br />
In their “Wrapped,” shared on X, the IDF listed “accomplishments” in the format of a public playlist titled "Your Top Songs 2024". The entries reinterpreted Spotify's music aesthetics, with song-like titles.<br />
<br />
Standout tracks included “Dead”, referring to the elimination of Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's former secretary general, and “Dead Pt. II”, referencing Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar. Other entries such as “365”, inspired by Charli XCX's hit this year, stressed a year of “protecting our civilians”.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Another entry read, “19,000+ Terrorists Eliminated” with the mock album named “Bye Bye Bye” - an NSYNC song. The post also featured mock albums such as “Dead Hezbollah Terrorists” and “Dead Hamas Terrorists.”<br />
<br />
“Thought we would share our year, wrapped,” they wrote in the caption.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The internet, however, did not take the IDF's Spotify Wrapped-inspired recap lightly. Almost immediately, social media users began sharing their own versions of Wrapped, using the viral template to call attention to Israel's war crimes.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A user wrote, “Don't be shy, post your real one,” and detailed, “Your top war crimes: Killing over 100,000 people in Gaza, displacing millions in Gaza, leaving 0 functioning hospitals in Gaza, destroying over 80 per cent of all buildings in Gaza, causing mass starvation in Gaza.”&nbsp;</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>News website Mondoweiss also created their own version of the Spotify Wrapped-inspired list with the caption, “Israel's genocide 'Wrapped' since October 7th, 2023.” The post used the same format as the IDF's original, but with starkly different content. Titled “Israel's Genocide Wrapped”, the template included statistics, such as the number of Palestinians killed, displaced, and injured, as well as the destruction of Gaza. The list highlighted the deaths of over 2,00,000 Palestinians, the displacement of more than 1.5 million, and over 20,000 children still missing in Gaza. The post also pointed out the more than 1,05,000 Palestinians injured, over 10,000 imprisoned.</p>

<p>“Turning death and destruction into a Spotify Wrapped parody? This is grotesque on a whole new level. Celebrating violence like it's a greatest hits album only highlights how far humanity has been stripped out of this conflict. War crimes as ‘accomplishments'? Shameful," a social media user commented.</p>

<p>The IDF continues its war in Gaza, particularly in the north. A massive evacuation is underway in Beit Lahia, with over 10,000 people forced to leave in the last 24 hours.<br />
<br />
On Wednesday, Human Rights Group Amnesty International published a report, accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. The group said the Israeli Defence Forces committed at least three of the five acts banned by the 1948 Genocide Convention. The IDF assault has led to indiscriminate killings of civilians, caused serious bodily or mental harm, and deliberately inflicted "on Palestinians in Gaza conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction".<br />
<br />
“Month after month, Israel has treated Palestinians in Gaza as a subhuman group unworthy of human rights and dignity, demonstrating its intent to physically destroy them,” said Agnes Callamard, secretary-general of Amnesty International,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/5/amnesty-international-accuses-israel-of-committing-genocide-in-gaza" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a> reported.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The influencer with a substantial Instagram following of over 266,000, views the surgery as a means to restore her self-esteem and embark on a fresh chapter in her personal and professional life.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brazilian influencer Ravena Hanniely plans to undergo hymenoplasty, a surgical procedure to repair the hymen, at a cost exceeding $19,000 (over Rs 16 lakh). This 23-year-old, with a substantial Instagram following of over 266,000, views the surgery as a means to restore her self-esteem and embark on a fresh chapter in her personal and professional life.</p>

<p>"This procedure holds special meaning for me," Hanniely shared with <em>Jam Press</em>. "I want to become a virgin again. It's about my self-esteem and deeply personal reasons that have always mattered to me."</p>

<p>Hymenoplasty, a surgical procedure to repair the hymen, involves stitching the torn edges of the hymen with dissolvable sutures to restore its pre-torn appearance. For Hanniely, this procedure holds symbolic significance, representing a "fresh start" in her life.</p>

<p>While her motivations are personal, Hanniely acknowledges the criticism such surgeries often attract. "Unfortunately, not everyone understands or supports intimate choices like these," she noted. "We need to move away from judgment and start respecting individual decisions."</p>

<p>Medical professionals, however, have voiced concerns. Dr Hana Salusollia, CEO of London-based Medisonal Clinic, highlighted the physical, ethical, and psychological challenges of hymenoplasty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Although recognized as a cosmetic procedure, it's primarily symbolic and does not restore virginity," Dr. Salusollia told the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/04/lifestyle/influencer-drops-19k-on-surgery-to-become-a-virgin-again-but-a-doctor-warns-of-the-risks-involved/" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>New York Post</em></a>. She warned of risks such as infection, scarring, and irregular healing, as well as the potential for dissatisfaction with the results.</p>

<p>Dr. Salusollia also pointed to the cultural and ethical complexities of the procedure. "It raises significant ethical questions. Patients should feel empowered to make informed decisions free from societal pressures," she said, emphasizing the importance of understanding the deeply personal and cultural dimensions involved.</p>

<p>Despite these concerns, Hanniely is firm in her decision and is yet to finalize a surgery date. She intends to follow all post-operative care guidelines, including avoiding physical activity, abstaining from intimacy during the recovery period, and prioritizing her comfort to ensure proper healing.</p>

<p>"This is about how a woman feels and what she wants for herself," Hanniely said, emphasizing the psychological empowerment she associates with the procedure.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced in a statement Wednesday that the body of a hostage had been recovered from the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>"In a special operation, the body of hostage Itay Svirsky, who was kidnapped on October 7 (2023) from kibbutz Beeri and murdered in captivity by Hamas terrorists in January 2024, was brought back," Netanyahu said in a statement released by his office.</p>

<p>The body of Svirsky, who was 38 when he was kidnapped during Hamas's surprise attack, was recovered in an operation by the Shin Bet internal security agency, aided by the military, both organisations confirmed in a joint statement.</p>

<p>The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, a campaign group for relatives of those abducted to Gaza, welcomed the return of Svirsky's body while demanding the immediate release of the remaining hostages.</p>

<p>"The families continue to wait for their loved ones after 425 days of captivity. Many hostages remain alive but in grave danger, requiring immediate release for urgent medical care and rehabilitation. Others must be returned for dignified burial," it said.</p>

<p>Separately on Wednesday, the Israeli military released a statement on its investigation into the deaths of six hostages, whose bodies were recovered in August.</p>

<p>The military said they were likely executed by their captors as Israel struck near their location in February.</p>

<p>"According to the most plausible scenario, the terrorists shot the hostages close to the time of the strike," the military said.</p>

<p>During the October 7, 2023 attack, militants kidnapped 251 people, 96 of whom remain in Gaza, including 34 declared dead by the Israeli military.</p>

<p>Svirsky's is the 38th body of a hostage to be brought back from the Gaza Strip.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite being the world's most famous cryptocurrency, Bitcoin -- whose value on Thursday passed $100,000 for the first time -- has always been surrounded by mystery and controversy.</p>

<p>Here are some things to know about the volatile digital unit, which has soared since Donald Trump won the US election promising to make the country the "bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world":</p>

<p><strong>Secret creator</strong></p>

<p>In the 16 years since Bitcoin was invented, no one has been able to name its founder.</p>

<p>It all started in October 2008, when a nine-page "white paper" attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto theorised "a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash (that) would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another".</p>

<p>The idea was to break free from the control of central banks, traditionally the only institutions who can create money.</p>

<p>But is Satoshi Nakamoto a real name, a pseudonym, or a team of people? Despite various theories, the mystery endures.</p>

<p>An Australian computer scientist called Craig Wright claimed to have written the white paper, but the High Court in London ruled this year that he was not the mythical Nakamoto.</p>

<p>Since its creation, bitcoin has been accused of being the currency of choice on the dark web for illegal payments that leave no trace. It is also the currency that hackers usually demand to be paid in during ransomware attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Fallen stars</strong></p>

<p>The crypto world has been shaken by high-profile bankruptcies and the fall of several star entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>Changpeng Zhao, formerly head of the world's largest cryptocurrency platform Binance, was sentenced to four months in jail for violating US anti-money laundering laws.</p>

<p>"No wish to be CEO again. But definitely wouldn't mind a pardon," Zhao said on X this week, alluding to Trump's presidential authority to grant clemency.</p>

<p>Binance's main rival, FTX, filed for bankruptcy in late 2022, and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced in March to 25 years in prison for fraud and conspiracy.</p>

<p>His downfall has smeared the sector's reputation, but the crypto industry has continued to call for more regulatory clarity, a cause championed by Bankman-Fried.</p>

<p><strong>Towards respectability</strong></p>

<p>Bitcoin investors on Thursday cheered Trump's decision to pick a crypto fan to head the US securities regulator, reinforcing hopes that the leader will push through looser measures.</p>

<p>Even though much of the hype around bitcoin is speculative, the currency has gained some respectability in recent years.</p>

<p>US financial regulators in January approved bitcoin ETFs, or exchange traded funds, which allow a wider public to invest without having to hold the cryptocurrency directly.</p>

<p>El Salvador in September 2021 became the first country to accept bitcoin as legal tender.</p>

<p>But the crypto money hasn't won over the country's population. According to a study by Central America University (UCA), 88 percent of Salvadorians never used it in 2023.</p>

<p><strong>Based on blockchain</strong></p>

<p>Bitcoin is based on blockchain technology, a virtual ledger that allows information to be stored and exchanged in a secure, secret and unmodifiable manner. Each transaction is recorded in real time, in a tamper-proof register.</p>

<p>Bitcoins are created -– or "extracted" -- as a "reward" when powerful energy-sucking computers solve complex problems. So-called "miners" validate the transactions to create bitcoins.</p>

<p>To prevent uncontrollable growth, Satoshi Nakamoto limited the global number of coin units to 21 million, a level that should be reached around 2140.</p>

<p>Every four years, the reward for "miners" is cut in two -- slowing down the rate that new bitcoins enter the market, further boosting their scarcity and their value.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Emmanuel Macron is looking for a new prime minister on Thursday after the far right joined forces with the left to push through a no-confidence motion against his government over a budget dispute.</p>

<p>The French president needs to find a premier who can pass a 2025 budget through a deeply divided parliament.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But any new leader will face the same financial squeeze that brought down Prime Minister Michel Barnier's administration.</p>

<p>The budget bill presented by Barnier — that sank with his government — contained €60 billion ($63 billion) in tax increases and spending cuts that aimed for a reduction in the deficit to 5% of economic output in 2025, from an estimated 6.1% this year.</p>

<p>The French president is due to make a statement at 8 p.m. on Thursday.</p>

<p>Far-right leader Marine Le Pen teamed up with a left-wing coalition to topple Barnier late Wednesday, pitching the country into a prolonged period of turbulence that's likely to further unsettle investors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the result of the vote widely anticipated, the euro was little changed around $1.0514 after the result and French bond futures gave up some of their earlier gains.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Barnier's tenure was the shortest for a premier since France's Fifth Republic was founded in 1958. Barnier, a seasoned conservative and the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, was appointed in September.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-12/rn7mdkm8_marine-le-pen-_625x300_05_December_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>There is little to suggest that the current stalemate will end so easily for Macron as the next premier will be subject to the same parliamentary calculus and risk of censure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Macron has the authority to appoint a new prime minister, but he had a lengthy struggle before he managed to win limited support for Barnier from a fragmented parliament.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The roots of the current turmoil date back to June, when Macron dissolved parliament and called a snap vote as he sought to rebound from a crushing defeat for his party in the European elections — where Le Pen's party won more than double the president's party.</p>

<p>Instead, he made Le Pen's National Rally the largest party in parliament and its leader became the country's most influential power broker as his centrist coalition crumbled.</p>

<p>Following the June ballot, the lower house was split into three fiercely opposed blocs: a diminished center supporting the president, a leftist alliance and the far right led by Le Pen. That makeup won't change as a new parliamentary election can't be held until July at the earliest.</p>

<p>The divisions between those groups have been exacerbated by the economic problems facing France, with the budget deficit set to exceed 6% of GDP this year and voters reluctant to accept spending cuts or higher taxes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“To those who think I'm intent on choosing a policy of disaster through a vote of no confidence, I want to tell them that the disastrous policy would be not to censure such a budget,” she told lawmakers on Wednesday. “It's the end of this ephemeral government.”&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>What Happens Next:</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The outgoing cabinet remains in place with limited powers and will likely rely on untested emergency legislation to collect taxes and enact crucial spending</p>
	</li>
	<li>The French president is solely responsible for appointing a new premier, but there is no constitutional time limit for a decision and no obvious candidate — it took Macron nearly two months to settle on Barnier</li>
	<li>Once named, a new premier proposes a cabinet, appointed by the president, and then has to send a new 2025 budget bill to parliament</li>
	<li>A new legislative election can't be held before July</li>
</ul>

<p>The chaos in the European Union's second-biggest economy has prompted bond investors to punish France's sovereign debt relative to its peers. Barnier warned of a “storm” in financial markets if he was ousted.</p>

<p>The outgoing administration will continue in a caretaker capacity for the time being, allowing the government to avoid a US-style shutdown. Barnier can use emergency laws to collect taxes and guarantee a minimal level of spending, but the broader impact is hard to predict.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-12/q0aneqc8_michel-barnier-_625x300_05_December_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Finance Minister Antoine Armand warned Tuesday that stopgap legislation would raise taxes for millions of households and block planned spending increases for some priorities, including security and farming.</p>

<p>Following the vote, Le Pen said that she is willing to work with another government, so long as they work with her party to draw up the budget. “This budget was toxic for the French,” she said in an interview on French television. Instead, she said, the country needs “a budget that's acceptable to all.”</p>

<p>Barnier became the first French prime minister to lose a no-confidence vote in more than 60 years. The only other premier to be ousted under the Fifth Republic was Georges Pompidou in 1962 and, with the backing of the powerful president, Charles de Gaulle, he was eventually reappointed.&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p>Le Pen has been ramping up the pressure on Macron to resign as a way to break the impasse and allow France to move forward.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It's up to his conscience to decide whether he can sacrifice public action and the fate of France to his own pride,” she said during the debate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Macron has said he won't step down until his term ends in 2027 and he can't be forced out of his job. Le Pen is the frontrunner for the next presidential election, according to opinion polls.</p>

<h3><strong>Possible Barnier Successors:</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>Bernard Cazeneuve, 61: A former prime minister and interior minister under Socialist President Francois Hollande. He was already considered as a possible premier this summer before Macron picked Barnier. Tapping Cazeneuve could potentially help Macron fracture the left-wing bloc.</li>
	<li>Sébastien Lecornu, 38: In 2022, he became the youngest defense minister since the French Revolution. He's a Macron loyalist who originally came from the center-right Republicans party. The skilled politician has been a minister since Macron became president and has overseen a jump in military spending.</li>
	<li>François Bayrou, 73: The veteran centrist is the leader of the MoDem party, a key Macron ally in parliament. Currently the high commissioner for government planning, Bayrou supports proportional representation in parliamentary elections, which has also been backed by the National Rally.</li>
	<li>Jean Castex, 59: A former prime minister under Macron known for his southern French accent and his management skills. Currently the head of the RATP, the state-owned company that operates the Paris metro.</li>
</ul>

<p>And finally...</p>

<ul>
	<li>Barnier, 73: Macron could re-name the outgoing prime minister. Barnier did, however, appear to rule himself out on Tuesday. “I want to serve,” he said “But what does it mean if I fall tomorrow, and the day after you find me back here, as if nothing had happened?”</li>

       <description><![CDATA[Trouble seems to be mounting for South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol, as lawmakers began the impeachment proceedings against him following a bungled imposition of martial law that brought thousands of protesters to the streets.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li"><strong>Impeachment Vote Scheduled: </strong>President Yoon was still clinging to power on Thursday as he faces impeachment after imposing martial law and sending troops and helicopters to parliament. The opposition has filed a motion to impeach Yoon, 63, who has since gone to ground. A vote in the South Korean parliament on the President's proposed impeachment is scheduled for Saturday at around 7:00 pm (1000 GMT), opposition lawmaker Jo Seoung-lae was quoted as saying by news agency Yonhap.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li"><strong>No Presidential Address:</strong> Embattled Mr Yoon will not make any public statements on Thursday, his office said, after the short-lived declaration of martial law imploded his political fortunes and his grip on the country spectacularly. Mr Yoon has not been seen in public since his televised address in the early hours of Wednesday after the law was lifted.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li"><strong>Police Investigating President: </strong>South Korean police said it has begun investigating President Yoon, who has lurched from crisis to crisis since taking office in 2022, for alleged "insurrection" over his declaration of martial law. Woo Jong-soo, head of the National Investigation Headquarters of the National Police Agency, told lawmakers that "the case has been assigned," footage showed.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li"><strong>South Korean Defence Minister Resigns: </strong>South Korean Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun resigned on Thursday, the president's office said. The resignation came after it came to light that it was Mr Kim, a longtime confidant of Mr Yoon, who recommended imposing martial law, according to a senior military official and impeachment filings by opposition figures on Wednesday. "Today, the President accepted the resignation of Minister of National Defence Kim Yong-hyun and approved his dismissal, and nominated Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Choi Byung-hyuk as the new ministerial candidate," Mr Yoon's office said.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li"><strong>Travel Ban On Ex-Defence Minister: </strong>Prosecutors in the Asian country banned ex-defence minister Kim from leaving the country over his role in a martial law declaration. "The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office has imposed a travel ban on the former minister," according to a report by news agency Yonhap.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li"><strong>Ruling PPP Lawmakers To Reject Impeachment Bill: </strong>The floor leader of South Korea's ruling People Power Party (PPP) vowed that all their lawmakers would "unite" to defeat an opposition-led motion to impeach President Yoon. "All 108 lawmakers of the People Power Party will stay united to reject the president's impeachment," Choo Kyung-ho said at a live-streamed party meeting. The opposition-dominated parliament needs eight ruling party lawmakers to vote with them for the impeachment bill to pass.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li"><strong>Ruling PPP Asks President To Leave Party:</strong> Despite the call to oppose the impeachment bill, the PPP has asked President Yoon to leave the party. The leader of PPP, Han Dong-hoon told reporters he had "demanded the president's resignation from the party," adding that his party was "not trying to defend the president's unconstitutional martial law".</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li"><strong>US Praises South Korea Amid Crisis: </strong>The White House on Wednesday praised South Korea's "democratic resilience" as lawmakers in Seoul moved to impeach the President. South Korea "is demonstrating democratic resilience. We are confident the people of Korea will resolve this episode peacefully, democratically, and constitutionally," US National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said on X.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li"><strong>South Korea Crisis: </strong>Long-simmering disputes between the conservative government and its opponents over budgets, investigations and scandals spiralled into the imposition of martial law by the President. The sudden declaration of decree also reportedly blindsided the ruling party, whose leader Han Dong-hoon told reporters the presidential office had not consulted with him about the move. He, along with Prime Minister Han Duck-soo joined calls for Mr Yoon to rescind the order. Mr Han, a Yoon appointee would become acting president if Yoon is removed from office, according to a report by Reuters.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li"><strong>Martial Law In Korea: </strong>The imposition was the first such declaration in over four decades in South Korea and brought back painful memories of its autocratic past. The move was to "safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements plundering people's freedom and happiness," Mr Yoon had said.</li>

<p>On December 3 at 10:25 pm Korean Standard Time (KST), surprising news shocked the world as reports spread across social media announcing the imposition of Martial Law by the President of South Korea, Yoon Suk Yeol. The announcement was a shock for most South Koreans, who had long enjoyed the benefits of democracy and had only studied the imposition of martial law in history lessons.</p>

<p>The news prompted lawmakers and citizens to gather at the National Assembly, where the opposition, led by Lee Jae-myung, head of the Democratic Party, entered the assembly to vote on the president's decision. Armed troops attempted to enter the building, jostling with lawmakers and staff, but were unsuccessful in halting proceedings, which led to a vote rejecting the martial law. Following the National Assembly's decision, the President was forced to lift martial law at 4:40 am KST on December 4, after an ordeal lasting six hours.</p>

<p>While the declaration of emergency martial law was a surprise, it was not entirely unexpected. Many experts had already discussed the possibility of martial law being implemented, particularly after the recent appointment of close allies to Yoon's cabinet. This raised suspicions about the likelihood of a ‘palace coup'. But what led to this extreme measure?</p>

<h2><strong>Reaction To Intensifying Pressure</strong></h2>

<p>President Yoon's administration has been mired in allegations of corruption and misgovernance since 2022. For example, his handling of the doctors' protest and the Itaewon crowd disaster has faced widespread condemnation from both the opposition and the public. In addition to governance issues, the First Lady has become a focal point, having been accused of corruption, scandals, and exerting undue influence within the presidential office. However, the situation grew more serious after the April National Assembly elections, when the opposition secured a majority, making it difficult for the president's party to pass legislation and conduct normal proceedings.</p>

<p>The likely reason behind Yoon's extreme step was the growing pressure from all sides, including the Democratic Party (DP), the public, and his own party. This pressure intensified in September when the 22nd Assembly's first regular session began. Following that, Yoon faced increasing partisan strife as the assembly turned hostile, repeatedly demanding accountability from the president over actions taken against the First Lady. Just last week, the president vetoed a bill passed by the opposition for the third time, calling for a special counsel investigation into corruption charges against the First Lady. The tension between the president and the legislature also coincided with his declining popularity.</p>

<p>In his public address declaring martial law, he stated, “I declare martial law to protect the Republic of Korea from the threats of North Korean communist forces, to immediately eradicate the unscrupulous pro-Pyongyang antistate forces that pillage the freedom and happiness of our people, and to protect free constitutional order.” He described the opposition's decision to block the National Assembly from functioning as a “legislature dictatorship”, which had paralysed the administration and sabotaged state functions. The speech highlighted his frustration with the opposition in the country.</p>

<p>With rising allegations against his wife and his falling popularity, the president also faced increasing pressure from within his party, particularly from Han Dong-hoon, the People Power Party (PPP) leader who publicly urged the president to take action. Sensing that he was losing support from the public and the party, and that the opposition's tactics were succeeding, he may have felt compelled to take this drastic step, which was supported only by a select few in the cabinet. As reported by the media, the Chungam Faction—a small group of close aides, including the president and the Defence Minister—took the decision without consulting the Prime Minister or the party. This indicates that the president felt he had no choice but to declare martial law to save his presidency.</p>

<h2><strong>What Lies Ahead for Yoon and His Party?</strong></h2>

<p>After the martial law was lifted, the entire cabinet offered to resign en masse. Several senior officials in the presidential offices, including the Presidential Chief of Staff, National Security Adviser, Chief of Staff for Policy, and seven others, have already submitted their resignations. The ruling party, PPP, has apologised for the president's decision, stating, “As the ruling party, we deeply apologise to the public for this distressing situation”, while its leader, Han Dong-hoon, has called for immediate action against Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun, who was instrumental in making the decision alongside the president.</p>

<p>In contrast, the DP, the opposition, has not relented. It has doubled down after this incident and resolved to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Yoon if he refuses to resign immediately, calling his decision a “clear violation of the constitution” and further stating that it constitutes “a serious act of rebellion and a perfect reason for impeachment”.</p>

<p>While the impeachment process may take some time, beginning in the National Assembly and then moving through the Constitutional Court, the first leg of the process is expected to proceed swiftly. Six parties, led by the opposition DP, have already submitted the impeachment bill yesterday, which will be listed today. The impeachment procedure requires a majority to propose a motion and support from two-thirds of the National Assembly for it to pass. Although the DP holds 170 seats in the assembly, it still requires 200 votes to secure the motion. Even with the support of smaller parties, such as the New Reform Party, the number reaches only 192—eight short of the expected total. Even if the motion passes through the National Assembly, the judicial process is likely to take much longer due to the procedural requirements for the Constitutional Court.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the opposition is expected to push for a serious investigation into the procedures surrounding the declaration of martial law, including examining the process behind the summoning of state council meetings for approval, with a view to supporting insurrection charges against the president. Nonetheless, what is certain is that the president's political career is likely over as a result of this decision. It will also have a significant impact on the prospects of his party, which was already plagued by serious allegations and internal conflict before this incident.</p>

<p>However, it remains to be seen whether the PPP, the ruling party, will oppose the president's impeachment, which, if it does, will further damage the party's reputation. On the other hand, adopting a ‘keep-at-arm's-length' approach by distancing itself from the president may help it save face. From this incident, which lasted only six hours, one thing is clear: this political drama has showcased South Korea's remarkable democratic resilience.</p>

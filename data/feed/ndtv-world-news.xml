       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was elected for a second term on Thursday after pledging to create a continental "defence union" and stay the course on Europe's green transition while cushioning its burden on industry.</p>

<p>Members of the European Parliament backed von der Leyen's bid for another five-year term at the helm of the European Union's powerful executive body with 401 votes in her favour and 284 against in a secret ballot in the 720-member chamber.</p>

<p>In an address to the Parliament in Strasbourg earlier in the day, von der Leyen laid out a programme focused on prosperity and security, shaped by the challenges of Russia's war in Ukraine, global economic competition and climate change.</p>

<p>"The next five years will define Europe's place in the world for the next five decades. It will decide whether we shape our own future or let it be shaped by events or by others," von der Leyen said ahead of a secret ballot on her candidacy.</p>

<p>She stressed the need not to backtrack on the "Green Deal" transformation of the EU economy to fight climate change - a key pledge for Green lawmakers, who joined centre-right, centre-left and liberal groups in backing her for the post.</p>

<p>After pledging to support Ukraine for as long as it takes in its fight against Russia, von der Leyen said Europe's liberty was at stake and it must invest more in defence.</p>

<p>Von der Leyen, a centre-right former German defence minister, pledged to create "a true European Defence Union", with flagship projects on air and cyber defence.</p>

<p>The plan sparked criticism from the Kremlin, which said it</p>

<p>reflected an attitude of "militarisation (and) confrontation".</p>

<p>Von der Leyen blasted Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's recent visit to Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow as an "appeasement mission", winning broad applause from lawmakers.</p>

<p>Defence policy in Europe has traditionally been the domain of national governments and NATO.</p>

<p>But following Russia's attack on Ukraine and amid uncertainty over how much Europe will be able to rely on the United States for its protection should Donald Trump win the U.S. presidential election in November, the European Commission is seeking to push more joint European defence projects.</p>

<p>Von der Leyen also promised a raft of climate policies including a legally-binding EU target to cut emissions by 90% by 2040, compared to 1990 levels.</p>

<p>She also pledged new measures to help European industries stay competitive while they invest in curbing emissions.</p>

<p><strong>Green Support</strong></p>

<p>The Greens' decision to join the informal alliance of parties that supports von der Leyen ensured her margin of victory was fairly comfortable. She needed 361 votes to secure a majority in the chamber.</p>

<p>Her own coalition of the centre-right, centre-left and liberals has 401 seats, but some of its members were expected to vote against her in the secret vote.</p>

<p>She might also promise tighter EU border controls and stronger police cooperation against crime.</p>

<p>Von der Leyen's re-election provides continuity in the European Union's key institution at a time of external and internal challenges - including mounting support for far-right and eurosceptic political parties in the 27-nation bloc.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks, she will propose her team of commissioners, who will face individual hearings from lawmakers before a final vote on the whole Commission later in the year.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain let down its citizens by leaving the nation ill-prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic because of significantly flawed planning and failures by ministers and scientific experts, a public inquiry concluded in a scathing report on Thursday.</p>

<p>Britain recorded one of the world's highest number of fatalities from COVID with more than 230,000 deaths reported by December 2023, while the nation's finances are still suffering from the economic consequences.</p>

<p>Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered an inquiry in May 2021, and its first report, which examined the nation's preparedness for an outbreak, was damning.</p>

<p>"Had the UK been better prepared for and more resilient to the pandemic, some of the financial and human cost may have been avoided," the report by the inquiry chair, former judge Heather Hallett, said in the report.</p>

<p>"The inquiry has no hesitation in concluding that the processes, planning, and policy of the civil contingency structures within the UK government and devolved administrations and civil service failed their citizens."</p>

<p>The inquiry found there had been a "lack of adequate leadership" with "groupthink" clouding expert advice. Ministers had not been given a broad enough range of opinions and then had failed to sufficiently challenge what they did receive.</p>

<p>A flawed 2011 strategy, which had underpinned the nation's preparations for such an emergency, had prepared for only one type of pandemic - influenza.</p>

<p>It was outdated, had focused on dealing with the impact of an outbreak rather than trying to prevent its spread, and had not taken into account the economic and social impact, the report said. That strategy was virtually abandoned on its first encounter with COVID.</p>

<p>"The Secretaries of State for Health ... who adhered to the strategy, the experts and officials who advised them to do so, and the governments of the devolved nations that adopted it, all bear responsibility for failing to have these flaws examined and rectified," the report said.</p>

<p><strong>Radical Reform</strong></p>

<p>Hallett made 10 recommendations, saying preparation for a civil emergency should be treated the same way as a threat from a hostile state.</p>

<p>"There must be radical reform. Never again can a disease be allowed to lead to so many deaths and so much suffering," she said in her introduction to the report.</p>

<p>Her inquiry's first module has only examined Britain's preparedness, and later reports will provide assessments of the more politically charged issues of decision-making during the pandemic against a backdrop of widespread accusations of government incompetence.</p>

<p>Johnson himself was forced from office in July 2022, with revelations of parties during COVID lockdowns among the many scandals that ended his premiership. A parliamentary committee later concluded he had misled lawmakers over the parties.</p>

<p>Rishi Sunak, the finance minister during the pandemic who later became prime minister, was also fined for breaking lockdown rules at the time.</p>

<p>"We know that for lives to be saved in the future, lessons must be learnt from the mistakes of the past," Brenda Doherty said on behalf of the campaign group COVID-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK ahead of the report's release.</p>

<p>"Sadly, nobody knows the true cost of the government's failure to prepare as we do."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli archaeologists working in the Judean Desert found the earliest evidence of Biblical scarlet dye, the Israel Antiquities Authority announced on Thursday.</p>

<p>The rare textile, 3,800-years-old and less than two cm in size, was uncovered in the "Cave of Skulls" northeast of Jerusalem during excavations aimed at preserving heritage finds and preventing antiquities theft. The woolen weft threads were dyed red, while the linen warp threads remained uncolored.</p>

<p>Carbon-14 analysis dated the textile to the Middle Bronze Age (1767-1954 BCE).</p>

<p>According to a new joint study of the Israel Antiquities Authority, Bar-Ilan University and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the textile's scarlet color was produced from the oak scale insects, which the researchers identify with the Biblical scarlet worm Tola'at Hashani.</p>

<p>The scarlet-red color, mentioned in the Bible alongside royal blue tekheilet and purple argaman, is considered one of the ancient world's most precious and expensive dyes, which were used -- according to the biblical commandment -- to dye the fabrics of the Tabernacle and the priestly garments.</p>

<p>Using advanced analytical methods, including High-Performance Liquid Chromatography to identify the dye's origin, the researchers concluded that the red hue came from the Kermes vermilio species, known for producing kermesic acid, which imparts the distinctive red color.</p>

<p>The findings were recently published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports.</p>

<p>"In ancient times, the dye was produced from the female scale insect, which lives on the kermes oak tree (Quercus coccifera)," explained Dr. Na'ama Sukenik, Curator of the Organic Material Collection at the Israel Antiquities Authority.</p>

<p>"Collecting these kermes was done in a very short window of time - one month out of the year, in the summer, after the female laid her eggs but before they hatched-- when the amount of dye was greatest. The short period in which the kermes could be collected, the difficulty in finding them due to their small size, between 3-8 mm, and their camouflage colours -- that make it difficult to locate them," Sukenik added.</p>

<p>The amount of dye that could be produced from the eggs was limited, she explained, but "the beautiful scarlet hue that can be produced from them for dyeing textiles made their use highly prestigious."</p>

<p>The discovery also underscores the interconnectedness of ancient societies. Despite the presence of a native species of a scale insect in Israel capable of producing a red-orange colour, the researchers found that the textile's dye came from a species common in the central and eastern Mediterranean region, indicating extensive trade networks, the researchers said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new video with a graphical reticule shows US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's head in the middle of what would have been the sniper's crosshair.</p>

<p>The video shows Mr Trump's tilting his head to look at a screen graphic and leaning into the microphone saved his life, according to a post on X by US journalist Mario Nawfal, whose 'The Roundtable Show' is billed as the biggest example of citizen journalism.</p>

<p>"New footage shows Trump dodging a perfectly aimed shot. Close-up footage reveals Thomas Crook's shot was perfectly centred on Trump's head... The footage was captured just seconds before the shot," Mr Nawfal said in the post.</p>

<p>The US Department of Homeland Security is investigating the Secret Service's handling of security at the campaign rally where the gunman tried to assassinate Mr Trump.</p>

<p>The Secret Service has faced intense scrutiny since Saturday's shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, during which a gunman opened fire on the Republican presidential candidate from an exposed rooftop some 150 metres away from the stage where Mr Trump was speaking.</p>

<p>Mr Trump was wounded in the ear and a rally attendee was killed. The 20-year-old gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was shot dead by Secret Service snipers.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden has ordered an independent review of the Secret Service's handling of the assassination attempt, which is also being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as a case of potential domestic terrorism.</p>

<p>The Secret Service is responsible for the safety of the US president, vice president and former presidents, and their families, as well as major election candidates and visiting foreign heads of state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Russian court on Thursday sentenced U.S. citizen Michael Travis Leake to 13 years in prison on drug smuggling charges, Moscow's court service said in a statement.</p>

<p>Leake, a musician and former U.S. paratrooper who was arrested in June 2023, was found guilty of selling drugs on a large scale, the court service said.</p>

<p>It was not clear how he pleaded and Reuters was not able to contact his lawyer.</p>

<p>Leake is one of about a dozen Americans currently held in Russian detention. Washington urges its citizens to leave Russia immediately, citing the threat of arrest and harassment amid the highest tensions between the two countries since the Cold War.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the U.S. embassy in Moscow did not immediately reply to a request for comment on his conviction.</p>

<p>Another American, Robert Romanov Woodland, was sentenced by a Russian court to 12-1/2 years for drug smuggling earlier this month.</p>

<p>Leake was convicted alongside another defendant, a woman. The pair were shown standing in a court cage in brief videos published by the court service. Leake listened to the proceedings with a grim expression, at one point shaking his head.</p>

<p>Leake, who is in his early 50's, is a former songwriter in the rock band "Lovi Noch" ("Catch the Night"). He also previously worked as an English teacher in Moscow and helped translate songs for Russian bands.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of 60 rare Siamese crocodiles have hatched in Cambodia, boosting hopes for one of the world's most endangered reptiles, conservationists said Thursday.</p>

<p>Five Siamese crocodile nests were discovered in Cambodia's Cardamom National Park in mid-May, the country's environment and agriculture ministry said in a joint statement with conservation group Fauna and Flora.</p>

<p>The nests contained 106 eggs, of which 66 were fertilised, and a total of 60 Siamese crocodile eggs successfully hatched between June 27 and 30, the ministry said.</p>

<p>"This discovery indicates that the area is a key habitat for natural crocodiles, providing hope for the species' recovery," they said in the statement.</p>

<p>Researchers say there are approximately 1,000 Siamese crocodiles worldwide, including around 300 individuals in the wild in Cambodia.</p>

<p>Their survival is threatened by poachers who supply eggs and adult reptiles to crocodile farms around the region, where their skins are turned into luxury belts, shoes, and handbags.</p>

<p>Cambodian environment minister Eang Sophalleth said it was a source of "pride" that the country is home to some of the world's rarest species, pledging continued efforts to "preserve biodiversity."</p>

<p>Deforestation and poaching have devastated many species in Cambodia, one of Asia's poorest and most corrupt nations.</p>

<p>In its haste to develop, the government has been criticised for allowing firms to clear hundreds of thousands of hectares of forest land -- including in protected zones -- for everything from rubber and sugar cane plantations to hydropower dams.</p>

<p>The successful mass hatching shows the vital importance" of protecting the Cardamom National Park, said Pablo Sinovas, country director of the Fauna &amp; Flora Cambodia programme.</p>

<p>"With only a few hundred individuals estimated in the wild, the hatching of 60 new crocodiles is a tremendous boost," Sinovas added.</p>

<p>Siamese crocodiles grow up to three metres in length and the Mekong River basin and wetlands in Cambodia appear to hold the only remaining wild populations, according to conservation group WWF.</p>

<p>They are listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>United States President Joe Biden has made numerous verbal stumbles and gaffes over the years. From verbal slip-ups to near-fall incidents, Mr Biden, whose age is often targeted by opposition leaders and remains a concern for voters, has had all. With US elections just around the corner, questions about the US President's fitness to serve four more years - or win November's election - continue to swirl. Amid this, a video of Mr Biden appearing to have difficulty getting into his vehicle after exiting Air Force One on Wednesday is <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/JordanUhl/status/1813784758201332150">going viral on social media</a>.</p>

<p>The incident occurred after Mr Biden said that he would be "isolating as I recover" after testing positive for coronavirus. He previously cancelled a scheduled appearance at the UnidosUS Annual Conference in Las Vegas. The President also gave the media the thumbs up from his limousine and said "I feel good" following the diagnosis.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/17/statement-from-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-3/">White House</a> said he was suffering from a runny nose, cough and "general malaise," was taking Covid medication, and was flying straight to isolation at his beach house in Rehoboth, Delaware. "He is vaccinated and boosted and he is experiencing mild symptoms. He will be returning to Delaware where he will self-isolate and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time," spokesperson Jean-Pierre said.</p>

<p>Further, his doctor also stated that he was suffering from a runny nose and a "non-productive cough" along with "general malaise. "His symptoms remain mild, his respiratory rate is normal at 16, his temperature is normal at 97.8 and his pulse oximetry is normal at 97 per cent," the White House note added.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the 81-year-old said that he would consider dropping his troubled re-election bid if he was diagnosed with a serious medical condition. He told the media outlet BET, "If I had some medical condition that emerged, if somebody, if the doctors came and said 'you've got this problem, that problem'."<br />

<p>Crooks reportedly also had images of both Donald Trump and President Biden on his phone and had searched the dates for the Democratic National Convention and Trump's Pennsylvania rally, The<a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/18/us-news/trumps-would-be-assassin-thomas-crooks-wrote-chilling-online-post-foreshadowing-rally-shooting-report/ "> NYPost </a>reported.</p>

<p>Investigators are analysing the shooter's phones and computer to determine the motive behind the assassination attempt. While they have explored the gunman's search history, they have not yet determined his political affiliation, despite his registration as a Republican.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The shooter reportedly had two cell phones, one found near his body and another at his home with only 27 contacts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Law enforcement sources report that snipers spotted Crooks on a roof with a rifle at 5:52 pm, but he didn't start firing until 6:12 pm. This means a 20-minute delay occurred between the time Crooks was first seen and the start of the shooting.</p>

<p>After Crooks fired at Donald Trump, the Secret Service shot him dead within 26 seconds. The former president survived with just a minor injury to his ear.</p>

<p>The gunshots, fired by an AR-style rifle, killed a 50-year-old father of two girls and injured two others.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sources told the NYPost that&nbsp;Crooks was identified as a person of interest a full hour before the shooting occurred. He had driven to&nbsp;Trump's rally on Saturday with a bunch of suspicious items in his car – a remote control transmitter, a detonator and an improvised metal explosive device connected to a receiver in his trunk – which suggested that he may have planned to cause a distraction or a diversion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the days leading up to the attack, Crooks visited a <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/trump-shooter-went-to-shooting-range-day-before-assassination-attempt-report-6126076 ">shooting</a> range, and also stopped at Home Depot and a gun store, where he purchased 50 rounds of ammunition and a 5-foot ladder.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The bill, called Content Origin Protection and Integrity from Edited and Deepfaked Media Act (COPIED ACT), has strong support across the US political spectrum.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States has introduced a bill aimed at tackling AI deepfakes and protecting original content from being used for AI training last week.</p>

<p>The bill, called Content Origin Protection and Integrity from Edited and Deepfaked Media Act (COPIED ACT), has strong support across the US political spectrum.</p>

<p>Last Month, another senate bill dubbed "Take It Down Act '' was tabled, advocating the removal of AI deepfakes specific to non-consensual intimate imagery.</p>

<p>Notably, several controversies including Taylor Swift's AI generated deepfake nude images went viral on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram in January, sparking a nationwide debate on the ills of AI technology.</p>

<p>Apart from addressing deepfakes, COPIED Act will also address the concerns of content creators, journalists, artists and musicians that AI has been profiting off of their work, without acknowledgement or paying deserved compensation.</p>

<p>Last month, a report from Forbes accused Perplexity AI - an AI enabled search engine- of stealing its content. This was followed by an investigation by a New York based technology magazine called Wired that found Perplexity was summarising its articles despite the Robot Exclusion Protocol being in place, trespassing into areas of their website designated as off-limits to search bots.</p>

<h3><strong>How will the COPIED Act work?</strong></h3>

<p>The COPIED act will enable a mechanism whereby provisions will be made for a digital document called "content provenance information" that is akin to a logbook for all content- news articles, artistic expressions, images or videos- which will ensure authentication and detection of all AI generated content.</p>

<p>It also seeks provisions for making it illegal to tamper with this information, helping journalists and creative artists to safeguard their work from AI. Additionally, the bill would empower state officials to enforce the bill, creating an avenue to sue AI companies for removing the watermark or using the content without consent and compensation.</p>

<h3><strong>How are other countries regulating AI?</strong></h3>

<p>The European Union (EU) has one of the most comprehensive legislations in place for regulating AI. In contrast to the US approach, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act requires European states to take a proactive role and classify each AI system into four categories based on risk levels- Unacceptable Risk, High-Risk AI, Limited-Risk AI, and Minimal-Risk AI.</p>

<p>AI systems like those used in China for ascribing a social score to each citizen have been identified to be unacceptable risk levels and prohibited under the act.</p>

<p>In India, although a specific AI regulatory law has not been made yet, a Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology directive in March had mandated AI systems labelled as "under-tested" or "unreliable" to seek government approval before deploying. The directive was later overridden by another one, reversing the mandate, in a move that signalled caution to not affect innovation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Arrested in Moldova, Chkhikvishvili recruited others for violent acts and disseminated a manifesto promoting terrorism and ethnic cleansing.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michail Chkhikvishvili, a neo-Nazi leader from Georgia, was indicted this week on charges of soliciting hate crimes and planning acts of mass violence in New York City. He intended to carry out a New Year's Eve attack involving Santa Claus distributing poisoned candy to racial minorities and Jewish children in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>As per a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/georgian-national-charged-soliciting-hate-crimes-and-mass-casualty-attack-new-york">US government release</a>, Chkhikvishvili was arrested in Chisinau, Moldova, on July 6, 2024, pursuant to an Interpol Wanted Person Diffusion, which was issued based on a criminal complaint. Chkhikvishvili is alleged to be a leader of the Maniac Murder Cult, also known as "Maniacs Murder Cult," "Maniacs: Cult of Killing," "MKY," "MMC," and "MKU," an international racially or ethnically motivated violent extremist group.</p>

<p>Chkhikvishvili allegedly recruited others for violent acts, including planning a mass attack in NYC with an undercover officer posing as a recruit. US Attorney Breon Peace, Assistant AG Matthew Olsen, and FBI's Christie Curtis announced the charges.</p>

<p>"As alleged, the defendant sought to recruit others to commit violent attacks and killings in furtherance of his Neo-Nazi ideologies," stated United States Attorney Peace. "His goal was to spread hatred, fear, and destruction by encouraging bombings, arson, and even poisoning children for the purpose of harming racial minorities, the Jewish community, and homeless individuals. We will not hesitate to find and prosecute those who threaten the safety and freedoms of all members of our community, including members of minority communities, no matter where in the world these criminals might be hiding."</p>

<p>The government report stated Chkhikvishvili led MKY, an international extremist group with a Neo-Nazi ideology promoting violence against minorities. MKY aims to disrupt social order through terrorism, with members in the United States and abroad.</p>

<p>Since September 2021, Chkhikvishvili has distributed the "Hater's Handbook" to MKY members, promoting MKY's principles and urging mass violence. The manifesto includes Chkhikvishvili's claims of killing for the white race and encourages school shootings, using children for suicide bombings, and other attacks against racial minorities. It outlines strategies for terror attacks, such as targeting large events and crowded streets, specifically in the United States.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A two-year-old Arizona toddler's life was cut short after she was left in a car for over three hours, while her father got "distracted" playing video games. Parker Scholtes' dad, Christopher Scholtes, 37, is now facing a murder charge.</p>

<p>Christopher, a father of three, claimed he left the kid in the car for only 30 minutes because he did not want to wake her up after they returned from shopping.</p>

<p>However, court documents and surveillance footage tell a different story. He left her inside their 2023 Acura MDX for more than three hours in the Arizona heat while he played video games on his PlayStation inside their home.</p>

<p>Christopher's wife, a doctor, returned home and discovered the little girl's lifeless body in the car, reported <a href="http://https://www.kplctv.com/2024/07/16/father-may-have-been-distracted-by-playstation-when-toddler-died-hot-car/ ">KPLCTV</a>.</p>

<p>Christopher told police he arrived at their home around 2:30 pm and parked outside because the garage was cluttered with exercise equipment. He claimed he forgot Parker was still in her car seat until Erika, his wife, came home at 4 pm and discovered their daughter's body. However, surveillance footage shows he arrived shortly after 12:30 pm, leaving Parker in the car in 109-degree weather for over three hours.</p>

<p>According to the complaint, Christopher "got distracted playing his game and putting his food away." He admitted to leaving the air conditioning on for Parker but knew it would shut off automatically after 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his other two children told police their dad regularly left all three siblings alone in the car while he was in the house. Text messages between Christopher and his wife also reveal a history of similar incidents. "I told you to stop leaving them in the car," Erika's text to her husband read. "How many times have I told you?"</p>

<p>In court on Friday, when Christopher was charged with murder and child endangerment, Erika pleaded with the judge to release her otherwise "perfect" husband, calling the death of their child "a big mistake."</p>

<p>She requested that her husband be allowed to return home to support their family during a difficult time and said that the recent incident does not define her husband's character. “I just want the girls to see their father – that I don't have to tell them tonight that they're going to have to endure another loss,” she pleaded, as per the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/16/us-news/christopher-scholtes-distracted-by-playstation-while-daughter-2-died-in-hot-car/ ">NY Post.</a></p>

<p>Authorities have since charged Christopher Scholtes with murder and the judge set bail at $25,000, despite the prosecution's request for a $1 million bond.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Usha Chilukuri Vance, the wife of Donald Trump's vice presidential running mate, has a great-aunt in southern India, aged 96, celebrated in local media as the country's oldest active professor.</p>

<p>Academic achievement marks the family of US-born Vance, notably Shanthamma Chilukuri, who still travels 60 km (40 miles) most weekdays to university to teach physics.</p>

<p>"Most of our family is academically strong and education has been a top priority," Chilukuri told Reuters by phone from the city of Visakhapatnam.</p>

<p>Usha Vance, 38, made her debut on the U.S. national political stage on Wednesday when she introduced her husband, U.S. Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.</p>

<p>"I got to know about Usha's husband being named as a vice president candidate and of course, we are happy as a family," Chilukuri told Reuters by phone from the city of Visakhapatnam.</p>

<p>In his memoir "Hillbilly Elegy", Vance calls his wife a "supersmart daughter of Indian immigrants" whom he met at Yale Law School.</p>

<p>The parents of Usha Vance moved to the U.S. in the late 1970s and now teach engineering and molecular biology in San Diego.</p>

<p>While Usha Vance studied at Yale and Cambridge, her father and grandfather both taught or studied at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), India's premier engineering college. Her younger sister is a mechanical engineer with a semiconductor company in San Diego and her aunt a medical professional in the southern Indian city of Chennai.</p>

<p>The family is originally from a village called Vadduru in Andhra Pradesh state but moved to Chennai when Usha Vance's paternal grandfather, Ramasastry Chilukuri, went to teach at the IIT there around the time it was set up in 1959, members of the family said. The IIT now runs a student award in the memory of Ramasastry, who used to teach physics.</p>

<p>The family, which is Hindu, is also deeply religious.</p>

<p>Shanthamma Chilukuri said many in the family were well-versed in ancient texts like Upanishads and Vedas. She has authored a book on verses from the Bhagavad Gita, one of Hinduism's holiest books.</p>

<p>Senator Vance told Fox News in June that his wife had helped him "re-engage" with his Christian faith.</p>

<p>Sitting by him during the interview, Usha Vance said: "I did grow up in a religious household. My parents are Hindu and that is one of the things that made them such good parents, that made them really good people. And so I have seen the power of that."</p>

<p>Usha Vance was a law clerk to U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts and later became an attorney at U.S. law firm Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson LLP. She resigned after J.D. Vance was named as the Republican vice presidential candidate.</p>

<p>A close India-based family member who attended their wedding in Kentucky in 2014 attributed Usha Vance's success to "the mindset that one must accomplish something, have degrees from top institutes".</p>

<p>"Our family WhatsApp group is flooded with messages ever since J.D. Vance's name was announced," said the family member, who did not want to be named to avoid public attention as interest in the family spikes in the media. "I sent her a congratulatory message and conveyed my best wishes. She was also elated."</p>

<p>Usha Vance's parents and her sister in the United States did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Indian media have hailed her as the latest among several Americans with roots in India rising to fame, including U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and former Republican presidential hopefuls Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy, who was J.D. and Usha Vance's classmate at Yale Law.</p>

<p>In a 2020 Netflix movie based on J.D. Vance's memoir, Usha Vance's character describes how her father started from scratch when he first moved to the United States.</p>

<p>"He came here with nothing," said the character played by Freida Pinto, an Indian actor who rose to fame as the female lead in Oscar-winning "Slumdog Millionaire". "He had to just find his way."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

</div>

<p>Even before the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, American politics was churning. But after the dramatic developments of last week, it's spinning in a way few could have foreseen. Even as President Joe Biden is getting weaker by the day, Trump seems to be gaining an unstoppable momentum. As per internal polling of the Democrats, Biden is losing ground to Trump in 14 key states, including the five that Biden won in 2020 - &nbsp;Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. His numbers are shaky in Colorado, Minnesota, Maine, New Mexico, Virginia and New Hampshire after his disastrous debate performance.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party remains badly divided with growing fears among its rank and file that, in light of the debate, Biden is in no position to defeat Trump and that he will leave other Democrats on the ballot in November vulnerable too. Voices are growing within the Party asking Biden to step aside, with senior party officials like Rep. Adam Schiff of California making an open case that "a second Trump presidency will undermine the very foundation of our democracy, and I have serious concerns about whether the President can defeat Donald Trump in November". Biden is fighting back but is struggling in convincing his own party about his suitability for the top job.</p>

<h2><strong>The GOP Convention</strong></h2>

<p>His opponent, meanwhile, is basking in the glory of a convention where his past critics are now coming together to anoint him as the party's nominee more formally. All those like Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis and Marco Rubio, who till a few months back were targeting Trump at the Republican primaries, have now ended up endorsing him unequivocally. Trump with a bandage over his ears and his supporters shouting "Fight, fight, fight!" at the Republican National Convention is a powerful imagery for a nation that a few days back was debating the suitability of a candidate who incited the January 6 insurrection at Capitol Hill. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The confusion in the Republican party was apparent when after J.D. Vance, a former Never Trumper who had, in 2016, wondered whether Trump might be "America's Hitler", was confirmed as the Republican Party's vice presidential nominee. He faced racist attacks from far-right commentators because of his wife's Indian heritage. The upholders of the 'Make America Great Again' movement are finding it difficult to reconcile Vance's multicultural family with their core agenda of anti-immigration.</p>

<h2><strong>Fundamental Challenges</strong></h2>

<p>Political polarisation in the US has led to some fundamental challenges being faced by both the Republicans and the Democrats. The demonisation of the other side has led to a situation where even after an assassination attempt, vitriol continues to flow and there is no attempt at reconciliation.</p>

<p>Though the theme of the Republican convention this week is about unity, there is no place in today's Republican rank and file for those who have a different vision for the US than Trump's. Any challenge to Trump is about challenging the party as the former president has ensured that the Republican Party today is more reflective of his views than a broad tent organisation.</p>

<p>After the assassination attempt on Trump, Vance wrote: "Today is not just some isolated incident. The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination." Trump's own role in vitiating the political climate in the US has been conveniently forgotten by his supporters.</p>

<p>Though President Biden called on the Americans last week to rein in the political debate, arguing that "[It] must never be a battlefield and, God forbid, a killing field", and warning that "no matter how strong our convictions, we must never descend into violence", it's not readily evident if anyone is listening. Trump's ability to tap into the sense of grievance and persecution felt by middle America has thwarted any attempt by the Biden administration and the Democrats more generally to craft a political narrative that can shift the momentum in their favour. And now after the attack on Trump, it has become even more difficult as the image of a defiant former President with blood streaked across his face stands in stark contrast to a fumbling feeble Biden unable to articulate a coherent thought.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
November is still far away. Even a day is a long time in politics. The Democratic Party can still regroup and present a serious challenge to Trump. But there is no denying the fact that the last two weeks have upended the US Presidential elections in fundamental ways and will leave a strong mark on American politics whichever way the political winds blow in the coming days.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden, who has tested positive for Covid for a third time, was reportedly been told by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that he could destroy the Democrats' chances of winning elections in November, due to his age.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old President has responded to Pelosi that he still has a chance of winning the presidential race, according to a report by CNN. One of their sources has mentioned Biden getting defensive about the upcoming polls in response.</p>

<p>The California Representative had reportedly asked Biden's Senior Advisor Mike Donilon to connect her with the President on a call, which would mark the second conversation between the two since Biden's poor performance in the debate with Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Although Pelosi seems to have stopped fully backing Biden, it is not known yet whether she thinks that he should withdraw from the race altogether. In an interview last week, she said, "It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short."</p>

<p>On the other hand, she took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) after the assassination attempt on Trump, writing, "As one whose family has been the victim of political violence, I know first-hand that political violence of any kind has no place in our society. I thank God that former President Trump is safe."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">As one whose family has been the victim of political violence, I know firsthand that political violence of any kind has no place in our society. I thank God that former President Trump is safe.<br />
<br />
As we learn more details about this horrifying incident, let us pray that all those…</p>

<p>A Pelosi spokesperson has also reportedly told CNN that she has not spoken to Biden since Friday.</p>

<p>One of the Democratic Party's leading fundraisers, actor George Clooney had said last week that Biden cannot win against time. Clooney said, "Top Democrats -- Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi -- and senators, representatives and other candidates who face losing in November need to ask this president to voluntarily step aside."</p>

<p>Biden had recently slammed Trump for joking about Pelosi's husband being attacked with a hammer, by a far-right conspiracy theorist in 2022, when she was the House Speaker.</p>

<p>"If I had some medical condition that emerged, if somebody, if the doctors came and said 'you've got this problem, that problem,'" Biden told the Black media outlet BET in an interview on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Biden testing positive for Covid today, amid pressure for him to withdraw from the White House race due to his age and mental acuity, makes the situation all the more tense in an already polarised nation ahead of the elections in November.</p>

<p>The instance of Biden mistakenly referring to Vice President Kamala Harris as Trump at his solo press conference has also added to doubts over his fitness as the US Presidential Candidate due to his age.</p>

<p>The last two weeks, especially after his disastrous performance in the presidential debate with Trump have seen Biden standing at a chance of losing celebrity support and key endorsers such as Teamsters. Meanwhile, Trump has regained the support of some of his key rivals including Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, and Vivek Ramaswamy at the Republican Convention following his assassination bid.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden has tested positive for Covid-19. The diagnosis, which came with mild symptoms, has been leveraged by his campaign team to target his principal political rival Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old Democrat, who is currently isolated at his beach home in Delaware, took to social media to announce his diagnosis, quipping "I'm sick" before following up with a tongue-in-cheek remark aimed at Musk and his wealthy associates, accusing them of attempting to "buy this election."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I'm sick</p>
— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1813715902250017022?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 17, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Musk has pledged roughly $45 million each month to a new fund backing Trump for US president.</p>

<p>President Biden's health issues have raised concerns about his fitness for office, particularly among Democrats. A recent poll conducted by the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research indicated that nearly two-thirds of respondents believe Biden should step down.</p>

<p>The president's illness has also sparked a heated debate within the Democratic Party, with prominent figures like Representative Adam Schiff and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urging Biden to "pass the torch. Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries have reportedly expressed concerns to Biden that his candidacy may jeopardise the party's electoral prospects.</p>

<p>Despite these developments, Biden remains adamant in his pursuit of reelection insisting that Democratic voters support him. &nbsp;White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre assured the public that Biden, who is vaccinated and boosted, continues to fulfil his presidential duties while in isolation. Dr Kevin O'Connor, Biden's physician, confirmed that the president's symptoms remain mild.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Republican National Convention is currently taking place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, featuring notable appearances from Donald Trump, JD Vance, and other conservative leaders.</p>

<p>However, the unexpected star this year is not a governor, senator, or presidential candidate, but a chubby bulldog.</p>

<p>Babydog, the pet of West Virginia Governor Jim Justice, has gained viral fame online for her calm demeanour during her owner's speech.</p>

<p>Relaxing on a black leather armchair, the English Bulldog appeared content in front of an audience of hundreds of politicians.</p>

<p>Governor Justice, a major speaker at the convention, made sure to mention his four-legged companion in his remarks.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea's supreme court on Thursday upheld a ruling that a same-sex partner was eligible for spousal benefits from state health insurance, a move hailed as a win for LGBTQ rights in a country that has lagged others in the region.</p>

<p>The court confirmed a landmark decision by the Seoul High Court early last year that the National Health Insurance Service should provide equal spousal coverage to So Sung-wook and Kim Yong-min - a gay couple who filed a suit in 2021 against the agency after it cancelled their spousal benefits.</p>

<p>"I couldn't believe when I heard the ruling. I was extremely happy and I started crying," Kim told Reuters outside the court.</p>

<p>"It took four years to earn this dependent status," he said. "We need to fight harder to legalize same-sex marriage going forward."</p>

<p>Chief Justice Jo Hee-de said that denying the couple benefits, even though there are no clauses in the National Health Insurance Act that specifically refer to same-sex unions, constituted discrimination based on sexual orientation.</p>

<p>"It is an act of discrimination that violates human dignity and value, the right to pursue happiness, freedom of privacy and the right to equality before the law, and the degree of violation is serious," Judge Jo told a televised trial.</p>

<p>So Kim refer to themselves as a married couple, but their marriage is not legally recognised in South Korea.</p>

<p>Lawyers and advocates said the ruling marks the first legal recognition of same-sex unions.</p>

<p>"With this ruling today, the legal status of same-sex couples will be recognised in the public system, so I think the existence of same-sex couples will become more visible," Chang Suh-yeon, one of the lawyers who represented the couple, told reporters.</p>

<p>While campaigns to legalize same-sex marriage have succeeded in Taiwan and Thailand, there is no legal acknowledgement of LGBTQ partnerships in South Korea, forcing couples to move abroad if they want to get married legally.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court's ruling is a "stepping stone for progress" towards marriage equality, said Horim Yi, an activist at the LGBTQ campaign group Marriage For All.</p>

<p>"It's going to be a very hopeful ruling for same-sex couples living in South Korea," Yi said.</p>

<p>Last year, the couple told Reuters they were being open about their story to help "change people's opinions and help other LGBTQ people like us gather up the courage".</p>

<p>Conservative religious groups in South Korea have mounted fierce resistance to efforts to pass laws promoting LGBTQ rights, prompting many people to hide their identity in the workplace as they struggle for equal recognition and acceptance.</p>

<p>Ahead of the ruling, members of conservative Christian groups held a rally outside the court, waving a banner reading "Same-sex families are nonsense. Supreme Court, overturn the Seoul High Court's ruling!"</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[AI drone development in Ukraine is broadly split between visual systems helping identify targets and fly drones into them, terrain mapping for navigation, and more complex programmes enabling UAVs to operate in interconnected "swarms"]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Ukraine, a handful of startups are developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems to help fly a vast fleet of drones, taking warfare into uncharted territory as combatants race to gain a technological edge in battle.</p>

<p>Ukraine hopes a rollout of AI-enabled drones across the front line will help it overcome increasing signal jamming by the Russians as well as enable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to work in larger groups.</p>

<p>AI drone development in Ukraine is broadly split between visual systems helping identify targets and fly drones into them, terrain mapping for navigation, and more complex programmes enabling UAVs to operate in interconnected "swarms".</p>

<p>One company working on this is Swarmer, which is developing software that links drones in a network. Decisions can be implemented instantly across the group, with a human only stepping in to green-light automated strikes.</p>

<p>"When you try to scale up (with human pilots), it just doesn't work," Swarmer CEO Serhiy Kupriienko told Reuters in the company's Kyiv offices. "For a swarm of 10 or 20 drones or robots, it's virtually impossible for humans to manage them."</p>

<p>Swarmer is one of more than 200 tech firms that have sprung up since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, with civilians from IT backgrounds developing drones and other devices to help Ukraine counter a much larger enemy.</p>

<p>Kupriienko said that while human pilots struggled to run operations involving more than five drones, AI would be able to process hundreds.</p>

<p>The system, called Styx, directs a web of reconnaissance and strike drones, both large and small, in the air and on the ground. Every drone would be able to plan its own moves and predict the behaviour of the others in the swarm, he said.</p>

<p>As well as scaling up operations, Kupriienko said automation would help protect drone pilots who operate close to the front lines and are a priority target for enemy fire.</p>

<p>Swarmer's technology is still under development and has only been trialled on the battlefield experimentally, he added.</p>

<p>Samuel Bendett, Adjunct Senior Fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said AI drone control systems would likely need a human in the loop to prevent the system making errors in target selection.</p>

<p>There are broad concerns about the ethics of weapons that exclude human judgment. A 2020 European Parliament research paper warned that such systems could commit violations of international humanitarian law and lower the threshold of going to war.</p>

<p>AI is already being used in some of Ukraine's long-range drone strikes which target military facilities and oil refineries hundreds of kilometres inside Russia.</p>

<p>One Ukrainian official, speaking anonymously, told Reuters that the attacks sometimes involve a swarm of about 20 drones.</p>

<p>The core drones fly to the target, but it is the job of others to take out or distract air defences along the way. To do this, they use a form of AI with human oversight to help spot targets or threats and plan possible routes, the source added.</p>

<h3><strong>SIGNAL JAMMING</strong></h3>

<p>The need for AI-enabled drones is becoming more pressing as both sides roll out Electronic Warfare (EW) systems that disrupt signals between pilots and drones.</p>

<p>Small, cheap, FPV (first person view) drones in particular, which became the main way for both sides to hit enemy vehicles in 2023, are seeing their hit rates fall as jamming increases.</p>

<p>"We are already working with the concept that in the near future, there will be no connection on the front line" between pilot and UAV, said Max Makarchuk, the AI lead for Brave1, a defence tech accelerator set up by the Ukrainian government.</p>

<p>According to Makarchuk, the percentage of FPVs that hit their target is constantly falling. Most FPV units now see a strike rate of 30-50%, while for new pilots that can be as low as 10%.</p>

<p>He predicted that AI-operated FPV drones could post hit rates of around 80%.</p>

<p>To counter the EW threat, makers including Swarmer have started developing functions which allow a drone to lock onto a target through its camera.</p>

<p>EW systems form an invisible signal-jamming dome over the equipment and soldiers which they protect.</p>

<p>If a pilot's contact with the drone is cut, they can no longer control it and the craft either plummets to the ground or continues flying straight on.</p>

<p>Automating the final part of a drone's flight to its target means that it no longer needs the pilot - thus nullifying the effect of the EW's jamming.</p>

<p>AI-enabled drones have been in development for years but had hitherto been seen as expensive and experimental.</p>

<p>Bendett said Russia had been developing AI-enabled aerial and ground drones before the 2022 invasion and had claimed some successes.</p>

<p>In Ukraine, the key task for manufacturers is to produce an AI targeting system for drones which is cheap. That would allow it to be deployed en masse along the entire 1,000 km (621 mile) front line, where thousands of FPV drones are used up each week.</p>

<p>Costs can be brought down by running AI programmes on a Raspberry Pi, a small, cheap computer which has found global popularity outside the educational purposes it was designed for.</p>

<p>Makarchuk said he estimated the cost of putting in a simple targeting system, which would lock onto a shape visible to the drone's camera, at only about $150 per drone.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After obliterating his Republican rivals, becoming the first former president convicted of a crime, and surviving an assassination attempt, Donald Trump caps off a crazy year with his coronation as the Republican Party's presidential nominee.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump the victor&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>From the first night of the 2024 primaries -- the Iowa caucuses -- Donald Trump dominated the competition.</p>

<p>The former president was thought to be in political trouble just a few months earlier given his mounting legal problems, but he easily clinched victory in the Midwest state.</p>

<p>Though several Republican hopefuls had campaigned across the state's rural agricultural landscape, Trump walked away with victories in 98 of Iowa's 99 counties.</p>

<p>The only one who stayed in the race after that night was Nikki Haley, the former UN ambassador and South Carolina governor.</p>

<p>Though she tried to define herself as a moderate alternative to Trump, she eventually dropped out in early March after Trump claimed more than a dozen primary victories on "Super Tuesday."</p>

<h3><strong>Trump the convict&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>After weeks spent in court during his highly publicized hush money trial, Trump was found guilty on May 30 on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up payments made to a former porn star.</p>

<p>The historic verdict was a blow to Trump, who became the only former president to have been convicted on criminal charges.</p>

<p>Sentencing in the case had been scheduled for July 11, but a recent ruling by the Supreme Court regarding presidential immunity has delayed the hearing until the fall.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump the survivor&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>On July 13, Trump was on stage for a campaign rally in Pennsylvania when shots rang out.</p>

<p>A 20-year-old man had climbed onto the roof of a nearby building and aimed for the former president, who was wounded in his right ear.</p>

<p>As spectators ducked on the ground, the US Secret Service rushed to protect Trump, who raised his fist in the air with blood dripping down his face.</p>

<p>Photos of the scene immediately spread around the globe.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump the nominee&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Less than 24 hours after the attempt on his life, Trump landed in Milwaukee for the Republican National Convention.</p>

<p>Unlike the chaos of the 2016 convention, however, Trump reigns as the head of his party, with former rivals spending all week singing his praises on stage.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Trump will accept the Republican nomination for president in the November general election, which, according to polls, he is well on the way to winning -- the culmination of a landmark year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Caden Schaefer-Rose will only just be 18 by the time of November's US election, but he is determined to cast his very first presidential vote -- for Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The high school student is among a growing number of teens defying liberal stereotypes of America's youngest voters and hopping aboard the Trump train.</p>

<p>"I feel like he reflects a lot of my personal values," Schaefer-Rose, wearing mirrored sunglasses, told AFP at a "Youth VoteFest" Wednesday near the Republican National Convention.</p>

<p>He first became aware of Trump in 2016, seeing him on television during that year's raucous campaign. Other young voters at the event said their first memory of Trump was seeing his cameo in "Home Alone 2," or as a brash boss in television's "The Apprentice."</p>

<p>"I kind of just connected with him," Schaefer-Rose said. "I was only eight years old at the time, but I could see that he was someone I could eventually look up to."</p>

<p>Same with Matthew Paley, a New Jersey 19-year-old who was playing corn hole outside the Republican convention arena.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><span class="ins_instory_span_credit">19-year-old Mathey Paley said he loves Trump's fight for what he believes in. Photo Credit: AFP</span></p>
</div>

<p>He met his idol Trump -- "very nice dude!" -- recently in Florida and fully backs the billionaire as he seeks a White House comeback.</p>

<p>"Honestly in the beginning... I just liked Trump because I thought he was hilarious," said Paley.</p>

<p>"Then once I started doing my research, I was like 'Oh wow, alright.'"</p>

<p>Paley said he embraces the same "core conservative values" as Trump, including gun rights.</p>

<p>"And I love that he has such a strong backbone and fights for what he believes in."</p>

<p>America's youth have traditionally voted Democratic, and for now they largely still do. But Republicans insist a shift is afoot.</p>

<p>Pew Research shows that in 2016, voters under 30 supported the Democratic Party ticket by a 30-point margin. By 2020, that advantage shrank to 24 points.</p>

<p>The youngest voters in particular are pivotal, as studies show college student voting is rising -- and Republicans are courting them like never before.</p>

<p>Trump's newly announced running mate, J.D. Vance, is just 39 years old, 20 years younger than Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>The party invited Amber Rose, a social media influencer with 24 million followers on Instagram, to address the convention, where she endorsed Trump Monday.</p>

<p>And in a bid to attract young Black voters, rapper Forgiato Blow made an appearance.</p>

<h3><strong>'Limit your dreams'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Charlie Kirk, who founded the youth-oriented grassroots conservative group Turning Point USA when he was just 18, took the convention stage this week claiming Biden's message to Gen Z is to "limit your dreams (and) be content with less."</p>

<p>"Donald Trump refuses to accept this fake, pathetic, mutilated version of the American dream," Kirk, 30, said to huge applause.</p>

<p>"This is why young men are the most conservative that they have been in 50 years."</p>

<p>Xavier Starks, an African-American high schooler in Wisconsin who turns 18 in August, said he is considering voting for Trump.</p>

<p>"I feel like Trump did do good things, but the way he's trying to run and saying 'I'm a dictator,' and how he's going to conduct himself, I don't know about that," Starks told AFP at the youth symposium.</p>

<p>The fact a convicted felon will be on the ballot is "pretty insane," he said. But Biden, 81, is "so old."</p>

<p>Well-informed young conservatives cite America's soaring national debt, shrinking home ownership prospects, bloated interest rates, and illegal immigration as reasons to back Trump.</p>

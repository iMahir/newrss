       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prosecutors are preparing to retry Harvey Weinstein on rape charges after a previous conviction against the former Hollywood producer was overturned.</p>

<p>Weinstein, who is currently at New York's Rikers Island prison, was rushed to Bellevue Hospital on Sunday to undergo emergency heart surgery after experiencing severe chest pains.</p>

<p>His lawyers are expected in court on Thursday. However, it is unclear whether he will present as his lawyers have said he has health problems.</p>

<p>The judge overseeing the case has set November 12 as a tentative trial date.</p>

<p>The 72-year-old is serving a 16-year sentence after being convicted on rape charges by a California court. He had also been found guilty of the rape and sexual assault of actor Jessica Mann and of forcibly performing oral sex on production assistant Miriam Haley by a New York court in February 2020.</p>

<p>But the New York Court of Appeals overturned the conviction in April, saying that Weinstein did not get a fair trial because a judge allowed testimony by accusers he was not formally charged with assaulting.</p>

<p>This was one of the defining cases of the Me Too movement. Weinstein has denied any non consensual sexual encounters with anyone.</p>

<p>At a July hearing, prosecutors with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said they intend to bring new charges for "additional violent sexual assaults" of more women who have agreed to testify.</p>

<p>More than 80 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last week, British prosecutors dropped indecent assault charges against the Miramax film studio co-founder after concluding there was no realistic chance of securing a conviction.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Atrial fibrillation (A-Fib) is a serious condition with a wide range of potentially life-threatening complications.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New research from the University of California San Francisco has revealed that atrial fibrillation (A-Fib), a potentially life-threatening heart condition characterised by a rapid and irregular heartbeat, affects a staggering 10.5 million adults in the US, approximately 5% of the population. The rising prevalence of A-Fib is attributed to the ageing population and growing rates of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.&nbsp;The condition can lead to stroke or sudden death, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2024.07.014">study noted.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>"Atrial fibrillation doubles the risk of mortality, is one of the most common causes of stroke, increases risks of heart failure, myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease and dementia, and results in lower quality of life," said first author Jean Jacques Noubiap, MD, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar at UCSF with a speciality in global cardiovascular health.</p>

<p>"Fortunately, atrial fibrillation is preventable, and early detection and appropriate treatment can substantially reduce its adverse outcomes," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A recent study by UCSF investigators analysed the medical records of approximately 30 million adult patients in California who received acute or procedural care between 2005 and 2019. The researchers found that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Around 2 million patients (6.67%) had been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (A-Fib).</li>
	<li>The prevalence of A-Fib increased significantly over the study period, rising from 4.49% of patients treated between 2005-2009 to&nbsp;6.82% of patients treated between 2015-2019</li>
</ul>

<p>Atrial fibrillation (A-Fib) is a serious condition with a wide range of potentially life-threatening complications, including mild symptoms like shortness of breath, and light-headedness and severe complications like blood clots, stroke, and heart failure. Research has shown that individuals with A-Fib are up to five times more likely to experience a stroke.</p>

<p>The current analysis is based on medical records and diagnoses, but digital technologies such as wearable devices, mobile apps, and electronic health records may uncover even more cases of atrial fibrillation (A-Fib).</p>

<p>"With the growing use of consumer wearables designed to detect atrial fibrillation combined with safer and more effective means to treat it, this current prevalence of atrial fibrillation in health care settings may soon be dwarfed by future health care utilization that will occur due to the disease," Gregory M. Marcus, MD, MAS, a cardiologist and electrophysiologist at UCSF Health said.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A Russian strike on Red Cross vehicles in eastern Ukraine killed three people, the country's president Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Russian strike on Red Cross vehicles in eastern Ukraine killed three people, the country's president Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday.</p>

<p>"Today, the occupier attacked the vehicles of the International Committee of the Red Cross humanitarian mission in Donetsk region," Volodymyr Zelensky said.</p>

<p>The International Committee of the Red Cross confirmed that three of its staffers had been killed when shelling hit a site of a planned frontline aid distribution in the region.</p>

<p>It did not say who was behind the shelling.</p>

<p>"I condemn attacks on Red Cross personnel in the strongest terms,"</p>

<p>ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric said in a statement.</p>

<p>"It's unconscionable that shelling would hit an aid distribution site," he added.</p>

<p>"Our hearts are broken today as we mourn the loss of our colleagues and care for the injured," she said.</p>

<p>"This tragedy unleashes a wave of grief all too familiar to those who have lost loved ones in armed conflict."</p>

<p>The attack happened in the village of Virolyubivka, a dozen of kilometres away from the front line in Donetsk.</p>

<p>The ICRC said its team had been preparing to distribute wood and coal briquettes to vulnerable households to help them prepare for winter when their vehicles were hit.</p>

<p>Two other staff members were wounded in the attack, ICRC said, adding that the aid distribution "had not begun, and no residents were affected by the explosion".</p>

<p>The ICRC did not provide any details about the staff members killed, but Ukrainian parliamentary commissioner for human rights Dmytro Lubinets said they were Ukrainian citizens.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicles 'clearly marked'</strong></p>

<p>There was no immediate comment from Russia, which routinely says it only hits military targets.</p>

<p>ICRC highlighted that its teams "are regularly present in the Donetsk region, and our vehicles are clearly marked with the Red Cross emblem".</p>

<p>"The deaths of three ICRC colleagues come amid a sharp rise in the number of humanitarians killed around the world over the last two years," it lamented.</p>

<p>The UN Humanitarian mission to Ukraine said 50 workers were killed or injured in Ukraine in 2023, including 11 killed in the line of duty.</p>

<p>"Since the beginning of the year, this repeated pattern of attacks appears to have intensified," the UN humanitarian coordinator Denise Brown said in a statement in February.</p>

<p>The ICRC urgently called in Thursday's statement "for the respect of international humanitarian law, including by taking every precaution possible to ensure that those engaged in humanitarian activities are not targeted or caught in hostilities".</p>

<p>Thursday's strike came just days before Spoljaric is due to carry out a long-planned visit to Moscow -- her second visit since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, ICRC spokesman Jason Straziuso told AFP.</p>

<p>She is due to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and other senior government officials on "critical issues in conflicts globally, such as the respect of international humanitarian law, prisoners of war, the fate of the missing, and protections for humanitarian workers," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Irony struck hard when Dame Diana Johnson, the UK's police and crime minister, had her purse stolen from a hotel where she was speaking to senior police officers at a government conference. This incident raised concerns about efficiency and security, according to<em> the BBC.</em></p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx6xvvn25xo"><em>news portal </em></a>further reported that thieves struck, while Dame Diana blamed the Conservatives for an "epidemic of antisocial behaviour, theft, and shoplifting" at the annual Police Superintendents' Association conference. A 56-year-old man from Coventry has been arrested on suspicion of burglary and released on bail in connection to the incident, Warwickshire Police said. The Home Office confirmed that Johnson had her belongings stolen at the conference and said that no security risks had been identified.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ft.com/content/21fd0bb9-d561-4125-ac9b-784a77c372f1"><em>The Financial Times</em></a>, the theft came on the same day that the government began releasing some prisoners early to deal with jail overcrowding in England and Wales. The strains on the criminal justice system have been worsened by an outbreak of rioting in August. PSA president Nick Smart, in his address to the conference, decried "chronic underinvestment" in policing in recent years that he said had left forces "financially drowning" and "operating on a shoestring.".</p>

<p>Nick Smart criticised the handling of overcrowding in prisons and prisoner releases, saying police officers faced "the prospect of arresting offenders who can then not be placed in prison and dealing with the fallout from the thousands of criminals being released early today, many potentially without proper rehabilitation and release plans."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Harvey Weinstein has been hit with new criminal charges in New York, a prosecutor said in court on Thursday, as the Manhattan district attorney's office prepares to retry the former movie mogul following the reversal of his rape conviction.</p>

<p>Jurors in Manhattan found Weinstein, 72, guilty on rape charges in 2020, but the New York Court of Appeals threw out the conviction in April, finding Weinstein did not get a fair trial because a judge improperly allowed testimony by accusers he was not formally charged with assaulting.</p>

<p>Manhattan prosecutors said in July that they were investigating additional violent sexual assaults allegedly committed by Weinstein after more women agreed to testify against the Miramax studio co-founder. He has denied ever having non-consensual sexual encounters with anyone.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Nicole Blumberg did not specify the new charges Weinstein faces during a hearing before Judge Curtis Farber in New York state court in Manhattan.</p>

<p>Farber has tentatively set a trial date for Nov. 12, but has said he is open to considering an earlier start.</p>

<p>Weinstein's lawyer has said it was unfair for prosecutors to seek to add additional victims to the case after the conviction was overturned.</p>

<p>"Once again we have a hotline: '1-800 Get Harvey," defense attorney Arthur Aidala said in court on July 9.</p>

<p>The onetime Hollywood kingmaker's health has deteriorated significantly in recent years, according to his representatives, and he is confined to a wheelchair due to back problems.</p>

<p>Despite the reversal of his New York conviction, Weinstein has remained in custody at the Rikers Island jail complex because of a separate rape conviction in California.</p>

<p>He was moved to the prison ward of a New York hospital in July with multiple ailments including COVID-19.</p>

<p>Weinstein's initial conviction in New York was a milestone for the #MeToo movement, in which women accused hundreds of men in entertainment, media, politics and other fields of sexual misconduct.</p>

<p>A jury found Weinstein sexually assaulted former production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006 and raped aspiring actress Jessica Mann in 2013. They are among more than 80 women who have accused him of sexual misconduct.</p>

<p>Weinstein was sentenced to 23 years in prison for the New York case, and to 16 years in prison for the separate California case.</p>

<p>In that case, a Los Angeles jury found Weinstein guilty of rape, forcible oral copulation and sexual penetration by a foreign object involving one woman, but acquitted him of charges relating to a second accuser.</p>

<p>The judge overseeing the case declared a mistrial on the counts where the jury could not reach a verdict, including the allegations made by Siebel Newsom, the wife of California Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>

<p>The California conviction was not affected by the New York top court's decision. Weinstein has not begun serving the California sentence.</p>

<p>Miramax's hit movies included "Shakespeare in Love" and "Pulp Fiction." Weinstein's film studio filed for bankruptcy in March 2018 after the allegations against him precipitated its implosion.</p>

<p>In the New York trial, portrayed Weinstein as a serial predator who had manipulated women with promises of career advancement in Hollywood, coaxing them to hotel rooms or private apartments and then overpowering and violently attacking them.</p>

<p>During his sentencing hearing in Manhattan in 2020, Weinstein said he was worried about the "thousands of men who are losing due process" during the #MeToo movement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Recent research reveals that Covid-19 lockdowns have led to premature brain ageing in adolescents, with girls showing more significant changes than boys.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The teen years, a crucial phase in human development marked by the transition from adolescence to adulthood, have been significantly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. The Covid-19 seriously changed this activity. Recent medical research pointed out that the Covid-19 social restrictions have struck at the very fragile phase of human development, especially in adolescent girls.</p>

<p><strong>Premature Brain Ageing Observed</strong></p>

<p>In 2022, researchers found evidence of premature brain ageing in teens who had faced Covid lockdowns. New research suggests one group bore the brunt of the burden.</p>

<p>The latest study, which was published in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2403200121"><em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,</em></a> is the first to reveal stark differences between boys and girls.</p>

<p>MRI scans have revealed that, on average, girls' brains appear approximately 4.2 years older than expected following lockdowns, while boys' brains show an average ageing of 1.4 years.</p>

<p><strong>Concerns for Mental Health and Learning</strong></p>

<p>Although the precise implications of these changes are still under investigation, there are growing concerns about their potential impact on adolescents' mental health and cognitive abilities. The study underscores the need for further research to understand the long-term effects of pandemic-related disruptions on young people's development.</p>

<p>"Social isolation due to lockdowns that were imposed because of the Covid-19 pandemic had a detrimental impact on adolescent mental health, with the mental health of females more affected than males. We assessed the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns on adolescent brain structure with a focus on sex differences. We collected MRI structural data longitudinally from adolescents prior to and after the pandemic lockdowns," said the authors of the study.</p>

<p>"The pre-Covid data were used to create a normative model of cortical thickness change with age during typical adolescent development. Cortical thickness values in the post-Covid data were compared to this normative model. The analysis revealed accelerated cortical thinning in the post-Covid brain, which was more widespread throughout the brain and greater in magnitude in females than in males."</p>

<p>"When measured in terms of equivalent years of development, the mean acceleration was found to be 4.2 years in females and 1.4 years in males. Accelerated brain maturation as a result of chronic stress or adversity during development has been well documented. These findings suggest that the lifestyle disruptions associated with the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns caused changes in brain biology and had a more severe impact on the female than the male brain."</p>

<p>The results emphasizes the need for continued support and targeted interventions to address the developmental challenges faced by today's youth in the wake of the pandemic.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>NSA Doval's visit to Russia comes over two weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's historic visit to Ukraine. In his talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, PM Modi said both Ukraine and Russia should sit together without wasting time to end the ongoing war and that India was ready to play an "active role" to restore peace in the region.</p>

<p>Sources had said that Mr Doval's visit to Russia would be aimed at resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict.&nbsp;He was carrying PM Modi's peace plan for President Putin, sources said.</p>

<p>In the talks, the Russian leader expressed hopes that PM Modi will travel to Russia's Kazan next month to attend the annual BRICS summit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Putin also proposed to hold a bilateral meeting with PM Modi on October 22 on the sidelines of the BRICS summit to summarise the outcomes of joint work on the implementation of the agreements reached during his visit to Moscow and to outline prospects for the near future, the Russian Embassy said in a statement released on Telegram.</p>

<p>"We are waiting for our good friend Modi and best regards to him," the Russian media quoted Putin as saying in the meeting.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Mr Doval had held wide-ranging talks with his Russian counterpart Sergei Shoigu in St Petersburg and discussed important issues of "mutual interests".

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>A new statue of Queen Elizabeth II has met mixed reviews, with one non-plussed critic assessing that it looks more like "an old lady buying potatoes at the market" than Britain's longest-reigning monarch.</p>

<p>The statue of the queen, who died in September 2022 aged 96, was unveiled last week in Antrim Castle Gardens park in Northern Ireland, and also features her husband Prince Philip and two of her beloved corgi dogs.</p>

<p>Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council said at the unveiling that the work captures "Her Majesty in a dignified pose, reflecting her grace, steadfastness and lifelong dedication to public service".</p>

<p>The local authority posted images of artist Anto Brennan's work on its social media sites but switched off comments after adverse comments.</p>

<p>One online commentator even likened it to Robin Williams's elderly female housekeeper Mrs Doubtfire in the 1993 Hollywood comedy-drama.</p>

<p>But while the council conceded that art can prompt "diverse opinions", it said it was "delighted" with the "generally positive" response.</p>

<p>Walking his dog at the gardens on Wednesday, Ivor Ritchie, 67, called the sculpture "terrible". "It looks no more like her than the man-in-the-moon," he said.</p>

<p>"I just don't think it looks like her face," added another passer-by, Eddie Smyth, a 52-year-old labourer also from Antrim, a half-hour drive northwest of Belfast.</p>

<p>English tourist Lorraine Barker, 58, agreed. "In fact the corgis are better than the queen I'd say," she told AFP.</p>

<p>The sculpture, one of the first of the queen in the UK since her death, is attracting increasing attention -- and curious visitors to the 400-year-old gardens.</p>

<p>"We came over to see it as we'd heard people talking about it," said Noel Wilson, 62, who drove from the nearby town of Ballymena with his wife Dorothy, 61, to have a look.</p>

<p>Hungarian tourist Gabor Laszlo, 50, struggled to see the queen's likeness but conceded: "Prince Philip is OK."</p>

<p>The queen, who ruled for 70 years, is depicted in a country jacket and tweed skirt, wearing a headscarf and carrying her trademark handbag.</p>

<p>Laszlo was unimpressed, saying it made her look "like an old lady at the market buying some potatoes".</p>

<p>Yet the depiction still has its fans.</p>

<p>"It's a really good replica of how warmly and fondly she is remembered by the British public, I think it's an excellent job," said English visitor Stephen Barker.</p>

<p>For 90-year-old Canadian tourist Roy Hill the work is "a wonderful depiction, very impressive".</p>

<p>"It brings back a lot of memories, I am old enough to remember Queen Elizabeth as a young person, at the coronation," he said.</p>

<p>Another local out for a walk in the park, Muriel McCandless, 81, expressed sympathy with the sculptor, who has yet to comment on the controversy.</p>

<p>"I actually think it's quite good," she laughed.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As global warming intensifies, the new travel trend "coolcation" emerges, reflecting a shift towards cooler destinations. With extreme heat impacting southern Europe, northern and central countries are becoming more attractive to tourists.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As global warming is hitting every inch of the planet and heatwaves intensify all over the world, a new kind of travel trend has emerged: the "coolcation", according to a report by <em>Deutsche Welle</em>. A combination of two words, "cool" and "vacation," it speaks volumes about people's growing penchant for cooler destinations as traditional sun-seeking vacations are increasingly seen as less appealing because of climate change.</p>

<p>The Swedish tourism association, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://visitsweden.com/">Visit Sweden</a>, champions this shift, asserting that travellers are increasingly drawn to destinations with moderate temperatures. Their website highlights the transition from chasing heat to seeking respite in cooler climates. Similarly, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.visitnorway.com/">Visit Norway</a> is promoting northern escapes as a refreshing alternative to the intense summer heat in southern Europe.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/webstories/science/climate-change-sparks-interest-in-coolcation-24150"><strong>Also Read | Climate Change Sparks Interest In "Coolcation"</strong></a></p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dw.com/en/coolcation-is-climate-change-transforming-travel/a-70187090"><em>DW report,</em></a> recent climate data confirms this trend: Spain and Italy saw their hottest years on record in 2022 and 2023; Greece also saw severe droughts and fires. Such conditions mean that extreme heat is likely to persist in southern Europe, which could change the face of tourism.</p>

<p>According to the EU Commission, tourism flows are shifting; northern and central countries are expected to gain, while southern destinations will be losers. On the winners' side will be countries such as Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, whereas countries such as Greece and Spain might lose as much as 30% of their tourism income.</p>

<p>Despite these changes, many travellers still favour warm climates. A European Travel Commission survey reveals that 74% of respondents are adapting to climate change by avoiding extreme temperatures. However, in Germany, traditional preferences for sunny destinations persist, with northern Europe accounting for a minor share of their travel.</p>

<p>While the "coolcation" may be gaining attention, experts caution that it's too early to confirm a decisive trend. Changes in travel behaviour due to climate change may take decades to fully materialise.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The gaming industry has experienced a wave of layoffs and downsizing across various companies, with several major players announcing significant job cuts this year.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chris Deering, the former President of Sony's Computer Entertainment division in Europe, has some straightforward advice for game developers who have recently lost their jobs. In a podcast, Mr Deering suggested that laid-off developers consider taking a year off to relax and enjoy themselves, perhaps spending time at the beach, or exploring alternative income sources like driving for Uber until the job market recovers and new opportunities emerge, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://fortune.com/2024/09/11/sony-computer-entertainment-chris-deering-blunt-advice-laid-off-workers-go-beach-drive-uber/">Fortune</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''You're going to have to take a few, figure out how to get through it, drive an Uber or whatever. Find a cheap place to live and go to the beach for a year,” he said on <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/chris-deering-former-president-of-sony-computer/id1665581266?i=1000668974022">My Perfect Console podcast</a>.</p>

<p>Mr Deering, who helmed Sony's European PlayStation division from 1995 to 2005, drew a stark comparison between the current wave of layoffs in the gaming industry and the COVID-19 pandemic, implying that the job losses are an unavoidable and widespread phenomenon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In February, the company announced a significant restructuring exercise, involving the layoff of approximately 900 employees worldwide and the closure of PlayStation Studios' London location, citing a decline in the gaming market. At that time,&nbsp;Sony's then-CEO Jim Ryan said the cost-cutting measure was to ''streamline our resources.''</p>

<p>Mr Deering, though, rejected the idea that the layoffs were solely driven by corporate greed and profit motives. ''I don't think it's fair to say that the resulting layoffs have been greed. I always tried to minimize the speed at which we added staff because I always knew there would be a cycle. If the money isn't coming in from the consumers on the last game, it's going to be hard to justify spending the money for the next game,'' he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the games division of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) strongly disagreed with his comments and highlighted the need for collective action and unionisation to protect workers' rights and interests.</p>

<p>''With a strong union, we can get what we deserve - work-life balance and job security. Without it, we're left with "let them eat cake",'' a tweet by&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/IWGB_GW" role="link">IWGB Game Workers</a> read.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<p>Notably, the gaming industry has experienced a wave of layoffs and downsizing across various companies, with several major players announcing significant job cuts this year. In addition to Sony, companies like Microsoft and Unity also downsized their studios this year, cutting nearly 4,000 jobs at the start of the year.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/0cov4748_kamala-trump_625x300_12_September_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>

<p>Votaries of the US presidential debate - including many of our senior politicians - may want to hold their horses. The first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, after all, has not turned out to be the symposium of policy and polity ideas that some hoped it would be. It certainly was massively entertaining. Nobody still knows who will be the next president of the United States in November or what their plan of action will be at home and in the world. One is forced to examine, therefore, whether the purpose of these presidential debates is entertainment - poli-tainment.</p>

<h2><strong>The Post-9/11 Television</strong></h2>

<p>Interestingly, the Trump-Harris debate was telecast live on the eve of the 23rd anniversary of the 9/11 attacks - an event that set a new tone for decades to come for not just the US establishment but the media as well. Let's rewind to 2001. The television ably aided the military-industrial complex of the United States in the project of what Noam Chomsky calls manufacturing consent. This consent was built not just around military action on foreign land but also heightened security measures within. This was done via 'militainment' - cultural products revolving around the military. Think in terms of all the war films Hollywood churned out each time the US soldiers engaged in military action on foreign soil. Post-9/11, the television brought all the fighting to the American living rooms with a renewed vigour. Heightened awareness of the enemies of the United States meant a better chance of convincing Americans about their government's decision to continue fighting them. And it was being done ostensibly under the garb of entertainment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Politainment, on the other hand, aims to serve entertainment in the name of politics. Entertainment often equals commercialism, and there seems to be no other form of entertainment bigger than the presidential polls in the US at the moment. The biggest names in the entertainment world have joined the fray, the latest being Taylor Swift, the biggest artist in the world of 2023, with her endorsement of Kamala Harris. Like TV, with a small hiatus in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, jumped right back into commercial programming and labelled it "public service," presidential polls become the public service events for artists and platforms every four years.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Is It Time To Retire The Debate?</strong></h2>

<p>The televised US presidential debate, initiated by the most showman-like of all American presidents, John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon, also turns sixty-four this month. Is it now time to retire it? The supporters uphold it as the democratisation of political information. But what does it really mean in terms of electoral participation and outcome? Scholars like Markus Prior have demonstrated that "Cable TV and the Internet increase gaps in knowledge and turnout between people who prefer news and people who prefer entertainment".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Political scientists have already analysed the Trump-Harris debate threadbare. Precious little has emerged about the policy direction that the most powerful country in the world will take in the next four years under a new president. Instead, it spawned industrial supplies of highly imaginative entertainment products like memes, parodies, and social media videos. Multimedia content creators are likely to have generated substantial wealth thanks to this debate, which was pretty low on political information. Even if it were high, there is no evidence that this debate would have elevated the average levels of political knowledge in the American population. Sure, Kennedy won the election after his super successful maiden debate with Nixon, but was it not owing more to his personality cult than any of his policy positions? &nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Demagoguery 101</strong></h2>

<p>These days, one almost feels sorry for the poor television. It tries to do a tightrope walk between public service and entertainment. In the US, television is constantly trying to reprieve its respectable status as a regulated private industry originally thought to operate for the general welfare. It is also torn in the opposite direction by capitalist motives of profit maximisation. Events like the presidential debates allow television to make the two ends meet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scholars like Roland Barthes have argued how history and memory create and further national narratives. Television serves as not just a creator but also an observer and a repository of both history and memory. At present, the national psyche of the US-bifurcated along party lines - lends itself to being exploited by television for the creation of a national narrative of fractured solidarities and policy chaos. There are deep disagreements among both Republican and Democrat supporters. Ongoing foreign wars have distilled these disagreements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fact that both Trump and Harris were unable to offer any policy framework during the debate and mounted only personal attacks against each other leaves a discerning audience with a sense of impending doom. Politics of issues has been firmly pushed into the background while emotionally charged demagoguery takes centre stage.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Forty five Indians who were illegally made to join the Russian army and fight for them on the battle fronts against Ukraine have been rescued from the war zone and discharged from the Russian military, the Ministry of External Affairs said today.</p>

<p>There are fifty more Indian nationals still on battlefields in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, and efforts are underway to rescue them and get them released too, the spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs added.</p>

<p>During Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit to Moscow, Russian President Vladimir had assured Mr Modi that Russia will discharge any and all Indians who had been misled and falsely inducted in the Russian Army and subsequently forced to go the battlefields in Ukraine.</p>

<h3><strong>HOW INDIANS WERE MISLED INTO JOINING RUSSIAN ARMY</strong></h3>

<p>A human trafficking network extending from New Delhi to Tamil Nadu used social media platforms and local agents to lure people to Russia by offering them lucrative jobs or admission to what Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) called "dubious private universities".</p>

<p>Once they reached Russia, however, the victims' passports were taken and they were trained in combat roles before being deployed at the front.</p>

<p>Roughly hundred Indian nationals find themselves trapped in this situation and at least four Indians have been killed in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.</p>

<p>Police in India have arrested at least four people involved in the job racket.</p>

<p>A viral video earlier this year showed a group of men from Punjab and Haryana - wearing army uniforms - claiming they were tricked into fighting the war in Ukraine and doubling down on their request for help.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">

</div>

<p>New Delhi has said that every case brought to its attention is being "strongly taken up" with Russia to ensure the "early discharge" of stranded people, and 10 Indians have been brought back as part of this effort so far.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister S Jaishankar said that the "toughest legal action" will be taken against agents who duped students from Kerala into fighting for Russia in its war against Ukraine.</p>

<p>"It is totally unacceptable that any Indian should be taken to a conflict zone and in any manner be made to work for a conflict, for an army...," Mr Jaishankar had said earlier this year.</p>

<h3><strong>PM MODI RAISES ISSUE WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN</strong></h3>

<p>During his visit to Moscow in July, Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised the issue with President Vladimir Putin following which Russia decided to discharge all Indians working in the Russian army.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Scientists at the institute have developed a new nanovaccine that shows promise in providing universal protection against all major Covid-19 variants.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wuhan Institute of Virology in China,&nbsp;which has conducted extensive research on bat coronaviruses, has faced controversy and scrutiny from various countries, including the US, regarding allegations of a lab leak contributing to the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, scientists at the institute have&nbsp;developed a new nanovaccine that shows promise in providing universal protection against all major Covid-19 variants and potential future coronavirus mutations, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3278004/chinas-wuhan-virology-institute-creates-nasal-covid-19-vaccine-future-pandemics">South China Morning Post</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the research team, current vaccines have played a crucial role in preventing the spread of Sars-CoV-2 and reducing mortality rates. However, they believe that existing vaccines lack universal protection against all variants of the virus. So, they developed a&nbsp;universal COVID-19 vaccine by combining coronavirus epitopes (specific parts of antigens that trigger an immune response) with the blood protein ferritin. This combination creates an intranasal nanoparticle vaccine that shows promise in protecting multiple variants of Sars-CoV-2, including Delta, Omicron, and WIV04.</p>

<p>The WIV04 strain refers to an early variant of Sars-CoV-2 that was initially detected in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the Covid-19 pandemic first emerged.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">''The ongoing and future pandemics caused by Sars-CoV-2 variants and mutations underscore the need for effective vaccines that provide broad-spectrum protection,'' the researchers wrote in a paper published in the peer-reviewed journal ACS Nano in June.</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">''Our constructed nanovaccine targeting the conserved epitopes of the pre-existing neutralising antibodies can serve as a promising candidate for a universal Sars-CoV-2 vaccine,'' the paper added.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">While the global risk level of COVID-19 has significantly decreased, researchers warn that the virus's ongoing mutation will continue to generate new variants, some of which may possess increased transmissibility and potentially trigger future outbreaks or even another global pandemic.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">That's why the team believes that&nbsp;nanovaccines offer an "excellent vaccine platform" and have&nbsp;long-lasting immune responses.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">The nanovaccine was first tested on mice, which&nbsp;demonstrated promising results.&nbsp;Mice receiving the nanovaccine, followed by two booster shots within 42 days, showed significantly higher levels of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies compared to control groups. When vaccinated mice were exposed to various coronavirus variants, including Omicron and Delta, they exhibited enhanced resistance to virus-induced lung symptoms, showcasing the vaccine's protective efficacy against different strains.</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">The nanoparticle vaccine “has the potential protective capability as a broad spectrum vaccine against various [coronaviruses]”, the team wrote.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities in Springfield, Ohio, have found no evidence to support claims circulating on social media about Haitian immigrants abducting and consuming pets. Despite the lack of credible reports, the false information has been widely shared and amplified by public figures, including former President Donald Trump and Ohio Senator JD Vance. Mr Vance had previously made statements about <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1833505359513661762">Haitian immigrants causing disruptions in Springfield</a> and recently claimed that there were reports of pets being taken and eaten by people ''who shouldn't be in the country''.</p>

<p>During a debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Donald Trump also reiterated the above claims. Despite city officials denying the allegations, Trump insisted that he had seen people making these claims on television. Officials have confirmed that these claims are unfounded and lack any credible evidence.</p>

<p>"In Springfield, they're eating the dogs — the people that came in, they're eating the cats. They're eating — they're eating the pets of the people that live there and this is what's happening in our country, and it's a shame," Trump said.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Where did the pet-eating claim come from?</strong></h2>

<p>A video recently went viral that claimed a Haitian immigrant in Springfield killed and ate a pet cat.&nbsp;An investigation by The Springfield News-Sun suggests that the claim may have started with a viral post in a local Facebook group, which was then amplified by others, including high-profile figures. However, the case pertains to an incident in Canton, Ohio,&nbsp;about 170 miles (273km) away from Springfield.</p>

<p>On August 16, a woman in Ohio was arrested and charged with animal cruelty after allegedly killing a cat by stomping on it and then consuming it in front of multiple witnesses. According to a police report, officers allege that &nbsp;Allexis Ferrell "smashed the cat's head with her foot and then began to eat the cat." The Canton Police Department also released <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/ohio/ohio-woman-arrested-after-eating-cat-canton-police-release-bodycam-footage-incident/530-3f8ac79a-cd97-4cee-9ed1-16943a04a658">bodycam footage</a> of the 27-year-old being arrested. Rumours soon started swirling on social media that she was an immigrant. The case also became a part of online presidential campaign chatter.</p>

<p>However, this incident in Canton is entirely unrelated to the false claims circulating about Haitian immigrants in Springfield. As per reports,&nbsp;Ferrell is not a Haitian immigrant, but an American citizen. She was born in Ohio and graduated from Canton McKinley High School in 2015.&nbsp;She was charged with prohibitions concerning companion animals, animal cruelty, and disorderly conduct.</p>

<p><strong>Another Misleading claim</strong></p>

<p>A photo of a Black man holding a goose has also been misused on social media to falsely claim that Haitian immigrants are eating geese in Springfield. However, the man who took the photo has come forward to set the record straight.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" data-embed-height="659" style="height:500px"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/1eebfta/this_is_ohio/">This is Ohio</a><br />
by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/isitmeyourelooking4x/">u/isitmeyourelooking4x</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/">Ohio</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

<p></p>

<p>He confirmed that he took the photo on July 28 in Columbus and posted it on Reddit because it was an unusual sight. CBS News has verified the location of the photo and confirmed that it is not related to the false claims about Haitian immigrants in Springfield.</p>

<p>In addition to Trump and Vance, billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has also shared memes referencing the false claims about Haitian immigrants in Springfield. However, the Canton Police debunked the claims and told<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77l28myezko" rel="nofollow, noindex">&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>BBC</em></a>&nbsp;"We have not dealt with any complaints of Haitian immigrants at all."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Springfield City also issued a statement saying there have been "no credible reports" of pets being harmed by the Haitian community.</p>

<p>In a statement on Tuesday, a Springfield police spokesperson said, "In response to recent rumours alleging criminal activity by the immigrant population in our city, we wish to clarify that there have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said today that there has been "some progress" with China on the boundary issue. The minister said that approximately 75 per cent of the "disengagement" problems has been resolved.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar, who is in Geneva, Switzerland for bilateral meetings, said this at an interactive session at the Global Centre for Security Policy - an independent think-tank. The minister further said that the bigger issue has been the increasing militarisation of the frontier.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said the Galwan Valley clashes of June 2020 affected the "entirety" of India-China ties, asserting that "One cannot have violence at the border and then say the rest of the relationship is insulated from it".</p>

<p>"Negotiations are going on. We made some progress. I would say roughly you can say about 75 per cent of the disengagement problems are sorted out," he said, adding "We still have some things to do."</p>

<p>Ties between India and China have been at an all-time low as the militaries of both nations have been standing their ground since the standoff in Ladakh began in May 2020. The disengagement process began in February 2021 and has been on since.</p>

<p>Roughly 75% of the disengagement problems with China has been sorted out, Mr Jaishankar said. Mr Jaishankar is scheduled to meet Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi during his visit to Switzerland.</p>

<p>Talks at both the diplomatic and military levels between India and China have held on an ongoing basis. "We hope that if there is a solution to the disengagement and there is a return to peace and tranquility, then we can look at other possibilities," Mr Jaishankar said.</p>

<p>While partial disengagement from Galwan, Hot Springs, and Gogra happened in July 2020 while full disengagement from Pangong Lake north and south banks took place in February 2021. However, Chinese soldiers are firmly entrenched in the Depsang Plains in northeastern Ladakh and show no signs of moving.</p>

<p>The Line of Actual Control or LAC between India and China, including China-occupied Tibet, is around 3,500 km in length.</p>

<p>India has maintained that its ties with China cannot be normal unless there is peace in the border areas.</p>

<p>"The basis obviously for a good relationship, I would say even for a normal relationship, was that there would be peace and tranquility in the border. After things started to take a better turn in 1988, we had a series of agreements which stabilised the border," Mr Jaishankar said.</p>

<p><strong>VIOLATIONS BY CHINA</strong></p>

<p>Speaking about how China unilaterally changed the status-quo along the LAC, Mr Jaishankar said "What happened in 2020 was in violation of multiple agreements for some reasons which are still entirely not clear to us; we can speculate on it."</p>

<p>"The Chinese actually moved a very large number of troops to the Line of Actual Control at the border and naturally in response, we moved our troops up. It was very difficult for us because we were in the middle of a Covid lockdown at that time," he said.</p>

<p>Describing the development as very dangerous and referring to the Glawan clashes, Mr Jaishankar said, "Now we could see straight away that this was a very dangerous development because the presence of a large number of troops in these extreme heights and extreme cold in near proximity could lead to a mishap. And that's exactly what happened."</p>

<p>"We have now been negotiating close to four years and the first step of that is what we called disengagement which is their troops go back to their normal operating bases and our troops go back to their normal operating bases and where required we have an arrangement about patrolling because both of us patrol regularly in that border as I said it is not a legally delineated border." Mr Jaishankar said.</p>

<p><strong>IMPACT ON INDIA-CHINA TIES</strong></p>

<p>Since the military clashes and subsequent standoff in Ladakh, the ties between India and China have been at an all-time low. The economic ties between the two nations have been imbalanced for the last few decades.</p>

<p>Speaking about trade ties, Mr Jaishankar said, the economic relationship with China has been "very unfair" and "unbalanced". But he has maintained that India is not closed for business with China.</p>

<p>Two days ago, during his visit to Germany, Mr Jaishankar had said that India is "not closed to business from China", but the issue is in which sectors the country does business with Beijing and on what terms.</p>

<p>"We are not closed to business from China...I think the issue is, which sectors do you do business and what terms do you do business? It's far more complicated than a black and white binary answer," Mr Jaishankar had said.</p>

<p>Since the Ladakh standoff, India has tightened its scrutiny of investments from Chinese companies and stopped all major projects, including in infrastructure. But as progress is made with China on disengagement along the LAC, government officials, including Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, have backed suggestions to allow more Chinese investment in the country.</p>

<p>Along with investment scrutiny, India has also virtually blocked visas for all Chinese nationals since 2020, but is now considering easing them for Chinese technicians, as it had hindered investments worth billions of dollars.</p>

<p>Since the Ladakh standoff, passenger flights between India and China had also stopped, but with progress in disengagement, though slow, resumption of flights is now being discussed.</p>

<p>Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu said today that early resumption of direct flights between India and China have been discussed by both nations.</p>

<p>According to a news report by Reuters, China has been pressing India since June to resume direct passenger flights, but New Delhi is resisting it as the disengagement in Ladakh is not complete.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a shocking crime that has stunned Switzerland, former Miss Switzerland finalist Kristina Joksimovic was allegedly murdered, with her body dismembered and dissolved by her husband, Thomas, Swiss officials revealed. The 38-year-old former model was discovered dead on February 13 in the laundry room of her home in Binningen, located about two miles southwest of Basel, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://news.sky.com/story/former-model-and-miss-switzerland-finalist-kristina-joksimovic-pureed-in-blender-by-husband-reports-13213183" rel="nofollow, noindex">Sky News</a></em> reported.&nbsp;Authorities concluded during the investigation that Ms Joksimovic had been strangled before her death. Her 41-year-old husband, identified only as "Thomas" in local media, was arrested and later confessed to the crime. The federal court in Lausanne rejected his appeal for release on Wednesday.</p>

<p><strong><em>Trigger Warning: Disturbing content</em></strong></p>

<p>An autopsy determined that Ms&nbsp;Joksimovic was strangled before her death, a detail corroborated by Thomas in his confession. Her body was dismembered in the laundry room using a jigsaw, knife, and garden shears. According to local media outlet <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bzbasel.ch/basel/baselland/bundesgericht-mord-in-binningen-ehemann-soll-die-leiche-seiner-frau-verstuemmelt-haben-ld.2668305">Basel</a></em>, some of her remains were later chopped with a hand blender, "pureed," and dissolved in a chemical solution.</p>

<p>Thomas claims that he killed his wife in self-defence, stating that she attacked him with a knife. After the murder, he reportedly panicked and proceeded to dismember her body.</p>

<p>However, medical-forensic reports contradict Thomas's self-defence claim. Investigators have found "concrete indications of a mental illness" in Thomas and described him as having "sadistic tendencies." They noted his "remarkably high level of criminal energy, lack of empathy, and cold-bloodedness" following the murder of his wife.</p>

<p>Prosecutors also disclosed that Thomas had previously strangled his wife. Additionally, a former partner claimed that he had once grabbed the beauty queen by the neck and slammed her head into a wall.</p>

<p><strong>Who was&nbsp;Kristina Joksimovic?</strong></p>

<p>Born in Binningen with Serbian heritage, Kristina Joksimovic initially pursued a career in modelling, winning the Miss Northwest Switzerland title in 2003 and becoming a finalist in the 2008 Miss Switzerland competition. She later transitioned to coaching, empowering aspiring models and businesswomen to build confidence and improve their personal and professional presence. Additionally, she successfully ran a coaching agency and worked in IT recruitment.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[An effective definition of terrorism is necessary to provide the operational rules of engagement to national security agencies.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When members of Al-Qaeda flew commercial jetliners into New York's World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, the idea of who was a terrorist crystallised for the world. But, 23 years on, the reality is there is no one "kind" of terrorist. As security forces around the world grapple with myriad threats from all manner of groups, an essential agreement on who the opponent is becomes crucial.</p>

<p>An effective definition of terrorism is necessary to provide the operational rules of engagement to national security agencies and, at an international level, to facilitate combined efforts based on the shared perspective of peace and war, of friends and enemies, of the threat scenarios.</p>

<h3><strong>Good, evil and the terrorist</strong></h3>

<p>A person is a terrorist because of what they do, not because of what they believe, and for their actions, they are prosecuted.</p>

<p>Discussing terrorism on the theoretical level of &nbsp;"good and evil" is counterproductive and pointless. Even if we all agree that terrorism is the expression of evil, it is not possible to reach an agreement on who the terrorists are.</p>

<p>This is because the category of evil, in today's fragmented world, is understandable only at a local level, difficult to share outside one's cultural boundaries. Evil as a concept depends on cultural perspectives and therefore it cannot lead to a definition of terrorism based on an objective assessment of damages and threats.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in a world of conflict, the same effect can be generated by terrorists, insurgents, freedom fighters, and other groups using violence and doing the same thing, for different reasons, with a different label. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The whole question about the "good or evil" of an action depends on the reasons that motivate that action, so again it is a vague criterion. The acceptance or rejection of actions cannot depend on the value of "good or evil", nor on the reasons that generate them.</p>

<p>So this is one more reason to change how we measure terrorism, forgetting "good and evil", instead focusing on the results of terrorism, banning its effects we cannot accept. Those effects, unlike the ideas that constitute motivations, can be counted and measured. &nbsp;When "an act of terrorism is such because of the effects that the act generates, and not because of the causes that drove it", then the way is open for all to agree to a common counter strategy to terrorism.</p>

<h3><strong>Defining terrorism</strong></h3>

<p>Ten years after 9-11, Alex P. Schmid, Distinguished Fellow at the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism (ICCT) and Director of the Terrorism Research Initiative (TRI), collected the opinions of dozens of experts to arrive at a scientific definition of terrorism for the 21st century.</p>

<p>The result has been a long list of characteristics, among which the objective of "terrorising" is emphasised, identifying communication as a specific element of terrorism, and the use of violence, indiscriminately directed towards "civilian" targets.</p>

<p>This plethora of definitions makes it difficult to come up with a common operational perspective for countering terrorism threats. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, too many definitions of terrorism, refer to the experience around this phenomenon gained in a world that no longer exists.</p>

<p>Italy is a fine example of this.</p>

<h3><strong>A history of violence</strong></h3>

<p>Italy is notorious for the violence it experienced during the last 30 years of the 20th century from groups on the far left, such as the Brigate Rosse (Red Brigades) to those on the far right (Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari) along with the mafia and other organised crime.</p>

<p>Italy experienced violent political terrorism that wanted to change the state to affirm another idea of the state.</p>

<p>Counterterrorism laws that still address the phenomenon were created based on that experience.</p>

<p>However, today's terrorism no longer has anything to do with the terrorism of that time. So old regulatory tools are still used to regulate a phenomenon that has changed.</p>

<p>This means that for an effective, updated response to terrorism, we have to go back to identifying the phenomenon as it appears today, asking the basic question: "What is terrorism?".</p>

<p>In recent years, terrorism has proven to be flexible, adaptable and opportunistic. It is very skilled in exploiting an enemy's vulnerabilities and from this ability it gains strength.</p>

<p>Europol, in the TE-SAT Terrorism Situation and Trend Report 2023, lists current terrorism types and dangerous groups, and warns that "the lines between different types of terrorism, including right-wing, left-wing, anarchist, jihadist, and other ideologies, are likely to become more blurred in the future".</p>

<p>Europol unlights that points of convergence have already been observed among terrorist and violent extremists across the whole ideological spectrum.</p>

<h3><strong>Salad Bar terrorism</strong></h3>

<p>Ideologically today one can talk about Salad Bar terrorism (or Mixed Ideology terrorism), where the ideological dimension is present, but it is articulated according to a personal taste, to justify the choice of violent affirmation of one's ideas.</p>

<p>Yet, the actual reasons for terrorism can be found in terrorism itself as a choice and action. They lie in the conviction terrorists have that only violence can change a situation already irrecoverable, urgent, and dramatic. The personalised ideology terrorists create for themselves is the justification for the terrorist action and not the real motivation.</p>

<p>In this framework, recruitment and propaganda are strategic pieces of the ideological puzzle: ideas are to be reassembled according to a flexible and adaptable image that constitutes the scenario in which the terrorist's violence will be expressed. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This fragmentation is the main feature of terrorism affecting young people's identities (since young people are the main victims of terrorist propaganda and recruitment). &nbsp;A fragmentation where geographical, political and cultural borders are no longer useful, reorganised by the global network of communication technologies. &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>More than ideology</strong></h3>

<p>The first challenge that comes out is the need to reconsider the meaning of nation and state.</p>

<p>The paths that can lead to terrorism are many and this is why the definition of terrorism based on reasons and motivations does not work: the unpredictable Salad Bar Ideology offers many ways to become a terrorist. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Ideologies no longer provide sufficient analytical categories to identify and, subsequently, prevent threats effectively. The reasons that drive radicalization today are multiple and come from various inputs. &nbsp;</p>

<p>A good example of the failure to adequately address terrorism today is the numerous tools developed by law enforcement to identify potential terrorists are the so-called Terrorist Risk Assessment Instruments. &nbsp;</p>

<p>All these have, so far, led to poor results, because they are based on the wrong assumptions of continuity, linearity, and ideal coherence, while today's Salad Bar Terrorism offers a circular route, rapid and unpredictable, always original for everyone. &nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, the Australian Institute of Criminology recently released a report on the use of four risk assessment tools designed to gauge the threat posed by radicalised offenders and, in some cases, justify them being held behind bars or closely supervised after their sentences have been served. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The AIC report found there was a "relative lack of research into the efficacy of these tools", something it found was a "barrier to their use and undermines confidence in expert assessments that rely on these tools".</p>

<p>There are often no credible signs to identify the "typical terrorist" until it is too late.</p>

<p>Today, a more effective method for identifying a potential terrorist risk could be adopting a so-called "Digital Humint" approach, which analyses both the "real" and "virtual" dimensions together, exploring not only the network of offline relationships and habits but also the social media ecosystem and chat rooms.</p>

<h2><strong>A new approach</strong></h2>

<p>A new approach, abandoning the ideological dimension as a founding dimension of terrorism is pivotal and it means "an act of terrorism is such for the effects that this act generates, not for the causes that drove it". &nbsp;</p>

<p>This approach is not just backed up by the previous empirical results and failures of counterterrorism efforts. It also has a theoretical foundation from the field of crisis management, where a crisis is defined as an event whose effects are not controlled by a system. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It also has a practical basis, in seeking an agreement on "what terrorism is" by referring to the effects, to the damage caused, for which an objective assessment can be agreed. &nbsp;This is in total alignment with the needs of the criminal justice system and legal framework.</p>

<p>In the EU, terrorism is defined by its aims to: "a) seriously intimidating a population; b) unduly compelling a government or an international organisation to perform or abstain from performing any act; c) seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic or social structures of a country or an international organisation", without any reference to a typology of ideological motivations.</p>

<p>Terrorism is no longer what it used to be, but those who fight terrorism have not realised this. Bold decisions have to be made to abandon obsolete approaches and tools that cannot deliver any more results. &nbsp;</p>

<p>What worked 50 years ago to fight terrorism in the 70s and 80s is irrelevant today, because contemporary terrorism bears little resemblance to its previous expressions. After all, human society has changed.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for spying for the Chinese government.</p>

<p>Alexander Yuk Ching Ma, 71, of Honolulu, was arrested in August 2020 after admitting to an undercover FBI agent that he sold US secrets to China, the US Department of Justice said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>He admitted that he had facilitated the provision of classified information to intelligence officers employed by China's Shanghai State Security Bureau (SSSB).</p>

<p>Ma has been sentenced to 10 years in prison followed by five years of supervised release announced Assistant Attorney General Matthew G Olsen of the Justice Department's National Security Division, US Attorney Clare E Connors for the District of Hawaii and Executive Assistant Director Robert Wells of the FBI's National Security Branch.</p>

<p>According to court documents, Ma, a US citizen born in Hong Kong worked for the CIA from 1982 until 1989.</p>

<p>Officials said Ma collaborated with a relative who is now deceased, and who worked for the CIA from 1967 until 1983.</p>

<p>As CIA officers, both Ma and his relative held top secret security clearances that granted them access to sensitive and classified CIA information, and both signed non-disclosure agreements, officials said.</p>

<p>Ma admitted in the plea agreement, in March 2001, over a decade after he resigned from the CIA, that he was contacted by SSSB intelligence officers, who asked him Ma to arrange a meeting between his relative and the SSSB.</p>

<p>During the meetings that were held in a Hong Kong hotel room for three days, Ma's relative provided the SSSB with a large volume of classified US information in return for USD 50,000 in cash.</p>

<p>In March, while living in Hawaii, Ma took up a job as a contract linguist in the FBI's Honolulu Field Office.</p>

<p>"The FBI, aware of Ma's ties to PRC intelligence, hired Ma as part of a ruse to monitor and investigate his activities and contacts with the SSSB," prosecutors said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Ma, they said worked part-time at an offsite location for the FBI from August 2004 until October 2012.</p>

<p>Under the terms of the plea agreement, Ma must cooperate with the United States for the rest of his life, including by submitting to debriefings by US government agencies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As protests grow, Benjamin Netanyahu clings to power in what appears to be a gambit to shape his own political and legal future, regardless of the cost.</p>

<p>War-weary and angry, hundreds of thousands of Israelis are taking to the streets week after week, calling for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to cut a deal and bring the remaining hostages from the October 7 Hamas attack home.</p>

<p>Their calls remain unanswered.</p>

<p>These massive public demonstrations, including the largest nationwide strike in 18 months, are met with renewed conditions for any deal with Hamas and commitments to continuing the war into its second year.</p>

<p>Despite the more than 750,000 protesters calling for his resignation and an end to the war, clinging to power and continuing the fight against Hamas appears to be Netanyahu's only plan for the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>What started the protests?</strong></h3>

<p>The protests began after another six Israeli hostages were found dead in Gaza at the beginning of September. &nbsp;</p>

<p>A key demand of the protesters has been for Netanyahu to sign a ceasefire with Hamas that would see the release of the remaining Israelis still held captive since the October 7, 2023 attacks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite increasing public dissent, Netanyahu has refused to sign any ceasefire and continues to add new conditions to any potential deal. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The latest sticking point is Israel's insistence that it retain a permanent military presence in the Philadelphi Corridor - a strip of land on the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hamas refuses to accept any such stipulation, arguing that all Israeli troops should evacuate the Gaza Strip.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Egypt has also expressed its concern at the prospect of Israeli troops stationed on its border, &nbsp;amid concerns of miscalculation from either Egyptian or Israeli troops.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Adding to the public pressure on Netanyahu is the political pressure from both inside and outside of his ruling coalition.</p>

<p>Externally, his political rivals accuse Netanyahu of lying to the Israeli public and for putting his political survival ahead of any deal to bring the hostages home.</p>

<p>Inside his coalition, there is more pressure to continue the war until all vestiges of Hamas are destroyed and the Palestinians are pacified.</p>

<p>While commentators speculate on how long Netanyahu can survive, perhaps the more relevant question is how he got here in the first place.</p>

<h3><strong>Netanyahu's narrow window</strong></h3>

<p>The root cause of Netanyahu's current dilemma is a series of 2016 allegations of corruption. &nbsp;Subsequent police investigations led to Netanyahu being charged in 2019 with breach of trust, accepting bribes, and fraud.</p>

<p>Since the allegations became public, Netanyahu has tried &nbsp;various political manoeuvres to avoid fronting court and a potential guilty verdict and likely jail sentence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Initially, these involved using parliamentary procedures to impede the judicial process. &nbsp;This included the Attorney General being accused of interfering in the investigation and deliberately delaying the indictment, as well as Netanyahu seeking immunity from prosecution from the Israeli Parliament, the Knesset.</p>

<p>When these efforts failed, Netanyahu's trial began in May 2020. &nbsp;Then, in March 2021, Netanyahu lost the election and the prime ministership, leaving him without any institutional protection - something he covets.</p>

<p>After another inconclusive election in November 2022 Netanyahu made a Faustian bargain with several right-wing nationalist parties to regain the prime ministership. &nbsp;In return for entering his coalition, Netanyahu agreed to pursue the nationalists' political agenda. &nbsp;</p>

<p>One of his government's first acts was to try and enact sweeping judicial reforms that would give the government oversight of Israel's Supreme Court. &nbsp;These reforms could benefit both Netanyahu and his coalition partners.</p>

<h3><strong>Political bargain offers no way out</strong></h3>

<p>Because Israel has just one parliamentary house, the Supreme Court acts as a check and balance on the Knesset's power. &nbsp;The government's intention to ensure it always had a majority on the committee that appoints judges was of particular concern to many Israelis. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Opponents feared these reforms could give Netanyahu the power to appoint sympathetic judges to the Supreme Court and potentially gain immunity from prosecution.</p>

<p>For the nationalists, the proposed reforms would remove many of the institutional checks and balances imposed by the Supreme Court on the expansion of Israeli settlements and the appropriation of Palestinian land in the West Bank - something &nbsp;Israeli nationalists have wanted for years. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If successful, it would mean Israel's 57-year occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem would become permanent, sounding the death knell for any future Palestinian state, something that did not go unnoticed by Hamas.</p>

<p>The proposed reforms provoked unprecedented public backlash, with massive weekly protests racking Israel from January to October 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was only when Hamas attacked on October 7 that Netanyahu's government gained some reprieve. &nbsp;</p>

<p>But the attacks posed an additional problem for Netanyahu because they were a massive security failure that resulted in the &nbsp;largest loss of Jewish lives since the Holocaust.</p>

<p>Throughout his political career, Netanyahu has always portrayed himself as being the only politician capable of ensuring the safety and security of Jews and the state of Israel. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This includes refusing to accept the possibility of a Palestinian state, which he deems an existential security threat to Israel. &nbsp;The fact that Netanyahu presided over this massive security failure strikes at the core of his political popularity.</p>

<p>This made him vulnerable politically and increasingly beholden to his coalition partners to remain in power.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If any of these parties left the coalition, it would no longer hold a majority in the Knesset, meaning fresh elections that, &nbsp;given the current political climate, Netanyahu could conceivably lose. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Unable to influence the political and judicial process, Netanyahu would find himself at the mercy of the justice system he sought to undermine. &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Clinging to power</strong></h3>

<p>Consequently, Netanyahu is determined to do whatever is necessary to remain in power. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This means acceding to the nationalists' demands by advocating for negotiation positions he knows Hamas will reject.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite mounting political pressure, the government's dogmatic approach to negotiations gives the nationalists time to pursue their ideological objectives by altering irrevocably the face of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Since the Hamas attacks, there has been an explosion of Israeli settler outposts throughout the West Bank appropriating Palestinian land.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Israeli military has also recently launched the largest military incursion in the West Bank since October 2023. &nbsp;In addition to the more than 41,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza, more than &nbsp;650 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank.</p>

<p>While Israel claims it is combating terrorism, the ultimate purpose of these actions, alongside Israel's actions in Gaza, appears to be to crush any organised Palestinian resistance to Israeli occupation and its appropriation of Palestinian land. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If successful, the nationalists' dream of a wholly Jewish state from the river to the sea would be closer than ever. &nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A 40-year-old New York resident is facing serious charges after allegedly drugging and sexually assaulting women he met through an online ‘sugar daddy' website. Andrew J Gallo was arrested on Wednesday and charged with rape by causing impairment, strangulation, drug and alcohol offenses and corruption of minors, reported <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/man-charged-drugging-raping-women-met-sugar-daddy-113601790 ">ABC</a> News. He is currently being held on $500,000 cash bail following his arraignment.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Gallo is accused of drugging at least six women, ages 17 to 30, over the past 15 months. The investigation revealed that Gallo, using the alias “DREWSTER420” on SugarDaddiesMeet.com, laced his victims' drinks with drugs such as methamphetamine, ecstasy and cocaine. Gallo gave his victims alcohol mixed with these substances, leaving them immobile and unable to resist his advances.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Prosecutors revealed that the victims experienced a lack of control during the assaults, with Bucks County District Attorney Jen Schorn noting that Gallo's actions rendered the women so impaired that they were unable to consent to sexual acts.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">One of the earliest known incidents occurred on Christmas Eve last year, when a 24-year-old New Jersey woman met Gallo for dinner. She reported that after drinking a margarita Gallo prepared, she felt unusually disoriented and feared that if she fell asleep, she might not wake up. Authorities believe the drink was laced with methamphetamine, reported the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/09/11/andrew-gallo-pennsylvania-drug/ ">Washington Post</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Gallo also allegedly strangled some women until they nearly or completely passed out.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Gallo faces five counts of rape by causing impairment, six counts of drug possession, and four counts of strangulation. Other charges include corrupting and furnishing alcohol to minors.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Reports indicated that the drugs caused extreme effects, including hallucinations and staying awake for long hours. Some of the victims had to seek medical attention after spending time at his home.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Authorities are actively seeking other potential victims who may have met Gallo. As of now, Gallo does not have a listed attorney, and no legal representation appeared during his arraignment.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Defending his shock decision last week to declare martial law, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Thursday lashed out at his political opponents as "anti-state forces".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Defending his shock decision last week to declare martial law, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Thursday lashed out at his political opponents as "anti-state forces" and said suspension of civilian rule was needed to investigate the election commission, which was "hacked" by North Korea. Mr Yoon said his short-lived martial law order was a legal move to protect democracy.</p>

<p>The President's comments came as the leader of his own People Power Party (PPP) said Mr Yoon had shown no signs of resigning and must be impeached.</p>

<p>Mr Yoon, who is likely to face the second impeachment vote in parliament on Saturday, vowed to fight "until the very last minute". This would be the second impeachment vote against the President after the first one, a week ago, failed because most of the ruling party boycotted the vote.</p>

<p>"I apologize again to the people who must have been surprised and anxious due to the martial law," he said in a lengthy address broadcast on television.</p>

<p>Trying to justify his move of declaring emergency rule in the first place, the President said the "criminal groups" that have paralysed state affairs and disrupted the rule of law must be stopped at all costs from taking over the government.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Please trust me in my warm loyalty to the people," he said adding that the National Election Commission of South Korea was hacked by North Korea last year but the independent agency refused to cooperate in an investigation and inspection of its system to safeguard integrity.</p>

<p>Mr Yoon states the refusal was enough to raise questions about the integrity of the April 2024 election and led him to declare martial law.</p>

<p>The President's People Power Party suffered a crushing defeat in the April election, allowing the main opposition, the Democratic Party, to get overwhelming control of the single-chamber assembly.</p>

<p>"The National Assembly, dominated by the large opposition party, has become a monster that destroys the constitutional order of liberal democracy," Mr Yoon said in the televised address.</p>

<p>But, he said, he would "not avoid legal and political responsibility regarding the declaration of martial law".</p>

<h3><strong>Criminal Probe Against The President</strong></h3>

<p>The South Korean President is under criminal investigation for alleged insurrection over the botched December 3 martial law declaration that sparked the biggest political crisis in Asia's fourth-largest economy in decades. Lawmakers broke through a police cordon, some by scaling the fence, to enter the country's parliament and demand the President rescind the emergency decree within hours of the declaration.</p>

<p>A probe into last week's turmoil has swiftly gathered pace, with police on Wednesday attempting to raid the President's office. He has also been banned from foreign travel as part of an "insurrection" probe into his inner circle over the dramatic events of last week that stunned South Korea's allies.</p>

<p>The former interior minister and the general in charge of the martial law operation are also barred from foreign travel. Prosecutors have, meanwhile, arrested former Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun who is accused of suggesting to Mr Yoon that he impose martial law. Two top law informant officials have also been taken into custody as part of the ongoing probe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main opposition Democratic Party, meanwhile, warned it would file legal complaints for insurrection against the presidential staff and security if they continued to obstruct law enforcement. The opposition is also another impeachment motion against the President on Saturday, but it needs eight members of the PPP to vote with them to oust Mr Yoon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The President's party, which backed him during the first impeachment vote, said it would support the Saturday motion as Mr Yoon has not tendered his resignation as he "had to be stripped of power".</p>

<p>Just before Yoon's televised address, PPP leader Han Dong-hoon said Yoon had to be stripped of power and the only way to accomplish that was for the party to back the impeachment bill.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after 26-year-old Luigi Mangione was arrested for allegedly killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, investigators have found new evidence linking him to the murder.</p>

<p>According to the New York Police Department (NYPD), the 3D-printed gun that Mangione had when he was arrested in Pennsylvania, matched three shell casings found at the crime scene, reported CNN. The 9mm shell casings had the words "delay", "deny" and "depose" written across them on each bullet. These words were reportedly the title of a book criticising the insurance industry.</p>

<p>The investigators also revealed that Mangione's fingerprints were matched on the Starbucks water bottle and a KIND energy bar (a snack) wrapper found at the incident site on December 4. The police were primarily investigating the fingerprints as surveillance images reportedly showed Mangione buying these items around 30 minutes before the shooting.</p>

<p>Mangione, an Ivy League graduate, was arrested on Monday from a McDonalds in Pennsylvania, ending over a week-long manhunt after UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot down in Manhattan. The 26-year-old suspect is currently in custody and is facing multiple charges, including murder. He was denied bail at an extradition hearing at the Blair County Courthouse in Pennsylvania on Wednesday.</p>

<p>As Mangione entered the courthouse, shackled at the hands and feet and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, he yelled, "It's completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It's lived experience".</p>

<p>The suspect was reportedly arrested with a manifesto where he accused health insurance companies of putting corporate greed over the well-being of people - which led to theories that he may have killed the CEO over disappointment with the insurance provider. A trail of Mangione's social media posts also showed that he may have been driven by anger against the health insurance industry.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Since Bashar al-Assad's 24-year rule came to an end on Sunday, Israel, which borders Syria, has conducted hundreds of strikes in key Syrian cities, targeting key military and strategic installations.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military on Wednesday said it conducted more than 400 strikes over the past 48 hours on strategic military targets in Syria, days after Syrian rebels ousted president <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/syrian-president-bashar-al-assad-in-russia-confirms-senior-moscow-official-7219267" target="_blank">Bashar al-Assad</a>.</p>

<p>"Within the last 48 hours, the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) struck most of the strategic weapons stockpiles in Syria, preventing them from falling into the hands of terrorist elements," the military said in a statement.</p>

<p>The targets included 15 naval vessels at the two Syrian Navy facilities - the Al-Bayda port and the Latakia port, anti-aircraft batteries and weapons production sites in the capital Damascus and other key cities.</p>

<p>"Dozens of sea-to-sea missiles with ranges of 80-190 km were destroyed. Each missile carried significant explosive payloads, posing threats to civilian and military maritime vessels in the area," the military said.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Googles Willow chip, a breakthrough in quantum computing, has reignited debates about parallel universes, as it performs tasks at speeds that challenge traditional science.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fresh debate regarding parallel universes has recently resurfaced among scientists following the new quantum computing advancement at Google, called the Willow chip. Hartmut Neven, the head of Google Quantum AI, attributes Willow's exceptional speed with this interesting concept. In a matter of minutes, it can process tasks that traditional supercomputers can only do in billions of years. Willow's features signify a big technological advancement and fuel enthusiasm and excitement toward the new possibilities unlocked about quantum mechanics.</p>

<p>"Willow has state-of-the-art performance across a number of metrics, enabling two major achievements. The first is that Willow can reduce errors exponentially as we scale up using more qubits. This cracks a key challenge in quantum error correction that the field has pursued for almost 30 years. Second, Willow performed a standard benchmark computation in under five minutes that would take one of today's fastest supercomputers 10 septillion (that is, 1025) years - a number that vastly exceeds the age of the Universe," Hartmut Neven said in a blog post on <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/"><em>Google's website.</em></a></p>

<p>"Willow's performance on this benchmark is astonishing: It performed a computation in under five minutes that would take one of today's fastest supercomputers 1025 or 10 septillion years."</p>

<p>"If you want to write it out, it's 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years. This mind-boggling number exceeds known timescales in physics and vastly exceeds the age of the universe. It lends credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes, in line with the idea that we live in a multiverse, a prediction first made by David Deutsch," said the lead of Google Quantum AI in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/">blog post.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk, whose wealth has been turbocharged since President-elect Donald Trump's win last month, became the first person to reach $400 billion in net worth, the latest milestone for the world's richest individual.</p>

<p>The most recent catalyst was an insider share sale of his privately held SpaceX, which boosted Musk's net worth by roughly $50 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Tesla Inc. shares also rallied to an all-time high Wednesday, pushing Musk's fortune to $447 billion.</p>

<p>Musk's one-day wealth jump of $62.8 billion is the largest on record, and helped propel the combined fortunes of the world's richest 500 people above $10 trillion, also for the first time, according to the index. The group's net worths are similar in size to last year's combined gross domestic products of Germany, Japan and Australia, according to data compiled by the World Bank.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Musk has added about $218 billion to his net worth since the start of 2024, more than any other member of the group. Tesla shares, which make up the bulk of Musk's fortune, have gained 71% this year and closed Wednesday at $424.77, their first record high since 2021.</p>

<p>Expectations that Trump will streamline the rollout of self-driving cars and eliminate tax credits for electric vehicles that help the company's competitors has helped buoy Tesla's stock. Musk is also slated to occupy a key role in the new administration as co-head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency. While it will work outside the government, it gives him a bully pulpit in Washington and a direct line to the Oval Office.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the value of his artificial intelligence startup, xAI, has more than doubled to $50 billion since it last raised money in May, with the Wall Street Journal reporting in November that Trump's victory helped drive new interest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Wednesday, SpaceX and its investors agreed to purchase $1.25 billion of shares from employees and other company insiders. The deal, which values the privately held space exploration firm at about $350 billion, makes SpaceX the most valuable private startup in the world.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">What's really crazy about this is that almost no investors wanted to sell shares even at a $350B valuation!<br />
<br />
SpaceX reduced the amount of shares it bought back from employees in order to allow some new investors in.</p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1866789126814699824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>The company makes most of its money on contracts with the US government, and can likely depend on more support under a Trump administration. The president-elect lauded Musk's vision of putting astronauts on Mars in campaign speeches, and joined Musk at a SpaceX launch in Texas shortly after the election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jared Isaacman, Trump's pick for NASA head, is a billionaire tech executive who made the first commercial spacewalk on a chartered SpaceX launch in September. He praised the company as "the most innovative, literally impressive organization that I've ever seen" last month after investing $27.5 million in SpaceX through his payments firm in 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Musk, 53, was handed a piece of bad news last week when a Delaware judge struck down his 2018 Tesla pay package, currently valued at more than $100 billion, for a second time. Tesla said it would appeal the decision, which Musk described as "absolute corruption" on X. Even if Musk's compensation award is ultimately clawed back, he would still be the world's richest person by a long shot.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syria's new prime minister said the Islamist-led alliance that ousted president Bashar al-Assad will guarantee minority rights, in an interview published on Wednesday, also calling on the millions who fled the war to return home.</p>

<p>Assad fled Syria after a lightning offensive spearheaded by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group and its allies, which brought to a spectacular end five decades of brutal rule by his clan.</p>

<p>Syrians across the country and around the world erupted in celebration, after enduring a stifling era during which anyone suspected of dissent could be thrown into jail or killed.</p>

<p>With Assad's overthrow plunging Syria into the unknown, its new rulers have sought to assure religious minorities that they will not repress them.</p>

<p>They have also pledged justice for the victims of Assad's iron-fisted rule, with HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani vowing that officials involved in torturing detainees will not be pardoned.</p>

<p>"We will not pardon those involved in torturing detainees," said Jolani, now using his real name Ahmed al-Sharaa, urging "countries to hand over any of those criminals who may have fled so they can be brought to justice".</p>

<p>In the corridors of Damascus's main hospitals, thousands of families gathered to try to find the bodies of loved ones captured years ago by the authorities.</p>

<p>"Where are our children?" women cried out as they grasped at the walls, desperate for closure after their years-long ordeal.</p>

<p><strong>'Starting to feel safe'&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Sunni Muslim HTS is rooted in Syria's branch of Al-Qaeda and is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by many Western governments, though it has sought to moderate its rhetoric.</p>

<p>"Precisely because we are Islamic, we will guarantee the rights of all people and all sects in Syria," Mohammad al-Bashir, whom the rebels appointed as the transitional head of government, told Italian daily Corriere della Sera.</p>

<p>Bashir, whose appointment was announced on Tuesday, is tasked with heading the multi-ethnic, multi-confessional country until March 1.</p>

<p>After decades of rule by the Assads, Syrians now face the enormous challenge of charting a new course as they emerge from nearly 14 years of war.</p>

<p>In Aleppo, Syria's second city and the first major one captured by the rebels in their offensive, shopkeeper Ramadan Dali, 70, said that "we are starting to feel safe."</p>

<p>Juman Khilaly, 40, said that "there is still a lot of uncertainty" over even the most basic aspects of life, like school for her 10-year-old child and soaring prices.</p>

<p>"Everything is so expensive," she said.</p>

<p>In the Assads' home village Qardaha, the tomb of the former leader's father was set alight, AFP footage showed, with rebel fighters in fatigues and young men watching it burn.</p>

<p>The Baath party of the deposed president announced it would suspend its work "in all its forms... until further notice" and hand over assets to the authorities.</p>

<p><strong>'Smooth transition'</strong></p>

<p>Syria's war has killed more than 500,000 people and forced half the population to flee their homes, with six million of them seeking refuge abroad.</p>

<p>In his interview with Corriere della Sera, Bashir called on Syrians abroad to return to their homeland.</p>

<p>"Syria is now a free country that has earned its pride and dignity. Come back," he said.</p>

<p>The main international airport in Damascus, closed since the rebels overran the capital, will reopen "in the next few days", its director Anis Fallouh told AFP.</p>

<p>Bashir said Syria's new rulers would be willing to work with anyone so long as they did not defend Assad.</p>

<p>The United Nations' envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, urged an inclusive process, telling AFP that his "biggest concern is that the transition will create new contradictions in the manner that could lead to new civil strife".</p>

<p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the world body was "totally committed to supporting a smooth transition of power".</p>

<p>Assad was propped up by Russia, where he reportedly fled, as well as Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the Kremlin said it wanted to see stabilisation in Syria "soon", as it criticised Israel over hundreds of air strikes it conducted on its neighbour over the past few days.</p>

<p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said that Israeli air strikes on Wednesday had targeted sites belonging to Assad's military in the coastal Latakia and Tartus provinces.</p>

<p>"Israeli warplanes continue to destroy what remains of Syria's military arsenal for the fourth consecutive day since the fall of the former regime," the Britain-based monitor said.</p>

<p><strong>'Test him'</strong></p>

<p>Some Western governments have also cautioned against military action by foreign powers.</p>

<p>Germany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Syrian "neighbours such as the Turkish and Israeli governments, which are asserting their security interests, must not jeopardise" the transition of power.</p>

<p>France called on Israel to withdraw troops from the buffer zone separating the annexed Golan Heights from Syrian territory, and Spain urged respect for Syria's "territorial integrity".</p>

<p>Assad had faced down protests and an armed rebellion for more than a decade before his fall.</p>

<p>The rebels launched their offensive on November 27, the same day that a ceasefire took effect in the Israel-Hezbollah war, which saw Israel inflict staggering losses in the ranks of Assad's Lebanese ally.</p>

<p>Qatar, which has backed Assad's opponents, said Wednesday it would reopen its embassy in Damascus "soon".</p>

<p>Robert Ford, the last US ambassador to Syria, pointed with hope to post-victory statements by Jolani, including welcoming international monitoring of any chemical weapons that are discovered.</p>

<p>"I'm not saying trust Jolani... But I sure as hell want to test him on some of these things," said Ford, now a senior fellow at the US-based Middle East Institute.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the days since Luigi Mangione was charged with murder for gunning down a top health insurance executive, more than a thousand donations have poured into an online fundraiser for his legal defense, with messages supporting him and even celebrating the crime.</p>

<p>In New York, "Wanted" posters with the faces of CEOs have appeared on walls. Websites are selling Mangione merchandise, including hats with "CEO Hunter" printed across a bullseye. And some social media users have swooned over his smile and six-pack abs.</p>

<p>Mangione has been charged with murder for the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, a father of two, in a brazen shooting on Dec. 4 outside a Manhattan hotel before an industry conference, setting off a five-day manhunt for the masked assailant.</p>

<p>The crime he is accused of has been broadly condemned, but the Ivy League educated, photogenic 26-year-old has become an unsettling mixture of folk hero, celebrity, and online crush in certain circles. His support has only seemingly intensified since his arrest on Monday.</p>

<p>Most of the messages on the crowd-sourced fundraising site GiveSendGo reflect a deep frustration shared by many Americans over the U.S. healthcare system - where some treatments and reimbursements can be denied to patients depending on their insurance coverage - as well as broader anger over rising income inequality and soaring executive pay.</p>

<p>"Denying healthcare coverage to people is murder, but no one gets charged with that crime," one donor wrote, calling the killing a "justifiable homicide."</p>

<p>Several others simply wrote, "Deny, Defend, Depose" - the words reportedly written on the shell casings found at the murder scene and intended to invoke tactics some accuse insurers of using to avoid paying out claims.</p>

<p>More than $31,000 had been raised as of Wednesday on GiveSendGo alone.</p>

<p>Felipe Rodriguez, a former NYPD detective sergeant, expressed dismay at the reaction.</p>

<p>"They've made him a martyr for all the troubles people have had with their own insurance companies," said Rodriguez, now an adjunct professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. "I mean, who hasn't had run-ins with their insurance? But he's a stone-cold killer."</p>

<p>Mangione is being held in Pennsylvania on gun and forgery charges while prosecutors in New York seek his extradition. His lawyer said he plans to plead not guilty to the Pennsylvania charges.</p>

<p><strong>Frustration And Anger</strong></p>

<p>On Wednesday, New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said police have matched a gun found on Mangione with the shell casings recovered at the scene and his fingerprints with a water bottle and energy bar wrapper found nearby.</p>

<p>Other evidence includes handwritten documents found in his possession casting his alleged crime as a legitimate response to what he viewed as corporate greed, some media outlets have reported.</p>

<p>Mangione lashed out himself on Tuesday as he was led into a courthouse, shouting in part, "...completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people!"</p>

<p>Americans pay more for health care than residents of any other country, and data shows spending on insurance premiums, out-of-pocket costs, pharmaceuticals and hospital services has all increased over the last five years.</p>

<p>Health insurers like UnitedHealth most often manage health benefits on behalf of employers and the government, which have a say in what services and drugs are covered.</p>

<p>Mangione suffered from chronic back pain that impacted his daily life, according to friends and social media posts, though it is unclear whether his personal health played a role in the shooting.</p>

<p>"It's hard to underestimate the anger and angst people have with their insurance companies," said David Shapiro, a former FBI agent and a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.</p>

<p>Shapiro said he had never seen anything like the reaction to Mangione, but added: "It's not so farfetched given the mood of the country and the ease of cheering this anonymously on the Internet."</p>

<p>On TikTok, users shared videos and photos of Mangione's outburst with messages of praise, such as "this man is an absolute legend" and "class consciousness is rising."</p>

<p>Several sites were selling T-shirts bearing his face with messages such as "FREE LUIGI" and "In This House, Luigi Mangione Is A Hero, End of Story." Others sold hats with the phrase "Don't Deny My Coverage."</p>

<p><strong>'Deeply Disturbing'</strong></p>

<p>Support was by no means universal, however.</p>

<p>Several commentators on social media noted Mangione's privileged background as a member of a prominent Baltimore, Maryland family, as compared to Thompson's working class upbringing in rural Iowa, and said the murder was an example of how anti-capitalist rhetoric can incite violence. Others described how their health insurance plans paid for life-saving treatment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Wednesday, UnitedHealth Group Inc CEO Andrew Witty sent employees a letter praising Thompson. "Brian was one of the good guys," he wrote. "I'm going to miss him. And I am incredibly proud to call him my friend."</p>

<p>Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro condemned those valorizing Mangione on Monday, calling the response "deeply disturbing."</p>

<p>"In America, we do not kill people in cold blood to resolve policy differences or express a viewpoint," he said.</p>

<p>At a panel at the Reuters NEXT conference in New York on Wednesday, executives from Pfizer and Amazon said health care companies are taking a step back to better understand patients' experiences.</p>

<p>"Our health system needs to be better ... There's a lot of things that should cause a lot of outrage," Amazon Pharmacy Chief Medical Officer Vin Gupta said. "It's also true that (the killing) should not have happened. There cannot be this false moral equivalence in our discourse."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American and European stock markets mostly rose on Wednesday after inflation data cemented expectations that the US Federal Reserve will trim interest rates next month.</p>

<p>While the Dow fell slightly, the other two major US indices advanced, led by the tech-rich Nasdaq, which piled on almost two percent to close above 20,000 points for the first time.</p>

<p>The consumer price index (CPI) rose to 2.7 percent last month from a year ago, up slightly from 2.6 percent in October.</p>

<p>"With the CPI numbers broadly in line, it is likely that the Fed will not be derailed and will cut rates again next week," Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.</p>

<p>"The data is not a showstopper for the current bull run on Wall Street," he added.</p>

<p>Ahead of the data, investors priced in an 86 percent chance the Fed will cut interest rates next week by a quarter percentage point. That rose to more than 98 percent after the CPI data was published.</p>

<p>Stocks in Paris and Frankfurt rose ahead of the European Central Bank's own interest rate announcement on Thursday, with analysts expecting another cut as it seeks to boost eurozone growth.</p>

<p>Investors are also eyeing political developments in France, where officials said President Emmanuel Macron aims to name a new prime minister "within 48 hours" as he seeks to end political deadlock following the ouster of Michel Barnier.</p>

<p>In company news, shares in German retail giant Zalando shed more than four percent on Frankfurt's DAX index, after it acquired domestic rival About You in a deal worth around 1.1 billion euros ($1.2 billion).</p>

<p>Shares in Zara owner Inditex slid more than six percent after a record quarterly profit for the group fell short of market estimates.</p>

<p>Among US companies, Google parent Alphabet earned 5.5 percent as it announced the launch of Gemini 2.0, its most advanced artificial intelligence model to date. That added to gains after Google also announced Tuesday details of a breakthrough quantum chip.</p>

<p>Shares in Shanghai rose but Hong Kong gave up an early rally to end in the red.</p>

<p>Traders were keeping tabs on China to see if it will announce further measures to support its struggling economy as leaders were to gather Wednesday for a conference to hammer out next year's agenda.</p>

<p>President Xi Jinping and other top leaders on Monday announced their first major shift in policy for more than a decade, saying they would "implement a more active fiscal policy and an appropriately relaxed" strategy.</p>

<p>Those remarks sparked hopes for more interest rate cuts and the freeing up of more cash for lending.</p>

<p><strong>Key figures around 2150 GMT</strong></p>

<p>New York - Dow: DOWN 0.2 percent at 44,148.56 (close)</p>

<p>New York - S&amp;P 500: UP 0.8 percent at 6,084.19 (close)</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Although Biden and Trump are working separately, their efforts overlap and both stand to gain from a deal. A U.S. official said Trump's public statements about the need for a swift ceasefire "have not been harmful."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israelis and Palestinians are signaling new efforts to forge a ceasefire deal, even a limited one, for the first time in a year that would pause the fighting in Gaza and return to Israel some of the hostages still held in the Palestinian enclave.</p>

<p>Israel Defence Minister Israel Katz told his U.S. counterpart Lloyd Austin in a phone call on Wednesday there was now a chance for a new deal that would allow the return of all the hostages, including US citizens, Mr Katz's office said.</p>

<p>A Western diplomat in the region, however, said a deal was taking shape, but it would likely be limited in scope, involving the release of only a handful of hostages and a short pause in hostilities.</p>

<p>Such a truce and release would be only the second since the start of the war in October 2023.</p>

<p>The guarded optimism emerges as US President Joe Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan heads to Israel for talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday and then to Egypt and Qatar, co-mediators with the US on a deal.</p>

<p>Separately, President-elect Donald Trump has demanded that militants of the Palestinian Hamas group release the hostages held in Gaza before he takes over from Mr Biden on Jan. 20. Otherwise, Mr Trump has said, there will be “hell to pay.”</p>

<p>Mr Trump's designated hostage envoy Adam Boehler has said he too is involved, having spoken already to Mr Biden and to Mr Netanyahu. Israel says 100 hostages remain captive in Gaza. Seven are believed to be US citizens.</p>

<p>Citing Mr Trump's threat of "hell to pay," Boehler told Israel's Channel 13 news last week: "I would appeal to those people that have taken hostages: Make your best deal now. Make it now because every day that passes, it is going to get harder and harder and more Hamas lives will be lost."</p>

<p>Although Mr Biden and Mr Trump are working separately, their efforts overlap and both stand to gain from a deal. A US official said Trump's public statements about the need for a swift ceasefire “have not been harmful.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The official said the priority is to get the hostages home, whether it is at the end of the Mr Biden term or the start of the Mr Trump term.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Steve Witkoff, Mr Trump's designated Middle East envoy, met separately in late November with Mr Netanyahu and Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said a source briefed on the talks.</p>

<h3><strong>TIMING IS APT FOR NETANYAHU</strong></h3>

<p>The timing for a deal may never have been better politically for Mr Netanyahu.</p>

<p>The prime minister told reporters on Monday that Hamas' increasing isolation following the collapse of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad's rule opened the door to a possible hostage deal even if it was too early to claim success.</p>

<p>Israel's military chief and the head of the Shin Bet internal security service were in Cairo on Tuesday to discuss post-war Gaza border crossings and administration, according to three Israeli security sources.</p>

<p>The public optimism of Israeli leaders over the past week has matched the general tone in internal discussions behind closed doors, according to an Israeli official.</p>

<p>For Mr Netanyahu, concessions would be far easier now with Israel having reestablished its reputation as the most powerful Middle East force and its Iran-backed enemies in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria now posing less of a threat.</p>

<p>Mr Netanyahu's once-fragile coalition has been strengthened by the addition of Foreign Minister Gideon Saar and his more centrist faction. Mr Netanyahu, having achieved a ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon, can complete the picture with the return of the hostages in a deal with Hamas.</p>

<p>Over the past year, some of the far-right ministers in his cabinet had voiced objections, even threatening to bring down the government, should the war in Gaza end. But with Israel's enemies weakened, and his coalition strengthened, Netanyahu is far less vulnerable politically.</p>

<p>Mr Saar said on Monday that Israel was now more optimistic about a possible hostage deal amid reports Hamas had asked other Gaza factions to help it compile a list of Israeli and foreign hostages in their custody, whether dead or alive.</p>

<p>A Palestinian official close to the talks and familiar with the positions of all the parties involved described what he called "a fever of negotiations" with ideas emerging on all sides, including among mediators in Egypt and Qatar.</p>

<p>Mr Trump's involvement had given the talks a boost, even if the sides have yet to present lists of Palestinian prisoners and hostages to be exchanged or to complete plans for a temporary or phased truce, the Palestinian official said.</p>

<p>He said Hamas was willing to show some flexibility should there be guarantees Israel would not resume the fighting.</p>

<p>It is unclear how the sides can bridge the largest gap that has persisted through numerous rounds of failed negotiations; Hamas demands an end to the war, while Israel says the war will not end before Hamas no longer rules Gaza.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken headed to Jordan and Turkey on Wednesday for talks on Syria, the State Department said. Israel is not in his official itinerary but there is always a possibility he might add the stop.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta-owned Instagram said its services were back online after thousands of users experienced technical issues accessing its platform on Wednesday, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com.</p>

<p>At the peak of the outage, which started around 12:50 p.m. ET., more than 1,00,000 incidents were reported with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/whatsapp-instagram-and-facebook-down-for-thousands-globally-7227085">Facebook</a> and nearly 70,000 with Instagram.</p>

<p>The number of reports has come down to over 1,000 for both apps as of 6 p.m. ET.</p>

<p>Downdetector's numbers are based on user-submitted reports. The actual number of affected users may vary.</p>

<p>Some Facebook and Instagram users posted on X that they were encountering an error that said "something went wrong" and that Meta was working to get it fixed.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, a technical issue led to an outage that impacted hundreds of thousands of Facebook and Instagram users globally for more than two.</p>

<p>The platforms faced another outage in October when services were largely restored within an hour.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FBI Director Chris Wray will step down from his post early next year, he said on Wednesday, after Republican President-elect Donald Trump signaled his intent to fire the veteran official and replace him with firebrand Kash Patel.</p>

<p>His resignation makes him the second straight FBI director driven out by Mr Trump, who during his first term in office fired Wray's predecessor James Comey, after souring on him over the FBI's investigations into alleged contacts between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia.</p>

<p>Mr Wray will leave before the end of the 10-year term that Trump himself appointed him to in 2017.</p>

<p>"In my view, this is the best way to avoid dragging the bureau deeper into the fray, while reinforcing the values and principles that are so important to how we do our work," Mr Wray told FBI employees in a town hall meeting.</p>

<p>Mr Trump and his hardline allies turned on Wray, and the FBI more generally, after agents conducted a court-approved search of Mr Trump's Florida resort in 2022 to recover classified documents he had retained after leaving office.</p>

<p>That sparked one of two federal prosecutions Trump faced while out of power, neither of which went to trial. Mr Trump denied wrongdoing and described all the cases against him as politically motivated. Federal prosecutors ended their efforts after his election, citing longstanding Justice Department policy not to prosecute a sitting president.</p>

<p>Mr Trump's Republican allies joined him in alleging that the FBI had become politicized, though there is no evidence that Democratic President Joe Biden interfered with its investigative processes.</p>

<p>On his social media platform Truth Social, Mr Trump called Wray's resignation "a great day for America."</p>

<p>"It will end the Weaponization of what has become known as the United States Department of Injustice. I just don't know what happened to him," Mr Trump wrote.</p>

<p>As he has built out his roster of Cabinet officials over the past few weeks, Mr Trump has assembled a team ready to carry out two of his biggest priorities: retribution against his political adversaries and a wholesale reshaping of the US government.</p>

<p>Mr Patel, who would need to be confirmed by the US Senate, has never worked at the FBI and only spent three years at the Justice Department earlier in his career in the National Security Division's Counterterrorism Section. If confirmed, he has pledged to shut down the FBI's headquarters building in Washington and drastically redefine the bureau's role with intelligence-gathering.</p>

<p>In a statement to Reuters, Mr Patel said, "I will be ready to serve the American people on day one."</p>

<p>Mr Trump allies welcomed the news.</p>

<p>"Reform is badly needed at FBI," Republican Senator Charles Grassley wrote on X, adding the American people deserve transparency and accountability.</p>

<h3><strong>WRAY DENIED BIAS</strong></h3>

<p>Throughout his term, Mr Wray said that he strove to impartially carry out the FBI's duties. During a 2023 hearing before a House of Representatives panel he rebuffed the idea that he was pursuing a Democratic partisan agenda, noting that he had been a lifelong Republican.</p>

<p>"The idea that I am biased against conservatives seems somewhat insane to me, given my own personal background," Mr Wray said.</p>

<p>FBI directors are appointed for 10-year terms, a measure meant to avoid the appearance of partisanship after political turnover in the White House every four years.</p>

<p>Mr Wray's term was not due to expire until 2027.</p>

<p>Senate Democrats on Wednesday thanked Wray for his service, with some raising concern for the bureau's future without him.</p>

<p>"The FBI is critical to our nation's security and our families' safety," Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin said. "It will soon embark on a perilous new era with serious questions about its future."</p>

<p>The FBI Agents Association in a statement said the bureau's mission "does not waver when there are changes in a presidential administration."</p>

<p>US Attorney General Merrick Garland also praised Wray, noting in a statement that the FBI director is charged with protecting the bureau's independence from "inappropriate influence" in its criminal investigations.</p>

<p>"That independence is central to preserving the rule of law," said Mr Garland.</p>

<h3><strong>FISA WARRANTS, JAN. 6 PROBES</strong></h3>

<p>The FBI has faced increasing criticism by Mr Trump's supporters for its various roles in investigating Trump over the years.</p>

<p>Some of the concerns pre-dated Mr Wray's tenure, including several damning reports by the Justice Department's inspector general which faulted the bureau for making errors in its warrant applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court during its early investigation into Mr Trump's 2016 campaign known as "Crossfire Hurricane."</p>

<p>During his tenure, Mr Wray has overseen reforms of the FBI's processes for securing FISA warrants.</p>

<p>The FBI during Mr Wray's time has also played a major role in helping to investigate and arrest many Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a failed bid to block Congress from certifying Biden's election victory.</p>

<p>More than 1,500 people were criminally charged in the attack.</p>

<p>Mr Trump has pledged to grant clemency to some of the Jan. 6 defendants, though he has not provided details.</p>

<p>Throughout his time as FBI director, Mr Wray has been known for his hawkish views on China, and has frequently warned that China represents the biggest national and economic security threat facing the United States.</p>

<p>Mr Wray started his career at the Justice Department in 1997 as a federal prosecutor in Atlanta.</p>

<p>He was nominated by Republican President George W Bush in 2003 to lead the department's Criminal Division, where he oversaw a variety of investigations including post-9/11 efforts to combat terrorism and the Enron Task Force.</p>

<p>Mr Wray also practiced law for about 17 years with the law firm King &amp; Spalding, and he clerked for former Judge J Michael Luttig in the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit after earning his law degree from Yale Law School.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump will ring the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday on the same day he is expected to be named Time magazine's "Person of the Year", according to two people familiar with the selection and plans.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Time declined to comment on the selection.</p>

<p>The Republican president-elect built his fortune as a New York real estate investor before turning to politics. During his first term as president, he measured his success in part by the strength of the stock market, which has so far welcomed his re-election.</p>

<p>The ringing of the bell signifies the start or closing of the trading day at the world's largest stock exchange, and is considered an honor. The act has historically been reserved for company executives celebrating an initial public offering or other major corporate milestones, but celebrities and politicians like Ronald Reagan, Nelson Mandela and Arnold Schwarzenegger have also rung it.</p>

<p>Politico first reported the news of Mr Trump's selection and plans.</p>

<p>Time bestowed the "Person of the Year" title to Mr Trump once before, in 2016. It named Democratic President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris "Person of the Year" in 2020, after they defeated Mr Trump. Pop star Taylor Swift received the title last year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to attend his inauguration next month, CBS News reported on Wednesday, citing multiple sources.</p>

<p>The invitation to the Jan. 20 inauguration in Washington occurred in early November, shortly after the Nov. 5 presidential election, and it was not clear if it had been accepted, CBS reported.</p>

<p>The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Trump said in an interview with NBC News conducted on Friday that he "got along with very well" with Xi and that they had "had communication as recently as this week."</p>

<p>Trump has named numerous China hawks to key posts in his incoming administration, including Senator Marco Rubio as secretary of state.</p>

<p>Trump has said he will impose an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods unless Beijing does more to stop the trafficking of the highly addictive narcotic fentanyl. He also threatened tariffs in excess of 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>In late November, China's state media warned Trump that his pledge to slap additional tariffs on Chinese goods over fentanyl flows could drag the world's top two economies into a mutually destructive tariff war.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syria's new prime minister said the Islamist-led alliance that ousted president Bashar al-Assad will guarantee minority rights, in an interview published on Wednesday, also calling on the millions who fled the war to return home.</p>

<p>Assad fled Syria after a lightning offensive spearheaded by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group and its allies, which brought to a spectacular end five decades of brutal rule by his clan.</p>

<p>Syrians across the country and around the world erupted in celebration, after enduring a stifling era during which anyone suspected of dissent could be thrown into jail or killed.</p>

<p>With Assad's overthrow plunging Syria into the unknown, its new rulers have sought to assure religious minorities that they will not repress them.</p>

<p>They have also pledged justice for the victims of Assad's iron-fisted rule, with HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani vowing that officials involved in torturing detainees will not be pardoned.</p>

<p>"We will not pardon those involved in torturing detainees," said Jolani, now using his real name Ahmed al-Sharaa, urging "countries to hand over any of those criminals who may have fled so they can be brought to justice".</p>

<p>In the corridors of Damascus's main hospitals, thousands of families gathered to try to find the bodies of loved ones captured years ago by the authorities.</p>

<p>"Where are our children?" women cried out as they grasped at the walls, desperate for closure after their years-long ordeal.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Starting to feel safe' -</strong></p>

<p>Sunni Muslim HTS is rooted in Syria's branch of Al-Qaeda and is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by many Western governments, though it has sought to moderate its rhetoric.</p>

<p>"Precisely because we are Islamic, we will guarantee the rights of all people and all sects in Syria," Mohammad al-Bashir, whom the rebels appointed as the transitional head of government, told Italian daily Corriere della Sera.</p>

<p>Bashir, whose appointment was announced on Tuesday, is tasked with heading the multi-ethnic, multi-confessional country until March 1.</p>

<p>After decades of rule by the Assads, Syrians now face the enormous challenge of charting a new course as they emerge from nearly 14 years of war.</p>

<p>In Aleppo, Syria's second city and the first major one captured by the rebels in their offensive, shopkeeper Ramadan Dali, 70, said that "we are starting to feel safe."</p>

<p>Juman Khilaly, 40, said that "there is still a lot of uncertainty" over even the most basic aspects of life, like school for her 10-year-old child and soaring prices.</p>

<p>"Everything is so expensive," she said.</p>

<p>In the Assads' home village Qardaha, the tomb of the former leader's father was set alight, AFP footage showed, with rebel fighters in fatigues and young men watching it burn.</p>

<p>The Baath party of the deposed president announced it would suspend its work "in all its forms... until further notice" and hand over assets to the authorities.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Smooth transition' -</strong></p>

<p>Syria's war has killed more than 500,000 people and forced half the population to flee their homes, with six million of them seeking refuge abroad.</p>

<p>In his interview with Corriere della Sera, Bashir called on Syrians abroad to return to their homeland.</p>

<p>"Syria is now a free country that has earned its pride and dignity. Come back," he said.</p>

<p>The main international airport in Damascus, closed since the rebels overran the capital, will reopen "in the next few days", its director Anis Fallouh told AFP.</p>

<p>Bashir said Syria's new rulers would be willing to work with anyone so long as they did not defend Assad.</p>

<p>The United Nations' envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, urged an inclusive process, telling AFP that his "biggest concern is that the transition will create new contradictions in the manner that could lead to new civil strife".</p>

<p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the world body was "totally committed to supporting a smooth transition of power".</p>

<p>Assad was propped up by Russia, where he reportedly fled, as well as Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the Kremlin said it wanted to see stabilisation in Syria "soon", as it criticised Israel over hundreds of air strikes it conducted on its neighbour over the past few days.</p>

<p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said that Israeli air strikes on Wednesday had targeted sites belonging to Assad's military in the coastal Latakia and Tartus provinces.</p>

<p>"Israeli warplanes continue to destroy what remains of Syria's military arsenal for the fourth consecutive day since the fall of the former regime," the Britain-based monitor said.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Test him' -</strong></p>

<p>Some Western governments have also cautioned against military action by foreign powers.</p>

<p>Germany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Syrian "neighbours such as the Turkish and Israeli governments, which are asserting their security interests, must not jeopardise" the transition of power.</p>

<p>France called on Israel to withdraw troops from the buffer zone separating the annexed Golan Heights from Syrian territory, and Spain urged respect for Syria's "territorial integrity".</p>

<p>Assad had faced down protests and an armed rebellion for more than a decade before his fall.</p>

<p>The rebels launched their offensive on November 27, the same day that a ceasefire took effect in the Israel-Hezbollah war, which saw Israel inflict staggering losses in the ranks of Assad's Lebanese ally.</p>

<p>Qatar, which has backed Assad's opponents, said Wednesday it would reopen its embassy in Damascus "soon".</p>

<p>Robert Ford, the last US ambassador to Syria, pointed with hope to post-victory statements by Jolani, including welcoming international monitoring of any chemical weapons that are discovered.</p>

<p>"I'm not saying trust Jolani... But I sure as hell want to test him on some of these things," said Ford, now a senior fellow at the US-based Middle East Institute.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli forces conducted a first withdrawal from a town in south Lebanon and were replaced by the Lebanese military under a ceasefire deal, the US Central Command (CENTCOM) said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The command's leader General Erik Kurilla "was present at the implementation and monitoring headquarters today during the ongoing first Israeli Defense Forces withdrawal and Lebanese Armed Forces replacement in Al-Khiam, Lebanon as part of the (ceasefire) agreement," CENTCOM said in a statement.</p>

<p>"This is an important first step in the implementation of a lasting cessation of hostilities and lays the foundation for continued progress," the statement quoted Kurilla as saying.</p>

<p>The Israeli military had earlier said its 7th Brigade had "concluded their mission in Khiam in southern Lebanon."</p>

<p>"In accordance with the ceasefire understandings and with the coordination of the United States, soldiers of the Lebanese Armed Forces are being deployed in the area together" with UNIFIL, it said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Israel stepped up its military campaign in south Lebanon in late September after nearly a year of cross-border exchanges begun by Hezbollah in support of its ally Hamas, following the Palestinian group's October 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel.</p>

<p>A ceasefire came into effect on November 27 and is generally holding, though both sides have accused the other of repeated violations.</p>

<p>As part of the agreement, the Lebanese army and United Nations peacekeepers will deploy in southern Lebanon as the Israeli army withdraws over a period of 60 days.</p>

<p>Hezbollah is also meant to withdraw its forces north of the Litani river, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the border, and dismantle its military infrastructure in southern Lebanon.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India and the United Arab Emirates will look to further their already-strong strategic partnership to an all-time high when External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his counterpart Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan will meet in Delhi today for a comprehensive strategic dialogue.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar and Sheikh Al Nahyan will review the entire gamut of ties between India and UAE and focus on enhancing the strategic partnership. The meeting also assumes significance as it comes close on the heels of the regime change in Syria.</p>

<p>West Asia, popularly called the Middle-East by Western nations, is at a critical juncture, with tensions between Israel and Iran simmering, the situation in Syria being extremely volatile, and Turkey launching strikes on Syria too. Bashar Al-Assad has been granted asylum in Moscow and Russia has lost its access to the Mediterranean Sea with the Tartus naval base in Syria now no longer in its control.</p>

<p>The two leaders will discuss the crises in the middle-east in great detail. Besides geopolitics, and strategic ties, Mr Jaishankar and Sheikh Al Nahyan will have a comprehensive dialogue on other aspects of the bilateral relationship between India and UAE, including trade and commerce, investment, cultural and scientific ties, among others.</p>

<p>Sheikh Al Nahyan, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister of UAE, will then call on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>

<p>It was Prime Minister Modi's historic visit to the UAE in August 2015 that elevated the bilateral relationship between the two countries to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.</p>

<p>The two nations also signed the landmark Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement or CEPA in 2022 which resulted in a massive upswing in trade and investment between the two sides. The trade deal led to the elimination of several tariffs and significantly lowered other levies. This further led to enhanced market access across various sectors.</p>

<p>Today, India and the UAE are among each others top trading partners, and the bilateral trade between the two countries stood at around USD 85 billion in 2022-23. UAE was also among the top four investors in India in terms of Foreign Direct Investments or FDI in 2022-23.</p>

<p>The two leaders will aim to build on these and scale up economic ties when they meet in New Delhi tomorrow. Mr Jaishankar might also raise the issue of visa applications reportedly being denied to Indians after new rules have been set in the UAE.</p>

<p>Dubai's emigration department recently introduced stricter requirements for tourist visas, mandating travelers to provide hotel booking documents with QR codes and a copy of their return tickets. For travelers staying with relatives, additional proof of accommodation is needed by the latter. This has reportedly led to a significant rise in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/indians-facing-mass-dubai-visa-rejection-after-new-application-rules-report-7201189" target="_blank">visa applications being rejected</a>.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will undergo another operation Thursday to "minimize the risk of future bleeding" in an area under his skull that received emergency surgery this week, his doctor said.</p>

<p>The 79-year-old president's doctor, Roberto Kalil, told journalists on Wednesday outside the Hospital Sirio-Libanes where Lula is convalescing that the procedure was an "expected" follow-up to the surgery carried out on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The hospital said in a medical bulletin: "As part of his treatment, complementary to the surgery, an endovascular procedure (embolization of the middle meningeal artery) will be carried out tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>The facility added that Lula was otherwise well.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, it said, he "carried out physiotherapy, walked and received family visits."</p>

<p>Doctors performed emergency surgery Tuesday on Lula to relieve pressure on his brain from bleeding in cranial membranes linked to a fall he had in October, in a bathroom at the presidential residence.</p>

<p>After complaining of a headache in Brasilia on Monday, an MRI scan found a hemorrhage between his brain and the dura mater membrane that protects it.</p>

<p>He was rushed to the Hospital Sirio-Libanes -- the country's top medical facility -- where doctors carried out a trepanation, involving drilling through his skull to relieve pressure.</p>

<p>Earlier Wednesday, the hospital said Lula was alert and had "progressed well" since the surgery, "without incident."</p>

<p>In a post-surgery news conference on Tuesday, his medical team said he had suffered no brain damage.</p>

<p>They said he would spend a couple of days in intensive care, under observation, and he was expected to be released from hospital next week.</p>

<p>After suffering his fall on October 19, Lula told an official from his Workers' Party that the accident had been "serious".</p>

<p>In the weeks following, the president skipped planned overseas trips. But from mid-November he resumed his active schedule, hosting a G20 summit in Rio and attending a Mercosur summit last week in Uruguay.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indian-origin student pursuing PhD at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has been suspended until January 2026 following his pro-Palestinian activism and is currently appealing the university's decision.</p>

<p>Prahlad Iyengar, also a National Science Foundation fellow, has been "suspended until January 2026," according to a post on X by a group called 'MIT Coalition Against Apartheid'.</p>

<p>This suspension effectively terminates Iyengar's five-year NSF fellowship and severely disrupts his academic career, the organisation said in the post.</p>

<p>It added that Iyengar, a PhD student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, is "now appealing the decision" to the Chancellor at MIT Wednesday, the "last opportunity to end this persecution and restore academic dignity.</p>

<p>"This decision is the harshest among several sanctions resulting from speech-related activities, including an article" that Iyengar wrote for a student-run zine 'Written Revolution, "which engaged in debate about the role of pacifism in the pro-Palestine movement."</p>

<p>"This suspension is, in practice, an expulsion, as his readmission is entirely contingent upon approval from the same Committee on Discipline that handed down this harsh sanction," the body said.</p>

<p>Iyengar is appealing his case with the Chancellor to "revoke or reduce" the "unjust sanctions" against him.</p>

<p>MIT Coalition Against Apartheid said it has launched a campaign to "put pressure on MIT's administration to "stop criminalising students who stand on the right side of history."</p>

<p>The organisation called on other institutions to support them.</p>

<p>In a call to action, the organisation is demanding that the MIT administration reverse Iyengar's suspension before Wednesday and said over 100 people have asked the city of Cambridge's councillors "to intervene on MIT's suppression of pro-Palestinian student activism."</p>

<p>An immigration attorney, Eric Lee, wrote on X that the decision against Iyengar is a "major blow to free speech everywhere. MIT's admin is so deeply connected to the war profiteers that it cannot tolerate pro-Palestinian speech. This sets the tone for further attacks on speech coming under Trump."</p>

<p>According to a November 14 report in WBUR, Boston's NPR News Station, nearly 100 MIT students had rallied on campus after the university decided to ban the distribution of 'Written Revolution', described as a pro-Palestinian student-run magazine. The magazine included the article 'On Pacifism' authored by Iyengar, who, according to the WBUR report, was also an editor of the magazine.</p>

<p>The WBUR report further said that according to an email sent by MIT Dean of Student Life David Warren Randall to the editors of the magazine, the 'On Pacifism' article featured imagery and language that "could be interpreted as a call for more violent or destructive forms of protest at MIT."</p>

<p>"Randall's email also cited the inclusion of several images in the article, including one that incorporates the logo of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which has been designated by the US State Department as a terrorist organisation," the WBUR report said.</p>

<p>At the time, Iyengar was quoted as saying in the WBUR report, "We want to say this is a gross violation of free speech."</p>

<p>He had added that the purpose of the magazine was to "put out, in our own words, what we were doing, why we were doing it and what was happening on campus."</p>

<p>The WBUR reported that after the publication of the magazine's October issue, "Iyengar said MIT barred him from entering campus."</p>

<p>In an email to Iyengar, "the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards cited 'a series of continuing behaviours' that included his essay, a protest held outside a campus lab and an email sent to grad students and postdoctoral researchers who work in the lab," the WBUR report said.</p>

<p>Iyengar was also suspended last year following the pro-Palestinian demonstrations that had erupted across US universities in the wake of the Israel-Hamas conflict.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The Huthi-run health ministry blamed Israel Saturday for a series of strikes on a fuel depot in the rebel-held Yemeni port city of Hodeida, adding that the strikes caused casualties.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli warplanes struck the Houthi-controlled Yemeni port of Hodeida Saturday, a day after a Houthi drone attack killed a civilian in Tel Aviv, the rebels said.<br />
In a statement on social media, top Houthi official Mohammed Abdulsalam reported a "brutal Israel aggression against Yemen."</p>

<p>He said the attack targeted "fuel storage facilities and a power plant" in Hodeida "to pressure Yemen to stop supporting" Palestinians in the Gaza war.</p>

<p>The Axios news outlet cited US and Israeli officials as saying that Israel carried out the strikes in retaliation for a Houthi drone strike on Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>The Houthi attack on Friday penetrated Israel's vaunted air defences and killed a civilian in a Tel Aviv apartment building, drawing Israeli threats of retaliation.</p>

<p>The Houthi-run health ministry said there were deaths and injuries in the Hodeida strikes but it did not give a count.</p>

<p>In a statement carried by the Houthi-run Al Masirah television, it said several people suffered "serious burns".</p>

<p>Footage aired by Al Masirah, which AFP could not independently verify, showed a massive blaze on the seafront, with a large plume of black smoke rising into the sky.</p>

<p>An AFP correspondent in Hodeida reported hearing several large explosions and seeing smoke over the port.</p>

<p>Fuel pumps across the city closed following the attack, the correspondent said.</p>

<p>Hodeida has been hard hit by a series of strikes carried out by Britain and the United States since January in response to attacks by Houthi rebels on commercial shipping in the Red Sea</p>

<p>The Houthis have attacked at least 88 commercial vessels since November in a campaign they say targets Israeli-linked shipping in support of the Palestinians in the Gaza war.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Gaza hospital said Saturday it saved a baby boy from his mother's womb after she died from wounds sustained in an Israeli strike.</p>

<p>Ola Adnan Harb al-Kurd, who was nine months pregnant, barely survived a punishing night of missile strikes that rescue services across the Hamas-run territory said killed more than 24 people, including six members of the same family.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But by the time Kurd reached Al-Awda Hospital, she was "almost dead", according to surgeon Akram Hussein.</p>

<p>Doctors were unable to save the mother, but performed an ultrasound that detected the baby's heartbeat.</p>

<p>They quickly staged an emergency cesarean section "and extracted the fetus," the surgeon told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The newborn was initially in critical condition, but after receiving oxygen and medical attention was stabilised, said Raed al-Saudi, head of the hospital's obstetrics and gynaecology department.</p>

<p>He was placed in an incubator and transferred to Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir el-Balah.</p>

<p>Kurd was among three women and a child killed by an Israeli missile fired on the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, according to a medical official at Al-Awda Hospital. Her husband was also wounded in the strike on the family home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel has not confirmed individual strikes, but a military statement said troops were "conducting targeted raids on terrorist infrastructure sites" in central Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel has stepped up its offensive in several parts of the territory in line with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's order to increase pressure on Hamas following the Palestinian militants' attacks on southern Israel on October 7.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One man was killed in a drone hit while riding a bicycle on a street near the southern city of Khan Yunis, the Palestinian Red Crescent said.</p>

<p>Air strikes on two homes in Gaza City in the north each left six dead, according to the civil defence agency and paramedics.</p>

<p>Israel's military statement said "troops eliminated a number of terrorists in several different encounters" and had launched an operation on the Tal al-Sultan refugee camp near the southern city of Rafah.</p>

<p>The war in Gaza has made childbirth increasingly perilous, with pregnant women facing not only near-daily strikes that hamper access to health facilities, but also widespread food insecurity, degrading sanitary conditions and water scarcity.</p>

<p>The few hospitals that are still working have been stretched to breaking point, according to humanitarian groups.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pre-term deliveries and maternal complications, including eclampsia, haemorrhage and sepsis, have been rising, Doctors Without Borders said this week.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French authorities have recalled Olympics-branded water bottles for children containing excessive levels of endocrine disruptor Bisphenol A, a week ahead of the Paris Games' opening.</p>

<p>The reusable bottles made by the Vilac company have "levels of Bisphenol A not in line with regulations" on products designed for contact with foods, government website Rappel Conso (Consumer Recall) said Friday.</p>

<p>The white-coloured flasks with beige, blue or red tops are branded with the Olympic rings, the Paris 2024 mascot or the Olympic flame.</p>

<p>People who have bought them should return them to the place of purchase, authorities said.</p>

<p>The bottles were sold in France from late August last year until the beginning of June.</p>

<p>Bisphenol A, once widely used in making food containers, has been banned in France since 2015.</p>

<p>Labelled an endocrine disruptor by France's food safety agency Anses, it is believed to be linked to health problems including breast cancer and infertility.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former teacher&nbsp;at Saint Mary Magdalen School in Wilmington, Delaware, has been accused of sending explicit photos to a former student.&nbsp;According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/19/us-news/catholic-school-teacher-accused-of-sending-sexually-explicit-photos-to-14-year-old/">New York Post, </a></em>Alanis Pinion, a 24-year-old eighth-grade teacher,&nbsp;was arrested on&nbsp;Thursday by the New Castle County Police.</p>

<p>&nbsp;According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nccpdnews.com/2024/07/19/detectives-arrest-teacher-distributing-explicit-photographs-alanis-pinion/">New Castle County Police</a>, Pinion regularly communicated with her students on Snapchat and allegedly engaged in inappropriate behaviour by sending explicit images to one of them.</p>

<p>She was charged with sexual solicitation of a child, endangering the welfare of a child, and indecent exposure.&nbsp;Pinion was arraigned and committed to the Baylor Women's Correctional Institution after failing to pay $46,000 cash bail.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the Saint Mary Magdalen School told <em>NBC10</em>&nbsp;that Pinion was a part-time contractor and is no longer associated with the school.</p>

<p>"Earlier this week, the school was contacted by the New Castle County Police to notify us of an investigation and ultimately an arrest of a former part-time contract employee regarding allegations of an exchange of inappropriate images electronically with a former student," the school wrote.</p>

<p>"The contractor had successfully completed the required background check process prior to her employment. The school, parish and our Diocese officials supported the police as they conducted their investigation. Please be assured that all of us at Saint Mary Magdalen Parish and School, along with our partners at the Diocese of Wilmington, always keep the safety of our children and youth as a primary goal,''&nbsp; the school continued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Division of Police is worried that there might be other victims who have not yet come forward, according to their statement.&nbsp;Anyone with information about the investigation is urged to reach out to Detective Daniel Watson.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last month, a special education teacher at an intermediate school in New Jersey was arrested for an alleged sexual relationship with a student, according to authorities.&nbsp;43-year-old&nbsp;Allison Havemann-Niedrach&nbsp;at Freehold Intermediate School was charged with first-degree aggravated sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child, Monmouth County&nbsp;<a href="https://mcponj.org/2024/06/29/intermediate-school-teacher-charged-with-engaging-in-sexual-relationship-with-student/">Prosecutor Raymond S.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh soldiers patrolled the deserted streets of the capital Dhaka on Saturday and set up roadblocks during a curfew meant to quell deadly students-led protests against government job quotas that have killed at least 110 people this week.</p>

<p>Internet and text message services have been suspended since Thursday, cutting the nation off from the rest of the world as police cracked down on protests that have continued despite a ban on public gatherings.</p>

<p>Overseas telephone calls mostly failed to connect while websites of Bangladesh-based media organisations did not update and their social media handles remained inactive.</p>

<p>"To take a country of nearly 170 million people off the Internet is a drastic step, one we haven't seen the likes of since the Egyptian revolution of 2011," said John Heidemann, chief scientist of the networking and cybersecurity division at USC Viterbi's Information Sciences Institute.</p>

<p>In addition to the deaths, the clashes have injured thousands, according to data from hospitals across Bangladesh. The Dhaka Medical College Hospital received 27 dead bodies between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. (1100-1200 GMT) on Friday.</p>

<p>For five days police have fired tear gas and hurled sound grenades to scatter protesters as demonstrators clashed with security personnel, throwing bricks and igniting vehicles.</p>

<p>The demonstrations - the biggest since Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was re-elected for a fourth successive term this year - have also been fuelled by high unemployment among young people, who make up nearly a fifth of the South Asian nation's 170 million people.</p>

<p>With the death count climbing and police and other security forces unable to contain the protests, Hasina's government imposed a national curfew and deployed the military.</p>

<p>The curfew was eased for two hours from noon on Saturday to allow people to shop for supplies and complete other chores, television channels reported. It will last until 10 a.m. (0400 GMT) on Sunday, when the government will assess the situation and decide the next course of action, the reports added.</p>

<p>Those venturing out on the streets had their identification cards inspected by army personnel at different check points, TV footage showed. Troops set up roadblocks and bunkers using sandbags across strategic locations of Dhaka, the centre of the anti-quota protests.</p>

<p>The nationwide unrest broke out over student anger against the controversial quotas for government jobs, including 30% for the families of those who fought for independence from Pakistan.</p>

<p>Hasina's government had scrapped the quota system in 2018, but a court reinstated it last month. The state appealed against the reinstatement and the Supreme Court suspended it for a month, pending a hearing on Aug. 7.</p>

<p>In the central Dhaka district of Narsingdi, protesters stormed a jail on Friday, freeing over 850 inmates and setting fire to the facility, TV channels reported, citing police. Scattered incidents of arson were also reported on Saturday in some parts of the country.</p>

<p>Hasina dropped plans to leave on Sunday for diplomatic visits to Spain and Brazil due to the protests, the office of Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud said.</p>

<p>Many opposition party leaders, activists and student protesters had been arrested, said Tarique Rahman, the exiled acting chairman of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Police arrested Nahid Islam, a leading coordinator of the students' agitation, at 2 a.m. on Saturday, the protesters said in a text message.</p>

<p>Reuters could not independently confirm the arrests.</p>

<p>Neighbouring India said nearly 1,000 Indian students have returned home through various land ports and flights since the violence began.</p>

<p>International rights groups have criticised the internet suspension and actions of security forces. The European Union said it is deeply concerned by the violence and loss of life.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The towering, 11-foot-high behemoth, dubbed "Apex," was excavated just outside present-day Dinosaur, Colorado, in May 2022.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire investor Ken Griffin, founder and CEO of hedge fund Citadel, has shattered auction records by splurging $44.6 million for a dinosaur skeleton.&nbsp;According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/18/us-news/stegosaurus-skeleton-sold-to-citadels-ken-griffin-for-44-6m/">New York Post</a></em>,&nbsp;Mr Griffin purchased the largest and the most intact stegosaurus&nbsp;skeleton at Sotheby's on Wednesday, making it the most valuable fossil ever sold at auction.</p>

<p>Estimated to be 150 million years old, the behemoth dubbed "Apex," was excavated just outside present-day Dinosaur, Colorado, in May 2022 by&nbsp;palaeontologist Jason Cooper. According to Sotheby's, the Apex stegosaurus is the largest ever discovered, standing at an impressive 11 feet (3.3 meters) in height and 27 feet (8.2 meters) in length, with a remarkable 254 out of an estimated 319 bones preserved, making it nearly complete.</p>

<p>Mr Griffin secured the skeleton by outbidding six other participants in an auction that lasted 15 minutes. The skeleton, initially anticipated to sell for around $6 million, was purchased for $44.6 million, 11 times its lower estimate, marking a new record for dinosaur fossils.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''Apex' lived up to its name today, inspiring bidders globally to become the most valuable fossil ever sold at auction. This sale has been years in the making, and at every turn, we have worked closely with Jason Cooper, from the moment of its discovery in Dinosaur, Colorado, to its sale in New York,'' said Cassandra Hatton, Sotheby's global head of science and popular culture in a statement.</p>

<p>According to Forbes, the hedge fund chief is a regular donor to the Republican party and has a net worth of approximately $37.8 billion. He now plans to loan the skeleton to institutions across the United States instead of keeping it for his private collection.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump will hold his first campaign rally on Saturday since he narrowly escaped an assassination attempt one week ago and fresh from his nominating convention where his takeover of the Republican Party was cemented.</p>

<p>Trump will appear in Grand Rapids, in the battleground state of Michigan, along with his new vice presidential pick, Ohio U.S. Senator J.D. Vance. It will be their first campaign event together as the now official Republican presidential ticket.</p>

<p>Republican Party officials said during Trump's nominating convention in Milwaukee this week that his brush with death last Saturday had changed him, and that when he made his acceptance speech on Thursday night he would call for national unity.</p>

<p>While Trump began the address with a call for unity and national healing, much of his speech was his well-known list of grievances and attacks on opponents.</p>

<p>It is unclear what type of a speech Trump will deliver on Saturday, but his diehard supporters typically flock to such events to hear Trump's more traditional inflammatory rhetoric.</p>

<p>Trump and Vance will take the stage in Grand Rapids with the Republican Party unified behind them after this week's nominating convention. In contrast, the Democrats are in turmoil and it is no longer certain that President Joe Biden will be the Democratic nominee facing Trump in the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>Biden is facing mounting calls from many elected officials in his own party to step aside as the party's White House candidate and to end his re-election bid, after his poor debate performance against Trump last month.</p>

<p>Biden is trailing in opinion polls and is behind in every swing state against Trump. Many Democrats fear he may have virtually no path to victory and that the party needs a new presidential candidate to take on Trump.</p>

<p>The rally in Grand Rapids will be in an indoor arena, unlike the event in Butler, Pennsylvania last weekend, which was outdoors. At that event, the gunman was able to scale the roof of a building outside the Secret Service perimeter before opening fire on Trump, clipping his ear, killing a rally-goer and wounding several others.</p>

<p>The U.S. Secret Service, which is responsible for protecting Trump, declined to comment on security for the Grand Rapids event. An investigation is under way into the security failures at the Butler rally.</p>

<p>"The Secret Service does not discuss the means and methods used for our protective operations," the agency said in a statement.</p>

<p>Trump gave a detailed account of his narrow brush with death in his convention speech on Thursday, telling the audience that he was only talking to them "by the grace of Almighty God."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 777X, Boeing's latest incarnation of the popular 777 family, has received more than 500 orders, although it has not yet entered commercial service.</p>

<p>Here are some key facts about the new aircraft.</p>

<h2>Largest of its class</h2>

<p>The dual-aisle plane, first announced in 2013, has a wingspan of 72 meters and a maximum length of 77 meters, which will make it the biggest dual-engine commercial aircraft in the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prior-generation offerings including the Airbus A380 and Boeing 747, which are no longer manufactured, had four engines.</p>

<p>As of late June, Boeing had received 540 orders for the 777X. The plane will be assembled at the company's Seattle-area factory in Everett, Washington state.</p>

<h2>Various versions</h2>

<p>There are three versions of the jet.</p>

<p>The 777-8 is a direct competitor to the Airbus A350-1000. It can hold 350 to 370 people and can fly as far as 16,110 kilometers (about 10,000 miles). It has 78 orders.</p>

<p>The 777-9 can carry between 400 and 425 passengers and fly as far as 14,075 km (about 8,750 miles). It has received 407 orders.</p>

<p>The 777-8 cargo is capable of transporting freight up to 118 tons. This jet has received 55 orders through the end of June. In July, Emirates announced plans to purchase an additional five jets.</p>

<h2>Certification delays</h2>

<p>Boeing had originally planned for the jet to enter service in January 2020, but the timeframe has been pushed back to 2025 due to certification delays.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The jet still must be certified by the US Federal Aviation Administration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In April 2022, Boeing announced it was pushing back construction until the end of 2023 due to those delays.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Observers believe the company has built 20 of the aircraft, in addition to four being used during flight tests.</p>

<h2>Costs</h2>

<p>Boeing estimates the new jet will reduce jet fuel consumption per seat and operating costs by 10 percent compared with rival planes.</p>

<p>In May 2023, the list price of the 777-8 was $410.2 million, while that of the 777-9 was $442.2 million.</p>

<p>The plane has about three million parts and about 215 kilometers of cables.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The engine is the GE9X produced by General Electric, the biggest ever manufactured, with a diameter of 3.4 meters (11.1 feet).</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the world's youngest air forces is taking part in war games alongside cutting-edge stealth fighter jets as the Pacific Island nation of Papua New Guinea boosts defence ties with Australia and the United States.</p>

<p>Papua New Guinea's trainee pilots have queued for take-off with US F-22 Raptor and Australian Joint Strike Fighter jets in northern Australia this week in the 20-nation Pitch Black war games.</p>

<p>"It is a learning experience for us as a small air force and it helps to build our air force," said Major Randall Hepota, one of six PNG Air Force pilots flying three small P-750 turboprop aircraft.</p>

<p>At home, the New Zealand-made plane can take off and land in very short spaces and transports supplies and troops to border areas in treacherous mountain terrain.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Douglas Vavar, the commanding officer of PNG Air Wing, said Pitch Black offered exposure to the world's best pilots and was helping PNG learn how to integrate with a large coalition force.</p>

<p>"We are becoming an air force. Flying in Papua New Guinea is a must," he said in an interview on Saturday at RAAF Base Darwin. "Eighty percent of the population live in rural areas - so the only way you can get access to them is to fly."</p>

<p>The PNG air force could land closer to the site of the Enga landslide disaster in May to deliver aid than larger Royal Australian Air Force planes, he said.</p>

<p>"We have been training with the Royal Australian Air Force for several years and the Enga landslide was the first time we had to deploy," he said.</p>

<p>The small PNG planes have been landing in remote Jabiru to deliver supplies during Pitch Black, as well as RAAF Tindal Base, home to Australia's F-35 fighter jets.</p>

<p>Australia's Governor General, Sam Mostyn, inspected one of the PNG aircraft at the RAAF Darwin base open day.</p>

<p>Australia and the United States last year struck defence deals with PNG, which is also being courted by Beijing, amid strategic competition by major powers in the Pacific Islands.</p>

<p>"Papua New Guinea is one of our key allies in&nbsp;the region," said Fiona Pearce, senior Australian Defence Force officer for RAAF Tindal.</p>

<p>"Their survival and our survival is interdependent," she added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[This Buck Moon coincides with the 55th anniversary of the 1969 Apollo moon landing]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The next full moon is just around the corner, and it is a special one. Commonly known as the Buck Moon, this full moon has many names, including the Thunder Moon, Hay Moon, Mead Moon, Guru Purnima, Asalha Puja (also known as Dharma Day or Esala Poya).</p>

<p><strong>When to see the Buck Moon?</strong></p>

<p>The next Buck Moon will occur on Sunday, July 21, at 4:47 pm IST, according to <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/uncategorized/the-next-full-moon-is-the-buck-or-thunder-moon/ ">NASA</a>.</p>

<p>This year's Buck Moon is especially significant as it marks a rare coincidence with the 55th anniversary of the Apollo moon landing in 1969.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How long will the Buck Moon last?</strong></p>

<p>The moon will appear full for about three days around this time, from Friday evening through Monday morning, making this a full moon weekend.</p>

<p><strong>How did the Moon get its name?</strong></p>

<p>The Buck Moon gets its name from the Algonquin tribes of the northeastern United States, who called it so because early summer is when buck deer grow new antlers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is also called the Thunder Moon due to the frequent thunderstorms during this time. Europeans called it the Hay Moon or Mead Moon, as it coincides with haymaking and mead-making.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cultural significance of the Buck Moon</strong></p>

<p>This full moon falls near the middle of the sixth month of the Chinese year of the Dragon, Tammuz in the Hebrew calendar and Muharram in the Islamic calendar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For Hindus, Buddhists and Jains, this full Moon is significant as it is the Guru Full Moon (Guru Purnima), a time for clearing the mind and honouring the guru.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Theravada Buddhists celebrate Asalha Puja, an important festival marking the Buddha's first sermon after reaching nirvana. This sermon is the core of Buddhist teachings and includes the four noble truths.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This full moon also marks the start of Vassa, the annual three-month retreat for Buddhist Monks during the rainy season.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China has slammed the European Commission over their stand on Taiwan, terming it "gross interference" in the country's internal affairs, Taiwan News reported.</p>

<p>The EU chief, Ursula von der Leyen came under fire on Friday from China for standing up for Taiwan.</p>

<p>In her manifesto, the German politician had described the Indo-Pacific as a "decisive region." She also called for "collective efforts to deploy the full range of our combined statecraft to deter China from unilaterally changing the status quo by military means, particularly over Taiwan."</p>

<p>Responding to the EU's stand, Beijing said Von der Leyen's policy guidelines constituted "gross interference" in the country's internal affairs, Taiwan News reported, citing a Euronews article.</p>

<p>The Director General for European Affairs at the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang Lutong, fanned the flames further by saying, "Playing with fire on Taiwan is highly dangerous."</p>

<p>Wang further said that "meddling" is not a right choice for Europe.</p>

<p>"Meddling and even trying to join forces is by no means a right choice for Europe," Wang was quoted as saying.</p>

<p>Earlier, Taiwan President Lai Ching-te congratulated von der Leyen for her "steadfast support for peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait." He added that he looked forward to building even stronger ties with the EU.</p>

<p>"Congratulations, @vonderleyen, on your reelection as @EU_Commission President. Greatly appreciate your steadfast support for peace &amp; stability in the Taiwan Strait. I look forward to fostering stronger #Taiwan-#EU ties built on our shared commitment to human rights &amp; democracy," President Lai stated.</p>

<p>Von der Leyen, from the center-right European People's Party (EPP), was re-elected Thursday after a secret ballot that saw the backing of 401 Members of the European Parliament. She is the 13th president of the EU and its first female leader.</p>

<p>In her manifesto, she outlined how Europe would work closely with regional actors such as Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, and Australia to address "common challenges in cyber, space and in the secure supply of critical minerals and technologies."</p>

<p>She further added that Beijing "should be prevented" from upsetting the decades-long status quo in the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan News reported.</p>

<p>It further cited a Politico article which stated, "Von der Leyen vows to stop China from invading Taiwan." It added that the US believes China intends to attack Taiwan in 2027, which would be in the middle of Von der Leyen's new five-year mandate.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Centre will play a crucial role in shaping standards and infrastructure for 6G networks worldwide, Dr Neeraj Mittal, Secretary (Telecom), has said.</p>

<p>Inaugurating a centre of excellence on 6G at IIT-M Research Park, Chennai, Mr Mittal said this initiative is aligned with the 'Bharat 6G Vision' document released by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in March last year.</p>

<p>PM Modi has envisaged India to be a front-line contributor in the design, development and deployment of 6G technology by 2030.</p>

<p>Mr Mittal emphasised that the initiative aims to create a cohesive and coordinated effort in advancing 6G technology, ensuring that all projects benefit from collective expertise and resources.</p>

<p>The centre of excellence is a sub-centre of Telecom Centres of Excellence (TCoE)-India which will spearhead the development and deployment of 6G technology, promising unprecedented speeds, ultra-low latency, and enhanced connectivity.</p>

<p>The centre will serve as a hub for innovation, bringing together academic and industry experts to collaborate on cutting-edge projects.</p>

<p>This collaborative environment will foster the development of new applications and services that leverage 6G's capabilities.</p>

<p>This centre will also facilitate interconnect between the existing 5G Test Bed at IIT Madras which was developed indigenously through a collaborative project involving eight institutes and funded by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT).</p>

<p>The 5G Test Bed was inaugurated by PM Modi in May 2022 and has since been used extensively by industry and academia for testing new 5G products and use-cases.</p>

<p>The DoT has funded two next-generation testbeds to advance the 6G research.</p>

<p>Under the Bharat 6G Vision, DoT is already evaluating 470 proposals on 'Accelerated research on 6G Ecosystem'.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday appointed Steven MacKinnon, a Liberal member of parliament from Quebec, as the new labor minister, filling a vacancy created when Seamus O'Regan stepped down for personal reasons.</p>

<p>MacKinnon, who had been temporarily in charge of government business in the lower chamber since January, takes over the labour portfolio at a shaky time for Trudeau's government, with its popularity among voters slumping in part because of high inflation and a shortage of affordable housing.</p>

<p>O'Regan, who represents a constituency in the province of Newfoundland, announced his resignation on Thursday, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family.</p>

<p>A surprise loss to the main opposition Conservative Party in a once-safe Toronto constituency in a special election last month has fueled questions about the Trudeau government's leadership and strategy. With about 15 months left before the next general election is due, a range of polls show the Liberals would lose badly to the Conservatives after being in power since November 2015.</p>

<p>Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper, citing unidentified sources, reported a rift between senior Trudeau aides and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland over concerns about her effectiveness in the key role.</p>

<p>The newspaper has also reported that Trudeau had met Mark Carney, a former Bank of Canada governor, about recruiting him into the government.</p>

<p>Pressed by reporters during briefings, both Trudeau and Freeland have stopped short of categorically denying that a change in the finance portfolio was in the offing.</p>

<p>When asked about the matter, Trudeau said he has confidence in Freeland but did not say whether she would remain as finance minister.</p>

<p>Freeland, who also serves as deputy prime minister, declined to say whether Trudeau had assured her that she would keep the job.</p>

<p>Trudeau has shuffled his cabinet once since forming a minority government after the 2021 election</p>

<p>The Liberal leader recruited seven new members of parliament into his cabinet in July 2023, but heavy hitters such as Freeland, Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne and Foreign Minister Melanie Joly kept their portfolios.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US cybersecurity agency CISA has issued a warning that hackers are trying to take advantage of Microsoft outage for phishing and other malicious activity.</p>

<p>Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella said today that they are "working" to safely bring systems back online globally.</p>

<p>The US cybersecurity agency warned individuals to "avoid clicking on phishing emails or suspicious links," which can lead to email compromise and other scams.</p>

<p>"Threat actors continue to use the widespread IT outage for phishing and other malicious activity. CISA urges organisations to ensure they have robust cybersecurity measures to protect their users, assets, and data against this activity," it said in a statement</p>

<p>The Microsoft outage has impacted Windows 10 and later systems, and is due to the "CrowdStrike Falcon content update and not to malicious cyber activity".</p>

<p>Satya Nadella said in a post on X that "We are aware of this issue and are working closely with CrowdStrike and across the industry to provide customers technical guidance and support to safely bring their systems back online."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Yesterday, CrowdStrike released an update that began impacting IT systems globally. We are aware of this issue and are working closely with CrowdStrike and across the industry to provide customers technical guidance and support to safely bring their systems back online.</p>

<p>A fresh Microsoft statement read that they are actively supporting customers to assist in their recovery.</p>

<p>According to CrowdStrike, the issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"What is CrowdStrike? Why is my Windows computer showing the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/windows-systems-restarting-throwing-blue-screen-of-death-due-to-crowdstrike-error-6138820">Blue Screen of Death</a>? Who is responsible for the biggest-ever IT outage?"</p>

<p>These are questions that have dominated conversations across the globe after a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/microsoft-outage-delhi-airport-the-situation-at-delhi-mumbai-airports-day-after-global-it-outage-6145653">Microsoft error brought Windows computers to its heels</a>. While it is now known that an update to an anti-virus program 'Falcon Sensor' by CrowdStrike was responsible for the massive worldwide outage, people have still been wondering how such a defective update was allowed to be released and who was behind it.</p>

<p>Step in Vincent Flibustier, an X user parading to be a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/crowdstrike-all-about-the-cybersecurity-giant-behind-global-it-outage-6145685">Crowdstrike</a> employee. Vincent broke the internet with an altered, AI-generated photo of him outside the CrowdStrike office along with the caption, "First day at Crowdstrike, pushed a little update and taking the afternoon off."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

— Vincent Flibustier ? (@vinceflibustier) <a href="https://twitter.com/vinceflibustier/status/1814233715641389456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>The photo went viral within minutes and already has nearly 4 lakh likes and has been shared by over 36,000 users.</p>

<p>Two hours later, Flibustier posted another update - the company had fired him. He also shared a short video where he takes 'responsibility' for causing the global outage.</p>

<p>Vincent Flibustier also changed his X (former Twitter) bio to accompany the parody. His bio said, "Former Crowdstrike employee, fired for an unfair reason, only changed 1 line of code to optimize. Looking for a job as Sysadmin."</p>

<p>While he was trying to make a joke about it, thousands online bought his satire and thought he was the one responsible for the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) on their system. Airlines, banks, TV channels, and several other industries were scrambling to deal with the issue, and people on social media went into overdrive after finding the 'culprit'.</p>

<p>While several users praised him for ensuring that they don't have to work on a Friday, some posted abusive messages about him.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>The truth: Vincent is a satirical writer who runs Nordpresse, a Belgian parody news site. He appeared as a guest on France TV, where he remarked, "People are drawn to stories that confirm their preconceptions."</p>

<p>Explaining further why people on the internet immediately latched on to his joke, he said, "No culprit named yet, I bring it on a platter, people like to have a culprit. The culprit seems completely stupid, he is proud of his stupidity, he takes his afternoon off on the first day of work. This falls right into a huge buzz in which people absolutely need to have new information, and a fake is by nature new, you won't read it anywhere else."</p>

<p>He also said that the post was shared by those who knew it was a joke, but the amplification sent it into a zone where people took every word of the tweet literally.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">

<br />
Several things that make it a good fake that worked: ?<br />
1. No culprit named yet, I bring it on a platter, people like to have a culprit.<br />
2- The culprit seems completely stupid, he is proud… <a href="https://t.co/JFJ2MEYNMQ">pic.twitter.com/JFJ2MEYNMQ</a></p>

<p>Millions of users across the globe are still facing issues, with both Microsoft and CrowdStrike trying to resolve the issue at the earliest.</p>

<p>The latest version of its Falcon Sensor software was meant to make CrowdStrike clients' systems more secure against hacking by updating the threats it defends against. However faulty code in the update files resulted in one of the most widespread tech outages in recent years for companies using Microsoft's Windows operating system.</p>

<p>Problems came to light quickly after the update was rolled out on Friday, and users posted pictures on social media of computers with blue screens displaying error messages. These are known in the industry as "blue screens of death."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The shooter who attempted to assassinate Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally flew a drone over the event site hours before the attack, law enforcement officials said.</p>

<p>Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, used a camera drone to scout out the Butler Farm Show grounds on July 13, capturing aerial footage of the area, the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/trump-gunman-flew-drone-over-rally-site-hours-before-attempted-assassination-2d0e2e1a">WSJ</a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The camera drone gave Crooks an overhead view, possibly aiding his plan. The assassination attempt was made on Saturday, at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Crooks opened fire on the former president, but the bullet only grazed his ear. The Secret Service responded swiftly, taking Crooks out within 26 seconds "<a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/took-him-out-with-one-shot-trump-lauds-sniper-who-killed-thomas-crooks-6138349">with one shot</a>".&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>The Secret Service typically prohibits drones over areas they are securing, but it is unclear if this was the case at the Butler rally. Investigators discovered the drone's flight, possibly through electronic traces of its flight path or records from DJI, the drone's manufacturer. A drone and related equipment were found in Crooks' vehicle, reported the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-shooter-flew-drone-venue-hours-attempted-assassination-source-sa-rcna162817 ">NBC</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thomas Crooks was also found to have a remote control transmitter, a <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/trump-shooter-went-to-shooting-range-day-before-assassination-attempt-report-6126076 ">detonator</a>, and an improvised metal explosive device in his car trunk, connected to a receiver, which suggests that he may have planned to remotely detonate an explosion, possibly as a diversion or distraction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the 48 hours leading up to the attack, Crooks made several suspicious stops. He visited a shooting range the day before the assassination attempt. He also stopped at a Home Depot and a gun store, where he purchased 50 rounds of ammunition and a 5-foot ladder - which investigators believe he used to climb the building from where he shot at Trump.</p>

<p>The motive behind the attempt to kill Donald Trump remains unknown and is currently under investigation. &nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity company behind a massive global IT outage, is a leader in its sector, known for building software defenses for the cloud computing age and exposing Russian and North Korean threats.</p>

<p>Based in Austin, Texas, the company was founded in 2011 by George Kurtz, Dmitri Alperovitch, and Gregg Marston.</p>

<p>Both Kurtz and Alperovitch had extensive backgrounds in cybersecurity, working at companies like McAfee.</p>

<p>Two years after its founding, CrowdStrike launched its signature product, the Falcon platform.</p>

<p>- Top player -</p>

<p>Crucially, the company embraced a "cloud-first" model to reduce big computing needs on customers and provide more effective protection.</p>

<p>Rather than just focusing on malware and antivirus products, the founders wanted to shift attention to identifying and stopping the attackers themselves and their techniques.</p>

<p>"CrowdStrike is one of the best known cybersecurity companies around," said Michael Daniel, who worked as the White House cybersecurity coordinator during Barack Obama's administration.</p>

<p>"It provides typically what we think of as sort of endpoint protection, meaning that it's actually got software running on a server, or on a particular device, like a laptop or a desktop and it's scanning for potential malware connections to bad domain names," he said.</p>

<p>"It's looking for behavior that might be unusual, that sort of thing," said Daniel who now runs the Cyber Threat Alliance.</p>

<p>The company's share price was down by about 9 percent in morning trading on Wall Street.</p>

<p>CrowdStrike became a publicly traded company in 2019 and the company's total revenue in the last quarter was $921 million with projections of brining in about $4 billion in the current fiscal year.</p>

<p>The company's main competitor is Palo Alto Networks as well as SentinelOne, which are standalone cybersecurity firms.</p>

<p>Cloud computing giants Microsoft, Amazon and Google also provide their own cybersecurity software and are rivals.</p>

<p>- North Korea hack -</p>

<p>But CrowdStrike is also a cyber intelligence company and made headlines when it was involved in investigating several high-profile cyberattacks.</p>

<p>Most famously, in 2014, CrowdStrike discovered evidence linking North Korean actors to the hack of servers at Sony Pictures.</p>

<p>The hackers stole large amounts of data and threatened terrorist acts against movie theaters to prevent the release of "The Interview," a comedy about North Korea's leader.</p>

<p>The studio initially canceled the movie's theatrical release, but reversed its decision after criticism.</p>

<p>Sony estimated the direct costs of the hack to be around $35 million for investigating and remediating the breach.</p>

<p>CrowdStrike also helped investigate the 2015-2016 cyber attacks on the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in the United States and their connection to Russian intelligence services.</p>

<p>In December 2016, CrowdStrike released a report stating that a Russian government-affiliated group called Fancy Bear had hacked a Ukrainian artillery app, potentially causing significant losses to Ukrainian artillery units.</p>

<p>However, this assessment was later disputed by some organizations and CrowdStrike rolled back some of the claims.</p>

<p>- Criticism of Microsoft -</p>

<p>In recent months, CrowdStike has criticized Microsoft for its lapses on cyber security as the Windows maker admitted to vulnerabilities and hackings by outside actors.</p>

<p>Among other criticisms, CrowdStrike slammed Microsoft for still doing business in China.</p>

<p>"You're telling the public they can't use Huawei, and they can't let kids watch dance videos on TikTok because China is going to collect intelligence," Shawn Henry, chief security officer at CrowdStrike said last year.</p>

<p>"Yet the most ubiquitous software, which is used throughout the government and throughout every single corporation in this country and around the world, has engineers in China working on their software," Henry told Forbes.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bridge collapse caused by torrential rains in northern China killed 12 people and left more than 30 missing, state media said Saturday.</p>

<p>Large parts of northern and central China have been battered in recent days by rains that have caused flooding and significant damage.</p>

<p>The bridge in the northwestern Shaanxi province buckled "due to a sudden downpour and flash floods" Friday night, according to state news agency Xinhua.</p>

<p>All 12 victims in the city of Shangluo were found inside five vehicles that were recovered from the river below the bridge, Xinhua said.</p>

<p>At least 31 people remained missing and initial investigations indicated that 17 cars and eight trucks had fallen into the river, it added.</p>

<p>Images on state television showed a partially submerged section of the bridge with the river rushing over it.</p>

<p>One witness told local media that he had approached the bridge but that other drivers started "yelling at me to brake and stop the car".</p>

<p>"A truck in front of me didn't stop" and fell into the water, the witness, surnamed Meng, said.</p>

<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has urged "all-out rescue and relief efforts" to find those still missing, Xinhua said.</p>

<p>In the southwestern province of Sichuan, more than 30 people were reported missing on Saturday after a violent thunderstorm caused flash flooding in the town of Ya'an, according to state broadcaster CCTV.</p>

<p>On Friday, state media reported at least five people dead and eight missing after the rains sparked flooding and mudslides in Shaanxi's Baoji city.</p>

<p>State television broadcast images of neighbourhoods completely flooded by muddy water, with excavators and residents attempting to clear the damage.</p>

<h2>Extreme weather</h2>

<p>The semi-desert province of Gansu, which neighbours Shaanxi, and Henan in central China were also hit by heavy rains this week.</p>

<p>In Henan's Nanyang city, the equivalent of a year's worth of rain fell at the start of the week, CCTV said.</p>

<p>And in Sichuan province, two people were reported killed and seven others missing Friday after heavy rain triggered landslides, Xinhua said.</p>

<p>China is enduring a summer of extreme weather, with heavy rains across the east and south coming as much of the north has sweltered in successive heatwaves.</p>

<p>Climate change, which scientists say is exacerbated by greenhouse gas emissions, is making these types of extreme weather phenomena more frequent and more intense.</p>

<p>In May, a highway in southern China collapsed after days of rain, leaving 48 dead.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Catastrophic computer outages caused by a software update from one company have once again exposed the dangers of global technological dependence on a handful of players, experts warned on Friday.</p>

<p>A flawed update sent out by the little-known security firm CrowdStrike brought airlines, TV stations, and myriad other aspects of daily life to a standstill.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The outages affected companies or individuals that use CrowdStrike on the Microsoft Windows platform: when they applied the update, the incompatible software crashed computers into a frozen state known as the "Blue Screen of Death."</p>

<p>"Today CrowdStrike has become a household name, but not in a good way, and this will take time to settle down," said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities.</p>

<p>The breakdown quickly fueled discussions about internet giants' power over the increasingly digital world economy, with more activity now taking place in the computing "cloud" or on a few apps or platforms.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Just 'a taste'</strong></p>

<p>When those platforms have flaws -- or are deliberately attacked -- the world seems to collapse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In recent months, entire healthcare systems and industries have been paralyzed after hackers infiltrated their systems, leaving consumers at their wits' end and companies at a loss.</p>

<p>"I think we're just getting a taste of some potential effects of real reliance by the financial sector and sectors across the economy on a handful of cloud companies and other key systems," Rohit Chopra, director of the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told CNBC.</p>

<p>"There are just a handful of big cloud companies where so much of the economy is now resting."</p>

<p>The world has seen a major shift to cloud computing, where companies use servers offered by big tech giants for their computing needs instead of their own infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amazon, through its AWS company, is the world leader, followed by Microsoft's Azure and Google Cloud.</p>

<p>Friday's breakdown was caused by a malfunctioning software update fed to Microsoft Windows users by CrowdStrike, which specializes in cybersecurity for cloud-based companies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We're deeply sorry for the impact we've caused to customers, travelers, and anyone affected by this," CrowdStrike CEO Kurtz said in an interview on NBC's "Today" show.</p>

<p>Microsoft blamed the problems on CrowdStrike, but industry insiders warned that the issue stems from entrusting the digital world to just a few key companies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's going to continue to raise issues for systems or businesses wholly dependent on Microsoft -- this issue of concentration risk," Michael Daniel, former White House cybersecurity coordinator and current head of the Cyber Threat Alliance told AFP.</p>

<p>"How do you balance the benefits of having everybody on the same operating system with the concentration risk that poses?"</p>

<p>Callie Guenther, senior manager of cyber threat research at Critical Start, warned that the shift to big players amplifies the impact of any system failure or vulnerability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One error, like CrowdStrike's on Friday, threatens society's smooth functioning worldwide, she said.</p>

<p><strong>No contingency plan&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Andrius Minkevicius, co-founder of Cyber Upgrade, a cybersecurity company, said that businesses must fight the complacency often associated with outsourcing technology to the big vendors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Today, we're seeing an example of those who relied mostly on vendor-offered cyber protection without additional contingency plans and are now suffering reputational and financial damage," he said.</p>

<p>Experts warn that this incident will likely invite scrutiny from regulators and officials.</p>

<p>"CrowdStrike will probably have to let some outside people come in and examine how this happened," said Cyber Threat Alliance's Daniel.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Businesses and services around the world are slowly recovering after a massive IT outage affected computer systems worldwide on Friday. Experts, however, said full recovery from the huge crash would take "some time."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>Airlines, banks, TV channels and financial institutions were thrown into turmoil for hours by one of the biggest IT crashes in recent years, caused by an update to an antivirus program.</li>
	<li>The breakdown was caused by a malfunctioning software update fed to Microsoft Windows users by CrowdStrike, which specializes in cybersecurity for cloud-based companies.</li>
	<li>The outages affected companies or individuals that use CrowdStrike on the Microsoft Windows platform. When they applied the update, the incompatible software crashed computers into a frozen state known as the "Blue Screen of Death."</li>
	<li>In India, several airports issued handwritten boarding passes to passengers. Many IndiGo flights in Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Hyderabad airports were cancelled and rescheduled.&nbsp;Airlines today said departures and arrivals were gradually resuming, but delays are expected even now.</li>
	<li>Media companies were also struggling, with Britain's Sky News saying the glitch had ended its morning news broadcasts and Australia's ABC similarly reporting major difficulties.</li>
	<li>CrowdStrike said it had rolled out a fix for the problem and the firm's boss, George Kurtz said in a statement his teams were "fully mobilised" to help affected customers. Kurtz, however, said it could be "some time" before all systems are back up and running</li>
	<li>The global nature of the software failure prompted some commentators to question the reliance on a single provider for such a variety of services.</li>
	<li>Security experts said CrowdStrike's routine update of its widely used cybersecurity software, which caused clients' computer systems to crash globally on Friday, apparently did not undergo adequate quality checks before it was deployed.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Microsoft said the underlying cause has been fixed and all impacted services have been restored.</li>
	<li>CrowdStrike - which previously reached a market cap of about $83 billion - is a major cybersecurity provider, with close to 30,000 subscribers globally.&nbsp;Over half of Fortune 500 companies and many government bodies such as the top US cybersecurity agency use the company's software.</li>

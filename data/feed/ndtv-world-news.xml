       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, affirmed that everyone agrees with the need to reach a ceasefire in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the restoration of peace and stability, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said on Monday (local time).</p>

<p>During the special briefing by the Foreign Secretary on the PM's visit to the US, Mr Misri said that Zelenskyy appreciated India's attention to these issues as well as the PM's recent visit to Ukraine to make for "peace and a pathway to finding a way out of this conflict."</p>

<p>"This is the third meeting between the two leaders in the space of probably three months...Their discussions on all matters, the bilateral issues as well as issues surrounding the Russia-Ukraine conflict. President Zelenskyy was very appreciative of India's attention to these issues and said that the Prime Minister's visit had been highly appreciated and he thanked the Prime Minister for the efforts that he was making for peace and a pathway to finding a way out of this conflict," Mr Misri said.</p>

<p>"Both sides appreciated that there was positive momentum on a lot of issues in the bilateral relationship and they agreed to remain in close touch either directly or through exchanges of visits at various other levels," he added.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a bilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in New York, where both leaders showed their commitment to implementing the outcomes of PM Modi's visit to Ukraine last month. This was the third time both leaders have met in the last three months.</p>

<p>The Foreign Secretary, during the briefing, also informed that the bilateral meeting between PM Modi and President Zelenskyy was requested from the Ukrainian side.</p>

<p>Being asked about whether the issue of India purchasing Russian oil was discussed, Mr Misri said the issue wasn't discussed.</p>

<p>PM Modi, affirmed that he has always talked about moving forward on the path of peace by proposing peace. The Prime Minister said that he has talked with leaders of different countries, and all are of the opinion that somehow a ceasefire has to be reached and efforts are ongoing in this regard.</p>

<p>Mr Misri said that since his visit to Ukraine, the Prime Minister has been in touch with Russian President Putin and US President Biden. National Security Advisor Ajit Doval also visited Russia recently.</p>

<p>"In a way, in the meeting with President Zelenskyy, the Prime Minister also got the opportunity to say that he has always talked about moving forward on the path of peace by proposing peace, so it is clear that if there is no peace, then in a way sustainable development cannot happen either. Will the war end, only time will tell, but everyone's efforts are focused on finding an end to the war in some way," Mr Misri said.</p>

<p>"In his conversation with President Zelenskyy, the Prime Minister also told him that he has talked to the leaders of different countries and discussions keep happening on this subject and everyone's opinion is that somehow we will have to find a way to ceasefire in the war and our efforts are also continuing in this regard," he added.</p>

<p>While stressing on attaining peace in the conflict, Vikram Misri also quoted Mahatma Gandhi and said, "There is no path to peace; peace is the path."</p>

<p>Mr Misri said during PM Modi and Zelenskyy's meeting, both sides appreciated the positive momentum on a lot of issues pertaining to both countries' bilateral relationship and also agreed to remain in close touch.</p>

<p>"Both sides appreciated that there was positive momentum on a lot of issues in the bilateral relationship and they agreed to remain in close touch either directly or through exchanges of visits at various other levels," he said.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi reiterated India's support for early resolution of the conflict in Ukraine and restoration of peace and stability.</p>

<p>"Met President Zelenskyy in New York. We are committed to implementing the outcomes of my visit to Ukraine last month to strengthen bilateral relations. Reiterated India's support for early resolution of the conflict in Ukraine and restoration of peace and stability," PM Modi said in a post in X.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian President also took to X, and said New Delhi and Kyiv actively developing our relations and working together to strengthen cooperation across various fields.</p>

<p>"This is already the third bilateral meeting this year with the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi @narendramodi. We are actively developing our relations and working together to strengthen cooperation across various fields," Zelenskyy said.</p>

<p>"The main focus of our conversation was on enhancing our interaction on international platforms, particularly at the UN and G20, as well as implementing the Peace Formula and preparing for the second Peace Summit. We had a substantive discussion on the available opportunities. I am grateful for the clear support of our sovereignty and territorial integrity," he added.</p>

<p>PM Modi visited Russia in July and Ukraine in August this year.</p>

<p>Notably, India has emphasised the need for sincere and practical engagement between all stakeholders to develop innovative solutions that will have broad acceptability and contribute towards early restoration of peace in the Ukraine conflict that started in February 2022.</p>

<p>India has also expressed its willingness to contribute in all possible ways to facilitate an early return of peace.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The gunman suspected of planning to kill Donald Trump wrote a chilling letter months ago about an&nbsp; "assassination attempt" on the former president, US prosecutors said on Monday.</p>

<p>The correspondence emerged as Ryan Routh, 58, was due in court in southern Florida charged with two firearms offenses after he was arrested allegedly fleeing Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach on September 15.</p>

<p>Prosecutors say a Secret Service agent fired at Routh after spotting a rifle poking out of the tree line several holes ahead of Trump, and that Routh was spotted by a witness who saw him escaping in a car.</p>

<p>Federal prosecutors said in Monday's filing Routh had dropped off a box at an unidentified person's home "several months" beforehand, containing ammunition, a metal pipe, building materials, phones "and various letters."</p>

<p>After learning of the apparent assassination bid, the witness apparently opened the box and discovered a letter addressed to "The World."</p>

<p>"This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I failed you," it said.</p>

<p>"I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster. It is up to you now to finish the job; and I will offer $150,000 to whomever can complete the job."</p>

<p>It was not clear if he was referring to a separate, earlier attempt on the life of Trump or the one at the golf course.</p>

<p>Detectives believe Routh may have been lying in wait for Trump for nearly 12 hours at the Florida course. He was arrested after police spotted his car driving on a nearby highway.</p>

<p>The government says Routh traveled to Florida a month before his arrest and began casing the golf course and drove by Trump's oceanfront home.</p>

<p>In online posts Routh said he voted for Trump in 2016 but that the president had become a disappointment.</p>

<p>"Everyone across the globe from the youngest to the oldest know that Trump is unfit to be anything, much less a US president," said Routh's letter, the front page of which appeared in a photograph included with the court papers.</p>

<p>"US presidents must at bare minimum embody the moral fabric that is America, and be kind, caring and selfless and always stand for humanity. Trump fails to understand any of (that)."</p>

<p>Routh is accused of possessing a gun with a scratched-out serial number and with possessing a gun illegally as a felon, although more serious charges may come after prosecutors put the case before a federal grand jury.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 5.6-magnitude earthquake struck near Japan's remote Izu Islands on Tuesday, the United States Geological Survey said, prompting local weather authorities to issue a tsunami warning.</p>

<p>A one-meter (3.3-inch) tsunami could be expected at Izu Islands by 8:30 am (2330 GMT) and Ogasawara Islands by 9:00 am (0000 GMT), the Japan Meteorological Agency said.</p>

<p>Island residents told national broadcaster NHK that they did not feel the earthquake.</p>

<p>Japan sits on top of four major tectonic plates and experiences around 1,500 quakes every year, most of them minor.</p>

<p>The impact is generally contained even with larger tremors thanks to advanced building techniques and well-practised emergency procedures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said on Monday that the escalating clashes between Israel and Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah threaten to plunge the Middle East into all-out war.</p>

<p>"I can say we are almost in a full-fledged war," Borrell said ahead of a gathering of world leaders at the United Nations.</p>

<p>"We're seeing more military strikes, more damage, more collateral damage, more victims," he added as Lebanese authorities said Israeli airstrikes killed at least 492 people on Monday, including 35 children.</p>

<p>The strikes marked the deadliest day of cross-border violence since the Gaza war began.</p>

<p>Israel said it killed a "large number" of Hezbollah militants when it hit about 1,300 sites in southern and eastern Lebanon, including a "targeted strike" in Beirut.</p>

<p>"Everybody has to put all their capacity to stop this," Borrell said, pressing for a solution in New York.</p>

<p>On Gaza, he said "despite all the diplomatic capacity that we have deployed, nothing has been able to stop the war," accusing both sides of "procrastinating."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden and his counterpart from the United Arab Emirates Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed discussed the progress of the landmark India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) and underscored its potential to usher in a "new era of international connectivity".</p>

<p>The ambitious project was launched at the 2023 G20 Leaders' Summit in New Delhi, together with the leaders of India, Saudi Arabia, France, Germany, Italy, and the European Union. When complete, it would connect India by ship-to-rail connections through the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel, and Europe through Greece.</p>

<p>At the meeting held at the White House on Monday, Biden and Zayed reaffirmed that the corridor will generate economic growth, increase efficiencies, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and enable the transformative integration of Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, according to a joint statement.</p>

<p>The two leaders underscored that the transformative partnership had the potential to usher in a "new era of international connectivity" to facilitate global trade and clean energy distribution, expand reliable access to electricity, and strengthen telecommunication.</p>

<p>According to the statement, they emphasised the importance of joint initiatives to promote a circular economy and advance sustainable practices, underscoring their commitment to innovation for resource efficiency and environmentally responsible growth.</p>

<p>Earlier, welcoming Zayed to the White House, Biden said UAE is a nation of trailblazers which always looking to the future and making big bets.&nbsp; "That's something our countries have in common, and our people have in common. In fact, it's a cornerstone of our growing cooperation in AI, in clean energy, in space, and investing in infrastructure to connect regions," he said.</p>

<p>Biden also announced plans to make UAE a major defence partner of the United States, which is the only other country after India to get this status.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. does not support the escalation between Israel and Hezbollah across the border, a senior State Department official said, adding that Washington was going to discuss "concrete ideas" with allies and partners to prevent the war from broadening.</p>

<p>Israel launched airstrikes against Hezbollah targets on Monday, killing 492 people and sending tens of thousands fleeing for safety in Lebanon's deadliest day in decades, according to authorities.</p>

<p>Israeli officials have said the recent uptick in airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon was designed to force the Iran-aligned group to agree to a diplomatic solution.</p>

<p>But the U.S. State Department official, briefing reporters in New York on condition of anonymity, pushed back on this Israeli position, saying President Joe Biden's administration was focused on "reducing tensions ... and breaking the cycle of strike-counterstrike."</p>

<p>"I can't recall, at least in recent memory, a period in which an escalation or intensification led to a fundamental de- escalation and led to profound stabilization of the situation," the official said.</p>

<p>Asked if that is a disagreement with the Israeli stance, the U.S. official nodded.</p>

<p>The spiraling conflict over Israel's northern border with Lebanon is a focus for Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly this week. Washington had "concrete ideas" to prevent a broader war and would seek an "off ramp" to tensions, the official said.</p>

<p>"It's an evolution of those discussions on which we're trying to base some practical, concrete steps that will have good chances of reducing tensions and actually getting some traction," the official said.</p>

<p>Asked if Washington believes Israel is preparing for an ground invasion of Lebanon, the U.S. official declined to answer definitively.</p>

<p>"We obviously do not believe that a ground invasion of Lebanon is going to contribute to reducing tensions in the region," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli air strikes on Lebanon killed at least 492 people on Monday, including 35 children, the health ministry said, marking the deadliest day of cross-border violence since the Gaza war began.</p>

<p>Arab states strongly condemned Israel for the escalating hostilities with Hezbollah, which have intensified to levels unseen in nearly a year.</p>

<p>The war erupted after Hamas and other Palestinian militants launched the unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, drawing in Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups.</p>

<p>Israel said it killed a "large number" of Hezbollah militants when it hit about 1,600 sites in southern and eastern Lebanon, including a "targeted strike" in Beirut in what the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) called "Operation Northern Arrows".</p>

<p>Hezbollah said Ali Karake, its third-in-command, was alive and had moved to safety after a source said the strike on the capital targeted him.</p>

<p>State media reported new raids in eastern Lebanon, while Hezbollah said it targeted five sites in Israel.</p>

<p>In the coastal Israeli city of Haifa, people were seen running for cover when air raid sirens sounded.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry said the strikes killed 492 people, including 35 children and 58 women, and wounded 1,645 others. Health Minister Firass Abiad said "thousands of families" had been displaced.</p>

<p>Explosions near the ancient city of Baalbek in eastern Lebanon sent smoke billowing into the sky.</p>

<p>"We sleep and wake up to bombardment... that's what our life has become," said Wafaa Ismail, 60, a housewife from the southern village of Zawtar.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Most difficult week for Hezbollah' -</strong></p>

<p>Global powers urged Israel and Hezbollah to step back from the brink of all-out war, as the violence shifted from Israel's southern border with Gaza to its northern frontier with Lebanon.</p>

<p>France and Egypt called on the United Nations Security Council to intervene, while Iraq requested an urgent meeting of Arab states on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York.</p>

<p>Israeli army chief Herzi Halevi said the strikes hit combat infrastructure Hezbollah had been building for two decades.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant called Monday "a significant peak" in the operation.</p>

<p>"This is the most difficult week for Hezbollah since its establishment –- the results speak for themselves," he said.</p>

<p>"Entire units were taken out of battle as a result of the activities conducted at the beginning of the week in which numerous terrorists were injured."</p>

<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was acting to change the "security balance" in the north.</p>

<p><strong>- Hezbollah wave of rockets -</strong></p>

<p>Hezbollah, which has been trading near-daily fire with Israel in support of Hamas, said it was in a "new phase" of confrontation.</p>

<p>The group said it launched rockets at Israeli military sites near Haifa and two bases in retaliation for Israeli strikes on the south and the Bekaa.</p>

<p>The attack came after an Israeli strike on southern Beirut on Friday killed its elite Radwan Force commander, Ibrahim Aqil, and coordinated communications device blasts that Hezbollah blamed on Israel killed 39 people and wounded almost 3,000 on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>

<p>Since the cross-border exchanges between Israel and Hezbollah began in October, tens of thousands of people on both sides have fled their homes.</p>

<p>An Israeli military official, who cannot be further identified under military rules, said the operation seeks to "degrade threats" from Hezbollah, push them back from the border, and then to destroy infrastructure.</p>

<p>Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati urged the United Nations and world powers to deter what he called Israel's "plan that aims to destroy Lebanese villages and towns".</p>

<p>- 'Full-fledged war' nearing -</p>

<p>EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell warned that Israel and Hezbollah were "almost in full-fledged war", ahead of a gathering of world leaders at the United Nations.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden, whose country is Israel's main ally and weapons supplier, said his country was "working to de-escalate in a way that allows people to return home safely".</p>

<p>The Pentagon said it was sending a small number of additional US military personnel to the Middle East after thousands were deployed earlier alongside warships, fighter jets and air defence systems.</p>

<p>A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity at the UN General Assembly, said that Washington opposed an Israeli ground invasion targeting Hezbollah and had "concrete ideas" on how to de-escalate the crisis.</p>

<p>UN chief Antonio Guterres was "gravely alarmed" by civilian casualties in Lebanon, his spokesman said.</p>

<p>The United Nations peacekeeping force in south Lebanon warned "any further escalation of this dangerous situation could have far-reaching and devastating consequences".</p>

<p>Qatar, a mediator in Gaza ceasefire talks, said Israel's bombardment of Lebanon "puts the region on the brink of the abyss", while Turkey said the strikes threatened "chaos" and Jordan urged an immediate end to the escalation "before it is too late".</p>

<p>The Palestinian foreign ministry condemned the strikes and ordered Palestinian medical staff in Lebanon to provide support for the wounded.</p>

<p>Iran's newly elected president, Masoud Pezeshkian, accused Israel of seeking "to create this wider conflict".</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Of the 251 hostages also seized by militants, 97 are still held in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 41,455 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to figures provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The UN has described the figures as reliable.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi, speaking at the United Nations Summit of the Future on Monday, said alongside terrorism, new areas of conflict are emerging and it is high time that "global action must match global ambition".</p>

<p>Pointing out that terrorism continues to be a serious threat to global peace and security, PM Modi said on the other hand, "cyber, maritime and space are emerging as new areas of conflict".</p>

<p>"On all these issues, I will stress that global action must match global ambition," he added.</p>

<p>Talking of growing global concern over dangers from new and evolving technologies, especially artificial intelligence, PM Modi said, "There is a need for balanced regulation at a global level, for the safe and responsible use of technology."</p>

<p>According to the Wilmington Declaration - made two days ago at the Quad meet -- leaders of the US, Australia, Japan and India announced their intention to enhance cybersecurity partnership.</p>

<p>"In the face of a deteriorating security environment in the cyber domain, Quad countries intend to enhance our cybersecurity partnership to address common threats posed by state-sponsored actors, cybercriminals, and other non-state malicious actors. Our countries commit to taking concrete steps to increase our collective network defense and advance technical capabilities through greater threat information sharing and capacity building," read the joint declaration.</p>

<p>The leaders, in their declaration, had unequivocally condemned terrorism and violent extremism in all its forms and manifestations, including cross-border terrorism.</p>

<p>"We are committed to international cooperation and will work with our regional partners in a comprehensive and sustained manner to strengthen their capability to prevent, detect and respond to threats posed by terrorism and violent extremism, including threats posed by the use of new and emerging technologies for terrorist purposes, consistent with international law," the statement had added.</p>

<p>"When we are discussing the global future, we must accord the highest priority to a human-centric approach while prioritising sustainable development," PM Modi also said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We must also ensure human welfare, food and health security," he added, declaring India was ready to share her experience in poverty eradication and bridging the digital divide.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world's biggest rainforest, the Amazon, has lost an area about the size of Germany and France combined to deforestation in four decades, a study showed Monday.</p>

<p>The South American jungle, spanning nine countries, is seen as crucial to the fight against climate change due to its ability to absorb planet-warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Deforestation, mainly for mining and agricultural purposes, has led to the loss of 12.5 percent of the Amazon's plant cover from 1985 to 2023, according to RAISG, a collective of researchers and NGOs.</p>

<p>This amounts to 88 million hectares (880,000 square kilometers, 339,773 square miles) of forest cover lost across Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana.</p>

<p>RAISG experts reported an "accelerated transformation" of the Amazon, with an "alarming increase" in the use of land previously occupied by forest for mining, crops, or livestock.</p>

<p>"A large number of ecosystems have disappeared to give way to immense expanses of pastures, soybean fields or other monocultures, or have been transformed into craters for gold mining," they said.</p>

<p>"With the loss of the forest, we emit more carbon into the atmosphere and this disrupts an entire ecosystem that regulates the climate and the hydrological cycle, clearly affecting temperatures," Sandra Rio Caceres, from the Institute of the Common Good -- a Peruvian association that took part in the study -- told AFP.</p>

<p>She said she believes the loss of vegetation in the Amazon is directly linked to severe drought and wildfires affecting several South American countries.</p>

<p>The World Weather Attribution network of scientists said Sunday that climate change was increasing the risk and severity of fires in the Amazon and Pantanal wetlands which are releasing "massive amounts" of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>"Never-ending heat has combined with low rainfall to turn these precious ecosystems into highly flammable tinderboxes," said Clair Barnes, a researcher from Imperial College London.</p>

<p>"As long as the world burns fossil fuels, the risk of devastating wildfires will continue to increase in the Amazon and Pantanal," she added.</p>

<p>The drought has placed some Amazon rivers at their lowest level in decades, threatening the lifestyle of some 47 million people who live on their banks.</p>

<p>The dry spell has sent fires -- often lit to clear land for farming -- burning out of control in Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[In New Mexico, scientists are exploring a futuristic solution to defend Earth against asteroid threats: harnessing X-ray blasts from nuclear explosions.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Asteroid collisions with Earth are surprisingly common, with NASA estimating 48.5 tonnes of meteoric material entering our atmosphere daily. Most burn up, producing shooting stars. Although devastating asteroid impacts are rare in Earth's history, humanity has learned a crucial lesson from the catastrophic event 66 million years ago. The asteroid responsible for the dinosaurs' extinction was approximately six miles wide, but significantly smaller objects still pose a significant threat.&nbsp;In the face of potentially catastrophic asteroid impacts, scientists are racing to develop innovative solutions to protect our planet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In New Mexico, scientists are exploring a futuristic solution to defend Earth against asteroid threats: harnessing X-ray blasts from nuclear explosions, the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/sep/23/nuclear-blast-could-save-earth-from-large-asteroid">Guardian</a></em> reported. Scientists at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque have&nbsp;successfully demonstrated a revolutionary method to deflect incoming asteroids using nuclear explosions. For the experiment, researchers harnessed the power of X-rays from a nuclear blast to vaporise the surface of a nearby asteroid.</p>

<p>The process works by unleashing an immense pulse of radiation, heating the asteroid's surface to tens of thousands of degrees. This creates a rapidly expanding ball of gas that can nudge the asteroid off its catastrophic course. By precisely calculating the blast's impact, scientists believe this technique can effectively push threatening asteroids away from Earth, potentially saving humanity from doomsday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The primary mechanism involves using X-rays to rapidly heat the target surface, causing it to vaporize and expand into the adjacent vacuum. The expanding gas pushes against the asteroid, transferring momentum (in the opposite direction)," authors of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-024-02633-7">study</a>&nbsp;published Monday in the journal Nature Physics wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scientists noted that the nuclear option is for larger asteroids, particularly when time is short. Researchers believe this strategy can effectively deflect asteroids up to 2.5 miles wide, although this isn't a rigid limit.</p>

<p>“If there is enough warning time, one can certainly deflect larger asteroids,” &nbsp;Dr Nathan Moore, the first author of the study said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Moore and his team plan to conduct further experimental tests to refine the X-ray deflection technique, building on their initial success. Their goal is to enhance the method's effectiveness through additional laboratory experiments. Ultimately, they envision a space-based demonstration, similar to NASA's DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) mission, to test the technique on a real asteroid.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Prime Minister Narendra Modi today called for reforms in the top global bodies, saying, "The success of humanity lies in our collective strength, not in the battlefield".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi today reiterated his message for world peace and called for reforms in top global institutions from the high platform of the UN General Assembly. "Reform is the key to relevance," he said.&nbsp;Speaking at the "Summit Of The Future" at the United Nations headquarters in New York, PM Modi said, "The success of humanity lies in our collective strength, not in the battlefield and for world peace and development, reform is essential for global organisations".</p>

<p>"For global peace and security, on the one hand there is a big threat like terrorism, on the other hand many new fields of conflict like cyber, maritime, space are also being created. On all these subjects, I would like to emphasize that Global Action must match Global Ambition,' he added.</p>

<p>PM Modi's message for peace comes after the UN General Assembly, which convened yesterday, adopted a "Pact for the Future" -- designed to address 21st Century challenges including climate change, conflict, and human rights.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was adopted despite resistance by a band of seven nations -- led by Russia which is currently engaged in armed conflict with Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Russia criticised the pact contending that the countries not satisfied with the agreement had not been given the opportunity for further negotiations.</p>

<p>"Regrettably, there is nothing good that today the United Nations adopted a Pact for the Future. The United Nations had infringed upon its own principles to pander to a group of delegations from the 'beautiful garden,' who have usurped the talks from the very beginning. And the majority from the 'jungle,' like a herd, could not find courage enough to protest and defend their rights. This is they who will bear responsibility for the consequences," Russia's First Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations Dmitry Polyansky said on his X account as cited by TASS.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[According to court documents, Sasser met David Wallace on Match.com and became obsessed after he revealed his engagement.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Melody Sasser, a 48-year-old Tennessee woman, was sentenced to 100 months in prison for attempting to hire a hitman to kill the wife of a man she met on a dating website. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/woman-tried-hire-hitman-kill-wife-man-met-match-seem-random-8715907">People,</a></em> Sasser used the dark website "Online Killers Market" to seek a hitman, offering $9,750 in Bitcoin for a "random" or "accident" killing.&nbsp;According to court documents, Sasser met David Wallace on Match.com and became obsessed after he revealed his engagement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Wallace told investigators that their relationship was limited to hiking companionship.&nbsp;Sasser had assisted him on an Appalachian Trail hike and they had also explored trails together in the Knoxville area before he relocated to Alabama&nbsp;and married his now-wife.</p>

<p>However, Sasser's interest evolved into an unhealthy obsession.&nbsp;After learning of his engagement, she showed up at his Alabama home, making disturbing threats and beginning a campaign of harassment against his now-wife.&nbsp;Sasser monitored the couple's activities using a fitness app and harassed the wife with six phone calls in one day.</p>

<p>''It needs to seem random or accident. or plant drugs, do not want a long investigation. She recently moved in with her new husband,” she wrote on the website, including details such as the couple's license plate numbers and the wife's workplace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sasser also notified the website administrator when he left her home for a mere two-mile walk.</p>

<p>"I have waited for two months and 11 days and the job is not completed. 2 weeks ago you said it has been worked on and would be done in a week. The job is still not done. Does it need to be assigned to someone else? Will it be done? What is the delay? When will it be done," Sasser wrote in a follow-up message to the website's administrator.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the plan was unsuccessful. During the search of her home, law enforcement uncovered incriminating evidence, including a journal detailing multiple hitman websites and a handwritten account of her communications with the notorious "Online Killers Market". Additionally, investigators found a stash of cash hidden beneath a sticky note bearing a Bitcoin address.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result, a federal grand jury indicted Sasser in June last year for utilising interstate commerce facilities to facilitate murder-for-hire. Sasser ultimately accepted responsibility for her crimes through a plea deal. On Wednesday, she received her sentence: 100 months in prison, accompanied by an order to pay over $5,300 in restitution to the victim.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Sri Lanka has made history by voting leftist Anura Kumara Dissanayake to power.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lanka has made history by voting leftist Anura Kumara Dissanayake to power. The people rejected all the known and tested political leaders and dynasts - Rajapaksa, Wickremesinghe and Premadasa - who, according to them, contributed to the island nation's economic collapse.</p>

<p>The Election Commission declared AKD, as Dissanayake is popularly known, as the winner after the second round of counting. Dissanayake won 5.7 million (42.3%) votes after two rounds of counting in the nation's first-ever second preference vote count - defeating Sajith Premadasa of the SJB (Samagi Jana Balawegaya), who got 4.5 million (32.8%). It was a big defeat for incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who fought as an independent and was a distant third with 17.3% votes. Namal Rajapaksa, the son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, managed only 2.4% of the total votes.</p>

<p>It is a robust victory for Dissanayake, the leader of the Marxist JVP (Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna) and also the broader front NPP (National Peoples Power), which had won just over 3% of votes in the previous presidential election in 2019. It also reflects the extent of Sri Lankans' distrust of the old regime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Soon after his win, Dissanayake wrote on X: "This achievement is not the result of any single person's work, but the collective effort of hundreds of thousands of you. Your commitment has brought us this far, and for that, I am deeply grateful. This victory belongs to all of us."</p>

<p><strong>Pragmatic leader</strong></p>

<p>An analysis of Dissanayake's political career reveals that he is a pragmatic leader who knows how to deal with global political realities despite his ideological moorings rooted in Marxism.</p>

<p>Dissanayake's political activism began when he was a university leader in the early 1990s, and it brought him close to the JVP (Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna), a left-wing Marxist-Leninist party mainly consisting of Sinhalese rural youth and known for its armed uprisings in 1971 and 1987-89. It is interesting to note that JVP's origins are linked to a faction within the Communist Party of Sri Lanka (CPSL) in the 1960s, mostly in its pro-China bloc.</p>

<p>However, ground-level electoral politics forced JVP to temper its stand, which had a positive impact on leaders like Dissanayake, who became the party's national organiser in 1997. In 2000, he became an MP. His elevation as JVP chief came after a long wait, in 2014. Dissanayake's flexibility and willingness to learn enabled him to grasp Sri Lanka's economic issues and relate to the rural and working-class citizens, especially through the country's worst economic crises in the late 2010s and early 2020s. His brief stint as Agriculture Minister also helped him connect with Sri Lanka's rural agricultural sector, setting him apart from the political elite.</p>

<p>Incandescent anger against the political elite over an economic mess saw Sri Lankans overthrow the Rajapaksa family in 2022. To voters fed up with steep inflation, food, fuel and medicine shortages and swelling debt, Dissanayake's anti-corruption stance and promise of political reforms appealed to the masses, especially the youth.</p>

<p>The victory will be overwhelming both for Dissanayake and JVP. This is their first time in power, and the lack of experience could be a worry domestically as well as internationally.</p>

<p>India is closely observing the developments in its neighbourhood, just a couple of hours away by speed boat from its southern tip Rameswaram. So is China, which is striving to increase its influence over the island nation.</p>

<p>Sri Lanka has undeniably moved towards China in the past 15 years, handing many lucrative projects to the country. Among other projects, China snagged one to develop an airport in Colombo. Earlier, the strategically important Hambantota Port, situated along the world's busiest shipping lane linking Asia and Europe was given to China, which gave it an upper hand in the region.</p>

<p><strong>India's stakes</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
India has splurged millions of dollars in the form of aid and loans to ensure stability in Sri Lanka, its closest neighbour.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Dissanayake on his victory and said he looks forward to working closely with him to further strengthen the Indo-Lanka multifaceted cooperation.</p>

<p>In his response on Monday (Sept 23), Dissanayake thanked PM Modi for his 'kind' words and support and said he shared his commitment to strengthening ties.</p>

<p>Historically, JVP has been anti-India, especially during the late 1980s, when the party held agitations against Indian imports, including medicines and drugs.</p>

<p>India will also be concerned about the Tamil population in Sri Lanka, as Dissanayake's party has had a complex and antagonistic relationship with Tamil nationalism and LTTE. The JVP opposed the Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord in 1987, and did not support the implementation of the 13th amendment of the Sri Lankan Constitution, which delegates powers to the country's Tamil minority.</p>

<p>A majority of Tamils did not vote for Dissanayake, given what they believe is the apathy of his alliance NPP towards Tamils' political demands. Whether Dissanayake, after taking office, will reach out to the country's Tamil minority will be watched.</p>

<p>Experts believe that the rigid stance may not hold up against the strategic geopolitical realities. Dissanayake displayed his eagerness to engage with India as early as February 2024 and met with Foreign Minister S Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.</p>

<p>Sri Lankans have reposed their faith in Dissanayake as their last hope. They are yet to experience his rule or his policies. His recent speeches do suggest a more nuanced approach, moderating his Left-leaning position. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Dissanayake has a lot on his plate on the domestic front, and fixing the economy will be his priority. He is expected to dissolve parliament and call parliamentary elections soon. Some of his public statements and decisions didn't seem to favour India's interests in the recent past.</p>

<p>India needs to use its diplomatic channels to ensure that Indian investments like the wind power project in the northern part of Sri Lanka are not jeopardised. Given the project's strategic location in northern Sri Lanka, any setback could mean a Chinese company or its proxy taking over, which would be a concern given the significance of the region and the presence of the Tamil minority.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaking at the "UN Summit of the Future" on Saturday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has said that he wants to close the "AI Divide" and pledged 120 million USD for AI training and education around the world, according to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/united-nations-keynote-2024/">blog</a> on Google.</p>

<p>Pichai addressed the United Nations General assembly (UNGA) at the very first "UN Summit of the Future," delivering the keynote speech. Pichai announced "Global AI Opportunity Fund" at the event and said that the AI education will be done in local languages, in partnerships with nonprofits and NGOs.</p>

<p>Pichai expressed his confidence in AI being the most transformative technology yet, and shared his personal experience as to how technology changed his life, being born and brought up in Chennai. He mentioned four ways through which AI technology has potential for transformative change: access to information in one's own language, AI driven scientific discoveries, AI's climate-related disaster management systems, and AI's contribution to the world economy.</p>

<p>However, Pichai also cautioned regarding AI's potential for harm as well. He expressed concerns of accuracy, biasness as well as misapplication of AI like in case of deep fakes. Pichai also called for regulations that do not give into protectionist impulses, enabling wider reach of AI technologies for equal opportunity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kelly Andrade, a 25-year-old live-in nanny, has been awarded a $2.78 million payout after discovering she was secretly videotaped by her millionaire boss, Michael Esposito, at his New York home. Ms Andrade, from Colombia, cared for Esposito's four children while living with the family, the <em><u><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/22/us-news/nyc-jury-awards-au-pair-who-was-secretly-filmed-by-creepy-chicken-mogul-employer-2-78m/" rel="nofollow, noindex">New York Post</a></u></em> reported.&nbsp; However, her job abruptly ended when she found a hidden camera in a smoke detector in her bedroom.&nbsp;The twisted episode unfolded in 2021.</p>

<aside>
<p>Ms Andrade's suspicions arose after noticing Esposito frequently adjusting the smoke detector, which was constantly repositioned. Her worst fears were confirmed when she discovered a hidden camera inside, containing a memory card filled with hundreds of recordings – many of which captured intimate moments of her nude or dressing/undressing. Within minutes of her finding the device, Esposito showed up at the house.&nbsp;Fearing for her safety, she escaped through a window when he arrived home and started banging on her door.</p>

<p>''He seemed very nervous and he seemed very worried when he arrived at the house,'' she recalled.</p>

<p>Esposito was arrested on suspicion of illegal surveillance, which carries a maximum four-year prison sentence. However, he was allowed to walk free after agreeing to two years of probation and counselling. A Manhattan jury awarded Ms Andrade $780,000 in emotional distress damages against Esposito and his wife Danielle, plus $2 million in punitive damages against him.</p>
</aside>

<p>Speaking to the <em>Post</em>, the nanny said, ''It's not enough for the whole situation I've been through these three years. It's not enough. I was angry because the damage that he caused me was irreversible.''</p>

<p>After enduring a traumatic experience, she is now devoted to healing and moving forward. The Colombian native, residing in New Jersey with her husband, reflected on the gruelling trial process, stating that it forced her to "relive" painful memories she had sought to forget.&nbsp;By sharing her story, she seeks to ensure that no one else suffers in silence and that perpetrators are held accountable for their actions.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan lodged a "very serious protest" with Moscow after a Russian patrol plane entered its airspace three times, the defence minister said Monday, calling it the first confirmed incursion since 2019.</p>

<p>The military responded by scrambling fighter jets and issuing radio and flare warnings, Japan's Defense Minister Minoru Kihara told reporters.</p>

<p>"We confirmed today that a Russian Il-38 patrol aircraft has violated our airspace over our territorial waters north of Rebun Island, Hokkaido, on three occasions," he said.</p>

<p>"The airspace violation is extremely regrettable and today we lodged a very serious protest with the Russian government via diplomatic channels and strongly urged them to prevent a recurrence."</p>

<p>Japan has supported the Western position on Ukraine, providing Kyiv with financial and material support and sanctioning Russian individuals and organisations after Moscow's invasion of its neighbour.</p>

<p>Mr Kihara said it was "the first publicly announced airspace incursion by a Russian aircraft since June 2019", when a Tu-95 bomber entered Japanese airspace in southern Okinawa and around the Izu Islands south of Tokyo.</p>

<p>In 2023, an aircraft believed but not confirmed to be Russian entered Japanese airspace, according to the defence ministry.</p>

<p>Top government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi also said on Monday that "we will refrain from giving any definitive information on the intent and purpose of this action, but the Russian military has been active in the vicinity of our country since the invasion of Ukraine".</p>

<p>Japan also scrambled fighter jets this month when Russian aircraft flew around the archipelago for the first time since 2019.</p>

<p>The Tu-142 planes did not enter Japanese airspace but flew over an area subject to a territorial dispute between Japan and Russia, Tokyo said.</p>

<p>Russian and Chinese warships recently held joint drills in the Sea of Japan, part of a major naval exercise that President Vladimir Putin said was the largest of its kind for three decades.</p>

<p>Japan scrambled fighter jets in August after the first confirmed incursion by a Chinese military aircraft into its airspace, with Tokyo calling it a "serious violation" of its sovereignty.</p>

<p>Then last week, a Chinese aircraft carrier sailed between two Japanese islands near Taiwan for the first time. Japan called that incident "totally unacceptable from the perspective of the security environment of Japan and the region".</p>

<p>China said the passage complied with international law.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Despite his decade-long absence, the government official remarkably escaped termination or penalties, continuing to collect his salary and bonuses without interruption.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A shocking scandal has rocked Thailand, exposing the country's deep-seated corruption issues. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3279397/thai-official-inactive-10-years-continues-receive-salary-while-working-nightclub" rel="nofollow, noindex">South China Morning Post</a></em>, a government official from the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Department in Ang Thong province allegedly received a salary and bonuses for 10 years without ever showing up to work. The reason? He was too busy singing at a nightclub to bother with his day job. The official was constantly exhausted from working at night, which led him to skip work during the day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite his decade-long absence, the government official remarkably escaped termination or penalties, continuing to collect his salary and bonuses without interruption. To maintain a facade of accountability, he would periodically receive a summons to the office to receive reprimands or sign documents at the mayor's behest - a strategic move seemingly designed to dodge scrutiny.</p>

<p>The shocking case of misconduct was only revealed thanks to a Facebook page called Watchdog, dedicated to exposing government wrongdoing. The page has garnered 1.1 million followers, highlighting the widespread concern over corruption in Thailand. According to Transparency International's 2023 Corruption Perceptions Index, Thailand scored a dismal 35 out of 100, ranking 108th out of 180 countries. A staggering 88% of Thai respondents view government corruption as a significant problem, with 24% admitting to paying bribes in the past year.</p>

<p>This incident has sparked outrage, with many questioning the government's lack of accountability. Under Thai law, corrupt officials can face one to 10 years in prison and fines ranging from 2,000 to 20,000 baht ($60 to $600).&nbsp;The local government has maintained silence regarding the case,&nbsp;and it remains unclear whether or how the official will be punished.</p>

<p>Notably, this isn't an isolated incident. Another case involves a family in Nakhon Ratchasima province, who endured six years of bullying by their neighbour – a government official and son of a high-ranking police officer. Despite reporting the abuse, the family faced legal threats, and the perpetrator remains uncharged.</p>

<p>Thailand's public sector employs approximately 1.68 million workers, including 421,000 civil servants. Once coveted for their financial security and benefits, these jobs are now losing appeal among young people, who increasingly opt for riskier careers to pursue their passions.</p>

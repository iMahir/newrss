       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There will be no studio audience, depriving candidates of the momentum that comes from ginning up supporters. Microphones will cut out when a candidate's speaking time is over. Thursday night's presidential debate will not be business as usual.</p>

<p>CNN, which is hosting President Joe Biden and his predecessor Donald Trump for their first debate of the 2024 campaign in Atlanta, wants to avoid the chaos seen when the two men squared off in 2020.</p>

<p>Here are some facts about the 90-minute debate, a key moment in the race for the White House, but one whose impact is difficult to predict.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;Averting mayhem&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In their first war of words four years ago, Trump repeatedly cut off the veteran Democrat, launched into lengthy diatribes and taunted his rival, who ended up shouting at one point: "Will you shut up, man?"</p>

<p>It was hardly the height of presidential decorum.</p>

<p>To cut down on the hijinks, CNN has set up a series of rules, to which both campaigns agreed.</p>

<p>Among the most notable: When the candidates take the stage at the network's Atlanta studios at 9:00 pm (0100 GMT Friday), there will be no one in the audience.</p>

<p>Microphones will be muted except for the candidate asked to speak. There will be two commercial breaks during the showdown between 78-year-old Trump and 81-year-old Biden, the two oldest presumptive White House nominees in history.</p>

<p>Moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, both regular CNN on-air presenters, will "use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion," the network said.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump gets last word&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Biden won the coin toss, allowing him to choose either his podium position or whether he preferred to speak first or second in final statements.</p>

<p>The incumbent chose the podium on the viewers' right, and Trump opted to have the last word.</p>

<h3><strong>No live fact-checking&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>CNN has not revealed the debate themes and does not plan to fact-check candidate statements in real time -- even if Trump repeats the baseless charge that the 2020 election was stolen from him.</p>

<p>For Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania, "one problem with a debate that features Donald Trump is that the moderators don't fact check in real-time, nor should they."</p>

<p>"It's highly risky to try to do that and it would be disruptive of the debate if they did," she told AFP. "The danger is instead of informing, a debate could actually increase the amount of inaccurate knowledge."</p>

<p>Biden and Trump will not have teleprompters and they cannot bring pre-written notes to the stage, although they will be provided with paper and pen. Consulting with campaign staff during commercial breaks will not be allowed.</p>

<h3><strong>Debate airs on all networks&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Both candidates rejected the oversight of the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates formed in 1987 to manage such events.</p>

<p>Instead, they made a direct deal with CNN. The news network, now owned by media conglomerate Warner Bros Discovery, afforded its rivals the opportunity to broadcast the debate live in the name of public service, under certain conditions.</p>

<p>The screen must bear the CNN logo and outside commentary is forbidden.</p>

<p>Fox News -- which regularly attacks CNN as biased against Trump -- plans to hit the airwaves two hours before the event, with talk show hosts Jesse Watters and Sean Hannity providing pre-game insights.</p>

<p>In the past, Hannity has called Tapper a "radical left-wing partisan talk show host masquerading as a journalist."</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;Impact on campaign?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The debate will certainly be a key moment in the campaign, watched by tens of millions: a record 84 million tuned in to watch Trump's first battle with Hillary Clinton in 2016, and 73 million saw Trump and Biden duke it out in 2020.</p>

<p>But it will not necessarily be a game-changer.</p>

<p>This is the first time a debate has been organized so early in the race, more than four months before Election Day, and even before the candidates have been formally nominated by their respective parties.</p>

<p>"The worry is that the public in the United States doesn't pay much attention to news in summer," said Jamieson.</p>

<p>"In general, presidential debates don't affect a sufficient number of votes to decide the outcome of an election. But when an election is close, as this one may be, debates can play an important role."</p>

<p>ABC is scheduled to host a second debate on September 10.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[From Gerald Ford's catastrophic Soviet gaffe to Ronald Reagan's witty remark about his age and Joe Biden asking Donald Trump to "shut up," US presidential debates have been funny, vicious and everything in between.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Gerald Ford's catastrophic Soviet gaffe to Ronald Reagan's witty remark about his age and Joe Biden asking Donald Trump to "shut up," US presidential debates have been funny, vicious and everything in between.</p>

<p>Here are some of the most memorable moments from more than 60 years of modern American debates.</p>

<h3><strong>Kennedy-Nixon, September 26, 1960&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>It was the first televised debate of its kind, when everything was still broadcast in black-and-white, and it established the importance of a politician's public image. Republican Richard Nixon looked poised to win the election, having served two terms as vice president under Dwight Eisenhower.</p>

<p>But the debate did not go well for him. Nixon refused to wear makeup and appeared pale and sweaty in front of more than 66 million viewers, while the young Massachusetts senator John F. Kennedy looked tanned and relaxed. While Nixon addressed the moderator, Kennedy looked at the camera, speaking directly to his voters.</p>

<p>How much the debate visuals pushed the needle is disputed, but Kennedy went on to defeat Nixon at the polls.</p>

<h3><strong>Ford-Carter, October 6, 1976&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The first debate between Republican president Gerald Ford and Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter was marked by a 27-minute loss of audio. The second debate didn't go well for Ford either, when he made a gaffe that arguably cost him the presidency.</p>

<p>At the height of the Cold War, Ford uttered that "there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration," even though the Soviet Union had troops deployed across the Eastern bloc.</p>

<p>Six days passed before Ford explained himself, saying that he spoke not of the literal military presence but meant that people's spirits there hadn't been crushed.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;Reagan-Mondale, October 21, 1984&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Republican president Ronald Reagan was 73 when he ran for a second term against 56-year-old Walter Mondale. But he managed to turn his age into his strength with a witty answer that went down in history.</p>

<p>"I will not make age an issue of this campaign," Reagan said when asked whether he was fit for office. "I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience."</p>

<h3><strong>Bush-Clinton-Perot, October 15, 1992&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The second presidential debate in the 1992 race pitted incumbent president George Bush against both his future successor Bill Clinton and Ross Perot, an independent candidate.</p>

<p>Bush was caught on camera looking at his watch while Clinton talked to an audience member during a town hall debate, a move that cost Bush dearly.</p>

<p>Years later, Bush admitted he hated the debates. "Maybe that's why I was looking at it, 'only 10 more minutes of this crap.'"</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;Obama-Romney, October 22, 2012&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>During a debate against president Barack Obama, Republican challenger Mitt Romney lamented that the US Navy had fewer ships presently than it did in 1916.</p>

<p>"Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed," Obama retorted.</p>

<p>"We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go under water, nuclear submarines."</p>

<p>Obama's comments went viral online.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump-Clinton, October 9, 2016&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The second debate of the 2016 US presidential election pitting Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was particularly vicious.</p>

<p>Coming shortly after the release of a video in which Trump was heard boasting that his fame allowed him to grope women, the Republican billionaire went after his opponent's husband, former president Bill Clinton, accusing him of being "so abusive to women."</p>

<p>Trump also vowed to have Hillary Clinton investigated over her use of a private email account when she was secretary of state.</p>

<p>"It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country," Clinton said.</p>

<p>Trump shot back: "Because you'd be in jail."</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;Trump-Biden, September 29, 2020&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The first debate of the 2020 presidential election, featuring Trump and Democrat Joe Biden, devolved into shouting and insults.</p>

<p>With Trump constantly interrupting him, Biden snapped, saying, "Will you shut up, man?"</p>

<p>The Democrat also called his opponent a "clown" and "Putin's puppy."</p>

<p>Trump for his part kept evading the question of whether he would recognize the results of the election.</p>

<p>Powerless to control the two candidates, the debate moderator, Fox News journalist Chris Wallace, later described feeling "desperation."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another whistleblower stepped forward Wednesday alleging he was retaliated against after flagging potentially dangerous manufacturing problems on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.</p>

<p>Richard Cuevas filed complaints with two US agencies alleging he was dismissed suddenly in March 2024 after raising concerns over manufacturing deviations in the forward pressure bulkhead, which is critical to managing pressure during flights, according to attorneys Katz Banks Kumin.</p>

<p>Cuevas is the latest whistleblower to come forward from Boeing's operations, adding to scrutiny of the plane maker following a January inflight incident on a 737 MAX operated by Alaska Airlines that required an emergency landing.</p>

<p>Cuevas worked as a contractor for Strom, who assigned him to Spirit AeroSystems, which builds fuselages for the Dreamliner.</p>

<p>In October 2023, Cuevas filed an ethics complaint with Boeing, alleging Spirit had made unauthorized changes to fastener hole dimensions in the forward pressure bulkhead on 787 aircraft without notifying Boeing.</p>

<p>"Our client witnessed critical issues with the forward pressure bulkhead assembly on multiple planes that deviated from Boeing's specifications," said a statement from Katz Banks Kumin.</p>

<p>"He recognized the substandard work and expressed concern about his safety concerns, but Spirit and Boeing failed to stop the faulty manufacturing processes. Mr. Cuevas was fired when his manager found out that an employee complained about these issues, and suspected that employee was Mr. Cuevas."</p>

<p>The attorneys filed complaints with the Federal Aviation Administration and the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, saying in the latter submission that Cuevas believes that "based on his direct observations of glaring safety issues, that Boeing's and Spirit's statements to the public and investors about the safety of 787 Dreamliners are fraudulent."</p>

<p>The attorneys also represent Sam Salehpour, a Boeing engineer who testified in April in the Senate about concerns over 787 manufacturing practices and that he was retaliated against for speaking.</p>

<p>Boeing said it is not involved in personnel decisions of subcontracts.</p>

<p>"A subcontractor's employee previously reported concerns to us that we thoroughly investigated as we take seriously any safety-related matter. Engineering analysis determined that the issues raised did not present a safety concern and were addressed," Boeing said. "We are reviewing the documents released today and will thoroughly investigate any new claim."</p>

<p>Spirit "leadership is aware of the allegations and looking into the matter," said company spokesperson Joe Buccino. "We encourage all Spirit employees with concerns to come forward, safe in knowing they will be protected."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The NHS, created after World War II to provide free healthcare to all, is a shadow of its former self, weakened by years of underfunding and the Covid-19 pandemic.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fatme Ibryanova, 36, will travel from Britain to Turkey next month, not to holiday but for a medical appointment about surgery she is struggling to get on the UK's "broken" state-run health service.</p>

<p>The NHS, created after World War II to provide free healthcare to all, is a shadow of its former self, weakened by years of underfunding and the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Getting an appointment with a doctor or a dentist is often an ordeal. Emergency rooms are usually overwhelmed, and waiting times for hospital treatment regularly hit new highs.</p>

<p>But the institution remains beloved by Britons, and the malaise afflicting it is one of their primary concerns going into the country's general election on July 4.</p>

<p>Ibryanova has just seen her local doctor in Chelmsford, a London commuter town in Essex, southeast England, for an ear infection that has been causing her severe pain for months.</p>

<p>It has stopped her working and she needs an operation, quickly.</p>

<p>"I'm on a waiting list. I have to wait three or four months. That's long," she told AFP.</p>

<p>So she decided to go to Turkey, her home country, where she can receive treatment sooner.</p>

<p>"If you need operation, they are doing it like this," she said, snapping her fingers.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Broken' -</strong></p>

<p>Ibryanova is not alone. More than 7.5 million people in England were waiting for treatment in April, a new peak despite recent investment by the Conservative government.</p>

<p>A recent survey suggested that less than a quarter of Britons were satisfied with the NHS, an unprecedented level.</p>

<p>"We have to wait three weeks for a blood test. We often have to queue to buy medications when you can buy them," lamented 71-year-old retiree Christine Knight.</p>

<p>The crisis is particularly acute in south Essex, with one doctor for more than 2,300 patients at the end of last year, much worse than the national average, according to the Nuffield Trust health think-tank.</p>

<p>Two doctors' surgeries have closed in Chelmsford in recent years, explained Marie Goldman, the candidate for the Liberal Democrats party in the constituency, which has a sitting Conservative MP.</p>

<p>"What is left is a hole. It is so frustrating for people," Goldman added. Voters always asked her about the NHS, she said.</p>

<p>The opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games celebrated the health service as the "pride" of the UK, she pointed out. But today, she said, it's "broken".</p>

<p>Hospitals here are among the worst in the country for cancer care, with more than three-quarters of patients having to wait more than a month to start treatment once diagnosed.</p>

<p>The local health body declined to comment when contacted by AFP.</p>

<p>Bobby Jacobs, a 30-year-old construction worker, recently had hand surgery at the town's Broomfield Hospital.</p>

<p>He noted a lack of resources in a system that already relies heavily on caregivers from abroad.</p>

<p>"You can see on every nurse's face that they are so overworked and overstressed. They are working long hours. There is not enough of them," he told AFP.</p>

<p><strong>- Funding needed -</strong></p>

<p>Long and frequent strikes over pay and conditions, including a historic first walkout by nurses, have plagued the NHS over the past two years.</p>

<p>Low morale is leading professionals to leave the service or try to cut back on hours.</p>

<p>"It was not unusual to see 45 to 50 patients a day, sometimes more than that," said James Booth, a doctor for more than 20 years who quit one workplace to go part-time at another.</p>

<p>He cited an ageing population, less time with patients, and a shortage of staff.</p>

<p>"We're seeing worrying numbers of doctors, nurses and other professionals leaving early into their careers or not joining the NHS at all," said Billy Palmer, of the Nuffield Trust.</p>

<p>Booth noted that two private clinics have opened in Chelmsford in recent years and are doing "very well".</p>

<p>All parties, including Labour -- which is tipped to form the next government -- are promising to fix the NHS through massive recruitment, innovation and reorganisation.</p>

<p>Experts remain unconvinced, however, saying what the system really needs is a massive injection of cash currently not available.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[He was quickly rushed to the hospital where he is still recovering.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Panic ensued at a casino in Singapore after a man suffered a heart attack while celebrating his 3.2 million pound (Rs 33,76,45,600) jackpot. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/wealth/man-wins-6m-jackpot-at-marina-bay-sands-casino-in-singapore-collapses-immediately-after-suffering-heart-attack/news-story/17485409921ad4dc1744f3500166c1d1">news.com.au</a>, the incident happened&nbsp;at the Marina Bay Sands Casino in Singapore on June 22.&nbsp;The unnamed man, a regular visitor&nbsp;to the casino, was left overjoyed after he won the life-changing amount.&nbsp;As he was celebrating and punching the air in sheer joy., he suddenly fell to the ground having a cardiac arrest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As he collapsed,&nbsp;horrified bystanders gathered around him as the staff rushed to help him. A woman accompanying the man became increasingly worried and was heard pleading with the staff as they tried to administer medical assistance. He was&nbsp;quickly rushed to the hospital where he is recovering from cardiac arrest.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, many social media reports suggested the man died, however, industry insiders said that the man is alive and still in recovery at the hospital.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the casino condemned the false reporting, highlighting the distress it has caused the man's family. ''Unfortunately, the fake news has spread, and the video still circulating online is causing some distress to the guest's family,'' he said.&nbsp;Some sources&nbsp;have also disputed the amount that the gambler won, however, there is no official clarification of it yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The casino is owned and operated by Las Vegas Sands, a Nevada-based company pulling revenues of $10.4 billion last year.</p>

<p>In a similar incident in 2021, a man in Michigan in the US was found washed up dead on a beach with the winning ticket in his pocket.&nbsp;A similar unfortunate incident happened in the US in April after a man fell into cardiac arrest while sitting at a Las Vegas blackjack table.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA on Tuesday said it had picked SpaceX to build a vessel to carry the International Space Station back through Earth's atmosphere and on to a final resting place in the Pacific Ocean after it is retired in 2030.</p>

<p>Elon Musk's company has been awarded a contract with a potential value of $843 million to develop and deliver the spaceship, dubbed the US Deorbit Vehicle.</p>

<p>"Selecting a US Deorbit Vehicle for the International Space Station will help NASA and its international partners ensure a safe and responsible transition in low Earth orbit at the end of station operations," said NASA's Ken Bowersox in a statement.</p>

<p>NASA plans to take ownership of the spacecraft after SpaceX builds it, and control operations throughout the mission.</p>

<p>Weighing 430,000 kilograms (950,000) pounds, the ISS is by far the largest single structure ever built in space.</p>

<p>Based on past observations of how other stations such as Mir and Skylab disintegrated on atmospheric re-entry, NASA engineers expect the orbital outpost to break up in three stages.</p>

<p>First, the massive solar arrays and the radiators that keep the orbital lab cool will come off, then individual modules will break off from the truss, or the station's backbone structure. Finally, the truss and the modules themselves will tear apart.</p>

<p>Much of the material will be vaporized, but large pieces are expected to survive. For this reason, NASA is aiming for an area of the Pacific Ocean called Point Nemo, one of the most remote areas of the world and known as the graveyard of satellites and spaceships.</p>

<p>The first segment of the ISS was launched in 1998, and it has been continuously inhabited by an international crew since 2001.</p>

<p>The US, Japan, Canada, and participating countries of the European Space Agency (ESA) have committed to operate the microgravity lab through 2030 -- though Russia, the fifth partner, has only committed to operations through 2028.</p>

<p>NASA chief Bill Nelson told Congress in April that given the dire state of US-Russia ties, it would be prudent to begin work on a US deorbit vehicle to "get the whole station down safely, so it won't hit anybody or anything."</p>

<p>Several companies are working on commercial successors to the ISS, including notably Axiom Space and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Julian Assange spent his first night in 14 years as a free man back at home in Australia as the conservative opposition on Thursday cautioned the government against hailing the WikiLeaks founder as a hero.</p>

<p>Assange landed in Australia to an ecstatic welcome on Wednesday evening after spending more than five years in a British high-security jail and seven years in asylum at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.</p>

<p>He had battled extradition to Sweden on sexual assault allegations and to the U.S., where he faced 18 criminal charges tied to WikiLeaks' release in 2010 of hundreds of thousands of U.S. classified military documents and diplomatic cables.</p>

<p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who has been calling for Assange's release for several years, welcomed him home in a phone call saying he "had a very warm discussion" with Assange.</p>

<p>However, the conservative opposition raised concerns about portraying Assange as a hero after he spent more than a decade trying to avoid prosecution and then pleaded guilty to one criminal count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified national defence documents.</p>

<p>The opposition leader in the Senate, Simon Birmingham, welcomed Assange's release but posted on X that "he's no martyr and was never a political prisoner denied access to justice."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">This call is neither necessary nor appropriate. Julian Assange was not wrongfully detained like Cheng Lei, Sean Turnell or Kylie Moore-Gilbert.<br />
<br />
For 12 years Assange chose to avoid facing justice in countries with fair judicial systems. He is underserving of this treatment. <a href="https://t.co/I8zDNFZ66V">https://t.co/I8zDNFZ66V</a></p>
— Simon Birmingham (@Birmo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Birmo/status/1805921152352788885?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 26, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>He cautioned Albanese against meeting Assange and said the release could strain Australia's ties with the United States, but that was rejected by Foreign Minister Penny Wong.</p>

<p>Wong told ABC Radio on Thursday that Assange's release posed no threat to Australia-U.S. ties.</p>

<p>James Paterson, the opposition's home affairs spokesperson, told Sky News Assange had evaded lawful extradition requests by hiding in the Ecuadorean embassy and used his legal rights in the UK to challenge it over many years.</p>

<p>"He is now someone who's pled guilty to very serious national security offences, which are not just offences against the United States. They're offences against the Five Eyes intelligence gathering alliance, including Australia," he said.</p>

<p>The U.S. State Department on Wednesday said its involvement in the resolution of Assange's case was very limited and reiterated its position that his actions had put lives at risk, although the U.S. judge who accepted his guilty plea said there had been no personal victim.</p>

<p>The White House was not in any way involved in the case, national security spokesman John Kirby said, adding it was a Department of Justice matter.</p>

<p>Assange's supporters and free speech advocates view him as a victim because he exposed U.S. wrongdoing and potential crimes, including in conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>

<p>However, the U.S. government has long said his actions were reckless and by publishing the names of government sources he had put agents' lives at risk.</p>

<p>Assange has not spoken publicly since being released. His wife, Stella, said it was too soon to say what her husband would do next and requested privacy for him.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Russian pranksters who often target people the Russian state is interested in released footage on Wednesday of a video call with British Foreign Secretary David Cameron after tricking him into thinking he was speaking to a former Ukrainian president.</p>

<p>London's Foreign Office said earlier this month that Cameron had held a video call with someone purporting to be former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko before realising he was the victim of a hoax.</p>

<p>The call, which appears to have lasted around 15 minutes and in which Cameron is shown talking on his mobile phone dressed casually somewhere outside, was carried out by Russian pranksters who use the aliases "Vovan and Lexus."</p>

<p>The duo is well-known inside Russia having duped a string of Western politicians over the years, including Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and, in 2022, then British defence minister Ben Wallace.</p>

<p>The Foreign Office said on Wednesday that the call looked like a Russian information operation designed to distract attention from Moscow's war in Ukraine. It did not answer a question about the video's authenticity.</p>

<p>Vovan and Lexus have in the past denied Western accusations that they have links to Russia's intelligence services, though they often ask their victims questions that would be of interest to the Russian state.</p>

<p>In Wednesday's video, the authenticity of which Reuters could not independently verify, Cameron is seen and heard talking about sensitive Ukraine-related topics.</p>

<p><strong>LOBBYING TRUMP</strong></p>

<p>In particular, he is heard talking about a private dinner he had with U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump in April during which he lobbied Trump to allow Republicans to vote in favour of U.S. military aid for Ukraine.</p>

<p>Cameron is heard saying that the Republican party is split on Ukraine and that he had told Trump that he was wrong if he thought Putin just wanted Crimea and Donbas, two of five Ukrainian regions Moscow now says are part of Russia.</p>

<p>The Washington Post reported in April that Trump had privately spoken about the option of allowing Putin to keep Crimea and Donbas in return for peace, something Trump's campaign has not confirmed.</p>

<p>Cameron is heard saying such an idea is flawed.</p>

<p>"Trump is convinced there's a deal to be made and that's not the case because Putin wants so much more," says Cameron, adding that he thinks Trump, if he wins the presidency, will support the winning side on the battlefield and that is why this summer's fighting is so important.</p>

<p>Cameron is also heard saying Ukraine will not be invited to join the NATO military alliance at a summit next month because Washington is opposed to the idea. Cameron also says he does not think a potential French plan to send troops to Ukraine is the right approach because they would become a target for Putin.</p>

<p>In another segment, he is heard recounting a conversation with the foreign minister of Kazakhstan who he said had told him the Central Asian nation feared Russia "wanted a slice" of northern Kazakhstan where many ethnic Russians live.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Britain's Foreign Office said in a statement:</p>

<p>"...We made public the fact that this call happened weeks ago, to do the right thing and make sure others were warned of the risk at the earliest opportunity. The Foreign Secretary understood this was a private call with a Ukrainian politician.</p>

<p>"This is clearly Russian, and is standard practice for information operations. Disinformation is a tactic straight from the Kremlin playbook to try to distract from their illegal activities in Ukraine and the human rights abuses being committed there."</p>

<p>"We do not want war, but we are preparing for every scenario," Gallant told reporters during the visit that ended Wednesday.</p>

<p>"Hezbollah understands very well that we can inflict massive damage in Lebanon if a war is launched," he said.</p>

<p>Tensions have been rising, with growing skirmishes along the border between Israel and the Iranian-backed militia, since the October 7 attack by Hamas that prompted a relentless Israeli retaliatory campaign in Gaza.</p>

<p>Gallant said that Israel has killed more than 400 Hezbollah "terrorists" in recent months.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bolivian authorities arrested General Juan Jose Zuniga on Wednesday afternoon, a Reuters witness saw, hours after troops stormed into the presidential palace amid a military coup attempt.</p>

<p>Bolivia's government and international leaders denounced</p>

<p>Bolivian armed forces pulled back from the presidential palace in La Paz on Wednesday evening and a general was arrested after President Luis Arce slammed a "coup" attempt against the government and called for international support.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, military units led by General Juan Jose Zuniga, recently stripped of his military command, had gathered in the central Plaza Murillo square, home to the presidential palace and Congress. A Reuters witness saw an armored vehicle ram a door of the presidential palace and soldiers rush in.</p>

<p>"Today the country is facing an attempted coup d'état. Today the country faces once again interests so that democracy in Bolivia is cut short," Arce said in comments from the presidential palace, with armed soldiers outside.</p>

<p>"The Bolivian people are summoned today. We need the Bolivian people to organize and mobilize against the coup d'état in favor of democracy."</p>

<p>A few hours later, a Reuters witness saw soldiers withdraw from the square and police take control of the plaza. Bolivian authorities arrested Zuniga and took him away, though their destination was unclear.</p>

<p>Inside the presidential palace, Arce swore in José Wilson Sanchez as the military commander, Zuniga's former role. He called for calm and order to be restored.</p>

<p>"I order that all personnel mobilized on the streets return to their units," Sanchez said. "We entreat that the blood of our soldiers not be spilled."</p>

<p>The United States said it was closely monitoring the situation and urged calm and restraint.</p>

<p>Tensions have been building in Bolivia ahead of general elections in 2025, with leftist ex-President Evo Morales planning to run against former ally Arce, creating a major rift in the ruling socialist party and wider political uncertainty.</p>

<p>Many do not want a return of Morales, who governed from 2006-2019 when he was ousted amid widespread protests and replaced by an interim conservative government. Arce then won election in 2020.</p>

<p>Zuniga said recently that Morales should not be able to return as president and threatened to block him if he attempted to, which led Arce to remove Zuniga from his post.</p>

<p>Ahead of the attack on the presidential palace, Zuniga had addressed reporters in the square and cited growing anger in the landlocked country, which has been battling an economic slump with depleted central bank reserves and pressure on the boliviano currency as gas exports have dried up.</p>

<p>"The three chiefs of the armed forces have come to express our dismay," Zuniga told a local TV station, calling for a new cabinet of ministers.</p>

<p>"Stop destroying, stop impoverishing our country, stop humiliating our army," he said in full uniform, flanked by soldiers, insisting the action being taken was supported by the public.</p>

<p><strong>'STRONGEST CONDEMNATION'</strong></p>

<p>Morales, head of the ruling MAS socialist party, said that his supporters would mobilize in support of democracy.</p>

<p>"We will not allow the armed forces to violate democracy and intimidate people," Morales said.</p>

<p>Bolivia's public prosecutor's office said it would launch a criminal investigation against Zuniga and others involved in the attempted coup.</p>

<p>Public support for Arce and Bolivia's democracy has poured in from regional leaders and beyond.</p>

<p>"We express the strongest condemnation of the attempted coup d'état in Bolivia. Our total support and support for President Luis Alberto Arce Catacora," Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on X.</p>

<p>Even conservative political opponents of the government in Bolivia condemned the military action, including ex-President Jeanine Anez, who was imprisoned in 2022 amid political turmoil.</p>

<p>"I fully reject of the mobilization of the military in the Plaza Murillo attempting to destroy constitutional order," she wrote on X. "The MAS with Arce and Evo must be got out through the vote in 2025. We Bolivians will defend democracy."</p>

       <description><![CDATA[A court in New York on Wednesday sentenced former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez to 45 years in prison after he was convicted of trafficking hundreds of tons of cocaine into the United States.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A court in New York on Wednesday sentenced former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez to 45 years in prison after he was convicted of trafficking hundreds of tons of cocaine into the United States.</p>

<p>Anti-Hernandez protesters gathered outside the Manhattan courthouse ahead of sentencing brandishing placards decrying the former head of state's crimes with one declaring "Narco government -- makes the people emigrate."</p>

<p>"The role of Mr Hernandez was to use his political power as president of Congress and president of Honduras to limit the risks of drug traffickers in exchange of money," said Judge Kevin Castel as the disgraced statesman stood impassively.</p>

<p>He said Hernandez provided police and military support and helped to send 400 tons of drugs -- worth $10 billion at market prices -- to the United States.</p>

<p>In a speech ahead of sentencing, Hernandez, who wore prison garb and used a walking stick to enter court, was interrupted by the judge for contesting the trial's outcome and insisting he was wrongly charged.</p>

<p>The sentence, which also included an $8 million fine, was less than the life imprisonment that prosecutors had sought -- although Hernandez's age, 55, means he may die behind bars.</p>

<p>"He's going to pursue every single possible legal remedy that he can pursue," Hernandez's lawyer Renato Stabile told reporters outside court.</p>

<p><strong>- War on drugs -</strong></p>

<p>Hernandez, who US federal prosecutors said turned his Central American country into a "narco-state" during his 2014-2022 presidency, has previously indicated through his legal team he would appeal his conviction.</p>

<p>He was convicted in March of having facilitated the smuggling of hundreds of tons of cocaine -- mainly from Colombia and Venezuela -- to the United States via Honduras since 2004, starting long before he became president.</p>

<p>Hernandez used the drug money to enrich himself and finance his political campaign, and commit electoral fraud in the 2013 and 2017 elections, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>He had presented himself as a champion of the war on drugs and was initially seen by Washington as an ally in the fight.</p>

<p>In 2017, the United States was one of the first countries to recognize his re-election, while the opposition denounced fraud against a backdrop of violent protests that left some 30 people dead.</p>

<p>He was extradited to the United States in 2022 using a law he had himself helped to pass as Congress president under pressure from Washington, accused of aiding drug smugglers in return for millions of dollars in bribes.</p>

<p>US Attorney General Merrick Garland said Hernandez "abused his power to support one of the largest and most violent drug trafficking conspiracies in the world, and the people of Honduras and the United States bore the consequences."</p>

<p>The fall of Hernandez, who is known in his country as "JOH," was abrupt.</p>

<p>No sooner had he handed over power to the new left-wing president Xiomara Castro, the outgoing leader was shackled and paraded in front of journalists.</p>

<p>Hernandez follows in the footsteps of other former Latin American heads of state convicted in the United States, including Panama's Manuel Noriega in 1992 and Guatemala's Alfonso Portillo in 2014.</p>

<p>The short, athletic leader was known for his military haircut, having served as an officer before training as a lawyer, completing a masters degree in New York in 1995.</p>

<p>His legal woes began in earnest in 2018 when his brother, Juan Antonio Hernandez, was arrested in Miami and sentenced in March 2021 to life imprisonment for "large-scale" drug trafficking.</p>

<p>After his arrest in Honduras in February 2022, Hernandez said he was a victim of "revenge" by the drug lords, many of whom testified against him in New York.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea claimed to have successfully tested its multiple-warhead missile capability, according to state-run KCNA news agency Thursday.</p>

<p>Pyongyang "successfully conducted the separation and guidance control test of individual mobile warheads" on Wednesday," KCNA reported, adding that the "separated mobile warheads were guided correctly to the three coordinate targets."</p>

<p>"The test is aimed at securing the MIRV capability," it said, referring to multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle technology -- or, the ability to fire multiple warheads on a single ballistic missile.</p>

<p>The statement came a day after South Korea's military said the North had test-fired what appeared to be a hypersonic missile on Wednesday, but the launch ended in a mid-air explosion.</p>

<p>The missile took off from an area in or around Pyongyang at about 5:30 am (2030 GMT) and South Korean and US intelligence agencies were conducting a detailed analysis, Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.</p>

<p>The JCS official said the test of what appeared to be a hypersonic missile ended in failure after a journey of some 250 kilometres (155 miles).</p>

<p>More smoke than usual appeared to emanate from the missile, raising the possibility of combustion issues, the official said, adding it may have been powered by solid propellants.</p>

<p>Japan also confirmed the launch, with its coast guard saying the missile splashed down in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea.</p>

<p>According to KCNA, the test "was carried out by use of the first-stage engine of an intermediate-range solid-fuel ballistic missile within a 170-200 km radius."</p>

<p>"The effectiveness of a decoy separated from the missile was also verified by anti-air radar," it said.</p>

<p>The test follows North Korea launching hundreds more trash-carrying balloons southward on Monday and Tuesday, the latest in a series of border barrages that have sparked a tit-for-tat propaganda campaign.</p>

<p>Late Wednesday, South Korea's military said the North has again floated another round of trash-carrying balloons southward for the third consecutive day, advising the public to report the balloons if spotted and refrain from touching them.</p>

<p>In response, Seoul has fully suspended a tension-reducing military deal and restarted some propaganda broadcasts from loudspeakers along the border.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, South Korea's Marine Corps resumed live-fire exercises on islands near the western inter-Korean border on Wednesday, marking the first such exercises since a 2018 tension-reducing military deal with the North was suspended earlier this month over the balloon-borne propaganda.</p>

<p>South Korea and the US also staged joint air drills Wednesday involving around 30 aircraft, including Washington's advanced stealth fighter jet, F-22 Raptor.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, President Yoon Suk Yeol visited a US aircraft carrier that arrived in South Korea at the weekend for joint military drills aimed at countering North Korean threats.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 20 people were injured after a passenger train derailed in Russia's Far North on Wednesday, authorities said.</p>

<p>The train was going from the city of Vorkuta, above the Arctic Circle, to the port of Novorossiysk on the Black Sea in the south of the country.</p>

<p>It derailed near the small town of Inta in the Komi Republic, which has a harsh climate and is scarcely populated.</p>

<p>Vladimir Uyba, the head of the Komi republic, said there 215 passengers onboard the train, adding: "20 people were injured, three in a serious condition."</p>

<p>He said the five last carriages of the train derailed, but authorities did not immediately give a reason for the cause of the accident.</p>

<p>Uyba said he was flying out to the scene of the accident.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Images published by Russian state media showed several carriages lying on their side in a ditch by a forest.</p>

<p>It takes almost five days for the Vorkuta-Novorossiysk train to complete its journey.</p>

<p>Transport accidents are not uncommon in Russia, but less so on railways, with the country, the largest in the world, having a massive rail network.</p>

<p>Since Moscow launched its Ukraine offensive, Russia has battled a wave of sabotage acts on its railways, used by the army to transport equipment to Ukraine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A notorious German pensioner known as the "Nazi grandma" who has been jailed several times for denying the Holocaust was sentenced to another 16 months at her latest trial on Wednesday.</p>

<p>A Hamburg court convicted Ursula Haverbeck, 95, of denying the Nazi genocide on several occasions, including in 2015 during the trial of a former Nazi camp guard.</p>

<p>In their sentencing, the judges took into account her previous convictions and the fact she had "also used the proceedings to further disseminate her views", a court spokeswoman told AFP.</p>

<p>Haverbeck repeated her remarks on the Holocaust several times at the trial.</p>

<p>Supporters of the pensioner showed up on Wednesday and repeatedly interrupted proceedings with heckling, the spokeswoman said.</p>

<p>Haverbeck was once head of a far-right training centre shut down in 2008 for spreading Nazi propaganda.</p>

<p>She has previously been sentenced on several occasions to jail for denying the Nazi genocide, once declaring on television that "the Holocaust is the biggest and most sustained lie in history."</p>

<p>Haverbeck was sentenced this time after losing an appeal over a conviction for comments allegedly made in 2015 during the trial of former Auschwitz guard Oskar Groening, who was convicted of being an accessory to murder.</p>

<p>Haverbeck said the Auschwitz concentration camp was just a labour camp and no mass murder had taken place there, according to prosecutors.</p>

<p>The proceedings were delayed several times due to the coronavirus pandemic and illness.</p>

<p>The sentencing also takes into account a previous conviction by a Berlin court in 2022 over statements made by Haverbeck in another interview and at an event.</p>

<p>It was not clear whether she would actually go to jail.</p>

<p>German law makes it illegal to deny the genocide committed by Adolf Hitler's regime, which in the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp in occupied Poland alone claimed some 1.1 million lives, mostly European Jews.</p>

<p>Holocaust denial and other forms of incitement to hatred carry up to five years in prison, while the use of Nazi symbols such as swastikas is also banned.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>King Charles III's sister Princess Anne is "recovering slowly" in hospital, her husband said Wednesday, after she suffered a concussion in an incident with a horse at her country estate.</p>

<p>"She'll be out when she's ready," Tim Laurence also told reporters outside Southmead Hospital in Bristol, western England, where Anne was taken on Sunday.</p>

<p>Anne, 73, suffered concussion and minor head injuries at Gatcombe Park on Sunday evening and was airlifted to hospital.</p>

<p>It is believed she was struck by a horse as she was walking within the protected perimeter of the sprawling estate, which hosts equestrian events.</p>

<p>The princess's medical team said her injuries are consistent with a potential impact from a horse's head or legs.</p>

<p>British media reported Wednesday that Anne's concussion meant the precise details of what happened are not clear.</p>

<p>The Princess Royal, as she is also known, is a skilled horsewoman who competed at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, and has a reputation as the hardest-working royal.</p>

<p>She has stepped in to represent King Charles while he postponed public engagements during his cancer treatment, and rode at his official birthday parade this month.</p>

<p>But the accident forced her to withdraw from an appearance at a state banquet on Tuesday evening for visiting Japanese Emperor Naruhito, and cancel an upcoming trip to Canada.</p>

<p>Buckingham Palace said Anne was in hospital "as a precautionary measure for observation and is expected to make a full and swift recovery".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US State Department on Wednesday renewed its allegation that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange put people at risk for revealing secrets, after he was freed in a plea deal.</p>

<p>"The documents they published gave identifying information of individuals who were in contact with the State Department -- that included opposition leaders, human rights activists around the world -- whose positions were put in some danger because of their public disclosure," State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.</p>

<p>"It also chilled the ability of American personnel to build relationships and have frank conversations," Miller said.</p>

<p>Assange had published hundreds of thousands of confidential US documents on the WikiLeaks whistleblowing website from 2010.</p>

<p>The Australian agreed to plead guilty to a single count of conspiracy to obtain and disseminate national defense information and was sentenced to the time he had served in London -- five years and two months -- and given his liberty.</p>

<p>Assange has become a hero for activists who point to his role in divulging information about the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but critics fault him for putting out vast quantities of government documents without any filtering.</p>

<p>Miller said that the State Department at the time "had to scramble to get people out of danger, to move them out of harm's way."</p>

<p>Pressed on whether anyone was harmed in the end, Miller said, "If you drive drunk down the street and get pulled over for drunk driving, the fact that you didn't crash into another car and kill someone doesn't get you out of the reckless actions and the endangerment that you put your fellow citizens in."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon.com plans to launch a section on its shopping site featuring cheap items that ship directly to overseas consumers from warehouses in China, the Information reported on Wednesday, citing slides shown to Chinese sellers.</p>

<p>The new marketplace, Amazon's most aggressive response to the growth of bargain sites like Temu and Shein, will offer unbranded fashion, home goods, and daily necessities, according to the slides, and will be delivered between 9 to 11 days to customers, the report said.</p>

<p>The e-commerce giant in a recent closed-door meeting told Chinese sellers it would start signing up merchants this summer and begin accepting inventory in the fall, according to the Information.</p>

<p>Amazon did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment on the report.</p>

<p>Sellers joining the bargain site can determine their product selection and pricing, and can produce in small batches to test the demand for any new products they plan to launch, the report added.</p>

<p>It is not clear if these shipments will be made using a U.S. trade provision that exempts individual packages worth less than $800 from US customs duties, Information reported.</p>

<p>E-commerce powerhouse Shein, which is trying to expand its market share before going public, and PDD Group-owned e-retailer Temu, depend on the expedited clearance process, which is available for direct-to-consumer shipments valued at $800 or less.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kenyan President William Ruto said Wednesday that a bill containing contentious tax hikes would "be withdrawn", dramatically reversing course after more than 20 people were killed in clashes with police and parliament was ransacked by protesters opposed to the legislation.</p>

<p>The initially peaceful demonstrations were sparked last week by the 2024 finance bill -- which politicians passed Tuesday afternoon -- and took Ruto's administration by surprise as rallies gathered momentum across the country.</p>

<p>But the Gen-Z-led protests spiralled into violence Tuesday when police fired live bullets at the crowds outside parliament, leaving the complex ransacked and partly on fire.</p>

<p>Nineteen people were killed in the capital Nairobi, a state-funded rights watchdog said.</p>

<p>"I concede and therefore I will not sign the 2024 finance bill and it shall subsequently be withdrawn," Ruto told a press briefing. "The people have spoken," he said.</p>

<p>"I will be proposing an engagement with the young people of our nation, our sons and daughters, for us to listen to them," he said, in a marked shift from his late-night address Tuesday when he likened some of the demonstrators to "criminals".</p>

<p>'Cannot kill all of us'</p>

<p>Immediately after his speech, prominent protester Hanifa Adan dismissed Ruto's announcement as "PR".</p>

<p>Referring to his comments the previous night, she said on X: "He made that speech trying to intimidate us and he saw it won't work hence the PR."</p>

<p>"The bill is withdrawn but are you going to bring everyone that died back alive?"</p>

<p>Ahead of Ruto's about-turn, protesters had called for fresh rallies on Thursday.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow, we march peacefully again as we wear white, for all our fallen people," Adan had said.</p>

<p>"You cannot kill all of us."</p>

<p>Demonstrators shared "Tupatane Thursday" ("we meet Thursday" in Swahili), alongside the hashtag #Rejectfinancebill2024 on social media.</p>

<p>Cost-of-living crisis</p>

<p>Ruto came to power in 2022 promising to champion the needs of impoverished Kenyans, but tax increases under his government have only made life tougher for those already struggling with high inflation.</p>

<p>The Kenyan leader had already rolled back some tax measures last week, prompting the treasury to warn of a gaping budget shortfall of 200 billion shillings.</p>

<p>Ruto said Wednesday that withdrawing the bill would mean a significant hole in funding for development programmes to help farmers and schoolteachers, among others.</p>

<p>The cash-strapped government had said previously that the increases were needed to service Kenya's massive debt of some 10 trillion shillings ($78 billion), equal to roughly 70 percent of GDP.</p>

<p>Deadly day</p>

<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Roseline Odede, chairwoman of the state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, said "we have recorded 22 deaths", 19 of them in Nairobi, adding that they would launch an investigation.</p>

<p>"This is the largest number of deaths (in) a single day protest," she said, adding that 300 people were injured across the country.</p>

<p>Simon Kigondu, president of the Kenya Medical Association, said he had never before seen "such level of violence against unarmed people."</p>

<p>An official at Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi said Wednesday that medics were treating "160 people...some of them with soft tissue injuries, some of them with bullet wounds."</p>

<p>Rights watchdogs have also accused the authorities of kidnapping protesters.</p>

<p>The police have not responded to AFP requests for comment.</p>

<p>'Madness'</p>

<p>A heavy police presence was deployed around parliament early on Wednesday, according to an AFP reporter, the smell of tear gas still in the air and dried blood on the ground.</p>

<p>A policeman standing in front of the broken barricades to the complex told AFP he had watched the scenes unfold on TV.</p>

<p>"It was madness, we hope it will be calm today," he said.</p>

<p>In the central business district, where the protests have been concentrated, traders surveyed the damage.</p>

<p>"They didn't leave anything, just the boxes. I don't know how long it will take me to recover," James Ng'ang'a, whose electronics shop was looted, told AFP.</p>

<p>The unrest has alarmed the international community, with Washington calling on Kenya to respect the right to peaceful protest on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Ruto's administration is under pressure from the IMF, which has urged the country to implement fiscal reforms in order to access funding.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lanka said on Wednesday it had clinched a restructuring deal with India, China, and other nations, covering up to $10 billion in debt, a critical step towards recovery after a 2022 financial crash. The agreement is expected to revive stalled infrastructure projects, including a Japanese-funded airport expansion and a new mass transit light rail in the capital, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said.</p>

<p>Sri Lanka defaulted on its foreign debt in April 2022 after running out of foreign exchange, and the unprecedented economic crisis forced then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to step down.</p>

<p>"Sri Lanka concluded negotiations with the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) and the Exim Bank of China," Wickremesinghe said in a televised Sinhalese-language address to the nation.</p>

<p>"Sri Lanka won," he added in English while thanking the OCC, which included Japan, India, the United States, Canada and several European nations.</p>

<p>He said the deal with OCC nations was reached in Paris, while an agreement with the Exim Bank of China was signed in Beijing on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Sri Lanka secured a moratorium on repayments until 2028, he said, but gave no further details.</p>

<p>His supporters in the capital Colombo let off firecrackers and distributed milk rice in celebration as he spoke.</p>

<p>Wickremesinghe said the nation was bankrupt when he took over almost two years ago and he hoped the International Monetary Fund bailout of $2.9 billion he secured last year would be the island's last.</p>

<p>Colombo had gone to the IMF, the international lender of last resort, on 16 previous occasions and the debt restructuring is a condition of the IMF bailout.</p>

<p>Wickremesinghe has doubled taxes, removed generous energy subsidies and is set to sell off loss-making state enterprises to shore up state revenue under that deal.</p>

<h2><strong>Teachers strike over pay</strong></h2>

<p>India welcomed Sri Lanka's deal and pledged more support.</p>

<p>"This milestone (agreement) demonstrates the strong progress made by Sri Lanka in stabilising its economy and moving towards reform and growth," the Indian government said in a statement.</p>

<p>Bilateral creditors account for 28.5 percent of Sri Lanka's outstanding foreign debt of $37 billion, according to treasury data from the end of March.</p>

<p>China accounts for $4.66 billion of a total of $10.58 billion borrowed from other countries.</p>

<p>Japan accounts for $2.35 billion and India for $1.36 billion.</p>

<p>The government said it was in talks with international bondholders but there was no agreement. A previous round of talks ended in deadlock in April.</p>

<p>Sri Lanka is unable to raise commercial loans until a deal with private creditors is struck.</p>

<p>However, the agreement with bilateral creditors allows the unfreezing of loans for ongoing infrastructure projects financed with funding from other countries.</p>

<p>Thousands of teachers from government schools went on strike in Colombo on Wednesday demanding higher pay, with police using water cannon and tear gas to disperse the protest.</p>

<p>Sri Lanka is due to hold a presidential election this year and opposition parties have vowed to renegotiate the terms of the IMF bailout.</p>

<p>The IMF's Sri Lanka mission chief Peter Breuer said the fund was willing to listen to alternative proposals from rival political parties, but said it was necessary to stick to the benchmarks set in the bailout.</p>

<p>Sri Lanka had made good progress but was not out of the woods yet, he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden and Donald Trump prepared Wednesday for the biggest moment so far in the US election -- the first of two high-stakes debates that could upend the race.</p>

<p>Thursday's showdown will raise the campaigning to boiling point, with both camps recently escalating their increasingly personal attacks.</p>

<p>"I think I have been preparing for it for my whole life...We'll do very well," Trump told right-wing network Newsmax in an interview on his debate preparation.</p>

<p>The 2024 election looks close, with Trump enjoying a slight polling advantage in the all-important swing states in an election likely to be decided by a few hundred thousand votes across a handful of battlegrounds.</p>

<p>The rivals both step onstage for the 90-minute clash, hosted by CNN in the southern city of Atlanta, seeking to allay fears about serious political liabilities.</p>

<p>Biden, 81, faces the most concern about his mental sharpness, with voters much more likely to bring up his age than Trump's, despite the Republican being just three years younger.</p>

<h2><strong>'Out for himself'</strong></h2>

<p>Both have faltered and appeared muddled during public events, although Trump in particular has raised eyebrows over his rambling and occasionally bizarre campaign speeches.</p>

<p>Trump is also engulfed in controversy over his inflammatory rhetoric and a glut of criminal cases he faces, as well as fears that he would weaponize the presidency to settle personal scores.</p>

<p>Biden spent the week off the radar at the mountainside retreat of Camp David near Washington, preparing with mock debates.</p>

<p>Trump's preparation has been more relaxed, eschewing dress rehearsals in favor of informal policy roundtables and workshopping debate strategy with rally crowds.</p>

<p>Aides have encouraged him to focus on his perceived strength on the economy and crime, while Biden will seek to paint Trump as unhinged and unfit for office.</p>

<p>The Biden campaign released an ad saying Trump is preoccupied with "revenge" rather than helping voters, and the Democratic National Committee put up billboards in Atlanta reminding voters that the Republican is a convicted felon.</p>

<p>"Come November, Georgians will head to the polls remembering that President Biden looks out for them, while white-collar crook Donald Trump will only look out for himself," said DNC spokesperson Jackie Bush.</p>

<h2><strong>'Ready for this'?</strong></h2>

<p>The Trump campaign has repeatedly characterized Biden as feeble and incompetent, but changed tack in recent days following warnings that setting low expectations for the Democratic president would only help him.</p>

<p>"We know that Joe Biden, that after taking an entire week off, will be ready for this," senior Trump campaign advisor Jason Miller told reporters.</p>

<p>Backed by right-wing media figures, Trump and his team have been pushing the baseless theory that Biden will be hyped up on performance-enhancing drugs.</p>

<p>The ex-president and his people have also been accused of "working the ref" and laying the groundwork for a poor Trump performance by repeatedly making insinuations of bias on the part of CNN.</p>

<p>Miller said Trump would emerge as the clear choice if "allowed" to set out his vision for America "without the blatant interference of CNN or the two moderators" of the debate -- the first ever between two candidates who have already served in the Oval Office.</p>

<p>One of Biden's biggest vulnerabilities is border security, with Trump promising to combat an influx of undocumented migrants from Mexico with mass deportations and repeatedly bringing up killings by migrants.</p>

<p>US media reported that Trump is expected to invite family members of victims of migrant violence to Atlanta, although the debate itself will have no audience.</p>

<p>The Biden administration announced Wednesday that new restrictions had brought illegal migrant crossings to their lowest levels in more than three years, undercutting immigration as an attack line.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

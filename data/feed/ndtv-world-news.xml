       <description><![CDATA[Russia warned the United States on Wednesday to halt what it called a "spiral of escalation" over Ukraine.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia warned the United States on Wednesday to halt what it called a "spiral of escalation" over Ukraine, but said it would keep informing Washington about test missile launches in order to avoid "dangerous mistakes".</p>

<p>The comments from Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov sent a signal that Moscow, which last week approved a new policy that lowered its threshold for the use of nuclear weapons, wants to keep communication channels open at a time of acute tensions with the U.S.</p>

<p>Ryabkov was speaking six days after Russia launched what it described as a new intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile called the Oreshnik against Ukraine - something he said had sent a clear message to the West.</p>

<p>"The signal is very clear and obvious - stop, you should not do this any more, you mustn't supply Kyiv with everything they want, don't encourage them towards new military adventures, they are too dangerous," state media quoted Ryabkov as saying.</p>

<p>"The current (U.S.) administration must stop this spiral of escalation," Ryabkov added. "They simply must, otherwise the situation will become too dangerous for everyone, including the United States itself."</p>

<p>President Vladimir Putin said last week that Russia fired the Oreshnik in response to Ukraine's first use of U.S. ATACMS ballistic missiles and British Storm Shadow cruise missiles to strike at Russian territory with permission from the West.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia's use of the new missile - which Kyiv said reached a speed of 13,600 kph (8,450 miles per hour) - amounted to "a clear and severe escalation" in the war and called for strong worldwide condemnation.</p>

<p>The U.S. military said the missile was experimental and that Russia likely possessed only a handful of them.</p>

<h2>'VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION'</h2>

<p>The Kremlin has said Russia was not technically obliged to warn the United States about the launch of the Oreshnik because it was intermediate-range rather than intercontinental, but that Moscow informed the U.S. 30 minutes before the launch anyway.</p>

<p>"I am sure you understand that this was a stabilising factor in the very dangerous situation in which we currently find ourselves. We are committed to this practice and we hope that the United States will also be committed to it," Ryabkov was quoted as saying.</p>

<p>"And we also hope that such actions will help reduce the risks of miscalculation or dangerous mistakes."</p>

<p>In a separate development on Wednesday, Russia state news agency TASS quoted an official as saying Moscow was continuing work to put its Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile - part of its strategic nuclear arsenal - on combat duty.</p>

<p>Sarmat is designed to deliver nuclear warheads to strike targets thousands of miles away in the United States or Europe, but its development has been dogged by delays and testing setbacks.</p>

<p>In September, arms experts said Russia appeared to have suffered a catastrophic failure in the missile's latest test, leaving a deep crater at the launch silo.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[This hike will apply to tourists from all nationalities and also doesn't take into account the length or duration of the flight.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Maldives, a tropical paradise in the Indian Ocean, is renowned for its crystal-clear turquoise waters, pristine white sand beaches and luxurious overwater villas. This archipelago of 1,200 islands offers an idyllic escape for honeymooners, adventurers and relaxation seekers alike. But from December 1, 2024, it will become costlier to leave the archipelago as Maldives as increased its exit fees, levied of passengers leaving a country, according to a report in <em>CNN</em>. The charges will primarily affect foreign travellers, the outlet further said.</p>

<p>For economy-class passengers, the fee will rise from $30 (Rs 2,532) to $50 (Rs 4,220), while business-class passengers will see an increase from $60 (Rs 5,064) to $120 (Rs 10,129). First-class travellers will pay $240 (Rs 20,257), up from $90 (Rs 7,597), and private jet passengers face a significant hike from $120 (Rs 10,129) to $480 (Rs 40,515).</p>

<p>This hike will apply to tourists from all nationalities and also doesn't take into account the length or duration of the flight, said the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/26/travel/maldives-departure-tax-increase-intl-hnk/index.html" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>CNN</em> report</a>.</p>

<p>Maldivian Inland Revenue Authority (MIRA), which announced the increase earlier this month, said the additional revenue will go towards the maintenance of Velana International Airport (MLE), the main airport in Maldives.</p>

<p>These taxes are usually added to the ticket prices, so tourists won't feel the pinch. Some airlines have already posted messages on their websites, advising customers to buy tickets before November 30 to avoid the new tax.</p>

<p>Since Maldives has warm weather the entire year, people visit the island country to view sunsets and indulge in spa. Famous for its privacy and exclusivity, it's a top destination for celebrities and travellers seeking tranquillity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire philanthropist and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates once gave a brilliant answer to one of the most common job interview questions that would have most of us stumped. During a 2020 interview for NBA star Stephen Curry's YouTube series called 'State of Inspiration', Mr Gates was asked to play the role of a junior software engineer interviewing for a job at Microsoft. He was then asked a few questions to which the tech magnet revealed important points and prospective that might help you for your next big career move.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the most common job interview questions the billionaire was asked was salary expectations. "What is your salary expectation for the role?" the host of the show asked Mr Gates. To this, the tech mogul didn't give an actual figure, but he explained how best to answer the question.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I hope the option package is good. I'm able to take risk and I think the company has a great future, so I prefer to get stock options even more than cash compensation," Mr Gates advised, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2020/11/01/watch-bill-gates-give-brilliant-30-second-answers-to-common-job-interview-questions/" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>Forbes</em></a>. "I hear some other companies are paying a lot, but treat me fairly and emphasize the options," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By saying he is willing to take shares of a company instead of a mega salary shows the interviewer that he is a risk-taker and believes in the firm, its products and its future. According to <em>Forbes</em>, he also gives himself leverage in any salary discussion by saying, "I hear other companies are paying a lot". This reminds the interviewer that this job candidate is in high demand, but treat him fairly and he'll be a team player.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the YouTube show, Mr Gates also answered other job interview questions that candidates dread answering. One important question that interviewers usually ask is: "Why should we hire you?"&nbsp;</p>

<p>Answering this, Mr Gates responded, "You should look at the codes that I've written. I write software programs way beyond any classes that I've taken. I think I've gotten better over time, so take a look at how ambitious I've been there."</p>

<p>"I do think I can work well with people. I might criticize their code a little harshly, but overall, I like to be on a team. I like ambitious goals. I like thinking through how we can anticipate the future. Software is cool, and I want to be involved," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Gates' answer shows off his achievements while also showing how his skills have improved over time. His answer also points out his ability to work well with others as well as reflects on where he could have improved. Overall, his answer demonstrates his high standards of excellence - an important quality recruiters look for and admire in a job candidate.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Several in Trump's team now see a direct approach from Trump, to build on a relationship that already exists, as most likely to break the ice with Kim.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump's team is discussing pursuing direct talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, hoping a fresh diplomatic push can lower the risks of armed conflict, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Several in Trump's team now see a direct approach from Trump, to build on a relationship that already exists, as most likely to break the ice with Kim, years after the two traded insults and what Trump called "beautiful" letters in an unprecedented diplomatic effort during his first term in office, the people said.</p>

<p>The policy discussions are fluid and no final decisions have been made by the president-elect, the sources said.</p>

<p>Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>What reciprocation Kim will offer Trump is unclear. The North Koreans ignored four years of outreach by U.S. President Joe Biden to start talks with no pre-conditions, and Kim is emboldened by an expanded missile arsenal and a much closer relationship with Russia.</p>

<p>"We have already gone as far as we can on negotiating with the United States," Kim said last week in a speech at a Pyongyang military exhibition, according to state media.</p>

<p>During his 2017-2021 presidency, Trump held three meetings with Kim, in Singapore, Hanoi, and at the Korean border, the first time a sitting U.S. president had set foot in the country.</p>

<p>Their diplomacy yielded no concrete results, even as Trump described their talks as falling "in love." The U.S. called for North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons, while Kim demanded full sanctions relief, then issued new threats.</p>

<p>It was not clear what result a new diplomatic effort would yield. An initial Trump goal would be to reestablish basic engagement but further policy aims or a precise timetable have not been set, the people said. And the issue may take a backseat to more pressing foreign policy concerns in the Middle East and Ukraine, according to one person briefed on the transition's thinking.</p>

<p>North Korean state media have not yet publicly mentioned the re-election of Trump, and Kim said this month that the United States was ramping up tension and provocations, raising the risks of nuclear war.</p>

<p>Trump and some of his allies left office with the impression that the direct approach was Washington's best shot at influencing behavior north of the demilitarized zone, which has divided the Korean Peninsula for seven decades. The countries' war was never technically ended even as the guns fell silent.</p>

<p>On Friday, Trump named one of the people who implemented that initial North Korea strategy, former State Department official Alex Wong, as his deputy national security adviser. "As Deputy Special Representative for North Korea, he helped negotiate my Summit with North Korean Leader, Kim Jong Un," Trump said in a statement.</p>

<p>TENSIONS RISE</p>

<p>Trump inherits an increasingly tense situation with Kim when he returns to the White House in January, as he did in 2017, an atmosphere allies expect the incoming president to confront head-on.</p>

<p>"My experience with President Trump is he's much more likely to be open to direct engagement," said U.S. Senator Bill Hagerty, a Trump ally, in an interview with Reuters earlier this year. "I'm optimistic that we can see an improvement in the relationship and perhaps a different posture adopted by Kim Jong Un if that dialogue were reopened again."</p>

<p>Washington has a dossier of concerns over the country's expanding nuclear weapons and missile program, its increasingly hostile rhetoric to South Korea and its close collaboration with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>These topics are expected to feature in Biden administration transition briefings for Trump aides, according to a U.S. official. The Trump team has yet to sign transition agreements, which could limit the scope of some of these briefings.</p>

<p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Particularly concerning to Washington are the prospects of increased sharing of nuclear or missile technology between Russia and North Korea and the deployment of thousands of North Korean troops to Russia to help in the war with Ukraine.</p>

<p>Reuters reported on Monday that North Korea is expanding a key weapons manufacturing complex that assembles a type of short-range missile used by Russia in Ukraine, citing researchers at a U.S.-based think tank who examined satellite images.</p>

<p>U.S. officials said those factors raise the risk of a conflict between multiple nuclear armed nations in Europe or Asia, including the United States and its allies, which include South Korea and Japan.</p>

<p>American troops are deployed throughout the region to deter North Korea, and Trump has insisted that U.S. allies share more of the cost for those deployments.</p>

<p>In his final meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month in Peru, Biden asked for Beijing to use its leverage to reel in North Korea.</p>

<p>Opportunity for China and the U.S. to work together may be limited as Trump vows vast tariffs on Chinese goods and stacks his inner circle with China hardliners, such as Marco Rubio as secretary of state and Representative Mike Waltz as national security adviser.</p>

<p>Trump said last month the two countries would have had "a nuclear war with millions of people killed," but that he had stopped it, thanks to his ties with the North's leader.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh High Court on Wednesday acquitted former prime minister and BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia in a corruption case in which she was sentenced to seven years in jail by a lower court, according to media reports.</p>

<p>Zia, 79, was convicted in the Zia Charitable Trust corruption case in 2018 by a Dhaka court. It also sentenced her to seven years imprisonment under the former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League government and fined her Tk 1 million.</p>

<p>A bench of Justices AKM Asaduzzaman and Syed Enayet Hossain overturned the decision based on an appeal by Zia, the bdnews24.com news portal reported. Two others accused in the case were also acquitted by the court.</p>

<p>The graft case was filed in 2011 by the Anti-Corruption Commission with Tejgaon Police Station, accusing Zia and three others of abusing power to raise funds for the trust from unknown sources, the Daily Star news portal reported.</p>

<p>The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Chairperson was lodged in the Old Dhaka Central Jail on February 8, 2018, after a special court sentenced her to five years in prison in the Zia Orphanage Trust corruption case.</p>

<p>On October 30, 2018, the High Court raised her punishment to 10 years. Later, she was convicted in the Zia Charitable Trust corruption case.</p>

<p>Amid the COVID-19 outbreak, the government temporarily released Zia from jail after 776 days through an executive order, suspending her sentence on March 25, 2020, with conditions that she would stay in her Gulshan house and not leave the country.</p>

<p>On August 6, after the regime change in Dhaka, Zia was completely freed by an order of Bangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin.</p>

<p>Zia served as the prime minister of Bangladesh from March 1991 to March 1996, and again from June 2001 to October 2006.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan this week saw serious turmoil, with supporters of former Prime Minister Imran Khan defying government lockdowns and violent police opposition to demand the release of jailed Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder. The face of one of the biggest protests in Pakistan's history was Bushra Khan, cricketer-turned-politician Khan's third wife.</p>

<p>Bushra Khan entered the capital Islamabad this week along with thousands of PTI supporters who breached heavy security force barricades. Mounted atop a truck, she addressed the public near the historic square of D-Chowk, also referred to as Democracy Chowk, and vowed to hold a sit-in until Khan was freed.</p>

<p>"You all need to promise that until Khan is amongst us, you won't leave D-Chowk," said Ms Bushra in her first public address.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her insistence on holding the protest at a centralised location near the country's parliament, despite Imran Khan's instructions to gather on Islamabad's outskirts, underscores her growing active role in PTI's strategy, Reuters reported quoting party officials.</p>

<p>Ms Brusha had to escape to the PTI stronghold of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province after a massive police crackdown on PTI supporters following days of deadly clashes between protesters and authorities, party officials added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PTI on Wednesday temporarily suspended the protests after Pakistan's security forces conducted a midnight raid on supporters.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>About Bushra Khan</strong></h2>

<p>Born Bushra Riaz Watto, Ms Khan took her husband's last name after her marriage. Imran Khan and his followers called her Bushra Bibi or Bushra Begum, titles that denote respect. She reportedly hails from a family of landowners in Punjab, but little is known about her early life.</p>

<p>Ms Khan, who is in her late 40s, has kept a low profile since marrying Mr Khan in a secret 2018 ceremony. It was the former PM's third marriage and her second. Bushra was previously married for around 30 years. The couple was charged for not completing the waiting period mandated by Islam after Bushra Bibi's previous marriage. However, the conviction was overturned by a court this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Khan usually appears in public dressed in a flowing plain black or white abaya, or robe and her face covered by a veil. She is also a devotee of Fariduddin Masud Ganjshakar, or Baba Farid, a revered Muslim mystic whose shrine is located in her ex-husband's hometown of Pakpattan in Punjab.</p>

<p>It was not clear when or how she met Mr Khan, but according to former aide Aun Chaudhry the former PM was very impressed with her spirituality. However, her husband's opponents accuse her of practising sorcery, a claim his aides have repeatedly denied.</p>

<p>Ms Khan was in jail for nine months in connection with a case involving the illegal sale of state gifts. She was released from prison in October.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Rise Of Bushra Bibi</strong></h3>

<p>Pakistan has a rich legacy of women rallying support for detained relatives and taking over significant roles in their parties, such as the country's first female Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. After her father Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was imprisoned and executed in 1979 under the military regime of the late General Zia-ul-Haq, the young ms Bhutto used to speak out defiantly in support of the former President.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Similarly, without formally holding office, Ms Khan, who has previously remained in Imran Khan's shadow, has now emerged as a de-facto leader of PTI, according to Mazhar Abbas, a journalist and political analyst. "Her posture is different and even the government is also targeting her," Mr Abbas was quoted as saying by Reuters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, according to PTI spokesperson Zulfikar Bukhari, Bushra Bibi still wanted to lead a private life. "If she has come out and led this protest, it's on the orders of Imran Khan and the people will obviously rally behind her unitedly because she is the wife of Imran Khan," he said, adding her near-year-long imprisonment has earned her supporters' admiration which had helped to mobilise the large numbers of protesters.</p>

<p>The public support rallying behind her is not going unnoticed by Pakistan's ruling coalition. Without naming her, South Asian country's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi told the media that the "one woman" behind the destruction during this week's protests. He also said that the root cause of the unrest was a "hidden hand."</p>

<p>Though it is yet to be seen how PTI would regroup, some analysts said that Bushra would likely continue to act as a rallying figure while Mr Khan remained behind bars.</p>

<p>"Putting Bibi at the forefront of these protests is a politically savvy move, because of her relationship to Khan. That gives her a level of authenticity that appeals to protesters and will bolster their commitment to the cause," said Michael Kugelman, director of the Wilson Center's South Asia Institute.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to slap a 25% tariff on all goods imported from America's largest trading partners - Mexico and Canada, starting January 20, his first day in office.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to slap a 25% tariff on all goods imported from America's largest trading partners - Mexico and Canada, starting January 20, his first day in office.</p>

<p>But this tariff imposition is also set to have severe implications on his own countrymen, who may face higher prices on various goods.</p>

<p>His first term was marked by a significant trade war with China, aimed at boosting US manufacturing, securing national security interests, and addressing what Trump believed was an extremely imbalanced trade relationship.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden maintained most of these tariffs and even added new ones.</p>

<p>But the new tariffs come at a time when the US has grown increasingly reliant on imports from Mexico and Canada. Mexico has overtaken China as the top exporter of goods to the US, while Canada is a close third. This means that the new tariffs will be virtually inescapable for Americans, as businesses facing higher costs will likely pass them on to consumers.</p>

<p>This potential trade war could break banks. Here are a few items that could get more expensive if Trump decides to follow through with his tariff plan.</p>

<h2>Gas</h2>

<p>The US imports a significant amount of crude oil from Canada, which is refined to produce gasoline and heating oil. A 25% tariff could lead to an increase of 25-75 cents per gallon, impacting Americans in the Great Lakes, Midwest, and Rockies regions.</p>

<p>After Canada' expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, the oil imports to the US had reached a whopping 4.3 million barrels per day.</p>

<p>"You can't simply process different oil overnight. It would take investments/years. More US supply wouldn't help," Patrick De Haan, the head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy said on X.</p>

<h3>Produce</h3>

<p>As a byproduct of climate change, the US has become less favourable for agriculture and relies heavily on Mexico.&nbsp;</p>

<p>$44.1 billion worth of agricultural products were imported by the US from Mexico in 2022.</p>

<p>90% of avocados Americans also consumed in 2022 were imported. A 25% tariff could make guacamole and avocado toast more expensive.</p>

<h3>Cars</h3>

<p>Mexico is a major hub for car manufacturing, with many US carmakers relying on parts from Mexico to build their vehicles. A 25% tariff could disrupt this supply chain and lead to higher car prices.</p>

<p>Last year, $44.76 billion worth of vehicles were imported from Mexico to the US.</p>

<h3>Alcohol</h3>

<p>According to US Department of Agriculture data, 80% of beer imports come from Mexico. Moreover there is tequila that comes from Mexico and other liqueurs from Canada that drives import growth.</p>

<p>In 2023, $4.6 billion worth of tequila and $108 million worth of mezcal was imported by the US from Mexico, according to the Distilled Spirits Council.</p>

<p>The tariffs of spirits are bound to start a chain reaction leading to job losses in the hospitality industry as well, which are still on their way to recovery after the pandemic.</p>

<p>The tariffs on these imports are bound to hurt the consumers if businesses face higher costs. Trump's tariff plan has already sparked concerns among businesses and economists, who warn that it could lead to higher prices, job losses, and a decline in economic growth.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tan Sri Ananda Krishnan is one of Malaysia's most influential and wealthiest individuals. In the past few days, Mr Krishnan, also known as AK, has been in the limelight because of his son Ajahn Siripanyo, who gave up the world's riches and spoils to become a Buddhist monk. According to <em>Forbes</em>, the 86-year-old is Malaysia's third richest man, with a net worth of over $5 billion (approximately Rs 40,000 crore). His business empire spans multiple industries, from telecommunications to multimedia.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Who is Tan Sri Ananda Krishnan?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Ananda Krishnan is a Malaysian businessman and philanthropist. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/ananda-krishnan/" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>Forbes</em></a>, his business empire spans across telecom, satellites, oil, gas and real estate industries. He also owns Aircel, the now-bankrupt phone company that once sponsored Indian Premier League (IPL) team Chennai Super Kings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ananda Krishnan is a Harvard Business School graduate. Born into Malaysia's middle-class family, he is known for his philanthropic favour. In 1985 he helped the Luve Air rock concert project that raised some $240 million around the world for African famine relief. Since then, he has donated tens of millions to art, education, sports and humanitarian causes in Malaysia through his privately owned holding company, Usaha Tegas, and its three main listed subsidiaries: cell phone operator Maxis, satellite TV and entertainment company Astro All Asia Networks and Tanjong, which is active in gaming, power generation and property.</p>

<p>Despite his immense wealth and business success, Mr Krishnan has remained a relatively private figure. However, his philanthropic efforts are well-known. His journey from modest beginnings to becoming one of Malaysia's richest businessmen serves as an inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>About&nbsp;Ananda Krishnan's monk son</strong></h3>

<p>Ananda Krishnan has only one son, who denounced a fortune worth billions to become a monk in Thailand. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/meet-ajahn-siripanyo-the-monk-who-gave-up-his-fathers-5-billion-empire-7111250">Ajahn Siripanyo</a> chose to detach himself from worldly possessions at the age of 18, a decision his father respects as he himself is a devout Buddhist.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ajahn Siripanyo is also reportedly a blue-blooded noble. His mother, Momwajarongse Suprinda Chakraban, is a descendant of the Thai royal family, according to the <em>South China Morning Post</em> report. Currently, he resides at the Dtao Dum Monastery located somewhere on the Thailand-Myanmar border as an abbot.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The video was inundated withhateful and objectifying comments, prompting Blue Origin to take it down to shield her from further online harassment.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blue Origin was forced to delete a video of female astronaut Emily Calandrelli's first time in space due to a flood of sexist and misogynistic comments on social media. Ms Calandrelli, an MIT engineer and TV host, was part of Blue Origin's NS-28 mission and became the 100th woman to fly to space. The footage, shared after her flight on November 22 captured her emotional reaction to seeing Earth from space. In the video, Ms Calandrelli expressed amazement, likening the experience to the joy of seeing her children for the first time.</p>

<p>"We got to weightlessness, I immediately turned upside down and looked at the planet and then there was so much blackness. There was so much space.&nbsp;I didn't expect to see so much space, and I kept saying that's our planet! That's our planet! It was the same feeling I got when my kids were born, and I was like, That's my baby," she said in the video.</p>

<p>However, the post was inundated with&nbsp;hateful and objectifying comments, prompting Blue Origin to take down the video to shield her from further online harassment. Some sexualized her reaction, while others posted offensive comments targeting her appearance and other personal aspects. One user wrote, "Would you consider yourself the hottest woman to ever go to space? Any other contenders?" Another said, "why is she moaning I cannot unhear it."</p>

<p>Despite the negative attention, Ms Calandrelli stood firm against the backlash and voiced her feelings on her Instagram account.&nbsp; She wrote she refuses "to give much time to the small men on the internet."</p>

<p>"This all happened as I was flying home after experiencing the most perfect, wonderful dream-achieving experience of my life. And instead of being on cloud nine, I'm crying in my seat staring out the window. Because of course, this happened. Of course, I should have expected this," she wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"But I refuse to give much time to the small men on the internet. I feel experiences in my soul. It's a trait I got from my father. We feel every emotion deeply and what a beautiful way that is to experience life. This joy is tattooed on my heart," she added.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Bangladesh has called ISKCON, or the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, a "religious fundamentalist" group in an affidavit filed in that country's High Court.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh has called <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/iskcon" target="_blank">ISKCON</a>, or the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, a "religious fundamentalist" group in an affidavit filed in that country's High Court.&nbsp;The interim government - in power after August's student-led rebellion ousted then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina - also said it is "examining ISKON.</p>

<p>This follows protests over the arrest Hindu priest Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari on Monday; this was after the Hindu community in the city of Rangpur, which is 300 km north of Dhaka, protested demanding stronger laws to protect them and a minority affairs ministry.</p>

<p>Hindus comprise around eight per cent of Bangladesh's 170 million people.</p>

<p>Since Ms Hasina was forced to quit, the new military-backed interim administration, led by Nobel laureate Mohammed Yunus, has faced criticism for failing to control violence against minorities. This includes instances of Hindu businesses and homes being vandalised.</p>

<p>The reference to ISKON as a "religious fundamentalist" organisation was part of the Bangladesh Attorney General's response to a question about the origin of the group in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>In his response, Mohd. Asaduzzaman reportedly said, "... it is a religious fundamentalist organisation. The government is already scrutinising them", and was told to file a note on authorities' response to ISKON and the prevailing law-and-order situation in the country.</p>

<p>The arrest of Chinmoy Brahmachari has, again, triggered furious and violent protests in Bangladesh; this morning it emerged that a temple in Chattogram had been vandalised.</p>

<p>ISKCON spokesperson Radharamn Das shared a video on X and wrote, "24x7 attack on Hindus &amp; Hindu places of worship in #Bangladesh. When will it all STOP?", while the ISKCON's Bangladesh unit condemned the arrest and the violence against Hindu community members.</p>

<p>The arrest has also led to political frostiness between New Delhi and Dhaka.</p>

<p>Delhi has expressed strong reservations over Chinmoy Brahmachari's arrest and urged Dhaka to ensure the safety of minority communities, including Hindus. The Bangladesh Foreign Ministry, however, has bristled at what they said was India's interference in its "internal affairs".</p>

<p>The Yunus government later reaffirmed "in the strongest terms" that every Bangladeshi, regardless of their religious identity, has the "right to establish, maintain or perform respective religious rituals and practices or express views without hindrance."</p>

<p>Chinmoy Brahmachari's arrest also triggered widespread protests by his supporters, prompting law enforcement agencies to be on alert across that country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video of President-elect Donald Trump&nbsp;jokingly offering "millions" to buy a young black girl's hair during a golf outing, has gone viral on social media. While driving a cart while playing golf in West Palm Beach, Florida, Trump complimented a girl on her hair, saying, "Oh, I love that girl. I love that hair. I want her hair. Can I buy your hair? I'll pay you millions for that." &nbsp;She told the 78-year-old that she voted for him, and Trump playfully responded that he voted for her too.</p>

<p>He then invited the child, who he described as beautiful, to join him on his golf cart for a photo opportunity. The crowd was delighted by the moment, with one onlooker expressing amazement and noting that the girl would have a unique story to share - playing golf with the president.</p>

<p><strong>Here's the video:</strong></p>

<p>The video has sparked mixed reactions. While some people appreciated his lighthearted and playful demeanour, others found the exchange to be unusual and weird. Some also called it racist. One user wrote, "This is so creepy and weird. A grown man yells out that he wants to buy a young girl's hair. That's weird, joking or not." Another said, "I can't take another 4 years of this."</p>

<p>Some also thought there was nothing wrong with the exchange.&nbsp;A third commented, "Imagine calling him racist when Trump is complimenting this beautiful young black girl's hair. This is why people love Trump. He's human just like the rest of us and has a heart.''</p>

<p>A fourth added, "Come on! People say that to kids to be nice! People overreacting! If it was someone else you would say that is cute and the girl has nice hair."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US lumber prices, which already have risen in recent months due to lower production in Canada, could see further gains after President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on trade from north of the border.</p>

<p>Lumber futures in Chicago rose as much as 2.1% to $599 per 1,000 board feet Tuesday after the president-elect posted on social media that he would&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/trump-vows-to-hit-china-mexico-canada-with-tariffs-over-border" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">impose</a>&nbsp;25% tariffs on all goods from Canada and Mexico unless those countries curb the flow of fentanyl and migrants into the US. Shares of forestry companies, including West Fraser Timber Co. and Interfor Corp., fell.</p>

<p>Canada, the biggest foreign supplier of lumber to the US, has faced a spate of sawmill closures amid higher US duties. The addition of tariffs would further threaten US lumber supplies as the nation seeks to rebuild in areas hit by hurricanes.</p>

<p>“What we've seen is that any of these sorts of duties or tariffs, they just end up causing supply to go down and prices to go up, and that impacts affordability of housing,” said Kurt Niquidet, chief economist of the BC Council of Forest Industries.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/f3f03i6g_trump-tariffs_625x300_27_November_24.jpg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The implementation of tariffs is more uncertain than duties, which are reassessed annually, but both would delve a financial blow to Canadian producers, Niquidet said.</p>

<p>In the US, tariffs “will further exacerbate our nation's ongoing housing affordability crisis,” Jim Tobin, president of the National Association of Home Builders, said in an emailed statement. The association had already been expecting price spikes over the next year as housing demand increases, he said.</p>

<p>While the US has become increasingly self-sufficient in its lumber production, it still relies on imports from Canada to meet domestic demand. And forests in the US South, the continent's biggest lumber production region, faced losses during the recent hurricane season.</p>

<p>Hurricane Helene in September damaged&nbsp;<a href="https://gatrees.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hurricane-Helene-Timber-Impact-Assessment-Georgia-2024.pdf" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">roughly 6%</a>&nbsp;of Georgia's forests, equating to about 1.47 million acres and $1.28 billion in losses, according to the Georgia Forestry Commission.&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p>After hurricanes Helene and Milton, housing construction in the South&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-19/us-housing-starts-slide-3-1-as-hurricanes-impact-south-region" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">dropped</a>&nbsp;in October as builders postponed projects, though single-family permit authorizations — a sign of future construction — rose to the fastest pace since April.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rebuilding efforts in hurricane-affected areas are “slowly gaining momentum” and should support strong lumber sales in late December and early next year, said Crystal Gauvin, a senior economist at Forest Economic Advisors.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's granddaughter, Kai, has offered a rare glimpse inside the US President-elect's private jet, Force One. In her latest YouTube vlog, the 17-year-old documented how she travelled to witness a SpaceX rocket launch alongside Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Ms Kai gave an intimate tour of the luxurious jet, featuring plush sofas, high-tech TVs, and a sleek, modern interior.</p>

<p>“Come along with me to SpaceX with Elon Musk for the sixth flight test of Starship!” she wrote to introduce the vlog. Next, she's seen boarding the plush aircraft alongside her friend.</p>

<p>Donald Trump's private jet, a Boeing 757, stands out for its customised interiors. Often referred to as the "Trump Force One," it has played a significant role in his campaigns and public image.</p>

<p>The Force One has seats embroidered with gold threads, lavatory fixtures, and other fittings. It also has plush leather seating and high-end wooden furnishings along with a state-of-the-art entertainment system with multiple screens.</p>

<p>There is a bedroom with a double bed and a dining area which seats four.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Kai also gave us a behind-the-scenes look at the cockpit. We also see a bobblehead at the centre. She recreated her grandfather's iconic YMCA dance moves and mimicked his well-known golf swing and signature hand gestures. Her enthusiasm continued as she explored the cockpit, describing the experience of seeing a plane land as "pretty cool stuff."</p>

<p>The vlog didn't just end on the jet. Ms Kai documented her journey to the SpaceX facility, capturing moments of her grandfather's conversation with Elon Musk about the rocket launch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I asked grandpa, ‘Would you go in it?',” said Ms Kai in the video. “And he goes, ‘No'. He would not volunteer to go in the spaceship but it's OK.”</p>

<p>Ms Kai laughed and then asked her friend if she would go. “Go on it? Without a doubt. In a heartbeat, I'm on that,” her friend said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kai Trump described witnessing the rocket launch as "honestly one of the coolest things ever," despite the booster not returning to the launch pad and instead landing in the Gulf of Mexico. “I've never seen something like that,” she said with awe. “And the noise of it, when it was going up. Insane.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Donald Trump has appointed the SpaceX CEO to lead the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) alongside Vivek Ramaswamy.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid unrest in Bangladesh following the arrest of Hindu priest Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari by Dhaka police, a Hindu temple was allegedly targeted by a mob in Chattogram. The arrest of former ISKCON leader Chinmoy Krishna Das has triggered protests across Bangladesh, with the community calling for the monk's release and justice for Hindus who have faced persecution since the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Loknath temple in Chittagong's Firingibazar was targeted in Chattogram, according to reports.</p>

<p>International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) spokesperson, Radharamn Das, shared a purported video of a mob attack on the temple on his X account and wrote, "24x7 attack on Hindus &amp; Hindu places of worship in #Bangladesh. When will it all STOP?"&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Dhaka Reacts To India's Statement Over Monk's Arrest</strong></h2>

<p>Dhaka has reacted to India's statement condemning the arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari and calling Bangladeshi authorities to ensure the safety and security of Hindus and all other minorities. In the issued by Bangladesh's foreign ministry, the Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus's government called the matter Dhaka's "internal affair" and said India's concerns are "unfounded" adding it "contrary to the spirit of friendship"</p>

<p>The Yunus administration later reaffirmed "in the strongest terms" that every Bangladeshi, regardless of their religious identity, has the "right to establish, maintain or perform respective religious rituals and practices or express views without hindrance."</p>

<h3><strong>Lawyer's Killing And Subsequent Arrests</strong></h3>

<p>The Bangladesh government also expressed "deep concerns" over the brutal killing of Advocate Saiful Islam Alif outside Chattogram court on Tuesday. "Authorities have stepped up security in the port city to ensure that religious harmony is maintained at any cost," read the statement.</p>

<p>Saiful, 35, an assistant public prosecutor, was hacked to death amid clashes between police and a crowd protesting the arrest of ISKCON leader Chinmoy Krishna Das in Bangladesh's port city of Chittagong. "Saiful Islam Alif, a lawyer, was killed in Chittagong," Nazim Uddin Chowdhury, President of Chittagong Bar Association, told news agency ANI over the phone.</p>

<p>Chief Adviser Yunus also condemned the murder of a lawyer and ordered an investigation into the killing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per Bangladeshi media, law enforcement authorities have detained at least 20 people in raids in Chittagong in connection with the killing of the lawyer. Quoting Kotwali police station Officer-in-Charge Fazlul Kader, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/366390/20-held-in-chittagong-over-lawyer-killing" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Dhaka Tribune</a> reported that arrests were made during operations in Patharghata Mathar Potti, Andarkilla and Hazari Goli areas from Tuesday evening until midnight.</p>

<h3><strong>Unrest In Bangladesh</strong></h3>

<p>The law enforcement agencies are on high alert across Bangladesh amid tensions in Chittagong. The government has deployed extra forces in Chittagong and the capital Dhaka.</p>

<p>The unrest started after thousands of people in Chittagong gathered outside court premises demanding the release of Chinmoy Brahmachari. The protesters blocked the prison van after a court rejected his bail prayer and ordered to send him to jail. Police and other law-enforcing agencies fired tear shells and sound grenades to remove them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After two hours of clashes, Chinmoy Brahmachari was landed in jail, witnesses said.</p>

<h3><strong>About Chinmoy Krishna Das</strong></h3>

<p>Chandan Kumar Dhar Prokash alias Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari is a spokesperson of the Sanatan Jagaran Mancha. He also heads an ISKCON-operated religious site named Pundarik Dham in Chittagong.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The monk was detained by the Detective Branch (DB) of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Monday and was arrested later on Sedation charges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A case has been filed against Chimnoy in charge of sedition, accusing him of hoisting a flag on the top of a stand of Bangladesh's national flag. But the man who filed the case, now he is not attached to the case. He is now disagreed to continue the case," a minority leader said.</p>

<p>Citing sources in ISKCON Chittagong, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/366367/who-is-chinmoy-krishna-and-why-is-he-being-charged" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Dhaka Tribune</a> reported that Chinmoy Krishna hails from the port city's Satkania Upazila. He reportedly earned the nickname 'Shishu Bokta' due to his popularity as a religious preacher from an early age. He served as the Chittagong Divisional Secretary of ISKCON from 2016 to 2022 and has also been the Principal of Pundarik Dham in Hathazari, since 2007.</p>

<h3><strong>Violence Against Minorities In Bangladesh</strong></h3>

<p>Chinmoy Krishna Das's arrest came amid tensions over minority rights in the South Asian country that has seen widespread political violence since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster. Hindus comprise approximately 8 per cent of Bangladesh's 170 million people. Since the ouster of former PM Sheikh Hasina, the new military-backed interim government led by Mohammed Yunus has faced criticism for failing to curb a spike in violence against minorities.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kaley Cuoco is facing criticism after sharing the "heartbreaking decision" she made to rehome her beloved dog. &nbsp;</p>

<p>On Monday, Cuoco addressed the situation on social media, explaining her reasons for rehoming the pet while announcing the dog's death. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"Most of you know I had [Shirley] for many, many, many years," Cuoco began in a video uploaded to Instagram.</p>

<p>"All of a sudden, you kind of stopped seeing her, and I started to get a lot of questions as to where she was, because it's very unlike me to just stop posting about a dog that I've had since she was 6 weeks old," she continued.</p>

<p>Kaley Cuoco elaborated that her decision to rehome her dog, Shirley, was driven by "intense conflicts" with her fiance Tom Pelphrey's dog, Blue. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"Shirley was very special to me, as you all know," Cuoco shared. "When the love of my life, Tom- a huge dog lover-moved across the country with his beautiful German Shepherd, Blue, things got complicated. Unfortunately, a couple of years ago, Blue and Shirley started getting into major fights." &nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>Big Bang Theory</em> star revealed that Shirley became "determined to harm" Blue, and the situation only escalated. "I loved her deeply, but I was genuinely afraid. I didn't want something terrible to happen or for someone to get hurt by accident," Cuoco said. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately, she rehomed Shirley with her pet handler, Tony, and his wife, Angie, who had been helping care for her. "They loved her so, so much, and it was an excruciating decision," she explained. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Cuoco then shared that Shirley recently died from "a very aggressive bone cancer." Through tears, she added, "She was almost 14 years old, which is an incredible life for a dog. I just wanted to share her story and what we had to do." &nbsp;</p>

<p>Following her revelation, Cuoco faced backlash from fans on social media, with many expressing disappointment over her decision to rehome the dog. &nbsp;</p>

<p>A user wrote, "I thought she was an advocate for abandoned dogs?"</p>

<p>Another user commented, "There's not a shot in hell I would give away my dog for any bf. Poor Shirley was never considered family; she was just a disposable animal!"</p>

<p>The third user wrote, "One day he'll be out her life and she's going to regret that she made that choice"</p>

<p>The fourth user asked, "Why didn't the boyfriend give up his dog? Why didn't they put both dogs through a training/ behavioural program?"</p>

<p>"I'm utterly disgusted," the fifth user commented.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid unrest in Bangladesh following the arrest of Hindu priest Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari by Dhaka police, Hindu temples are allegedly being targeted by mobs in Chattogram. The arrest of former ISKCON leader Chinmoy Krishna Das has triggered protests across Bangladesh, with the community calling for the monk's release and justice for Hindus who have faced persecution since the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At least three temples - Lokonath Temple in Firangi Bazar, Mansa Mata Temple, and Kali Mata Temple in Hazari Lane - have been targeted in Chattogram in the past 24 hours, according to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.news18.com/world/temples-attacked-advocate-killed-as-hindu-monks-arrest-pushes-bangladesh-to-edge-top-points-9135421.html" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">News18</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) spokesperson, Radharamn Das, shared a purported video of a mob attack on a Hindu temple on his X account and wrote, "24x7 attack on Hindus &amp; Hindu places of worship in #Bangladesh. When will it all STOP?"&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Dhaka Reacts To India's Statement Over Monk's Arrest</strong></h2>

<p>Dhaka has reacted to India's statement condemning the arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari and calling Bangladeshi authorities to ensure the safety and security of Hindus and all other minorities. In the issued by Bangladesh's foreign ministry, the Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus's government called the matter Dhaka's "internal affair" and said India's concerns are "unfounded" adding it "contrary to the spirit of friendship"</p>

<p>The Yunus administration later reaffirmed "in the strongest terms" that every Bangladeshi, regardless of their religious identity, has the "right to establish, maintain or perform respective religious rituals and practices or express views without hindrance."</p>

<h3><strong>Lawyer's Killing And Subsequent Arrests</strong></h3>

<p>The Bangladesh government also expressed "deep concerns" over the brutal killing of Advocate Saiful Islam Alif outside Chattogram court on Tuesday. "Authorities have stepped up security in the port city to ensure that religious harmony is maintained at any cost," read the statement.</p>

<p>Saiful, 35, an assistant public prosecutor, was hacked to death amid clashes between police and a crowd protesting the arrest of ISKCON leader Chinmoy Krishna Das in Bangladesh's port city of Chittagong. "Saiful Islam Alif, a lawyer, was killed in Chittagong," Nazim Uddin Chowdhury, President of Chittagong Bar Association, told news agency ANI over the phone.</p>

<p>Chief Adviser Yunus also condemned the murder of a lawyer and ordered an investigation into the killing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per Bangladeshi media, law enforcement authorities have detained at least 20 people in raids in Chittagong in connection with the killing of the lawyer. Quoting Kotwali police station Officer-in-Charge Fazlul Kader, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/366390/20-held-in-chittagong-over-lawyer-killing" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Dhaka Tribune</a> reported that arrests were made during operations in Patharghata Mathar Potti, Andarkilla and Hazari Goli areas from Tuesday evening until midnight.</p>

<h3><strong>Unrest In Bangladesh</strong></h3>

<p>The law enforcement agencies are on high alert across Bangladesh amid tensions in Chittagong. The government has deployed extra forces in Chittagong and the capital Dhaka.</p>

<p>The unrest started after thousands of people in Chittagong gathered outside court premises demanding the release of Chinmoy Brahmachari. The protesters blocked the prison van after a court rejected his bail prayer and ordered to send him to jail. Police and other law-enforcing agencies fired tear shells and sound grenades to remove them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After two hours of clashes, Chinmoy Brahmachari was landed in jail, witnesses said.</p>

<h3><strong>About Chinmoy Krishna Das</strong></h3>

<p>Chandan Kumar Dhar Prokash alias Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari is a spokesperson of the Sanatan Jagaran Mancha. He also heads an ISKCON-operated religious site named Pundarik Dham in Chittagong.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The monk was detained by the Detective Branch (DB) of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Monday and was arrested later on Sedation charges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A case has been filed against Chimnoy in charge of sedition, accusing him of hoisting a flag on the top of a stand of Bangladesh's national flag. But the man who filed the case, now he is not attached to the case. He is now disagreed to continue the case," a minority leader said.</p>

<p>Citing sources in ISKCON Chittagong, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/366367/who-is-chinmoy-krishna-and-why-is-he-being-charged" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Dhaka Tribune</a> reported that Chinmoy Krishna hails from the port city's Satkania Upazila. He reportedly earned the nickname 'Shishu Bokta' due to his popularity as a religious preacher from an early age. He served as the Chittagong Divisional Secretary of ISKCON from 2016 to 2022 and has also been the Principal of Pundarik Dham in Hathazari, since 2007.</p>

<h3><strong>Violence Against Minorities In Bangladesh</strong></h3>

<p>Chinmoy Krishna Das's arrest came amid tensions over minority rights in the South Asian country that has seen widespread political violence since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster. Hindus comprise approximately 8 per cent of Bangladesh's 170 million people. Since the ouster of former PM Sheikh Hasina, the new military-backed interim government led by Mohammed Yunus has faced criticism for failing to curb a spike in violence against minorities.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Kimberly Hanzlik, 59, was convicted in 2011 alongside gunman Joseph Meldish.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman, who spent over a decade in prison, was released after <a href="https://www.bronxda.nyc.gov/downloads/pdf/pr/2024/95-2024-Hanzlik-conviction-vacated.pdf " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">new evidence</a> cast doubt on her involvement in a 1999 Bronx murder case. Kimberly Hanzlik, 59, was convicted in 2011 alongside gunman Joseph Meldish for allegedly tipping him off about the location of the victim, Thomas Brown, who was in Frenchy's Tavern on East Tremont Avenue on March 21, 1999.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Ms Hanzlik was sentenced to 20 years to life in state prison, but a re-investigation into the case by the Bronx District Attorney's Office led to her acquittal.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Meldish, who is suspected of being involved in 40 gangland murders, was furious with Brown – a former drug dealer – for refusing to lend him money and for reporting him to the police after a burglary. Ms Hanzlik, who was struggling with crack addiction at the time, was said to have accompanied Meldish and another man to the bar, where she allegedly saw Brown sitting with his wife and informed Meldish of his presence. Meldish then entered the bar and shot Brown eight times, killing him. However, it was later revealed that Meldish had actually murdered Brown's lookalike brother, Joey.<br />
<br />
Ms Hanzlik was convicted largely based on testimony from the getaway driver, who claimed she helped in the murder.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After Ms Hanzlik's attorneys requested a re-investigation in 2021, new evidence came to light. The DA's Conviction Integrity Bureau found police documents revealing that the getaway driver originally said Ms Hanzlik was not present at the scene.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Brown's wife, who had earlier testified to seeing Ms Hanzlik in the bar before the shooting, did not mention her involvement until 2006, seven years after the incident. Investigators also uncovered that the now-dead NYPD detective who identified Ms Hanzlik was involved in coercing false identifications in an unrelated case.<br />
<br />
On Tuesday, an administrative judge at the Bronx Hall of Justice granted Ms Hanzlik's attorney's motion to vacate her conviction, dismiss the indictment, and seal the case, allowing her to walk free from prison.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Ms Hanzlik's attorney, Irving Cohen, called it an “amazing day” for his client. “We knew she was innocent right away,” Mr Cohen said, adding that Ms Hanzlik was “really emotional” about her release. “I mean, she is totally innocent. She wasn't there when this event happened.”<br />
<br />
However, not everyone was pleased with the outcome. Brown's widow Eileen said that she was “disgusted” with the outcome, as per the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/26/us-news/woman-freed-from-prison-after-new-evidence-contradicts-accounts-of-1999-murder-in-the-bronx/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">NY Post</a>. “I don't understand how they could be letting her out.” She argued, “If she didn't walk into that bar and point out my husband, he would still be with us today.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The coming year will put incoming US President Donald Trump's geopolitical strategies to the test, as wars rage in the Middle East and Ukraine and tensions rise in Asia.</p>

<p>Here are some of the big foreign policy hotspots facing him and other world leaders in 2025.</p>

<h2><strong>Middle East</strong></h2>

<p>More than a year on from the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, the Middle East risks tipping into regional conflict. Israel is pursuing its deadly retaliatory offensive in Gaza while also battling another armed group, Iran-backed Hezbollah, in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Trump has nominated a staunch pro-Israel politician, Mike Huckabee, as his ambassador to Israel.</p>

<p>Michael Horowitz, an analyst at consultancy Le Beck International, said Trump has pledged to "end wars" but does not look inclined to set conditions for Israel.</p>

<p>"The conflict in Gaza could really enter a state of limbo, with Israel imposing a new military solution that keeps troops inside the Strip and declaring that the conflict has ended -- without even the beginning of a political solution," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Horowitz judged a ceasefire in Lebanon more likely, as Israel has achieved "a lot of its objectives", having bombarded Hezbollah and killed several of its leaders.</p>

<h2><strong>Ukraine</strong></h2>

<p>Ukraine is struggling to fight off the invasion launched by Russia in February 2022. Kyiv is short of soldiers and depends on Western military aid, while Russia is advancing in Ukraine's east and has been bolstered by troops from its ally North Korea.</p>

<p>The Republicans' election victory has raised the prospect of a halt to US military aid to Ukraine after party representatives held up a package for nearly a year.</p>

<p>Moscow is pushing for Kyiv to negotiate a settlement.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on November 16 that Kyiv would like to end the war next year through "diplomatic means".</p>

<p>But Russia has demanded Kyiv surrender four regions as a precondition for talks, which Ukraine has rejected.</p>

<p>Trump said during his election campaign that he could end the war "in 24 hours".</p>

<p>His nominee for US national security advisor, Mike Waltz, on November 24 called for negotiations.</p>

<p>"We need to restore deterrence, restore peace, and get ahead of this escalation ladder, rather than responding to it," he said.</p>

<h2><strong>North Korea</strong></h2>

<p>Pyongyang has carried out numerous ballistic missile tests in 2024. Tensions have risen between it and South Korea. The North also has strengthened its ties with Moscow.</p>

<p>The two countries signed a mutual defence treaty in June and North Korea sent 10,000 soldiers to aid Moscow's fight against Ukraine.</p>

<p>"In return, North Korea will seek military technology from Moscow -- everything from drone defence systems to ballistic missiles," said Fyodor Tertiskiy, a senior research fellow with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a US-based think tank.</p>

<p>"These moves signal that we should be prepared for actions from North Korea that we haven't seen before."</p>

<p>Andrew Yeo, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, another US think tank, meanwhile pointed to growing tensions between North and South Korea.</p>

<p>Pyongyang recently blew up roads and railways between the two states and accused the South of sending drones into the North.</p>

<p>If Russia further boosts North Korea militarily, "the United States and its allies in Europe and Asia will need to prepare for a new phase of greater instability and possible escalation in northeast Asia," said Yeo.</p>

<h2><strong>Taiwan, China</strong></h2>

<p>Elsewhere in Asia, Taiwan remains a potential flashpoint for global conflict. China claims the island as part of its territory and has said it would never rule out taking it by force.</p>

<p>The United States is Taiwan's most important backer and biggest supplier of weapons, but like most other countries it does not have official diplomatic relations with the island.</p>

<p>Trump has named China hawk Marco Rubio to be his secretary of state, heralding tensions with Beijing.</p>

<p>Waltz meanwhile has declared that the United States is in "a Cold War with the Chinese Communist Party".</p>

<p>He has said the United States must learn from the experience of Ukraine's war with Russia by backing Taiwan in the face of China.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Zealand scientists on Monday began dissecting a whale considered the rarest in the world, a species so elusive that only seven specimens have ever been documented.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The dead spade-toothed whale washed ashore on New Zealand's South Island earlier this year, offering a chance to study a deep-sea mammal that has never been seen alive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Measuring five metres (16.4 feet) long, the whale was winched off the beach in July and has sat in a special freezer since.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whale expert Anton van Helden said it was the first time scientists had been able to dissect a complete spade-toothed specimen, which belongs to the family of beaked whales.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is a remarkable and globally significant opportunity," he said.</p>

<p>The week-long dissection will help to fill in gaps about the whale's behaviour, its diet, and even its basic anatomy.</p>

<p>"Beaked whales are the most enigmatic group of large mammals on the planet," said Van Helden.</p>

<p>"They are deep divers that are rarely seen at sea, which presents real challenges for researching these marine animals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This one is the rarest of the rare -- only the seventh specimen known from anywhere in the world, and the first opportunity we have had to undertake a dissection like this."&nbsp;</p>

<p>New Zealand's conservation department said the spade-toothed whale was the "rarest whale in the world".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The species was first described in 1874 from just a lower jaw and two teeth collected from the Chatham Islands off the east coast of New Zealand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That sample, along with skeletal remains of two other specimens found in New Zealand and Chile, enabled scientists to confirm a new species.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because so few specimens have been found and there have been no live sightings, the spade-toothed whale is classified as "data deficient" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NFL legend Rando Moss has revealed that he is "battling" an illness as he appeared on <em>ESPN's Sunday NFL Countdown </em>show, wearing sunglasses. The former Minnesota Vikings and New England Patriots star wide receiver did not specify what he was suffering from but requested the viewers and fans to pray for him to come out on top. "I just wanted to let the viewers know that me and my wife and my family are battling something internally. I have some great doctors around me," Mr Moss said during the show, surrounded by co-hosts Mike Greenberg, Rex Ryan, Alex Smith and Tedy Bruschi.</p>

<p>"I couldn't miss the show. I wanted to be here with you guys. I feel great. But if you see me with these 'Michigan turnover glasses' that I have on, it's not being disrespectful because I'm on television. It's because I'm battling something."</p>

<p>"I need all the prayer warriors. God bless you all. Thanks for the prayers. We'll work through it."</p>

<p>After Mr Moss's update, all the co-hosts on the panel pulled out their glasses at the same time and wore them to show solidarity with the NFL alum. "All for one and one for all," Mr Greenberg said while sliding the glasses on his face. "If he's wearing glasses, we're all wearing glasses today."</p>

<p>Mr Moss, who turns 48 next year, has been a six-time Pro Bowler and four-time All-Pro after playing 14 years in the NFL. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2018 in what was his first year of eligibility.</p>

<p>As the video clip of Mr Moss's health update went viral, fans from across the board came out in his support, wishing him good luck on his recovery journey.</p>

<p>"The solidarity of these guys to put their glasses on with him made my heart full," said one user, while another added: "I love Randy the GOAT!!! Praying for you."</p>

<p>A third user speculated: "Eye changes are most common in cancer patients who undergo radiation therapy. This is especially true for patients with head and neck cancers since radiation is delivered close to the eyes."</p>

<p>Notably, prior to joining the ESPN crew in 2016 where he is now a regular member of the "Sunday NFL Countdown" crew, Mr Moss worked for Fox Sports as a broadcaster as well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The treasure chests are filled with items, including gold doubloons, rare Pokemon cards, a Bitcoin valued at nearly $100,000, and historical artefacts.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you're a treasure-hunting enthusiast, this might pique your interest: a Bitcoin millionaire in the U.S. has hidden over $2 million worth of treasures across the country. Entrepreneur Jon Collins-Black, who built his wealth through cryptocurrency investments, has created this elaborate project to spark curiosity and adventure, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/bitcoin-millionaire-2m-treasure-hunt-clues" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>Fox 10</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The treasure chests are filled with extraordinary items, including gold doubloons, rare Pokemon cards, a Bitcoin valued at nearly $100,000, and historical artefacts such as a diamond and sapphire brooch once owned by Jacqueline Onassis. Clues to the five hidden chests can be found in Collins-Black's book,<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://treasureinside.com/" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em> There's Treasure Inside</em></a>, which features puzzles and maps to guide seekers.</p>

<p>A lifelong fantasy and adventure enthusiast, Collins-Black grew up immersed in games like <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Now, he's channelling that passion into a real-world quest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To ensure safety and accessibility, Collins-Black has strategically placed the treasures in non-remote locations within three miles of public roads. None are buried or located on private property. "You don't have to be a genius to solve the clues," he told the *New York Post*. "With curiosity, imagination, and a willingness to try something new, anyone can find the treasures I've hidden."</p>

<h3><strong>The treasure includes a diverse array of unique items to capture different interests, such as: &nbsp;</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>A fourth-century BCE gold Greek laurel &nbsp;</li>
	<li>A coin designed and minted by Pablo Picasso &nbsp;</li>
	<li>A rare lunar rock specimen &nbsp;</li>
	<li>A Michael Jordan 1986 rookie card &nbsp;</li>
	<li>A single Bitcoin, adding a modern twist to the age-old concept of treasure hunting &nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Collins-Black began planning the hunt during the COVID-19 lockdowns, inspired to create a legacy of adventure. "I created this treasure hunt because I live for adventure," he said. "I hope to ignite that same sense of wonder and curiosity in everyone who joins this journey."</p>

<p>The project has drawn comparisons to the famous treasure hunt organized by New Mexico art dealer Forrest Fenn, who hid a chest of gold and jewels worth $2 million in the Rocky Mountains in 2010. Fenn's hunt lasted a decade and attracted global attention but also sparked controversy after reportedly leading to the deaths of five searchers. Collins-Black, however, emphasizes that his treasure hunt prioritizes safety and inclusivity.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[After the mall started to blast the song on loop, fewer homeless people were seen around the area.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A shopping centre in Canada has divided the internet after it was revealed that it had been playing popular children's song, <em>Baby Shark,</em> on loop, to deter homeless people from loitering on the premises, especially the fire emergency stairwell. Complexe Desjardins, a mall and office complex in downtown Montreal confirmed to Canadian website <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-mall-baby-shark-1.7396051" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>CBC </em></a>it had been playing the music for the past year owing to security issues. Mall spokesperson Jean-Benoît Turcotti said the music was installed "because we were having problems in these areas".</p>

<p>As per Mr Turcotti, since the mall started to blast the song on loop, fewer homeless people were seen around the area.</p>

<p>"Since the installation of this sound solution, we have noticed an improvement in the situation," Mr Turcotti told the publication, adding there were no plans to stop playing the song.</p>

<p>Ironically, the mall is situated near the Old Brewery Mission, the city's largest homelessness support organisation.</p>

<h3><strong>Internet reacts</strong></h3>

<p>As the news of the mall's unconventional action went viral, social media users chimed in with their differing viewpoints, While some sided with the mall, others called out the authorities for being cruel towards the homeless people.</p>

<p>"Actually I'm not even mad. Private property. They can do whatever they want. They can play the song through the entire mall 24/7," said one user, while another added: "It is creative. Better than dousing them with water. What other method would you use? They CAN'T live there."</p>

<p>A third added: "Unconventional but if it works then maybe why not"</p>

<p>"More Canadian citizens are homeless than illegals. So this is a war on Canadian citizens by big business. Let's see the liberal NDP say anything lmao," said one user, who was seemingly against the move.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Lionel Carmant, the minister for social services, reacting to the news said the use of the song to scare away the homeless was not alright.</p>

<p>"It's not humane and it's not the right way (to do it). I am here to take care of the homeless," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ledevoir.com/politique/quebec/824672/c-est-pas-humain-dit-ministre-carmant-sujet-utilisation-chanson-baby-shark" rel="noindex, nofollow">said </a>Lionel Carmant, the minister for social services.</p>

<p>Despite the criticism, Mr Carmant did not have a specific plan of action to tackle the issue. "The community needs to come together to take care of people," he said instead.</p>

<p>Notably, Desjardins Group, the company that maintains the mall, pledged £946,000 (Rs 10.1 crore) for homelessness initiatives in Montreal in 2023.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian war bloggers reported on Sunday that Moscow has dismissed Sergei Kisel, the general in charge of its forces in Syria, after insurgents swept into the city of Aleppo in the biggest challenge to President Bashar al-Assad in years.</p>

<p>Russia is a key Assad ally. The removal of Kisel, 53, was reported by the Rybar Telegram channel, which is close to the Russian defence ministry, and by the Voenny Osvedomitel (Military Informant) blog.</p>

<p>Reuters has requested comment from the Russian defence ministry. Since the start of the Ukraine war, Russia has made a number of military reshuffles that were not publicly announced.</p>

<p>Unconfirmed reports said Kisel was being replaced by Colonel General Alexander Chaiko.</p>

<p>The military blogs were scathing about the performance of Kisel, who previously commanded Russia's 1st Guards Tank Army in the Kharkiv region of Ukraine, where Moscow's forces were driven back in a lightning counter-attack by Ukrainian troops in late 2022.</p>

<p>"Apparently he was supposed to reveal his hidden talents in Syria, but something got in the way again," Voenny Osvedomitel wrote.</p>

<p>Rybar commented: "The approach needs to change. The Syrian sandbox has long been a place for laundering the reputations of unsuccessful generals who turned out to be incompetent in the zone of the special military operation" - Russia's term for the war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Rybar speculated that Russia might even turn to Sergei Surovikin, a general who earned the nickname "General Armageddon" for his ruthlessness in Syria and was briefly in charge of the Ukrainian war effort. Surovikin was demoted last year, when unconfirmed reports said he had been investigated for possible complicity in a mutiny by Russia's Wagner mercenary group.</p>

<p>The insurgent advance in Syria was the first since March 2020 when Russia and Turkey, which supports the rebels, agreed to a ceasefire that led to the halting of military action in northwest Syria.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the Syrian army said it had recaptured several towns that had been overrun by rebels in recent days. The insurgents are a coalition of Turkish-backed mainstream secular armed groups, along with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist group that is the opposition's most formidable military force.</p>

<p>Aleppo had been held by the government since a 2016 victory there, one of the war's major turning points, when Russian-backed Syrian forces besieged and laid waste to rebel-held eastern areas of what had been the country's largest city.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A plastic-eating insect may help solve the trash problem that has choked the Earth for a long time, scientists have concluded in a new study. The larvae of the lesser-eating Kenyan mealworm can digest plastic, making it the only insect species native to Africa capable of doing it, The New York Post reported. The study was published in the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-72201-9" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">Nature Journal</a>.</p>

<p>"By studying these natural 'plastic-eaters,' we hope to create new tools that help get rid of plastic waste faster and more efficiently," Fathiya Khamis, a senior scientist at the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology and the person behind the study, said.</p>

<p>Mr Khamis and his team found the worm is the pupae of an Alphitobius darkling beetle. It possesses enzymes which can break down polystyrene, a major ingredient in styrofoam. It runs rampant in aquatic ecosystems and has a long durability.</p>

<p>The mealworm might provide an efficient and eco-friendly alternative to the traditional recycling methods that are usually expensive and can paradoxically increase pollution.</p>

<p>To test the capabilities of the worm, the researchers held a month-long trial and showcased their gut bacteria.</p>

<p>During the study period, the worms were given plastic polystyrene and bran -- a nutrient-dense food.</p>

<p>The results showed the worms consumed polystyrene more efficiently when given with bran, compared with the polystyrene-only diet. They managed to break down 11.7% of the total polymer.</p>

<p>They also survive at a higher rate, indicating the importance of a nutritious diet.</p>

<p>Khamis said the worms that broke down polymer had higher levels of certain bacteria, the enzymes of which they now look forward to isolating to "create microbial solutions that will address plastic waste on a larger scale".</p>

<p>"Instead of releasing a huge number of these insects into trash sites (which is not practical), we can use the microbes and enzymes they produce in factories, landfills, and cleanup sites," Khamis added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Outgoing US President Joe Biden has pardoned his son Hunter Biden, who had been convicted on charges related to gun crimes and tax violations.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has responded to outgoing US President Joe Biden's decision to pardon his son Hunter Biden who had been convicted on charges related to gun crimes and tax violations, calling it a "miscarriage of Justice".</p>

<p>In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, "Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years? Such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!"</p>

<p>The J6 hostages is a reference to those people imprisoned for their role in the January 6, 2021 riots on Capitol Hill, Trump and his supporters have called the imprisoned people hostages claiming they were acting peacefully and patriotically.</p>

<p>It has been speculated that once Donald Trump takes over as President he will issue a pardon for those who are imprisoned for their role in the siege of Capitol Hill on January 6, 2021.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joe-biden-pardons-son-hunter-in-2-criminal-cases-hope-americans-will-understand-7151191#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">Joe Biden</a> on Sunday signed a pardon for his son, Hunter Biden, who had been convicted on charges related to gun crimes and tax violations. The pardon ensures that Hunter Biden will not face sentencing for these offences and removes the possibility of prison time.</p>

<p>In a statement, President Biden addressed the charges against his son, arguing that individuals in similar situations--such as those with tax payment issues due to addiction--typically receive non-criminal resolutions.</p>

<p>He contended that Hunter's case was treated differently, leading to felony charges despite the absence of aggravating factors. Biden also stressed his commitment to not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, despite his belief that his son had been "selectively and unfairly prosecuted."</p>

<p>"Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter. From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively and unfairly prosecuted. Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form. Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties are typically given non-criminal resolutions. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently," the statement read.</p>

<p>Biden explained that the charges against his son were initiated after political opponents in Congress pushed for the case to be brought forward. He added that a plea deal, which had been negotiated with the Department of Justice, unravelled in court due to political pressure.</p>

<p>"The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election. Then, a carefully negotiated plea deal, agreed to by the Department of Justice, unravelled in the courtroom--with a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process. Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunter's cases," the statement added.</p>

<p>The outgoing President maintained that the charges were politically motivated, asserting that Hunter was targeted because of his relationship with him. Biden concluded his statement by expressing his belief that, while he had faith in the justice system, the legal process had been influenced by politics, leading to a "miscarriage of justice."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Sales by major arms makers were boosted last year by wars in Ukraine and Gaza and tensions in Asia, with marked increases for manufacturers based in Russia and the Middle East.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sales by major arms makers were boosted last year by wars in Ukraine and Gaza and tensions in Asia, with marked increases for manufacturers based in Russia and the Middle East, a report said Monday.</p>

<p>Sales of arms and military services by the world's 100 largest arms companies totalled $632 billion in 2023, up 4.2 percent, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).</p>

<p>Revenues had dipped in 2022 as global weapons makers struggled to meet the increase in demand, but many of them managed to increase production last year, the authors of the report noted.</p>

<p>In a sign of this surge in demand, all 100 companies tracked achieved sales in excess of $1 billion last year for the first time.</p>

<p>"There was a marked rise in arms revenues in 2023, and this is likely to continue in 2024," Lorenzo Scarazzato, a researcher with the SIPRI Military Expenditure and Arms Production, said in a statement.</p>

<p>Sales from the world's top 100 arms companies "still did not fully reflect the scale of demand, and many companies have launched recruitment drives, suggesting they are optimistic about future sales," Scarazzato added.</p>

<p>Smaller producers have been more effective in meeting the demand linked to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, growing tensions in East Asia and rearmament programmes in other regions, the institute said.</p>

<p>"A lot of them specialise in either a component of something or build systems that require one set of supply chains," allowing them to react more quickly, Nan Tian, Director of SIPRI's Military Expenditure and Arms Production Programme, told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Among the leading producers, US companies recorded a 2.5 percent increase in their sales last year and still account for half the world's arms revenues, with 41 US weapons producers in the world's top 100.</p>

<p>Lockheed Martin and RTX (formerly Raytheon Technologies), the world's two largest arms makers, on the other hand, reported a fall in revenue of 1.6 percent and 1.3 percent respectively.</p>

<p>Such behemoths "often depend on complex, multi-tiered supply chains, which made them vulnerable to lingering supply chain challenges in 2023," Tian said.</p>

<h3><strong>Russia's Rostec surges</strong></h3>

<p>In Europe, home to 27 of the top 100, arms makers on average saw an increase of just 0.2 percent.</p>

<p>But European groups manufacturing complex weapons systems were still in the process of honouring old contracts last year, so the revenues do not reflect the influx of orders since then.</p>

<p>"At the same time, a number of other European producers saw their arms revenues grow substantially, driven by demand linked to the war in Ukraine, particularly for ammunition, artillery and air defence and land systems," SIPRI noted.</p>

<p>The figures for Russia, though incomplete, give a clear signal of an economy increasingly geared toward war.</p>

<p>Sales by the two Russian groups in the ranking rose by 40 percent, mainly thanks to a 49 percent increase in sales for state-owned conglomerate Rostec, according to the report.</p>

<p>Manufacturers in the Middle East were buoyed by the war in Ukraine and by the first months of the Israeli offensive in Gaza after Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack -- and saw on average an 18 percent lift in sales.</p>

<p>The three Israeli manufacturers in the ranking posted record sales of $13.6 billion, up 15 percent from the year before, while the three groups based in Turkey, such as drone producer Baykar, saw their sales jump by 24 percent -- boosted by Ukraine and Turkey's investments in its defence.</p>

<p>In Asia, the trend toward rearmament was particularly evident in the growth in sales by the four South Korean manufacturers, with revenues rising 39 percent on average, and five Japanese firms that saw an average increase of 35 percent.</p>

<p>The nine Chinese producers meanwhile saw revenue increase by only 0.7 percent "amid a slowing economy," but their sales still totalled $103 billion.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Tamuna Museridze had been looking for her birth parents since 2016 but only made the breakthrough earlier this year.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An adopted woman in Georgia received the surprise of a lifetime after she found she had been Facebook friends with her birth father all these years. Tamuna Museridze made the astonishing discovery while she was on a mission to find her birth parents, according to a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36p9drnrdlo" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>BBC</em></a>. Ms Museridze's search started in 2016 after the woman who raised her died. While clearing out the house, she found her birth certificate but noticed that it had the wrong birth date, leading to suspicion that she may have been adopted.</p>

<p>After doing some digging, Ms Museridze set up a Facebook group called Vedzeb, or I'm Searching, hoping to reconcile with her birth parents. It wasn't up until this year that she received a message from a woman in rural Georgia, claiming that her aunt had concealed a pregnancy in Tbilisi in September 1984, which matched the time around Ms Museridze's birthdate.</p>

<p>After some correspondence, the unnamed woman agreed to take a DNA test. While waiting for the tests, Ms Museridze decided to call her mother.</p>

<p>"She started screaming, shouting - she said she hadn't given birth to a child. She didn't want anything to do with me," Ms Museridze told the publication about her first interaction with her mother.</p>

<p>"I was ready for anything, but her reaction was beyond anything I could imagine."</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/two-south-korean-sisters-separated-at-birth-reunited-after-nearly-40-years-6899460" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Also Read | Two South Korean Sisters Separated At birth Reunited After Nearly 40 Years</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>The epilogue</strong></h3>

<p>A week later, the DNA test arrived, confirming that Ms Museridze and the woman on Facebook were indeed cousins. With the hard evidence by her side, Ms Museridze confronted her mother again and convinced her to acknowledge the truth. She also got her to reveal the name of the father. It was a man called Gurgen Khorava.</p>

<p>"The first two months were shocking, I couldn't believe these things were happening to me. I couldn't believe I had found them," Ms Museridze said.</p>

<p>Once Ms Museridze had Mr Khorava's name, she quickly tracked him down on Facebook. It turned out that he had been following her story on social media with the pair being friends for three years.</p>

<p>"[He had] been in my friend list for three years. He didn't even know my birth mother had been pregnant. It was a huge surprise for him," she added.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised President-elect Donald Trump that Canada would toughen controls over the long undefended joint border, a senior Canadian official said on Sunday.</p>

<p>Trudeau flew to Florida on Friday to have dinner with Trump, who has promised to slap tariffs on Canadian imports unless Ottawa prevents migrants and drugs from crossing the frontier.</p>

<p>Canada sends 75% of all goods and services exports to the United States and tariffs would badly hurt the economy.</p>

<p>Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, who sat at the head table with Trudeau and Trump, said the two men discussed additional security measures Canada would be introducing.</p>

<p>"We're going to look to procure, for example, additional drones, additional police helicopters, we're going to redeploy personnel ... we believe that the border is secure," he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.</p>

<p>"It's important, I think, to show Canadians and the Americans that we're stepping up in a visible and muscular way, and that's exactly what we're going to do," he added, promising more details in the days and weeks to come.</p>

<p>Canada, he said, would continue to make the case that tariffs would damage both nations, given how interconnected the two economies are.</p>

<p>"I'm confident that the Americans will understand that it's not in their interest ... to proceed in this way," he said, describing the dinner meeting as very warm and cordial.</p>

<p>Trump said on Saturday he discussed the border, trade and energy in a "very productive" meeting with Trudeau.</p>

<p>The friendly nature of the dinner contrasts with previous exchanges between the two men.</p>

<p>Trump called Trudeau "a far left lunatic" in 2022 for requiring truck drivers crossing the border to be vaccinated against COVID. In June 2018, Trump walked out of a G7 summit in Quebec and blasted Trudeau for being "very dishonest and weak."</p>

<p>At the end of the dinner, LeBlanc said, Trump walked Trudeau to his car and said "Keep in touch. Call me anytime. Talk soon."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bob Bryar, the former drummer of the rock band My Chemical Romance, died at 44. Few details about his death have been disclosed, but a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/11/29/bob-bryar-original-my-chemical-romance-drummer-dead-44/" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>TMZ</em></a>, citing law enforcement sources, states there is no indication of foul play.&nbsp;</p>

<p>TMZ reported Bryar's death on Friday evening, revealing that he was found dead in his Tennessee home on Tuesday. He was last seen alive on November 4. Law enforcement sources indicated that all his belongings, including weapons and music equipment, remained undisturbed, further ruling out foul play.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Animal Control was reportedly called to remove two dogs from the home after Bryar's heavily decomposed body was discovered. The medical examiner is currently investigating the cause and manner of his death.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for My Chemical Romance told Rolling Stone, "The band asks for your patience and understanding as they process the news of Bob's passing."</p>

<p>Born in Chicago in 1979, Bryar began playing drums at an early age. Initially a sound engineer and tour manager, he transitioned to being a musician after meeting the members of My Chemical Romance in 2004. He joined the band during their Japan tour, replacing drummer Matt Pelissier, and remained with them for six years. During his tenure, he contributed to three albums, including their iconic 2006 release, *The Black Parade*.</p>

<p>After leaving the band, Bryar shifted to behind-the-scenes roles in the music industry, supporting tours for various artists. In recent years, he maintained a low profile.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[At least 257 people, including 104 security personnel and 119 civilians, were injured in clashes and bombings in Pakistan in November.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 245 people, including 68 security personnel, were killed in a series of terrorist attacks and clashes across Pakistan in November, said Dawn, citing a report by the Islamabad-based think tank, the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), released on Sunday. The casualties included 127 terrorists and 50 civilians.</p>

<p>November ranked as the second deadliest month of the year, following August, which saw 254 deaths, including 92 civilians, 108 terrorists, and 54 security personnel. In terms of security personnel casualties, November was the deadliest month of 2024, surpassing October, which saw 62 security force deaths.</p>

<p>Additionally, 257 people were injured in clashes and bombings, including 104 security personnel and 119 civilians. This period reflects a sharp increase in terrorist attacks across the country in recent years.</p>

<p>The report detailed that 131 fatalities occurred in terrorist attacks, including 54 security personnel, 50 civilians, and 27 terrorists.</p>

<p>Terrorist activity showed an increase in November, with 71 recorded attacks, compared to 68 in October.</p>

<p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was the hardest-hit region, with 50 terrorist attacks leading to 71 deaths and 85 injuries. The Kurram district witnessed one of the worst tribal clashes in recent history, with over 120 people killed, Dawn, citing the Islamabad think tank, said.</p>

<p>Further, according to the report, Balochistan reported 20 terrorist attacks, resulting in 60 deaths, including 26 security personnel, 25 civilians, and nine terrorists. The 127 terrorist fatalities in November marked the highest monthly toll since February 2017, when 148 terrorists were killed, Dawn, citing the think tank, added.</p>

<p>The Pakistani security forces also suffered major losses, with 68 personnel killed--the highest toll since January 2023, when 114 security force members died.</p>

<p>The data also revealed that terrorist-related fatalities in 2024 have surpassed 1,000, reaching 1,082 in the first 11 months, with 856 terrorist attacks reported so far this year, compared to 645 attacks in 2023, reflecting the worsening security situation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Dozens of people were killed Sunday in clashes between fans at a football match in N'Zerekore, Guinea's second largest city.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dozens of people were killed Sunday in clashes between fans at a football match in N'Zerekore, Guinea's second largest city, hospital sources told AFP, describing scenes of mass carnage.</p>

<p>"There are bodies lined up as far as the eye can see in the hospital. Others are lying on the floor in the hallways. The morgue is full," one doctor said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.</p>

<p>He said "there are around 100 dead", with bodies filling the local hospital and morgue. Another doctor said there were "dozens of dead".</p>

<p>Videos circulating on social media, which AFP was unable to immediately verify, showed scenes of chaos in the street outside the match and numerous bodies lying on the ground.</p>

<p>Angry demonstrators also vandalised and set fire to the N'Zerekore police station, according to witnesses.</p>

<p>"It all started with a contested decision by the referee. Then fans invaded the pitch," a witness told AFP, asking that his name be withheld for safety reasons.</p>

<p>Local media said the match was part of a tournament organised in honour of Guinea's junta leader, Mamadi Doumbouya, who seized power in a 2021 coup and has installed himself as president.</p>

<p>Such tournaments have become common in the West African nation as Doumbouya eyes a potential run in presidential elections expected next year and political alliances form.</p>

<h3><strong>Prolonged transition</strong></h3>

<p>Doumbouya seized power by force in September 2021 by overthrowing President Alpha Conde, who had placed the then-colonel in charge of an elite force tasked with protecting the head of state from such coups.</p>

<p>Under international pressure, he pledged to hand power back to a civilian government by the end of 2024 but has since made clear he will not.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The military leader "exceptionally" promoted himself to the rank of lieutenant general in January and last month he elevated himself to the rank of army general.</p>

<p>Doumbouya has presided over an ongoing crackdown on dissent, with many opposition leaders detained, brought before the courts or forced into exile.</p>

<p>A "transitional charter" drawn up by the junta shortly after the coup said that no member of the junta could stand in either national or local elections.</p>

<p>But Doumbouya's backers have recently expressed their support for his candidacy in the next presidential election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the end of September, authorities indicated that elections intended to restore constitutional order would be held in 2025.</p>

<p>Despite its considerable natural resources, Guinea remains an impoverished nation.</p>

<p>It has been ruled by authoritarian governments for decades.</p>

<p>Doumbouya is one of several officers who have seized power in West Africa since 2020, along with fellow military leaders in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.</p>

<p>N'Zerekore, where the clashes took place in Guinea's southeast, has a population of about 200,000 people.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Richard Lombardi and Frank Griswold had been friends since the early 1990s when they worked together at a company.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man in the US state of Massachusetts has been charged with involuntary manslaughter, assault and battery after he allegedly killed a 'sneezing' elderly roommate for being too close to the Thanksgiving turkey dinner he was cooking last week. The man, identified as Richard Lombardi, 65, argued with his roommate, Frank Griswold, 80, telling him not to wash the dishes as he was concerned that the latter's chronic sneezing would contaminate the turkey sitting nearby, according to court documents accessed by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/man-charged-in-death-of-80-year-old-in-marshfield-massachusetts/63050612" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>WCVB</em></a>.</p>

<p>According to the official version given to the police by Mr Lombardi, he returned to the kitchen later, only to find Mr Griswold washing dishes near the turkey, not heeding his request. Overcome by anger, Mr Lombardi grabbed his roommate from behind and pushed him aside. As Mr Griswold's feet allegedly got "tangled up," he fell to the floor and hit his head.</p>

<p>Mr Lombardi said he called 911 after his roommate remained unresponsive and started bleeding from the head. Mr Griswold was taken to South Shore Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.</p>

<p>"He did see the victim, Mr Griswold, near that food doing dishes, said that he went over and grabbed Mr Griswold from behind, grabbed his back and threw Mr Griswold to the right and tossed him to the side," said prosecutor Joseph Presley.</p>

<p>"He was seen laying face-up on the floor in the kitchen in a pool of blood," added Mr Presley.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-man-convicted-after-dismembering-burning-victims-in-ritualistic-sacrifice-7093114" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Also Read | US Man Guilty Of Killing 3, Mutilating, Eating Victim's Heart For "Ritualistic Sacrifice"</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>'Not guilty'</strong></h3>

<p>As the police conducted the investigation, Mr Lombardi was charged and arraigned in Plymouth District Court last week where he pleaded not guilty.</p>

<p>"It sounds like an accident based on what the evidence was that was revealed in court," said Mr Lombardi's public-appointed attorney, Marshall Johnson.</p>

<p>According to a report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/01/us-news/mass-man-kills-elderly-roommate-for-being-too-close-to-thanksgiving-dinner/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>NY Post</em></a>, both Mr Lombardi and Mr Griswold had been friends since the early 1990s, when they worked together at Charles River Management. They became roomies in 2001 and as per the landlord, did not have any arguments or altercations. Although Mr Lombardi was not Mr Griswold's caretaker, he helped his roommate with dinner, bills and paperwork.</p>

<p>Mr Lombardi is currently being held without bail. He is next expected to be in court on Wednesday (Dec 4).</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden on Sunday said he had issued an official pardon for his son Hunter, who is facing sentencing for two criminal cases.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden said on Sunday he had pardoned his son, Hunter Biden, a reversal after pledging to stay out of legal proceedings against the younger Biden who pleaded guilty to tax violations and was convicted on firearms-related charges.</p>

<p>"Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter. From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted," the president said in a statement.</p>

<p>The White House had said repeatedly that Biden would not pardon or commute sentences for Hunter, a recovering drug addict who became a target of Republicans, including President-elect Donald Trump.</p>

<p>"No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son," Biden said in a statement released shortly before leaving for a trip to Africa.</p>

<p>The grant of clemency said Biden had granted "a full and unconditional" pardon to Hunter Biden for any offenses in a window from January 1, 2014, to December 1, 2024.</p>

<p>Hunter Biden faced sentencing for the false statements and gun convictions this month. In September he pleaded guilty to federal charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes while spending lavishly on drugs, sex workers and luxury items. He was scheduled for sentencing in that case on Dec. 16.</p>

<p>"I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction - mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport," Hunter Biden said in a statement on Sunday, adding he had remained sober for more than five years.</p>

<p>"In the throes of addiction, I squandered many opportunities and advantages ... I will never take the clemency I have been given today for granted and will devote the life I have rebuilt to helping those who are still sick and suffering."</p>

<p>Republicans criticized the president's move.</p>

<p>"Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years? Such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social site, referring to those convicted for storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, after Trump claimed falsely that he had won the 2020 election.</p>

<p>"Joe Biden has lied from start to finish about his family's corrupt influence peddling activities," said Representative James Comer, chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability.</p>

<p>The president, whose son Beau died of brain cancer in 2015, said his opponents had sought to break Hunter with selective prosecution.</p>

<p>He said people were almost never brought to trial for felony charges for how they filled out a gun form, and said others who were late in paying taxes because of addiction but paid them back with interest and penalties, as his son had, typically received non-criminal resolutions to their cases.</p>

<p>"It is clear that Hunter was treated differently. The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election," Biden said. "In trying to break Hunter, they've tried to break me - and there's no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough."</p>

<p>In August 2023, lawyers for Hunter Biden said prosecutors had reneged on a plea deal that would have resolved the tax and firearms charges. The president said in his statement on Sunday that the plea deal "would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunter's cases."</p>

<p>Biden said he had made his decision to pardon over the weekend. The president, his wife, Jill Biden, and their family including Hunter, spent the Thanksgiving holiday in Nantucket, Massachusetts, and returned to Washington on Saturday night.</p>

<p>"Here's the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice - and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further," Biden said.</p>

<p>"I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday named Lebanese-American businessman Massad Boulos as his senior advisor on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs, the latest family member to be appointed to a key position.</p>

<p>"I am proud to announce that Massad Boulos will serve as Senior Advisor to the President on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs," Trump posted on Truth Social of the appointment, which puts his daughter Tiffany's father-in-law in a major White House position.</p>

<p>Boulos was a key emissary for the Trump campaign, helping to mobilize Arab American and Muslim voters, many of whom were disaffected with White House policy on the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>The businessman will take over a difficult portfolio, with Israel's war raging in Gaza, a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon seeing early violations, and rebel forces in Syria making advances against the government of Bashar al-Assad.</p>

<p>Massad Boulos's son, Michael, is married to Trump's daughter Tiffany.</p>

<p>A day earlier, Trump appointed Charles Kushner -- the father of his son-in-law Jared -- as the US ambassador to France.</p>

<p>"Massad is an accomplished lawyer and a highly respected leader in the business world, with extensive experience on the International scene," said Trump of his pick for the Middle East advisor job.</p>

<p>"He has been a longtime proponent of Republican and Conservative values, an asset to my Campaign, and was instrumental in building tremendous new coalitions with the Arab American Community."</p>

<p>The Republican referred to Boulos as "a dealmaker."</p>

<p>Trump often promised on the campaign trail to bring a swift end to the wars in Gaza, Ukraine and elsewhere, without specifying how he would do so.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday that his country needed security guarantees from NATO and more weapons to defend itself before any talks with Russia.</p>

<p>He made the comments after meeting the EU's new head of diplomacy Kaja Kallas and EU Council chief Antonio Costa, who were visiting Kyiv as a show of support on their first day in office.</p>

<p>"An invitation for Ukraine to join NATO is a necessary thing for our survival," Zelensky said at a press conference with Costa.</p>

<p>Ukraine faces a tough winter ahead, with Russia unleashing devastating barrages against its power grid and Kyiv's fatigued forces losing ground on the frontline.</p>

<p>Questions are also swirling around the future of US support once Donald Trump assumes the presidency in January, with fears he could force Kyiv to make painful concessions in pursuit of a quick peace deal.</p>

<p>Zelensky said his country needed to be in a "strong position" before any talks with the Kremlin, calling for "steps forward with NATO" and a "good number" of long-distance weapons to defend itself.</p>

<p>"Only when we have all these items and we are strong, after that, we have to make the very important... agenda of meeting with one or another of the killers," the Ukrainian leader said, adding that the EU and NATO should be involved in any negotiations.</p>

<p>Costa said the European Union would give Ukraine its "unwavering" support.</p>

<p>"We have stood with you since the very first day of this war of aggression, and you can count on us to continue to stand with you," he told Zelensky.</p>

<p>The European Union's new leadership team is keen to show it remains firm on backing Kyiv at a perilous moment for Ukraine nearly three years into its fight against Russia's invasion.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened this week to strike government buildings in Kyiv with his new Oreshnik missile, after the US gave Ukraine approval to fire long-range ATACMS missiles into Russia for the first time.</p>

<p>A Russian drone dropped explosives on a bus in the southern Kherson region on Sunday, killing three people, authorities said, while the Russian army claimed to have captured two new frontline villages in the east.</p>

<p><strong>Ceasefire?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Zelensky on Friday appeared to begin staking out his position ahead of any potential peace talks.</p>

<p>He called on NATO to offer guaranteed protections to parts of Ukraine controlled by Kyiv in order to "stop the hot stage of the war", and implied he would then be willing to wait to regain other territory seized by Russia.</p>

<p>"If we will have a frozen conflict without any strong position for Ukraine, Putin will come back in two, three or five years," Zelensky said Sunday.</p>

<p>Kallas told journalists on the journey into Ukraine that for Kyiv "the strongest security guarantee is NATO membership".</p>

<p>"We need to definitely discuss this -- if Ukraine decides to draw the line somewhere then how can we secure peace so that Putin doesn't go any further," she said.</p>

<p>But diplomats at NATO say there appears little prospect of the alliance granting Ukraine membership soon given opposition from a raft of members cautious of getting dragged into war with Russia.</p>

<p>Zelensky insisted Kyiv was not "delusional" about its prospects with NATO and admitted there was deep reluctance from US President Joe Biden, along with leaders in countries such as Hungary.</p>

<p><strong>'Transactional language'</strong></p>

<p>Kallas said the EU "shouldn't really rule out anything" in terms of the question of sending European troops to help enforce any ceasefire.</p>

<p>"We should have this strategic ambiguity around this," she said.</p>

<p>Trump has cast doubt on continuing Washington's vast aid for Ukraine and called on EU countries to do more.</p>

<p>Europe together has spent around $125 billion on supporting Ukraine since Russia's 2022 invasion, while the United States alone has coughed up over $90 billion, according to a tracker from the Kiel Institute.</p>

<p>Kallas said the EU would use a "transactional language" to try to convince Trump that backing Kyiv was in the interest of the US.</p>

<p>"Aid for Ukraine is not charity," she said. "A victory for Russia definitely emboldens China, Iran, North Korea."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States is not considering returning to Ukraine the nuclear weapons it gave up after the Soviet Union collapsed, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Sunday.</p>

<p>Sullivan made his remarks when questioned about a New York Times article last month that said some unidentified Western officials had suggested US President Joe Biden could give Ukraine the arms before he leaves office.</p>

<p>"That is not under consideration, no. What we are doing is surging various conventional capacities to Ukraine so that they can effectively defend themselves and take the fight to the Russians, not (giving them) nuclear capability," he told ABC.</p>

<p>Last week, Russia said the idea was "absolute insanity" and that preventing such a scenario was one of the reasons why Moscow sent troops into Ukraine.</p>

<p>Kyiv inherited nuclear weapons from the Soviet Union after its 1991 collapse but gave them up under a 1994 agreement, the Budapest Memorandum, in return for security assurances from Russia, the United States and Britain.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

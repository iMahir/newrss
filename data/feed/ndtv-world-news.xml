       <description><![CDATA[A groundbreaking study by New York University (NYU) reveals that memory formation isnt limited to brain cells but may occur in various body cells, altering our understanding of memory.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A groundbreaking discovery made by researchers at New York University (NYU) implies that memory creation occurs in cells other than the brain. Treatments for memory-related disorders and learning strategies may be significantly impacted by this study.</p>

<p>The long-held belief that memories are only retained in brain cells is called into question by this study. Rather, NYU researchers found that cells from different body areas had a memory function, suggesting that learning by repetition may occur at the cellular level. This implies that the ability of our body to "remember" extends beyond the brain, with each cell possibly having the power to adjust in response to past events.</p>

<p>"Learning and memory are generally associated with brains and brain cells alone, but our study shows that other cells in the body can learn and form memories, too," explains New York University's Nikolay V. Kukushkin, the lead author of the study, which appears in the<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-53922-x"><em> journal Nature Communications.&nbsp;</em></a></p>

<p>The research sought to better understand if non-brain cells help with memory by borrowing from a long-established neurological property-the massed-spaced effect-which shows that we tend to retain information better when studied in spaced intervals rather than in a single, intensive session-better known as cramming for a test.</p>

<p>In the Nature Communications research, the scientists replicated learning over time by studying two types of non-brain human cells in a laboratory (one from nerve tissue and one from kidney tissue) and exposing them to different patterns of chemical signals-just like brain cells are exposed to patterns of neurotransmitters when we learn new information. In response, the non-brain cells turned on a "memory gene"-the same gene that brain cells turn on when they detect a pattern in the information and restructure their connections in order to form memories.</p>

<p>"This reflects the massed-space effect in action," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2024/november/memories-are-not-only-in-the-brain--new-research-finds.html">says Kukushkin,</a> a clinical associate professor of life science at NYU Liberal Studies and a research fellow at NYU's Center for Neural Science. "It shows that the ability to learn from spaced repetition isn't unique to brain cells, but, in fact, might be a fundamental property of all cells."</p>

<p>The researchers add that the findings not only offer new ways to study memory, but also point to potential health-related gains.</p>

<p>"This discovery opens new doors for understanding how memory works and could lead to better ways to enhance learning and treat memory problems," observes Kukushkin. "At the same time, it suggests that in the future, we will need to treat our body more like the brain-for example, consider what our pancreas remembers about the pattern of our past meals to maintain healthy levels of blood glucose or consider what a cancer cell remembers about the pattern of chemotherapy."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's 2024 victory is very reminiscent of his 2016 one. However, comparing Trump's 2016 and 2024 presidential campaigns reveals some striking differences as well.</p>

<p>Despite the passage of time, Trump's appeal remained consistent across both elections. His support base remained loyal, and he continued to draw significant support from key demographic groups.</p>

<p>According to a CNN exit poll, White voters without college degrees have always supported Trump and this was the case in 2024 as well. Latino voters were shifting towards Trump since 2016, but this year, Trump won them in full glory. Votes from women plateaued for Harris as compared to women's votes for Biden and Clinton, even though she aimed to mobilise women through reproductive rights and Trump enjoyed his edge among men.</p>

<p>One notable difference between the two elections was Trump's ability to secure a popular vote majority in 2024. This was a significant departure from 2016, where he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Trump's false statements have remained consistent over the years. His comments on crime rates and poverty have been a subject of debate. In 2016, he highlighted a 17% increase in homicides in the 50 largest US cities, which was the largest increase in 25 years. However, this claim cherry-picked statistics and ignored the overall decline in murders during the Obama administration and preceding decades.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to 2024, Trump claimed that "our crime rate is going up," but according to the FBI's preliminary analysis, violent crime and property crime are near historic lows and decreased in the first quarter. His 2016 statement on Latino poverty was accurate in raw numbers, stating that two million more Latinos were in poverty since Obama took office. However, he omitted the fact that the Latino population grew and their poverty rate actually decreased.</p>

<p>Trump's selective use of statistics has raised concerns. For instance, while food prices have increased by 21% and gas prices by 35% since Biden took office, Trump's claims exaggerate these numbers. He mentioned a 57 per cent increase in the cost of groceries and 60 per cent increase in gas.</p>

<p>The 2024 election also highlighted the ongoing issues with polling accuracy. Despite efforts to improve polling techniques, Trump's support was consistently underestimated during both the years - 2016 and 2024. Hilary Clinton and Kamala Harris had both headed into Election Day asserting that they would defeat Trump.</p>

<p>The Trump voter phenomenon has left many scratching their heads, and two key theories attempt to explain why polling predictions often miss the mark. Firstly, Trump supporters tend to be anti-establishment and wary of authority, which may lead them to systematically refuse pollsters' calls, essentially staying under the radar. This reluctance to engage with pollsters could be due to a sense of mistrust or a desire to keep their opinions private.</p>

<p>Secondly, some hypothesise that the criteria pollsters use to identify "likely" voters inadvertently screens out individuals inclined to support Trump.</p>

<p>The "Bradley effect" or "Wilder effect" offers insight into this phenomenon, where voters conceal their true preferences due to social desirability bias, particularly when faced with questions about racial or sensitive topics.</p>

<p>The similarities between the 2016 and 2024 elections suggest that American politics has become increasingly polarised. The country is largely divided between two equal-sized coalitions, resulting in Groundhog Day-style repeat elections. This polarisation has significant implications for the future of American politics.</p>

<p>After Barack Obama's win in 2008, the country was positive about heading in the right direction, fair, even-handed and unbiased. However, after two disastrous losses of 2016 and 2024, it is hard to shirk off the thought that the losses might just be related to the candidates' identities since one of the common denominators between both the elections are that the Democratic contenders were both women.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Two years after surgery, three patients experienced improved corneal transparency with no serious side effects.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japanese researchers have successfully tested a stem cell transplant in a groundbreaking clinical experiment, significantly improving the vision of three patients with serious corneal damage.</p>

<p>This ground-breaking study, which was recently published in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01764-1/fulltext"><em>The Lancet, </em></a>concentrated on limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD), a crippling disorder that causes significant visual impairment due to scar tissue accumulation on the cornea.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/spacex-launches-24-starlink-satellites-in-back-to-back-space-missions-7020058"><strong>Also Read | SpaceX Launches 24 Starlink Satellites In Back-To-Back Space Missions</strong></a></p>

<p>Scientists created corneal epithelial cell sheets (iCEPS) produced from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) for this treatment. In an attempt to restore vision by repopulating the vital stem cells that preserve the cornea's clarity, these sheets were then placed onto the participants' injured corneas. With encouraging results, the trial-the first of its kind worldwide-marks a critical turning point in regenerative medicine.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/indian-gaming-market-to-hit-rs-76-000-crore-66-gamers-from-small-towns-report-7018797"><strong>Also Read | Indian Gaming Market To Hit Rs 76,000 Crore, 66% Gamers From Small Towns: Report</strong></a></p>

<p>Two years post-surgery, the three patients showed no serious side effects, and each cornea appeared far more transparent than before, signaling a substantial improvement in vision. This success highlights the potential of stem cell therapy for restoring sight in individuals suffering from LSCD, where the natural loss of limbal stem cells hinders the eye's ability to maintain a clear cornea.</p>

<p>With four participants enrolled, this study could pave the way for more extensive trials and ultimately provide new options for patients with similar eye conditions. Researchers hope this innovative approach will offer lasting relief and clarity to those affected by corneal diseases worldwide.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid a rise in global demand for it, India today successfully completed the flight-test of its advanced guided weapon system Pinaka. During the test, the Pinaka system's range, accuracy, consistency and rate of fire for multiple target engagement in a salvo mode were assessed.</p>

<p>"Defence Research and Development Organisation or DRDO has successfully completed the flight-tests of Guided Pinaka Weapon System as part of Provisional Staff Qualitative Requirements (PSQR) validation trials," the Defence Ministry said today, adding that the flight-tests have been conducted in three phases at different field firing ranges.</p>

<p>"Twelve rockets from each production agency from two in-service Pinaka launchers upgraded by the launcher production agencies have been tested," the statement said.</p>

<p>With this, New Delhi's defence manufacturing push under 'Make in India' is gaining momentum. France has recently showed interest in the Pinaka Multi-Barrel Rocket Launcher or MBRL system to bolster its defences.</p>

<h2><strong>THE PINAKA SYSTEM</strong></h2>

<p>The Pinaka system, considered on par with America's HIMARS system, has been India's first major defence export as conflict-hit Armenia had placed the first order. Now France has also shown interest in the advanced rocket system to boost its army's artillery division. In fact, talks are already at a fairly advanced stage, sources familiar with the matter said, adding that France has decided to test the system in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Named after Lord Shiva's divine bow, the Pinaka rocket system was a replacement for the Russian Grad BM-21 rocket launcher for the Indian Army. It was first deployed during the 1999 Kargil War. The Pinaka system had played a pivotal role in destroying Pakistani positions at strategic heights during the war.</p>

<p>The Pinaka rocket system is developed by Armament Research &amp; Development Establishment or ARDE, which comes under the DRDO. The system comprises of a free-flight artillery rocket having a maximum range of 38 km with different types of warheads and fuzes. It comes with a multi-tube launcher vehicle, a replenishment-cum-loader vehicle, a replenishment vehicle, and a command post vehicle.</p>

<p>The multi-barrel rocket system has two pods containing 6 rockets each, capable of firing all 12 rockets in salvo mode within 44 seconds, neutralizing a target area of 700 x 500 meters. For the Indian Army's specific requirement of a free flight rocket with enhanced range, ARDE has successfully developed the Pinaka Mk-II rocket with a 60-km range. The existing launch vehicle and ground systems of Pinaka MBRS is used for the Mk-II as well, with minor modifications for firing this new rocket.</p>

<p>A battery can fire 72 rockets. Each launcher can now be operated independently and rockets can be fired individually or simultaneously in different directions. The launcher may be operated in manual, remote, stand alone, and autonomous modes. Its shoot-and-scoot capabilities also enable it to escape counter battery fire.</p>

<p>The current version of the Pinaka system is a guided one, which means that the rockets have seekers, which are used for precision strikes. Because of it becoming a guided system, it has now been able to increase its range to nearly double of what the first version was. The DRDO is now working on a guided Pinaka system which is capable of ranges greater than 120 km, 150 km, and 200 km to counter China's long-range guided rocket systems.</p>

<h3><strong>GLOBAL INTEREST</strong></h3>

<p>The system is already in service with the Indian Army and deployed both at the LoC with Pakistan and LAC with China. It was also reportedly delivered to Armenia via Iran in 2023 to bolster its defence against Azerbaijan.</p>

<p>France's move to consider buying the Pinaka system is part of the effort to boost defence and strategic ties between the two nations. France is India's second biggest defence supplier after Russia. The recent T AC 295 transport aircraft deal and the Rafael deal are testament to Paris and New Delhi's steadfast defence ties.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Zealand's youngest MP Hana-Rawhiti Kareariki Maipi-Clarke, who shot to viral fame after she performed a haka during her maiden speech in parliament last year, is back in the limelight after once again staging the traditional Maori dance and ripping up a copy of a contentious bill during a House session.</p>

<p>A viral video of the vote on the Treaty Principles Bill shows the 22-year-old Te Pati Maori MP interrupting the session by tearing apart a copy of the legislation before performing a haka. She is then joined by the people in the public gallery, prompting Speaker Gerry Brownlee to briefly suspend the House.</p>

<p>The ACT New Zealand party, a junior partner in the country's centre-right coalition government, last week unveiled the bill, which seeks to change some of the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi - a move opposed by many Maori.</p>

<p>First signed in 1840 between the British Crown and more than 500 Maori chiefs, the Treaty lays down how the two parties agreed to govern. The interpretation of clauses in the document still guides legislation and policy today.</p>

<p>The bill, however, is seen by many Maori and their supporters as undermining the rights of the country's indigenous people, who make up around 20% of the population of 5.3 million.</p>

<p>As the proposed bill passed its first reading, hundreds of people set out on a nine-day march, or hikoi, from New Zealand's north to the national capital of Wellington to mark their protest.</p>

<p>Coalition partners the National Party and New Zealand First are only supporting the legislation through the first of three readings as part of the coalition agreement. Both parties have said they will not support it to become legislation.</p>

<p>"You do not go negate, with a single stroke of a pen, 184 years of debate and discussion, with a bill that I think is very simplistic," Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told reporters before leaving for Peru to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[SpaceX completed a remarkable coast-to-coast double launch on November 14, expanding its Starlink satellite network with 24 new satellites.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX successfully launched its second set of Starlink satellites today (November 14th) in an incredible display of efficiency, according to Space.com. At 8:21 am EST, a Falcon 9 rocket carrying 24 Starlink satellites took out from Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station after a morning launch from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.</p>

<p>This doubleheader of launches shows a new commitment by SpaceX to build up the Starlink satellite constellation. The constellation should then provide high-speed internet to remote and underserved areas around the world.</p>

<p>A weathered booster on its 18th launch, the first stage of the Falcon 9 landed well on the SpaceX droneship "Just Read the Instructions" in the Atlantic Ocean. This reusable booster has played a crucial role in numerous Starlink missions.</p>

<p>These 24 join the constellation, so it will continue to increase in numbers, already having exceeded 6,560 active satellites. Mission control of the global internet by SpaceX is slowly within reach with time.</p>

<p><strong>What is Just Read the Instructions (JRTI)?</strong></p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://space-offshore.com/just-read-the-instructions"><em>space-offshore.com</em></a>, JRTI is a SpaceX autonomous spaceport droneship (ASDS) operating out of Port Canaveral, Florida. The droneship is built upon a modified barge-Marmac 303-and is named after a spacecraft of the same name from the novel 'The Player of Games', from the Culture series of books by author Iain M. Banks.</p>

<p>The JRTI droneship is a modified barge that is outfitted with a large landing platform, station-keeping thrusters, and other equipment to allow SpaceX to land Falcon boosters at sea on high-velocity missions that cannot carry enough fuel to allow for a return-to-launch-site landing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India will follow up a November 10 request to Canada to extradite terrorist Arshdeep Gill, alias <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/arsh-dalla" target="_blank">Arsh Dalla</a>, the de facto chief of the banned <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/khalistan-tiger-force" target="_blank">Khalistan Tiger Force</a>, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday.</p>

<p>In a statement on X, the ministry said a court in Canada's Ontario had listed its extradition request for hearing and that it had sent separate requests to verify financial details as provided last year.</p>

<p>The ministry labelled Dalla a "proclaimed offender" named in over 50 cases of murder, attempt to murder, extortion and terrorist acts, including terror financing. He was designated a 'terrorist' in January last year and is also an accused in multiple cases filed by the National Investigation Agency.</p>

<p>Delhi also believes Dalla has taken over the reins of the Khalistani terror outfit after Hardeep Nijjar was shot dead. The June 2023 killing of Nijjar - a Canadian citizen - has led to a diplomatic row with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declaring - without proof - that "agents" of India were involved in the murder.</p>

<p>Dalla and the associate, Gurjant Singh, were arrested and await bail hearings.</p>

<p>Dalla is from Moga in Punjab.</p>

<p>A known aide of Nijjar, Dalla is credited with orchestrating multiple targeted killings through a grid of sleeper cell assassins. Among the more high-profile victims of his murderous network was Manohar Lal, a member of the Gurmeet Ram Rahim-led Dera Sacha Sauda in November 2020.</p>

<h3><strong>Dalla-Bishnoi Rivalry</strong></h3>

<p>Dalla's criminal network is believed to have a long-standing rivalry with that led by gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, who, incredibly, runs his vast syndicate from a jail in Punjab.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Minnesota is preparing for a potential winter storm next week, with forecast models predicting a shift from rain to snow, especially in central and northern areas as colder air moves in.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Minnesota residents are advised to prepare for a major shift in weather next week, with multiple forecast models predicting a significant rain-to-snow event across the state. Late Monday or early Tuesday is when the system is predicted to arrive, initially bringing rain to a large portion of the state.</p>

<p>However, especially in the central and northern regions, the precipitation is expected to turn to snow as colder air moves in. According to several models, the storm may stall over Lake Superior, causing significant snowfall in these regions.</p>

<p>While the exact track and intensity of the storm are still uncertain, forecasters are urging residents to monitor weather updates closely. It's advisable to prepare for potential travel disruptions, power outages, and hazardous road conditions.</p>

<p><strong>How Frequently Does Snow Fall in Minnesota?</strong></p>

<p>While winter brings cold temperatures to Minnesota, snowfall days are relatively limited. On average, Minneapolis experiences around 15 snow days each year, while Rochester sees about 16 days. Duluth, known for its more intense winter weather, averages around 25 days of snow annually.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://krocnews.com/ixp/715/p/new-forecast-minnesota-snow/"><em>KROC News,</em></a> Minnesota's weather forecast for Thursday, November 21, predicts scattered snow showers in Rochester with highs of 37 fahrenheit, lows of 29 fahrenheit, and up to an inch of snow. Minneapolis expects a mix of rain and snow with a high of 43 fahrenheit and a low of 34 fahrenheit. In Duluth, rain and snow chances increase to 60% by evening, with similar mixed conditions continuing Friday and Saturday, reaching highs near 39 fahrenheit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Political rivals Joe Biden and Donald Trump met at the White House, with the outgoing president promising a smooth transition of power to the president-elect. Their meeting began awkwardly, marking the first time they had come face-to-face since a heated presidential debate in June that led to Biden dropping out of the race.</p>

<p>During their White House encounter, Biden congratulated Trump on his second term and welcomed him back. While the meeting was tense, a viral AI-generated video reimagined the two leaders in a much friendlier scenario.</p>

<p>In the AI video, now trending on social media with over 8.5 million views on X, the two presidents are portrayed enjoying a lighthearted day together. The video opens with a scene in the White House where a somber Biden tells Trump, "This job is not fun." Trump responds, "Missed you in the race," and Biden expresses a desire to leave.</p>

<p></p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has appointed immigration hardliner and close aide, Stephen Miller, as his White House Deputy Chief Of Staff for policy. Confirming Miller's appointment, Vice President-elect JD Vance on Monday, congratulated the incoming Deputy Chief Of Staff for policy on X, calling him "another fantastic pick by the president."</p>

<p>Mr Miller was part of the president-elect's first administration and served as his senior adviser and director of speech-writing at the White House. He was also a central figure behind several of Mr Trump's policies on immigration, including the Muslim travel ban and the 2018 family separation policy.</p>

<h2><strong>Miller's Stance On H-1B Visas</strong></h2>

<p>Known for his extremist rhetoric, Mr Miller was a frequent presence during the president-elect's 2024 campaign, often seen speaking at Mr Trump's rallies. Addressing Mr Trump's infamous Madison Square Garden rally in New York which saw an attendance of nearly 19,500 Americans, Mr Miller told the crowd that "America is for Americans and Americans only" and promised to "restore America to the true Americans".</p>

<p>Last year during an interview with the New York Times, Mr Miller asserted that if Mt Trump was re-elected, his administration would bring policies to restrict legal and illegal immigration. He also talked about plans to detain undocumented immigrants in camps while they await expulsion.</p>

<p>During Trump's first administration, Miller helped in drafting the Cruz-Sessions bill that prohibited international students with a master's or bachelor's degree from working in H-1B status in the US for at least 10 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now in his new role in Trump 2.0, Mr Miller is expected to continue his advocacy for restrictive immigration policies, including limits on H-1B visas. He argues that the H-1B program can lead to American worker displacement and wage suppression.<br />
<br />
<strong>Trump Administration And Immigration&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Trump administration's stance on immigration has often been at odds with economic consensus, which shows that skilled immigrants and international students benefit the US economy. As president, Mr Trump did not enact any measures to increase access to H-1B visas, and his second term will likely be similar. Policies introduced during his presidency also saw a rise in visa denial rates and a narrowing of the definition of "speciality occupation," reducing the positions eligible for H-1B workers.</p>

<p>In 2020, before Mr Trump left office, his administration published a restrictive H-1B rule, which was blocked by a court for violating the Administrative Procedure Act. As per a report by Forbes, the rule included numerous provisions to prevent companies from employing foreign-born scientists and engineers, such as changing who and what positions could qualify for an H-1B speciality occupation.</p>

<p>Taking his previous administration's agenda forward, Mr Trump has also appointed former acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) director Tom Homan as his administration's "Border Czar." In a post on his Truth Social platform, the President-elect said that Homan would oversee the border security of the US along with maritime and aviation security. He also stated that Mr Homan would oversee deportation policies.</p>

<p>Together, Miller and Homan are anticipated to work closely in implementing the Trump administration's restrictive immigration measures.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2024/11/10/past-h-1b-visa-policies-predict-donald-trumps-immigration-policy/" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Forbes</a> report said that if President Joe Biden's administration does not finalize the H-1B "modernizing" rule before he leaves the Oval Office, a new Trump administration could issue the H-1B rule with its priorities rather than those of the Biden team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per the report, the new rule would likely be far more restrictive than the current H-1B regulation or what US Citizenship and Immigration Services proposed in October 2023.</p>

<p><strong>H-1B Request Denial Under Trump Administration</strong></p>

<p>An H-1B visa is often the only way a high-skilled foreign national can work long-term in the US.</p>

<p>In Mr Trump's first term, officials issued memos and policy guidance, which raised the H-1B petition denial rate from 6 per cent in FY 2015 to 24 per cent in FY 2018 and 21 per cent in FY 2019.</p>

<p>As per the Forbes report, after a legal settlement in June 2020, denial rates descended to pre-Trump levels to 4 per cent in FY 2021 and 2.2 per cent in FY 2022.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The model has been pre-trained on more than 11,000 surgical specimens and over 4 million unique microscopic fields of view]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Researchers have developed a tool that uses artificial intelligence to mark any part of the cancerous brain tumour that remains behind after surgery, within 10 seconds, according to a report in Science Daily.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The breakthrough technology, named FastGlioma, was introduced in a research paper titled "Foundation models for fast, label-free detection of glioma infiltration" in Nature Journal, and claims to beat the traditional methods by a wide margin.</p>

<p>FastGlioma has an exceptional average success rate of 92 percent, in detecting and calculating the remaining tumour from an operated patient. The new technology only missed the high-risk residual tumour only 3.8 percent of the time, compared to a 25 percent miss rate in conventional methods.</p>

<p>Such a tool could be a state-of-the-art innovation for the treatment of patients with brain cancer, according to the team of experts behind it from the University of Michigan and the University of California, San Francisco.</p>

<h3><br />
<strong>How it works</strong></h3>

<p>Removal of brain tumours has proven to be a difficult affair for neurosurgeons worldwide. The brain is an extremely sensitive organ, and surgical removal of tumours often leaves behind some cancerous mass. This can cause recurrence of cancer in patients, often leading to loss of life.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
Traditional methods to detect residual tumour tissue in neurosurgery employ MRI imaging during the surgery procedure, combined with use of fluorescent agents- a method that has the resource as well as specificity constraint as it only works on some types of tumours.</p>

<p>FastGlioma fills this gap by providing a quicker, more accessible and precise solution to this critical problem. It is an artificial intelligence system that is referred to as foundation models- similar to AI tool based on GPT-4 and DALL·E 3, trained on big datasets that can be tailored to several types of applications from image classification to generating text.</p>

<p>The model has been pre-trained on more than 11,000 surgical specimens and over 4 million unique microscopic fields of view for FastGlioma. The imaging is done through stimulated Raman histology- a high-resolution optical imaging technique developed at University of Michigan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The technology works faster and more accurately than current standard of care methods for tumour detection and could be generalised to other paediatric and adult brain tumour diagnosis. It could serve as a foundational model for guiding brain tumour surgery." said Todd Hollon, M.D. Neurosurgeon at University of Michigan and co-author of the research paper. &nbsp;</p>

<p>FastGlioma has two modes; one with full resolution images that takes about 100 seconds, and a fast mode that has lower resolution images with just 10 seconds' output.&nbsp;<br />
"This means that we can detect tumour infiltration in seconds with extremely high accuracy, which could inform surgeons if more resection is needed during an operation," added Hollon.</p>

<p>The implications of this technology go beyond brain tumours. Researchers suggest that FastGlioma could be adapted for other types of brain tumours, including paediatric cases like medulloblastoma and ependymoma and non-glioma tumours, such as meningiomas.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than two dozen lawmakers and eminent Indian Americans celebrated Diwali at the Capitol, the first major event at the US Congress after last week's presidential elections.</p>

<p>The annual "Diwali at Capitol Hill" on Tuesday was organised by the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, in association with several other Indian American organisations including the Hindu American Foundation, Sikhs for America, Jain Association of North America, and Art of Living.</p>

<p>President-elect Donald Trump is set to assume office after winning the presidential election last week.</p>

<p>Speaking at the Diwali celebration, Senator Rand Paul said the US is a land of immigrants which attracts the best and brightest around the world, underscoring that they blend to make America a great country.</p>

<p>"I'm a big advocate of more lawful immigration and have many bills to expand that, and I'm going to keep working on that. Have a good Diwali," Paul said.</p>

<p>Greeting Indian Americans on the occasion, Mississippi Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith said she looks forward to the great next four years. "We want to just provide prosperity for this country, for those who want to look for something new, to do something new," she said.</p>

<p>"We just want to encourage you that we want to have a stable atmosphere. We want a great economy. We want a safe place for everybody to be able to raise your family," she said, addressing the gathering which also included India's Ambassador to the US Vinay Mohan Kwatra.</p>

<p>"This is an Indian festival which is embraced and celebrated the world over. Your presence here, the presence of so many congressmen and senators has made it all the most special. It is a reflection of their commitment to the relationship. Your presence there is a reflection of the important role that you at this festival place in the relationship," Kwatra said in his address.</p>

<p>Congressman Shri Thanedar, who was re-elected from the thirteenth Congressional district of Michigan last month, said in his first term he was able to form Hindu, Sikh, Jain and Buddhist caucuses for the first time in Congressional history.</p>

<p>"There's a lot that needs to be done. I'm working with the State Department on the attacks on Hindu temples and making sure our community is protected all across America. I'm also working with the State Department on the atrocities on the Hindus in Bangladesh," Thanedar said.</p>

<p>Congressman Tom Souzzi from New York referred to the recent attacks on Hindu temple in Long Island. "I spoke on the floor of the Congress, and I said that when Indian Americans, Hindu Americans, place their hands like this and say namaste, they are really recognising the divinity and the respect they have for the person in front of them, and we need more of that in our country today," he said.</p>

<p>In his address, Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi said, "You are the fastest-growing ethnic minority in America. You are the most prosperous, the best educated. One out of every seven doctors is a Desi."</p>

<p>"The words of support tonight are coming from members of Congress who greatly appreciate each of you taking time, not just to be at this Diwali event for another beautiful year, but of the year that has been so monumental in the growth and opportunity for so many of you here in the United States of America," Congressman Pete Sessions said in his remarks.</p>

<p>Congressman Dan Meuser recollected the joint address to the Congress by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year and said he did a wonderful job.</p>

<p>"It stayed with me just how well he spoke about the importance of the American Indian relationship, how it needs to improve for economic reasons, and for national security reasons, and an overall peace for our world," he said.</p>

<p>"Our relationship will continue to grow. It's very, very important. We have a new president and a new Senate. We hope to be united, work together, find common ground, and do what's best for the United States, for India, for the world," Meuser said.</p>

<p>Former House Majority Leader Congressman Steny Hoyer applauded the contribution of Indian Americans to the country's progress. "On this Diwali, I come here to thank each and every one of you. America is stronger and better for those of you who came from India and who love America and who serve our fellow citizens," he said.</p>

<p>"We know that our Indian American community is one of our success stories. It is a part of the vibrancy of our incredible economy and so many communities...to the families across America recognising and celebrating Diwali, we salute you tonight," said Congresswoman Haley Stevens.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In staffing his incoming administration, President-elect Donald Trump has so far veered from the conventional to the confounding. But his choices all seem to have one thing in common: A bond with Trump himself.</p>

<p>From his chief of staff to those he's tapped to lead the Justice Department, the Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security, Trump is picking people who have been familiar faces at his campaign rallies, frequent visitors to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida or reliable defenders of him on TV.</p>

<p>It's a sharp contrast from his first go-round in the White House, when Trump, then a neophyte Republican politician, ended up with members on his team with whom he had no prior working relationship and no level of trust.</p>

<p>For Trump 2.0, the president-elect is rewarding his staunchest allies with plum roles. Some have almost no relevant experience for their positions, and a few could face a difficult Senate confirmation process even with a Republican majority.</p>

<p>Trump has tapped Pete Hegseth, a Fox News personality with no administrative experience, to oversee the sprawling Pentagon; nominated Matt Gaetz, a longtime conservative provocateur who lacks a law-enforcement background as attorney general; and asked the governor of rural South Dakota, Kristi Noem, to be the nation's top Homeland Security official.</p>

<p>He also has tasked billionaire Elon Musk and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, Trump rally mainstays, with streamlining the federal bureaucracy although neither has ever worked in government.</p>

<p>The picks suggest that Trump, as is his style, prefers the hammer to scalpel, and wants to show his political base that he is following through on his campaign pledges to deport millions of migrants, investigate his political adversaries and rid the military of "woke" policies on gender and diversity.</p>

<p>"It's noteworthy that the people that he's selected for the most prominent positions tend to be people who are, I would say, good on television, so they're good on the sort of public-facing side of those jobs," said David Lewis, a professor at Vanderbilt University who has written a book on presidential appointments.</p>

<p>"I think there (are) some questions about whether the folks that he has selected have the experience managing large bureaucracies and have all of the substantive expertise they need to do those jobs," Lewis added.</p>

<p>Trump's choices of Hegseth and Gaetz were among those that were met with skepticism and surprise among some leaders in Washington.</p>

<p>Various administration hopefuls have been steadily making their way to Palm Beach to meet with Trump's transition team at Mar-a-Lago and to try to steal a moment with Trump himself.</p>

<p>"Sometimes you just need to catch him on the patio," said one source close to Trump's team.</p>

<p>A Trump donor said the president-elect and his allies have huddled in a room with TVs and pictures of prospective appointees. "I hear Trump is watching a lot of TV clips," the donor said, "looking at: How will these people defend me on TV?"</p>

<p><strong>NO MORE STRANGERS</strong></p>

<p>After Trump's 2016 win, he called upon strangers such as Rex Tillerson, the former CEO of ExxonMobil, to helm the State Department, and Jim Mattis, a retired general, to head up the Pentagon. He named an outsider, Reince Priebus, who was chair of the Republican National Committee, as his chief of staff.</p>

<p>Trump eventually became disillusioned and replaced Tillerson and Mattis, and cycled through four chiefs of staff during his first term.</p>

<p>This time around, he seems determined to avoid similar missteps. Trump has had four years to learn the job of chief executive and better understand what he wants from his appointees.</p>

<p>He quickly named Susie Wiles, his trusted co-campaign manager, as his chief of staff. He chose Tom Homan, who ran the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency during Trump's first term, to be his "border czar" in charge of the mass deportations of migrants that Trump has promised. He tapped John Ratcliffe, who previously served as Trump's director of national intelligence, to now become CIA director.</p>

<p>"In many ways, President Trump was able to run a four-year university in term one that has allowed him to provide training to so many people who are now aligned with his agenda," said Matt Mowers, a former US State Department official and a Republican strategist.</p>

<p>Observers say Trump's approach to appointments has been noticeably more efficient than eight years ago, when he sacked his transition chair, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, over disagreements on personnel.</p>

<p>"It seems to be a much more orderly process and without the chaos of having fired the transition chief and tossing their work," said Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, an expert in presidential staffing at the Brookings Institution.</p>

<p>Trump's latest picks on Wednesday again included loyalists who made the rounds for him on the trail and TV during his successful campaign - and are unlikely to push back against his plans for his second term.</p>

<p>Trump announced US Senator Marco Rubio, a former rival who has deep experience in foreign policy and intelligence issues, as his secretary of state. Rubio has softened some of his stances over the last several years to align more closely with Trump's views.</p>

<p>Trump also selected Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman who grew popular with conservatives for supporting isolationist policies and showing disdain for "wokeness," as his director of national intelligence.</p>

<p>Gabbard has little direct experience with intelligence work. But she made a home for herself on Fox News and other conservative channels, and likely soon will be defending Trump on the air again in her new role.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The fate of millions of immigrants hangs in the balance as President-elect Donald Trump vows to scale back Temporary Protected Status (TPS).]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The fate of millions of immigrants hangs in the balance as President-elect Donald Trump vows to scale back Temporary Protected Status (TPS), a program that allows people from 17 countries, including Haiti, Afghanistan, Sudan, and Lebanon, to stay and work in the US if their homelands are deemed unsafe.</p>

<p>Currently, 7.7 million people are displaced due to political violence and economic turmoil in Venezuela - one of the biggest displacements worldwide. In Haiti and El Salvador, people are facing widespread gang violence, instability and economic hardships.</p>

<p>TPS currently protects over 1 million immigrants from these 17 countries. Designations for El Salvador, Sudan, Ukraine, and Venezuela are set to expire in March and April, respectively.</p>

<p>Established in 1990, TPS initially protected Salvadorans from civil war. Since then, designations have been extended to various countries facing conflicts, natural disasters, or extraordinary conditions. A designation does not guarantee permanent residency in the United States, however, applicants can try to change their status through various other immigration processes.</p>

<p>Trump's plans to stop mass parole and grants of TPS have sparked anxiety among beneficiaries. Vania Andre, editor-in-chief of The Haitian Times, emphasises that Haiti cannot absorb the return of thousands of people, given its existing widespread gang violence. Attorney Ahilan T. Arulanantham warns that stripping employment authorisation from TPS holders could be economically disastrous.</p>

<p>According to AP, Maribel Hidalgo's journey to the United States was nothing short of perilous. She fled Venezuela with her one-year-old son, traversing Panama's Darien Gap and Mexico, only to find solace in the US when the Biden administration granted Venezuelans TPS.</p>

<p>However, with President-elect Donald Trump vowing to scale back TPS, Hidalgo's future hangs in the balance. In October, JD Vance said "We're going to stop doing mass grants of Temporary Protected Status" in an Arizona rally.</p>

<p>"My only hope was TPS. My worry, for example, is that after everything I suffered with my son so that I could make it to this country, that they send me back again", Hidalgo said.</p>

<p>Advocates urge the White House to renew and expand TPS protections, particularly for Nicaraguans fleeing oppression. Maria Bilbao of the American Friends Service Committee calls it a "moral obligation" for the Biden administration to act. Elena, a 46-year-old Nicaraguan living in the US illegally for 25 years, hopes Biden moves quickly, fearing deportation.</p>

<p>Will the Biden administration act to protect them, or will Trump's promises of mass deportations become a harsh reality? Only time will tell.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Khalistani terrorist Arshdeep Dalla, an aide of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, was arrested by cops in Canada after he was injured in a gunfight with unknown shooters last month. He was taken to a hospital with bullet wounds to his right bicep but it led to his arrest when cops searched his car and house and found illegal firearms.</p>

<p>On October 28, Arshdeep Gill and Gurjant Singh were attacked by unknown shooters. Gill was injured and cops arrived at Guelph Hospital and later searched their vehicle and found bullet marks on their Dodge Durango SUV's driver's side and front window. The cops also found two casings on the passenger's seat, suggesting that Gill and Singh also fired back.</p>

<p>Arshdeep claimed that an unknown vehicle was chasing him and accidentally a bullet was fired in his vehicle, the investigating agencies said.</p>

<p>A day later, the cops searched their house and found a Taurus 9mm handgun with a loaded magazine which was inserted into a backpack. They also found a rifle a shotgun and two high-capacity magazines in a gun safe.</p>

<p>One magazine was capable of holding 15 rounds, while the other could hold 35 ammunition in the gun safe.</p>

<p>They were arrested for discharging a "firearm with intent", possession of a prohibited firearm with ammunition, tampering with the serial number of the guns and possession of ammunition and firearm without a license since the barrel length of the gun was 80 mm.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/khalistani-terrorist-arshdeep-dalla-aide-of-hardeep-singh-nijjar-arrested-in-canada-say-sources-6986687">Sources in Indian security agencies said </a>Dalla, 28, &nbsp;lives in Canada's Surrey with his wife. He is allegedly involved in multiple cases of extortion, murder and other terror-linked activities and has cases registered against him under UAPA. A Lookout Circular has been issued against him by the Punjab Police.</p>

<p>In a Facebook post, Dalla had taken responsibility for the murder of an electrician, Paramjeet Singh, from Punjab's Jagraon.</p>

<p>His associates had shot dead Manohar Lal, a Dera Sacha Sauda follower in November 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was also involved in hatching a conspiracy to kidnap and kill Shakti Singh, another Dera Sacha Sauda follower.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-09/s0ltn3ig_trump-modi-afp_625x300_22_September_19.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The question topmost in the minds of our foreign policy makers and commentators is what to expect from US President Donald Trump's second term as regards our interests. Trump's unpredictability is a source of concern to all countries, whether allies, friends or adversaries. However, our experience of Trump's first term gives us confidence that his second presidency will generally see continuing progress in our ties, the foundations of which have been laid in the last couple of decades during the previous Republican and Democratic presidencies.</p>

<p>This would explain Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar's comment that some countries may be nervous about Trump returning to power, but India is not. Some external commentators believe that Trump's re-election has been greeted with enthusiasm in India because they see him as a kindred spirit of Modi, both being right-wing ideological conservatives. This echoes the Modi-bashing narrative promoted in Western progressive, left-wing, human rights, minority rights circles. Modi, no doubt, got along very well personally with Trump, but so he did with Biden, and, before him, with Obama, too. Just as elements of the policies of Biden and Obama were problematic for India, so were aspects of Trump's policies.</p>

<h2><strong>Relief, Not Enthusiasm</strong></h2>

<p>At policymaking levels and amongst discerning commentators, there is no "enthusiasm" as such. There might be a feeling of some relief that the Trump administration would stay away on some issues on which the Democrats have harangued us. On these issues, there was a degree of political synergy between the opposition in India and Democratic circles, to the point of even inviting US interference in our internal affairs. This would still be the undercurrent in India-US ties as the Democratic ecosystem in the media, academia, think tanks, "progressive" Congressional circles, etc, will remain active. But this will not be part of the government narrative as before.</p>

<p>There is a caveat though. The annual reports on human rights, religious freedoms, etc, issued by the US State Department are mandated by the US Congress, and these will contain the usual salvos against India. One can expect that unlike Blinken, who, unprecedentedly, singled out India twice by name while presenting the reports, his successor is unlikely to do so. But we should keep in mind that Christian Evangelists are amongst those who strongly support Trump and could work as a pressure point within the administration on issues relating to Christian "persecution", the conversion issue and restrictions on NGOs in India.</p>

<h2><strong>What The New Appointments Mean For India</strong></h2>

<p>There is much interest globally in the appointments that Trump makes to key positions in his administration. India has reason to be satisfied with his nomination of Marc Rubio to the post of Secretary of State and Mike Waltz as the National Security Adviser. Rubio is a strong supporter of more robust defence, space and technology ties with India. He introduced the US-India Defense Cooperation Act in the Senate in July 2024, which aims to bolster cooperation in these areas with India, besides seeking exemption for it from the CAATSA (Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act) legislation and restricting US assistance to Pakistan. As a China hawk, he also sees India as a counterbalance to China.</p>

<p>Mike Waltz is the Republican Co-Chair of the India Caucus, which means that he has an understanding of India-related issues, has been receptive to India's concerns, has been an advocate of strong US-India ties, and is well-connected to the Indian diaspora. He believes that the US-India partnership was the most important strategic relationship of the 21st century. One can assume that he will, like Jake Sullivan, continue to lead the iCET (Initiative for Critical and Emerging Technologies) from the US side, with our National Security Advisor (NSA), Ajit Doval, as his counterpart. This is important.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both are China hawks, which means that the Quad and the Indo-Pacific Strategy will continue to be strongly backed by the White House and the State Department. Kurt Campbell, earlier in Biden's White House and later appointed as Deputy Secretary of State in the State Department, was a strong proponent of the Quad and the Indo-Pacific strategy. He will most probably leave his post, but both Rubio and Waltz would ensure that this part of the India-US strategic cooperation, which also has the China challenge in view, continues unabated.</p>

<h2><strong>Caution Is Foremost</strong></h2>

<p>India will be hosting the next Quad summit in 2025, which means that Trump should be coming to India very early in his tenure-a bonus because the bureaucracies in both countries will get galvanised to make the visit substantive in content and give a direction to India-US ties also at the bilateral level.</p>

<p>We need to be cautious though in not being pushed, beyond a certain point, into subscribing to the Trump administration's hawkishness on China. Our ties with Beijing will remain a massive challenge to us strategically, even if there has been some positive movement on the border recently. It amounts to some lessening of tensions but not an end to them, as Chinese policies will remain unpredictable. We will need hedging strategies, for which the Quad and the Indo-Pacific strategy are indispensable. We need to keep in mind our stakes in BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) as part of maintaining a balance in our foreign policy and retaining some cards to play to preserve our strategic autonomy.</p>

<h2><strong>Trump, China And Russia</strong></h2>

<p>We will also have to keep in view that there are inherent contradictions in the US policy towards China, and Trump's approach is not free of them. Trump does not want to get involved in wars abroad anymore, which means he will want to use diplomatic and economic tools to deal with China's expansionism and its threat to US global pre-eminence. How much China can and will exploit this contradiction to continue asserting itself in the Western Pacific and beyond, with the economic power at its disposal that gets inevitably translated into political influence, remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Trump's inclination to resolve the Ukraine conflict will potentially ease tensions, benefiting India and the Global South. Whether he succeeds, or, if rebuffed, ups the ante to exert more pressure on Russia, remains to be seen. If a direct dialogue begins with the US and Russia, then the pressure on Modi to act as an intermediary between Russia and Ukraine and find some common ground will end. Zelenskyy's latest 'Victory Plan' to establish peace will also become redundant. Trump and his nominees for the State Department, the NSA and the Pentagon are extremely pro-Israel, and this does not bode well for peace in West Asia. Trump's anti-Iran stance is not reassuring either for the region or for India.</p>

<h2><strong>Economic Pain Points</strong></h2>

<p>On the economic side, we had pressure from Trump during his first term when the US excluded us from the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) and imposed tariffs on our steel and aluminium exports to the US. During his campaign, he has referred to India as a "tariff king" and a 'trade abuser', even as he has spoken very warmly about Modi personally. He has threatened to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese exports to the US and 10-20% tariffs on imports from other countries. Many in Indian economic circles believe that we could handle a 10% tariff, in fact, and with much higher import duties on China, we could even benefit in some areas. There is concern that Trump might tighten up on H1B visas, the stronger controls on technology transfers from the US might affect us too, and Trump's determination to push American corporations to invest in the US and create jobs there might alter the discourse on friend-shoring or resilient supply chains, etc.</p>

<p>The nomination of Robert Lighthiser, the US Trade Representative in Trump's first term and someone India found difficult to deal with, to define US trade policy in the president's second term will be problematic all around. He is truly a trade hawk who wants to use US economic power aggressively to protect the country's interests as he perceives them, to the point of wrecking the World Trade Organization (WTO), if he can.</p>

<h2><strong>Counting On Modi-Trump Rapport</strong></h2>

<p>India has the advantage, even with these difficulties, of a personal rapport between Modi and Trump and political backing prospectively in the State Department and at the level of the National Security Advisor, not to mention in the US Congress, to counter undue trade pressures. Even on the US side, they will have to take the totality of US long-term interests in India to fashion a balanced policy approach.</p>

<p>Finally, we can hope that the approach of the Biden administration on the Nijjar and Pannun affairs will become more discreet rather than one that resorts to unquestioningly supporting Trudeau, talking down at India by demanding satisfaction and accountability, and giving free rein to Pannun to threaten India with terrorism, death threats, etc. Trump has called Trudeau 'weak', 'dishonest' and 'two-faced'. That holds out some hope that Trudeau will become less provocative. One must keep in mind though that as the Pannun case is before courts, information on the proceedings will make news that anti-Indian elements abroad will pick up and which our press will play up.</p>

<p>Interesting times ahead.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is nothing more beautiful than a mother's love and only the mother can go to any length for their children. In a remarkable display of motherly love and courage, a video is doing rounds of the internet in which a mother leopard is seen fighting a lion head-on, to save her two cubs. The incident was recorded inside Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, by Carol and Bob, a couple on an African adventure.</p>

<p>The video shared on October 24, by the YouTube channel “LatestSightings”, details the incident.</p>

<p>Carol and Bob, along with ranger Godliving Shoo, started a Safari ride, early in the morning. Godliving knew of a leopard denning in the area and thought it would be a great time to try and spot her. Before they knew it, the duo spotted the leopard. And her two cubs doubled up as the cherry on top.</p>

<p></p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="400" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WH3mYLRmYgA" title="Leopard Mom Sacrifices Herself To Protect Her Cubs" width="700"></iframe></p>

<p>But something was off.</p>

<p>The leopard was seen standing on the top of a rock, in a state of paranoia.</p>

<p>“The leopard was outside her den when my husband spotted a lioness crouched just a few meters away, watching intently in the same general direction,” recalled Carol. “We initially thought two separate events were unfolding — the leopard and her cubs, and the lioness watching the wildebeest in the distance. But as she crept forward, we realised she was actually focused on the leopards!”, she added.</p>

<p>The lion walked in. And the leopard jumped and went all in, without worrying about her own life. The fierce leopard kicked the lioness and made her jump back, holding her paw like an injured puppy.</p>

<p>The cubs used this time to hide. When the lioness jumped back, the leopard too escaped.</p>

<p>According to the report, the leopard had to move her cubs twice that afternoon. “She did seem to be exhausted but was left with only minor injuries. As for the lioness, she was left with a very sore leg.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump is likely to get a healthy majority in the Senate this time around. However, despite that he may not have the magic 60 seats that would allow him to overcome opposition attempts to delay legislation.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump's Republican Party has won enough seats to retain its control over both chambers of Congress - the House of Representatives and the Senate - cementing its dominant performance in the 2024 United States elections. In Washington DC's political parlance, when a president's party also controls the Congress, it is called "a governing trifecta".</p>

<p>With Republicans cementing their grip on the "Washington trifecta", Mr Trump, after taking charge of the Oval Office, will have much more sweeping authority over the next year to implement his legislative priorities, including major poll promises to enact immigration controls and reduce regulations on Wall Street and the energy industry among others.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/0g874728_donald-trump-afp-_625x300_14_November_24.jpeg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Had he not won majorities in Congress, Mr Trump's resounding victory over Democrat rival Kamala Harris would still have given him significant control over the formation of the federal government and US foreign policy, both of which are likely to see a significant change during his administration. However, with a governing "trifecta", the incoming President will also be able to get easier approvals for his nominees for posts in his administration - something he had struggled with during his first term back in 2017 when internal resistance within the Republican Party was significantly higher.</p>

<h2><strong>How Does US Congress Work?</strong></h2>

<p>The US Congress has a total of 535 members, including 100 representatives in the Senate and 435 in the House of Representatives. Each of the 50 states in the US sends two Senators to the US Senate. However, the state's representation in the House of Representatives is based on its population. For example, a smaller state like Vermont has one representative while large states like California have 53 representatives</p>

<p>The term of members of the House of Representatives is two years and all 435 seats are considered for reelection every even year. This marks a stark contrast with the Senate, the upper chamber of Congress, where senators serve six-year terms. Elections to the Senate are staggered over even years so that only about 1/3 of the Senate is up for reelection during any election.</p>

<p>The single-party control of Congress, which was once common, has become rare and short over the past few decades, with the party in power losing seats when midterm congressional elections are held every two years. Both former President Trump and President Joe Biden enjoyed "trifectas" for their first two years in the White House, but the dynamics changed following midterm polls.</p>

<h3><strong>Does 'Trifecta' Guarantee Absolute Power?</strong></h3>

<p>A 'trifecta' is no guarantee against political infighting. Despite the Biden administration having "trifecta" from 2021 to 2023, internal dissent stymied certain policy priorities, with figures like Arizona's independent Senator Kyrsten Sinema resisting party orthodoxy.</p>

<p>A major obstacle in the way of total control by either party is that it requires a three-fifths majority - or 60 votes out of 100 - to pass bills in the Senate. Therefore, to bypass the filibuster or the tradition of unlimited debate, a party needs a healthy majority in the Senate. Hence, should a party have a simple majority in the Senate, it needs to reach across the aisle to get a bill passed.</p>

<p>As per a report in the New York Times, Mr Trump is likely to get a healthy majority in the Senate this time around. However, despite that, he may not have the magic 60 seats that would allow him to overcome opposition attempts to delay legislation.</p>

<p>Moreover, there are already signs that Donald Trump may not have his way at all times, with his party selecting John Thune as the Senate majority leader despite Rick Scott being reportedly favoured for the post by by Trump.</p>

<p>Though Mr Trump did not officially endorse Scott, the American media is seeing Mr Thune's selection as a sign that some Republican lawmakers are asserting their independence.</p>

<h3><strong>How The "Trifecta" Can Benefit Trump</strong></h3>

<p>All said, if managed astutely, a "trifecta" can open the way for the possibility of significant legislative initiatives. A majority in both chambers of Congress may give Mr Trump an advantage in pushing through his right-wing agenda and big poll promises like the largest deportation of migrants in history, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports, and the rolling back of environmental protections.</p>

<p>As per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/elections/republican-house-trifecta.html" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">NYT</a> report, using legislation to achieve these goals will make them much harder to overturn in the courts, especially with the judicial landscape also in Mr Trump's favour. In his first term, the former President was able to put three conservatives in the Supreme Court - cementing a two-thirds majority for years to come. He also named more than four dozen judges to the federal appeals courts, bending several circuits to a more conservative bent.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>King Charles turned 76 on Thursday, November 14, and he is celebrating his birthday by opening two food hubs, which will distribute large volumes of surplus food to schools and community centres. Treating his birthday as a working day, the British monarch will visit a new food hub in South London. A virtual opening ceremony is being held for the other in Merseyside, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8yqqpl8e0o">BBC</a> reported.</p>

<p>The food distribution hubs are a part of his 'Coronation Food Project' designed to cut down on waste and support charities helping those in need and hungry.</p>

<p>In South London, a 'surplus food festival' is being hosted. At the festival, meals are prepared with food, which would have otherwise gone to waste. According to Buckingham Palace, the hubs are designed to support charities, including the Felix Project and FareShare, to collect food and deliver it to individuals and community groups.</p>

<p>This food comes from multiple places such as supermarkets or the catering industry. Instead of throwing good quality unsold food into waste, it is used to help those in need.</p>

<p>During his visit, King Charles is also scheduled to meet some people who benefited from the initiative.</p>

<p>The Buckingham Palace noted the project, so far, has managed to save an additional 940 tonnes of surplus food, equivalent to more than 2.2 million meal portions.</p>

<p>King Charles continues to be treated for cancer, but he wants to keep focusing on his work as well, aides of the Royal Family said.</p>

<p>Besides this, his birthday is being marked more traditionally with gun salutes at the Tower of London as well as in the capital's parks, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/king-charles-celebrates-76th-birthday-by-opening-food-hubs-2024-11-14/">Reuters</a> reported.</p>

<p>These celebrations come amid a busy week for King Charles, who attended the London premiere of "Gladiator II" on Wednesday night. However, his wife Camilla, recovering from a chest infection, wasn't at the event.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, she attended the Booker Prize awards and said, “I think I'm on the mend - but these things always take a bit of time".</p>]]></content:encoded>

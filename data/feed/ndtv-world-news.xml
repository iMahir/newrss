       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Israeli airstrike on the southern suburbs of Beirut on Tuesday killed a Hezbollah commander who was a leading figure in its rocket division, two security sources in Lebanon said, as fears of a full-fledged war in the Middle East mounted.</p>

<p>The sources identified the commander who was killed as Ibrahim Qubaisi. The attack, in which six people were killed, dealt another blow to the Iran-backed group which has faced a series of setbacks at the hands of Israel over the past week.</p>

<p>The relentless pressure on Hezbollah has increased fears that nearly a year of conflict will explode into another all-out war and destabilise the Middle East, where a conflict between Israel and Hezbollah's ally Hamas is already raging in Gaza.</p>

<p>Israel struck the Hezbollah-controlled area of the Lebanese capital for a second consecutive day after mounting a new wave of airstrikes on targets in Lebanon.</p>

<p>After nearly 12 months of war against the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza on its southern border, Israel is shifting its focus to the northern frontier, where Hezbollah has been firing rockets into Israel in support of Hamas, which is also backed by Iran.</p>

<p>The health ministry gave an initial toll of six dead and 15 wounded in the Beirut strike.</p>

<p>The Israeli military carried out airstrikes against Hezbollah on Monday which Lebanese authorities said killed more than 500 people.</p>

<p>The airstrike hit a building in the usually busy Ghobeiry neighbourhood in Beirut. One of the security sources shared a photo showing damage to the top floor of a five-storey building.</p>

<p>Israel's military chief said earlier that attacks on Hezbollah would be accelerated.</p>

<p>"The situation requires continued, intense action in all arenas," said Military Chief of General Staff Herzi Halevi after holding a security assessment.</p>

<p>Lebanese authorities said 558 people had been killed, including 50 children and 94 women, in Israel's airstrikes on Monday. A further 1,835 were wounded, they said, and tens of thousands more have fled for safety.</p>

<p>The casualty tolls and the charge from the most powerful and advanced military in the Middle East has spread panic in Lebanon, which suffered from devastating destruction when Israel and Hezbollah fought in 2006.</p>

<p>"We are waiting for victory, God willing, because as long as we have a neighbour like Israel, we can't sleep safely," said Beirut resident Hassan Omar.</p>

<p>Afif Ibrahim, a taxi driver from southern Lebanon, was defiant.</p>

<p>"They (Israel) want us (Lebanese) to kneel, but we kneel only to God in our prayers; we bow our heads to no one but God," he said.</p>

<p><strong>GROWING CALLS FOR DIPLOMACY</strong></p>

<p>Calls for diplomacy are growing as the conflict worsens, with UN human rights chief Volker Turk urging all states and actors with influence to avert further escalation in Lebanon.</p>

<p>"I believe that we can still find a path forward to get de-escalation between Israel and across that northern border between Israel and Lebanon and bring about a diplomatic solution that allows people to return to their home," White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told MSNBC.</p>

<p>The fighting has raised fears that the United States, Israel's close ally, and regional power Iran, which has proxies across the Middle East - Hezbollah, Yemen's Houthis and armed groups in Iraq - will be sucked into a wider war.</p>

<p>Hezbollah last week suffered heavy losses when thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by its members exploded in the worst security breach in its history.</p>

<p>The operation was widely attributed to Israel, which has a long history of sophisticated attacks on foreign soil. It has not confirmed or denied responsibility.</p>

<p>Israel's intelligence and technological prowess has given it a strong edge in both Lebanon and Gaza. It has tracked down and assassinated top Hezbollah commanders and Hamas leaders.</p>

<p>But Hezbollah has proven resilient during decades of hostilities with Israel, challenging superior firepower.</p>

<p>The group, which was founded by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in 1982 to counter an Israeli invasion of Lebanon, is a more formidable enemy than Hamas.</p>

<p>Hezbollah used a new rocket, Fadi 3, in an attack on an Israeli army base, the group announced in a message posted on Telegram on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Its media office said on Tuesday that Israel was dropping leaflets with a "very dangerous" barcode on them onto Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley, warning that scanning it by phone would "withdraw all information" from any device.</p>

<p>There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Hezbollah's media office did not say if anything else was written on the flyers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fungal infections are evolving and becoming resistant to the medicines used to treat them, causing what some researchers are calling a "silent pandemic" that needs to be addressed urgently. According to molecular biologist Norman van Rhijn from the University of Manchester in the UK, the threat of fungal pathogens and antifungal resistance is being overlooked in global health discussions. Without urgent attention and action, some particularly nasty fungal infections, which already infect 6.5 million a year and claim 3.8 million lives annually, could become even more dangerous, he warned, as per <em>Science Alert</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The biologist, along with an international group of scientists, is urging government, research communities and the pharmaceutical industry to "look beyond just bacteria". Fungal infections are left out of too many initiatives to tackle antimicrobial resistance, the researchers said, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.sciencealert.com/deadly-fungal-infections-causing-a-silent-pandemic-scientists-warn" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Science Alert</em></a>. Without urgent attention, fungal infections could become even more dangerous, they said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The disproportionate focus on bacteria is concerning because many drug resistance problems over the past decades were the result of invasive fungal diseases, which are largely under-recognized by the community and governments alike," Norman van Rhijn and his colleagues, who hail from institutions in China, the Netherlands, Austria, Australia, Spain, the UK, Brazil, the US, India, Turkiye, and Uganda, said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fungal diseases such as Aspergillus fumigatus, which affects the lungs, and Candida, which causes yeast infections, are considered the most dangerous. People with weakened immune systems and older adults are at the highest risk, per the outlet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scientists explained that compared to bacteria and viruses, fungi are more complicated organisms, which makes it harder and more expensive for scientists to develop a medicine that kills the cells of fungi without damaging other important cells in the body. Currently, there are only four classes of antifungal drugs, and resistance to them is increasing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"To treat deep or invasive fungal infections, only four systemic antifungal classes are available and resistance is now the rule rather than the exception for those currently available classes," the researchers wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The team said that it is concerned that agricultural practices are contributing to the problem. They explained that fungicides used in farming can cause cross-resistance in the fungi that affect humans. They suggest that the world needs a balance between protecting crops and treating fungal infections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Antifungal protection is required for food security. The question is, how do we balance food security with the ability to treat current and future resistant fungal pathogens?" the researcher wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The team recommends a global agreement to limit certain antifungal drugs to specific purposes, as well as collaborative regulations to balance food security with health.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Telegram can disclose users' data upon reasonable requests from authorities, the encrypted messaging service's co-founder Pavel Durov said on his Telegram channel.</p>

<p>"We've made it clear that the IP addresses and phone numbers of those who violate our rules can be disclosed to relevant authorities in response to valid legal requests," Pavel Durov said on Monday, specifying that the messenger has updated its terms of service and privacy policy, bringing them to uniformity across the world, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Such changes were introduced to "further deter criminals from abusing Telegram Search," he noted.</p>

<p>Pavel Durov also pointed out that some users were abusing Telegram's search function to sell illegal goods. However, the team of the platform has removed all problematic content from searches in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Pavel Durov, a native of Russia, was detained in Paris last month and later released on a $5.6 million bail for charges including failing to act against Telegram users involved in cyberbullying, sharing pedophilic content and glorifying terrorism. He was placed under judicial supervision and banned from leaving France.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[This groundbreaking technology, expected to be operational by 2030, will be a significant step forward in AI development and scientific research.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan is building a super-fast computer, the first of its kind, that will be 1,000 times faster than any computer we have now. It will be ready to use in 2030 and could cost over $780 million to make. This new computer will help Japan stay ahead in developing artificial intelligence (AI).</p>

<p>According to Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT), development of a successor to the country's flagship supercomputer, Fugaku, will begin in 2025. The supercomputer could reach speeds on a zetaFLOPS scale, which has never been achieved before.</p>

<p>According to<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/japan-to-start-building-1st-zeta-class-supercomputer-in-2025-1000-times-more-powerful-than-todays-fastest-machines"><em> Live Science,</em></a> "Floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) is used to measure how fast computers can solve problems-where one floating-point operation is a single calculation. A supercomputer with a speed of 1 zetaFLOPS could make one sextillion (1 followed by 21 zeros) calculations per second. Today's most powerful supercomputers have only just broken the exaFLOPS barrier, meaning they can make just over one quintillion (1 followed by 18 zeros) calculations per second."</p>

<p>The<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOSG215U40R20C24A8000000/?s=31"> Japanese news site Nikkei</a> stated in a translated article that the decision to create such a powerful machine was taken "in order to keep up with the development of scientific research using artificial intelligence."</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-in-japan-are-about-to-build-a-supercomputer-like-no-other"><em>ScienceAlert,</em></a> supercomputers have proved consistently useful to scientists, helping researchers simulate black holes, discover new materials, model Earth's future, and probe the foundations of mathematics. As these machines continue to get more powerful, we should see their capabilities expand too.Unlike quantum computers, supercomputers aren't too different from the desktops and laptops we all use every day; they're just scaled up to an incredibly high level. They're still based on processors, memory, and storage, but taken to extremes.</p>

<p>An upgraded zetta-class machine could be trained on more data at a faster speed and produce results that are more detailed, more accurate, and more comprehensive. If all goes well, six years from now, there should be a new supercomputer standard.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a stunning breakthrough, South Korean police have solved a shocking cold case from 2008, arresting a man in his 50s for murdering his live-in girlfriend and encasing her body in cement on their apartment balcony. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2024/09/113_382939.html"><i>Korea Times</i></a>, the gruesome crime went undetected for years, filed as a missing person case until a chance discovery last month. A construction worker repairing a leak on the rooftop balcony stumbled upon a travel suitcase encased in concrete and bricks, containing the partially preserved remains of the victim, identified as B.</p>

<p>Initial investigations in 2011 suspected the boyfriend identified as A, but lack of evidence and leads led to a dead end. However, advances in forensic technology and a thorough re-examination of the case led police to re-question the boyfriend.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During interrogation, the boyfriend confessed to killing his girlfriend --who was in her 30s at the time--during a heated argument over a romantic issue in October 2008. He admitted to striking her on the head and face with a blunt object. He then placed her dead body into a suitcase, which he buried under a layer of bricks and cement on his balcony.</p>

<p>Fingerprint analysis identified the partially preserved body, and an autopsy revealed blunt force trauma to the head as the cause of death. Police promptly identified the boyfriend as the prime suspect and arrested him on September 19 in Yangsan.</p>

<p>Additional revelations exposed how the crime remained hidden for so long. The boyfriend deceived B's family and the landlord, claiming she had left after an argument. Notably, her family had lost contact with her and were misled about her whereabouts. When they travelled to Geoje in search of their daughter, they were informed by Mr A that the couple had separated, and B had departed the city.</p>

<p>He continued occupying the apartment until 2017 when he was imprisoned for drug charges.&nbsp;The landlord, unaware of the gruesome secret, used the room as storage space, leaving the concrete-encased body undisturbed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The boyfriend faces charges related to his drug use, as the statute of limitations for concealing a corpse has expired. Prosecutors will review the case once the investigation is complete.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">For almost a year, Israel and Hezbollah have engaged in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/11/mapping-11-months-if-israel-lebanon-cross-border-attacks">increasingly provocative cross-border skirmishes</a> as onlookers warn that this escalating war of attrition could land the region in an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/09/22/israel-and-hizbullah-creep-closer-to-all-out-war">all-out conflict</a>. The past few days have made that devastating scenario closer to a reality.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>First came Israel's <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/18/pager-and-walkie-talkie-attacks-on-hezbollah-were-audacious-and-carefully-planned">pager and walkie-talkie attack</a>, an unprecedented assault on Hezbollah's communications that injured thousands of the organization's operatives. It was followed by <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y9wyy9pr2o">the assassination of Ibrahim Aqil</a>, a key Hezbollah leader, who died in an airstrike that also killed other senior commanders of the militant group, as well as some civilians. Hezbollah responded by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/22/world/gaza-israel-hamas-hezbollah">extending the geographical range</a> of its rockets fired at Israel, targeting both military facilities and civilian neighbourhoods across northern Israel. Israel then launched a fresh air assault in which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/23/world/gaza-israel-hamas-hezbollah">more than 270 people were killed</a>, according to Lebanese health authorities, leading also to the flight of thousands of residents from South Lebanon to the north of the country.</p>

<p>As a <a href="https://kroc.nd.edu/faculty-and-staff/asher-kaufman/">scholar of Lebanon and Israel</a>, I have followed the dynamics of this war of attrition since Oct. 8, 2023, the day after Hamas executed an unprecedented and deadly attack on Israel, which responded by bombarding the Gaza Strip. Hezbollah then began firing rockets into northern Israel in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>Despite the high rhetoric and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/22/world/gaza-israel-hamas-hezbollah">mutual threats</a> <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/doctrine-hezbollah">of destruction</a>, until recent days neither Israel nor Hezbollah, nor the latter's sponsor Iran, have shown an interest in a full-scale war. All parties surely know the likely destructive consequences of such an eventuality for themselves: Israel has the military power to devastate Beirut and other parts of Lebanon as it did in Gaza, while even a weakened Hezbollah could fire thousands of missiles at Israeli strategic sites, from the airport to central Tel Aviv, water supply lines and electricity hubs, and offshore gas rigs.</p>

<p>So instead, they have exchanged fire and blows along their shared boundary, with somewhat agreed-upon red lines concerning the geographical scope of attacks and efforts not to intentionally target civilians.</p>

<p>But Israel's recent attacks in Lebanon may have turned the page of this war of attrition into a new and far more acute situation, putting the region on the brink of a full war. Such a war would wreak havoc in Lebanon and Israel, and might also <a href="https://theconversation.com/escalating-israel-hezbollah-clashes-threaten-to-spark-regional-war-and-force-us-into-conflict-with-iran-232803">drag Iran and the United States</a> into direct confrontation. In doing so, it would also <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/10/26/1208456496/iran-hamas-axis-of-resistance-hezbollah-israel">fulfill the apparent</a> of the Hamas gunmen who <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/haaretz-explains/2023-10-19/ty-article-magazine/israels-dead-the-names-of-those-killed-in-hamas-massacres-and-the-israel-hamas-war/0000018b-325c-d450-a3af-7b5cf0210000">murdered around 1,200 Israelis</a> on Oct. 7 in the hope that a heavy-handed Israeli response would draw in more groups across the region.</p>

<h3><strong>A dangerous ‘new phase'</strong></h3>

<p>Hezbollah's secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah, has insisted throughout the near-yearlong hostilities that his organization would hold its fire only if a cease-fire agreement is reached between Israel and Hamas. In recent weeks, however, Israel has taken the conflict in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>The country's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/israel-defense-minister-yoav-gallant-new-phase-war-hezbollah/">described the coordinated attacks</a> on Hezbolah targets as a “new phase,” adding that the “center of gravity” in the war was moving north into Lebanon. The Israeli government has added the “return of the residents of the north securely to their homes” as <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglkkrj94ldo">an additional war goal</a>.</p>

<p>The assault on Hezbollah's communications system targeted the organization's operatives but <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/09/18/lebanon-exploding-pagers-harmed-hezbollah-civilians">hit many civilian bystanders</a>, leaving Lebanese in shock, trauma, anger and desperation.</p>

<p>It demonstrated Israel's tactical military advantage over Hezbollah. The unprecedented penetration into the heart of the organization's command and rank-and-file structures has never been seen before in any conflict or war globally. It struck Hezbollah in its most vulnerable places and even exposed its coordination with Iran – one of the injured persons from the pager explosions <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-ambassador-lebanon-injured-by-pager-explosion-2024-09-17/">was the Iranian ambassador</a> in Lebanon.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-mideast-tensions-attack-8ec89de2b117b52e2c09b19155e35d13">killing of Akil</a> two days later was another signal that the Israeli government had now decided to try to change the rules of this risky game of reprisals and counter-reprisals. It is clear that rather than the uneasy status quo that defined this war of attrition for nearly a year, Israel's intent is now to pressure Hezbollah to concede.</p>

<h3><strong>Getting out of control</strong></h3>

<p>Nasrallah delivered a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/19/middleeast/lebanon-hezbollah-hassan-nasrallah-speech-analysis-intl-latam/index.html">gloomy and defiant speech</a> in the aftermath of the pager attack. While acknowledging that Hezbollah was severely undermined by this operation, he defined the Israeli attack as a continuation of “multiple other massacres perpetrated by the enemy over decades.”</p>

<p>By doing so, he framed it within a popular historical narrative among many Lebanese and Palestinians who <a href="https://english.ahram.org.eg/News/510520.aspx">regard Israel as a criminal entity</a> that regularly carries out massacres against innocent civilians.</p>

<p>Nasrallah also insisted that his commitment to supporting Hamas in Gaza remains unwavering.</p>

<p>While stating that Israeli actions have “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79n1v4d203o">crossed all red lines</a>” and could amount to a declaration of war, Nasrallah also reiterated a point he had made in previous peaks of this ongoing conflict: that retribution is coming, the only question being of timing and scale. By doing so, Nasrallah hinted that he may still not be interested in a full war.</p>

<p>Israel, on the other hand, appears less circumspect. After almost a full year of contained tension with Hezbollah, Israel's leaders appear willing to risk an escalation that might get out of control.</p>

<p>It is hard to determine what the strategy behind Israel's actions is: Since Oct. 7; as the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/03/18/israel-gaza-biden-netanyahu-rafah/">Biden administration has noted</a>, Israel has not displayed a coherent strategy with clear political goals.</p>

<p>Rather, critics of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggest that he is mainly motivated by his own political survival and the <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-israels-netanyahu-survives-in-his-job-237382">retention of power</a> as the head of state, tying Israel's interests to his own.</p>

<h3><strong>Uniting the ‘axis of resistance'</strong></h3>

<p>So where does this leave Nasrallah as he weighs Hezbollah's response, surely in consultation with Iran? After such devastating blows to Nasrallah's organization, it is hard to think that Hezbollah would be willing to scale down, stop its cross-border attacks and retreat away from the Israeli border, or give up its commitment to support Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>On the other hand, opting for a full-scale war, after spending a year avoiding it, is fraught with risk – both Nasrallah and his sponsors in Tehran know well the high costs of such a war for Hezbollah, Lebanon and potentially also for Iran.</p>

<p>If Hezbollah went to war now against Israel, it would embark on its most consequential move since its <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67307858">foundation in 1982</a>. But it would do so with crippled communications systems and without much of its leadership – some of whom had worked for decades side by side with Nasrallah, building with him the military capacity of the organization.</p>

<p>In some respects, Israelis under Netanyahu's leadership, and Lebanese in a country increasingly held hostage by Hezbollah's interests, face similar predicaments: Their well-being is being sacrificed for other priorities.</p>

<p>Netanayhu's <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-hamas-war-hezbollah-lebanon-attacks-haifa-west-bank-al-jazeera-rcna172130">recent statements</a> about concern for Israeli citizens in the north sound hollow after 11 months of pursuing policies that put them more in danger, as well as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-06-24-2024-f5de2ed8288ac3cdb02c4e9e2fbaeda1">opposing a Gaza cease-fire deal</a> that would also end hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel.</p>

<p>In Lebanon, Hezbollah has dragged the country into this war <a href="https://mondediplo.com/2024/08/02lebanon">against the will of most Lebanese</a> – a decision that has led to significant devastation in parts of a country already suffering extreme political and economic duress.</p>

<p>Nasrallah's speech described Hezbollah's predicament as that of all Lebanon – while sending a veiled threat that dissent would not be tolerated. Many Lebanese are undoubtedly sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and resent Israel's war in Gaza. But at the same time, they may balk at the idea that their own well-being has to be sacrificed in the process.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Yahya Sinwar, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/17/nx-s1-5075313/who-is-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar">Hamas leader and mastermind</a> behind the Oct. 7 massacre, may well be looking on at the unfolding events between Israel and Hezbollah with satisfaction. His plan was designed to trigger the unification of all fronts of the so-called “axis of resistance,” which includes the Houthis in Yemen as well as Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups with the hope for a regional war against Israel.</p>

<p>A year later, we are closer than ever to that scenario.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TikTok, a popular video app, has kicked off accounts belonging to Russian state-owned media outlets RT and Sputnik. They said these accounts were trying to secretly influence people, which is against their rules. This means that users can no longer see content from these Russian news organisations on TikTok.</p>

<p>In its official announcement on its<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/en-us/us-election-hub"> website</a>, TikTok has said that it is "removing accounts associated with Rossiya Segodnya and TV-Novosti for engaging in covert influence operations on TikTok, which violates our Community Guidelines. Previously, these accounts were restricted in the EU and UK."</p>

<p>TV-Novosti and Rossiya Segodnya are the parent organisations of the RT television network and the Russian news agency Sputnik.</p>

<p>"Globally, under our state-affiliated media policy, their content was also ineligible for the For You feed to limit attempts to influence foreign audiences on topics of global events and affairs, and their accounts were labelled as state-controlled media to provide important context about the source of the content. The removed accounts will be reported in our September Covert Influence Operations report," the statement mentioned.</p>

<p>This is not the first time when the RT and other Russian media outlets have been banned from any social media platforms. A few days ago, social media giant Meta, the company that owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and Whatsapp, announced on September 16 that it is banning Russian media outlet RT, days after the Biden administration accused RT of acting as an arm of Moscow's spy agencies.</p>

<p>"After careful consideration, we expanded our ongoing enforcement against Russian state media outlets. Rossiya Segodnya, RT, and other related entities are now banned from our apps globally for foreign interference activity," a Meta spokesperson said in a statement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just as individual humans handle stress differently, so do corals. Even coral colonies of the same species, growing side by side, vary in their tolerance to pressures such as heatwaves.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01649-4">research published today</a>, we discovered surprising new evidence of variable heat tolerance in corals. As the world's oceans warm, these differences are important.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the world's <a href="https://icriforum.org/4gbe/">fourth global mass bleaching event</a> was declared. The Great Barrier Reef has suffered <a href="https://www2.gbrmpa.gov.au/learn/reef-health/reef-health-updates#:%7E:text=In%20March%202024%2C%20the%20fifth,record%20levels%20of%20heat%20stress.">five mass bleachings</a> since 2016 – most recently this past summer. The declarations followed the world's <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67861954">warmest year on record</a>.</p>

<p>To keep the world's coral reefs healthy and functioning, global carbon emissions must be <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1674">dramatically curbed</a> to reduce the rate of ocean warming. As humanity works towards that goal, interventions may buy time for corals to survive in their warming environments.</p>

<h3><strong>What we did</strong></h3>

<p>The heat tolerance of corals can be measured by analysing their responses to elevated water temperatures. Our research involved measuring the bleaching thresholds of more than 500 colonies of the tabular coral, <em>Acropora hyacinthus</em>.</p>

<p><em>Acropora hyacinthus</em> is a common coral that forms “tables” of tiny branchlets. This species is <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/conl.12817">both</a> ecologically important and highly vulnerable to heat waves, making it a prime candidate for conservation.</p>

<p>The characteristic colour of coral is provided by algae living inside its tissue. The algae also provide most of the coral's nutrition. When water temperatures get too high for too long, the coral expels the algae, causing it to bleach and starve.</p>

<p>While at sea, we visited 17 reefs to scuba dive and search for <em>Acropora hyacinthus</em>. We then brought samples of these corals on board a research vessel to conduct experiments.</p>

<p>Our specially designed portable experiment system contained 12 tanks set to four different temperatures. Coral fragments were placed in each tank and subjected to short-term heat stress at different temperatures.</p>

<p>Afterwards, we measured the amount of pigment left in the coral fragments, which directly aligns with the amount of algae left in the coral's cells.</p>

<p>We then determined each coral's bleaching thresholds - in other words, the temperature at which the coral's pigmentation drops to 50% of its healthy level. This allowed us to understand how much variation exists and where the most heat-tolerant colonies live.</p>

<p>So what did we find? Under our experiments, the amount of pigment retained under high temperatures varied from 3% to 95%. This means at high temperatures, some coral colonies completely bleached while others seemed barely affected.</p>

<p>Of the 17 reefs we studied, 12 contained colonies with bleaching thresholds in the top 25%. This means heat-tolerant corals could be found at most of the reefs we sampled.</p>

<h3><strong>Nature versus nurture</strong></h3>

<p>Corals handle stress differently for two reasons: nature and nurture.</p>

<p>Each coral has a unique “nature” or genetic makeup that can affect its heat tolerance. Our results suggest corals found across the entire Great Barrier Reef may hold unique genetic resources that are important for recovery and adaptation.</p>

<p>However, aspects of the marine environment may nurture, or hinder, a coral's heat stress response. These include water temperatures, nutrient conditions, and the symbiotic algae living inside coral tissue.</p>

<p>We found corals living in warmer regions, such as the northern Great Barrier Reef, can handle higher water temperatures. However, because the water is so warm in these areas, the corals are already pushed close to their temperature limits.</p>

<p>Corals in the southern Great Barrier Reef cannot handle temperatures as high as their northern neighbours. Our findings suggest these corals can tolerate more warming above their local temperatures than corals to the north.</p>

<p>These tolerance patterns may affect which corals survive marine heat waves.</p>

<h3><strong>Giving our reefs a future</strong></h3>

<p>Our findings have potentially important implications for the ability of corals to adapt to warmer seas under climate change.</p>

<p>The results may also inform reef restoration and conservation efforts. For example, heat-tolerant parent corals could be <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abg6070">selectively bred</a> to produce offspring better suited to warmer waters.</p>

<p>The success of such programs depends on the extent to which a coral's genetic makeup controls its tolerance to heat. So, the next step in this research is investigating these genetic differences.</p>

<p>Selective breeding trials are already <a href="https://gbrrestoration.org/">underway</a>, using the most heat-tolerant corals identified in this study.</p>

<p>When it comes to protecting our coral reefs, reducing greenhouse gas emissions is imperative. However, interventions such as selective breeding may be useful supplements to give coral reefs the best future possible.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <description><![CDATA[Yoga Nidra practice causes many changes in brain activity, including in areas involved in regulating emotions, mind wandering, and sleep.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The conscious sleep practice known as 'Yoga Nidra' has long fascinated people with its promise of improving mental and physical health. Now, Indian researchers have explored these effects by scanning brains with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology to understand its value better. Researchers from IIT Delhi, AIIMS Delhi, and Mahajan Imaging Delhi have conducted this study, which was published in the international journal Scientific Reports, exploring the neural mechanisms underlying 'Yoga Nidra'. The study shows how 'Yoga Nidra' practice brings deep relaxation and increased awareness. It also shows that more significant brain changes occur during 'Yoga Nidra' practice in individuals with greater experience in yoga/meditation.</p>

<p>According to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://home.iitd.ac.in/show.php?id=56&amp;in_sections=Research">release</a> by the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, the study, titled <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-63765-7"><em>"Functional connectivity changes in meditators and novices during 'Yoga Nidra' practice,"</em></a> included two groups: 30 meditators (householders with an average of 3000 hours of experience in meditation and/or yogic practices) and 31 matched novice controls. The study found that the Default Mode Network behaves differently (less connected) in experienced meditators compared to novices. This difference in brain communication patterns helps us understand how 'Yoga Nidra' modulates our brain functions, promoting a state of deep relaxation while staying aware.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://home.iitd.ac.in/show.php?id=56&amp;in_sections=Research">The study </a>found a strong link between the amount of meditation and yoga practice participants had and the reduction in DMN connectivity during 'Yoga Nidra'. In other words, the more hours participants spent practicing meditation and yoga, the more noticeable the changes in their brain activity during 'Yoga Nidra'. These results could potentially indicate that experienced meditators have reduced mind-wandering as compared to novices, leading to changes in the DMN connectivity.</p>

<p>The researchers behind this study say 'Yoga Nidra' (YN) practice, a meditative technique originating from the ancient Indian tradition, has garnered global attention for its potential to improve psychological well-being and health. Despite the growing interest in its clinical applications, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying neural correlates of YN remains largely unexplored.</p>

<p>"Literally translated as "Yogic Sleep Practice," 'Yoga Nidra' practice is typically attempted in <em>Shavasana</em>, a supine position resembling the stillness of a corpse, which contrasts it from other conventional meditation practices that require a seated, upright posture, thus making it suitable for MRI-based scanning approaches," the study authors said.</p>

<p>As the researchers involved in this project have found, "Yoga Nidra practice employs audio-guided instructions that systematically guide the awareness of the participant to different parts of the body, breathing, or mantras that aim to induce a deeply relaxed state, mirroring the serenity experienced during deep sleep but with conscious awareness in contrast to the self-regulated focus typically associated with focused attention styles of meditations."</p>

<p>The practitioner remains in a state of light withdrawal of the five senses (pratyahara) with four of their senses internalised and only the hearing still connects to the instructions. The exceptional allure of this technique stems not merely from the deep relaxation and mindful awareness it provides but also as a method to progressively master entering the most profound states of meditation (samadhi).</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/492-dead-in-israeli-strikes-on-hezbollah-strongholds-in-lebanon-6634643 ">Israeli airstrikes</a> on Monday killed at 492, including 35 children, in Lebanon, marking the deadliest attack on the country in nearly two decades. This came just days after thousands of pagers, still used in the country, exploded and killed at least 32 people and injured scores of others. Lebanon claimed Israel was behind those explosions as well.</p>

<p>Tensions between Israel and militant-group Hezbollah have escalated on unprecedented levels in the last year after Hamas' October 7 attack. Even though Hezbollah said it had nothing to do with the attack on Southern Israel, it has continued to support the militant group in Gaza where Israeli airstrikes have killed over 40,000 Palestinians and displaced nearly the entire population. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The shadow war</strong></p>

<p>The shadow war between Israeli intelligence agencies and Hezbollah goes back over 40 years. In the early 1980s, Israel invaded Lebanon to uproot the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). While Israel achieved an initial victory by forcing the PLO to withdraw from Beirut, a disastrous event in November 1982 marked the beginning of Israel's ongoing struggle against Hezbollah.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In one of the first major blows, a massive explosion destroyed the headquarters of Israel's internal intelligence service, Shin Bet, in the town of Tyre, killing 91 people. It was revealed to be one of the first suicide car bombings, orchestrated by militant Shia Islamists who would later go on to form Hezbollah.</p>

<p><strong>Hezbollah</strong></p>

<p>Founded in 1983 with Iranian backing, Hezbollah quickly became one of Israel's most formidable enemies. The organisation, adept at both guerilla warfare and covert operations, continued its efforts to destabilise Israeli targets both within and outside Lebanon. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Hezbollah conducted numerous attacks, including the bombings of the US and French military barracks in Beirut.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hezbollah managed to fund its operations through a vast network of supporters, including in South America, which emerged as a key aspect of the shadow war. The organisation's involvement in both legal and illegal activities, such as drug trafficking and money laundering, enabled it to amass significant resources, which Israel struggled to disrupt.<br />
<br />
A prime example of Hezbollah's global reach came in the early 1990s when following the assassination of Hezbollah leader Abbas al-Musawi by Israeli forces, the militant group retaliated by bombing the Israeli embassy and a Jewish community centre in Argentina's Buenos Aires, killing over 100 people.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Spy Ops</strong></p>

<p>However, Israel's spy agency Mossad also remained relentless. Mossad, in a series of high-profile assassinations, targeted senior Hezbollah and Iranian operatives involved in planning attacks against Israel.</p>

<p>The elusive Hezbollah military commander, Imad Mughniyeh, was a particular target of Israeli intelligence. Mughniyeh, credited with masterminding several high-profile attacks, including the 1983 bombings in Lebanon, evaded capture for decades. It wasn't until 2008 that Israeli forces, along with the CIA, succeeded in killing Mughniyeh with a car bomb in Damascus.</p>

<p>Hezbollah retaliated with numerous attempts to target Israeli embassies and civilians, including the 2012 suicide bus bombing in Bulgaria that killed five Israelis.</p>

<p>This year, in July 2024, Israel successfully eliminated two high-ranking Hezbollah officials, Fuad Shukr and Ibrahim Aqil. They were involved in the 1980s attacks on Israeli forces in Lebanon.</p>

<p>The shadow war has not been limited to conventional or even guerilla tactics. One of the most infamous attacks came in the form of the Stuxnet computer virus, a joint Israeli-American operation that targeted Iran's nuclear facilities in 2010. This cyberattack, which destroyed centrifuges at Iran's Natanz facility, marked the first known instance of a cyber operation causing physical damage.</p>

<p>Most recently, Hezbollah and Israel have engaged in a new type of high-tech warfare. In September 2024, Hezbollah acknowledged that a series of attacks involving exploding pagers and walkie-talkies had inflicted severe damage on the group. The operations bore the hallmarks of Mossad even though Israel has not officially claimed responsibility.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Sam Altman imagines a future where AI improves various aspects of life, including personal AI teams that assist with everyday tasks.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At a time when the global artificial intelligence revolution is already reshaping the world as it is redefining and revolutionising industries, economies, and even daily life sooner than expected, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has said that he believes that the arrival of superintelligence is just a few thousand days away.</p>

<p>In a recent blog post, titled <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://ia.samaltman.com/"><em>'The Intelligence Age',</em></a> the creator of the biggest generative AI tool ChatGPT, Mr Altman, said that, "It is possible that we will have superintelligence in a few thousand days! It may take longer, but I'm confident we'll get there."</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/openai-ceo-sam-altman-reveals-his-top-strategy-for-life-without-regrets-put-a-huge-premium-on-it-6627724"><strong>Also Read | OpenAI CEO Sam Altman Reveals His Top Strategy For Life Without Regrets: "Put A Huge Premium On It"</strong></a></p>

<p>"In the next couple of decades, we will be able to do things that would have seemed like magic to our grandparents. This phenomenon is not new, but it will be newly accelerated. People have become dramatically more capable over time; we can already accomplish things now that our predecessors would have believed to be impossible," he wrote.</p>

<p>Talking about the beginning of a new age in human life, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://ia.samaltman.com/">Mr Altman said</a>, "Technology brought us from the Stone Age to the Agricultural Age and then to the Industrial Age. From here, the path to the intelligence age is paved with computation, energy, and human will."</p>

<p>The biggest question that AI has raised till now is, "Will AI replace human jobs?" And in his blog, Mr Altman tried to address this issue, saying that "many of the jobs we do today would have looked like trifling wastes of time to people a few hundred years ago, but nobody is looking back at the past, wishing they were a lamplighter. If a lamplighter could see the world today, he would think the prosperity all around him was unimaginable. And if we could fast-forward a hundred years from today, the prosperity all around us would feel just as unimaginable."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk offered effusive praise for Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in brief remarks at an awards ceremony in New York, the latest sign of cosiness between a billionaire who's trying to get Donald Trump elected and a European leader at odds with her Group of Seven allies.</p>

<p>Musk, bestowing an Atlantic Council Global Citizen Award on Meloni, said it was an honour to present the accolade to "someone who is even more beautiful on the inside than she was on the outside."</p>

<p>"She's also someone who is authentic, honest, truthful - and that can't always be said about politicians," Musk added.</p>

<p>The remarks were in keeping with the warm relationship between Musk and Meloni, whose political roots on the right align her with Trump, even as she's backed the G-7's support of Ukraine in its struggle against the Russian invasion.</p>

<p>At a festival organized by Meloni's right-wing Brothers of Italy party in December, Musk exhorted the crowd to "make more Italians" and warned of unchecked migration while addressing Italy's birth rate, which is the lowest in Europe.</p>

<p>Meloni has refrained from backing either Trump or his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, saying she will work closely with whoever occupies the White House, given long-standing ties between the two countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After Musk spoke, Meloni delivered an implicit rebuke to the left, lamenting the desire to "to violently erase the symbols of our civilizations in the US as in Europe."</p>

<p>"I know that we should not be ashamed to use and defend words and concepts like nation and patriotism, words that mean more than a physical place," Meloni said. "They mean a state of mind to which one belongs."</p>

<p>Meloni is in New York with leaders from more than 190 other nations for the annual high-level meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. On Sunday, she met with Sundar Pichai and Sam Altman, the chief executives of Alphabet Inc. And OpenAI Inc.</p>

<p>The choice to give a Global Citizen Award to the prime minister, and have Musk present it, has angered some former and current Atlantic Council staff, Politico reported last week, given the dissonance between their views on Ukraine and immigration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meloni received the award "for her strong support of the EU and becoming the first female prime minister of Italy," according to a media package distributed by the Atlantic Council.</p>

<p>Musk has business interests in Italy. He and Meloni have scheduled a closed-door meeting later this month to discuss investment opportunities in Italy's space and artificial intelligence sectors, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Italy approved a new regulatory framework in June that grants foreign space companies permission to operate in the country, a move that it expects to generate investments of about &amp;#8364;7.3 billion ($8.1 billion).</p>

<p>Italy is already serviced by Musk's Starlink, which delivers broadband internet through a global network of more than 6,000 satellites operated by his Space Exploration Technologies Corp.</p>

<p>Meloni has also expressed interest in artificial intelligence, though she sounded a note of caution about the technology in a speech to the United Nations Summit of the Future earlier Monday. She called AI a "great multiplier" but warned it could widen global imbalances.</p>

<p>"Machines will not answer this question," she said. "Politics must guarantee that artificial intelligence remains controlled by humans and keeps humans at the centre."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump had said that he was going to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit here but they did not meet.</p>

<p>PM Modi's brief trip was of about 55 hours packed with activities, while Trump was in the heat of the campaign for an election six weeks away.</p>

<p>The PM was busy on Saturday with the Quad summit with President Joe Biden, and Prime Ministers Anthony Albanese of Australia and Fumio Kishida of Japan.</p>

<p>Monday was taken up entirely by PM Modi's address to the Summit of the Future and meetings with some leaders before his flight back.</p>

<p>On Sunday, he addressed the diaspora rally in a New York suburb, and he had some time later in the day for meetings.</p>

<p>But Trump was away holding his own rally in North Carolina.</p>

<p>Later Sunday, PM Modi met with Palestine President Mahmoud Abbas, Nepal's Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli, and Kuwait Crown Prince Sheikh Sabah al-Khalid.</p>

<p>There were media speculations about another meeting: Between PM Modi and Mohammad Yunus, the de facto prime Minister of Bangladesh, on the sidelines of the United Nations Summit of the Future.</p>

<p>Some media reports said that PM Modi was snubbing him by refusing to meet.</p>

<p>Ultimately it was also a matter of timing.</p>

<p>Asked at his news conference about the meeting that wasn't to be, India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said, “The Prime Minister is leaving in a few minutes from now. The chief advisor of Bangladesh is not here yet, so there hasn't been any possibility of a meeting on this occasion”.</p>

<p>Touhid Hossain, the foreign affairs adviser in the interim government of Bangladesh, spoke at the summit on Monday instead of Yunus who was listed as the speaker.</p>

<p>After meeting Presidents Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and To Lam of Vietnam on Monday, PM Modi also squeezed in two other meetings, with the Vatican's Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and Armenia's President Nikol Pashinyan.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent video of Republican Donald Trump on social media has sparked mixed reactions. The video shows Trump giving $100 to a Pennsylvania mother of three to help with her grocery bill during a campaign stop on September 23. The former U.S. President, who is running for the presidency again, also promised to lower supermarket prices if elected in November.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign team posted the video on X (formerly Twitter) with the caption, "President @realDonaldTrump helps a mom of 3 pay for her groceries."</p>

<p>In the video, Trump hands the money to the woman, saying, "Here, it's gonna go down a little. It just went down 100 bucks."</p>

<p>The woman thanks Trump, laughing along with others present. Trump then adds, "We'll do that for you from the White House, alright?" and compliments her sons, calling them "beautiful" and "perfecto."</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">President <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@realDonaldTrump</a> helps a mom of 3 pay for her groceries ❤️?? <a href="https://t.co/33ifPk2cXI">pic.twitter.com/33ifPk2cXI</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p></p>

<p>Trump has repeatedly vowed that, if he returns to the White House, he will address inflation and reduce the cost of everyday items like groceries and gas.</p>

<p>While Trump supporters praised his actions in the comments, with some drawing comparisons to Vice President Kamala Harris, others were less impressed, calling the gesture "fake" and insincere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is more than Kamala has ever done to help any American," one user wrote, while another said, "Comrade Kamala could never do this, Trump is real &amp; genuine, Kamala is fake." "That's my president!" one user exclaimed. Another wrote, "President Trump is the people's President".</p>

<p>"Love Trump, he has been doing this his own life without cameras filming. There's so many stories of people coming out and saying he read their story in the paper and so he sent them a check to pay off their house. Gave loans to minorities when all banks refused etc," the third user wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another section of the internet called the gesture "fake".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Brought grandkids to rally, and now paying a voter...fake AF!! This won't change anyone's vote," one user wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another said, "Wait, he said "we'll do that for you for the White House" as in he's bribing someone for a vote? Also why did he feel the need to have this taped for posting instead of just doing it privately? I'm not impressed".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"So genuine with 100 cameras on this," said a user, using sarcasm.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli airstrikes targeted southern and eastern Lebanon, as well as the capital city of Beirut, on Monday, killing 450 people and injuring over 1,500. This was the deadliest Israeli attack on Lebanon since the 2006 war with Hezbollah. It came just days after thousands of pagers, still used in the country, exploded, killing 32 people and injuring thousands. Lebanon has blamed Israel for the attack.<br />
<br />
Fears of a broader war loom large, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urging civilians to evacuate affected areas. The latest Israeli onslaught displaced more than 1.10 lakh Lebanese and around 60,000 Israelis.<br />
<br />
The conflict between Israel and Lebanon goes back to 1982. To understand the current situation, we must revisit the First Lebanese War.<br />
<br />
<strong>The First Lebanese War</strong><br />
<br />
In March 1978, members of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) infiltrated Israel, leading to the murder of an American tourist and the hijacking of a bus, resulting in the deaths of 34 hostages. In retaliation, Israeli forces invaded Lebanon, targeting terrorist bases. After two months, they withdrew, allowing United Nations peacekeepers to enter.<br />
<br />
Violence continued to escalate, with repeated PLO attacks and Israeli reprisals. A ceasefire brokered by the US in July 1981 quickly fell apart, as the PLO conducted 270 terrorist operations in Israel, the West Bank, Gaza and along the Lebanese border, resulting in 29 Israeli deaths and over 300 injuries. At the time, an estimated 15,000 to 18,000 PLO members were stationed across Lebanon, armed with significant quantities of light and heavy weaponry.<br />
<br />
The tipping point occurred in June 1982 when a Palestinian terrorist group attempted to assassinate Israel's Ambassador to Great Britain. In response, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched ‘Operation Peace for Galilee' on June 6, aimed at terrorists.<br />
<br />
The initial success of the Israeli operation aimed for broader objectives, including the expulsion of the PLO from Lebanon and the establishment of a peace treaty. Lebanon's President Amin Gemayel signed a treaty in 1983, but Syria intervened, forcing him to retract. Many Arab residents in southern Lebanon suffered due to the strong presence of PLO.<br />
<br />
As the IDF surrounded Beirut, civilian suffering increased due to the PLO's refusal to surrender. An agreement for a ceasefire was reached to facilitate a peaceful PLO withdrawal, but the PLO's continual demands complicated negotiations. They engaged in controlled violations of the ceasefire, seeking to provoke Israeli retaliation, while strategically positioning themselves behind civilians.<br />
<br />
Despite media scrutiny, Israel worked towards expelling the PLO from Beirut, resulting in the deployment of an international coalition to oversee their evacuation. By September 1, 1982, approximately 14,000 PLO fighters left. Among them was Yasser Arafat, the chairman of the PLO, who departed for Tunisia.<br />
<br />
The war sparked intense debate within Israel, and for the first time, there was no unified consensus for it. Prime Minister Menachem Begin eventually resigned amid public demands to end the conflict. In 1984, Israel withdrew its troops but left a token force to support the South Lebanese Army. The war cost 1,216 Israeli lives and left a lasting legacy of violence and instability in the region, highlighting ongoing challenges for the two countries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky lauded Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday for his "clear support" of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>

<p>The two leaders met on the sidelines of the UN Summit of the Future to discuss the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and explore paths toward peace.</p>

<p>In a post on X, Zelensky expressed gratitude for the productive conversation.</p>

<p>"This is our third bilateral meeting this year. We are working together to strengthen cooperation across various fields," he said.</p>

<p>Highlighting the focus on bolstering interaction on international platforms, Zelensky wrote, "The main focus of our conversation was on enhancing our interaction on international platforms, particularly at the UN and G20, as well as implementing the Peace Formula and preparing for the second Peace Summit. We had a substantive discussion on the available opportunities."</p>

<p>"I am grateful for Prime Minister Modi's clear support of our sovereignty and territorial integrity," Zelensky wrote, stressing India's diplomatic stance on the conflict.</p>

<p>During their meeting, PM Modi reiterated India's commitment to a peaceful resolution of the war through diplomacy and dialogue.</p>

<p>According to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), Modi emphasized India's "clear, consistent, and constructive" approach, which prioritizes engagement between all stakeholders.</p>

<p>After the meeting, PM Modi shared a post on X, saying, "Met President Zelensky in New York. We are committed to implementing the outcomes of my visit to Ukraine last month to strengthen bilateral relations. Reiterated India's support for early resolution of the conflict in Ukraine and restoration of peace and stability."</p>

<p>This marked the third meeting between the leaders in just over three months. The two agreed to maintain close contact, as confirmed by the MEA.</p>

<p>PM Modi's visit to Ukraine in August, the first by an Indian PM since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1992, underscored India's active engagement in promoting peace in the war-torn region.</p>

<p>Despite being seen as neutral in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, PM Modi has consistently advocated for a peaceful resolution, reaffirming India's position as a proponent of stability.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists in New Zealand said Tuesday they have discovered a new species of "ghost shark", a type of fish that prowls the Pacific Ocean floor hunting prey more than a mile down.</p>

<p>The Australasian Narrow-nosed Spookfish was found living in the deep waters of Australia and New Zealand, according to scientists from Wellington-based National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA).</p>

<p>The specimens were discovered during research in the Chatham Rise, an area of the Pacific which stretches around 1,000 kilometres (621 miles) east near New Zealand's South Island.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ghost sharks, or chimaeras, are related to sharks and rays, but are part of a group of fish whose skeletons are entirely made of cartilage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also known as spookfish, the ghost sharks have haunting black eyes and smooth, light brown, scale-free skin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>They feed off crustaceans at depths of up to 2,600 metres (8,530 feet) using their distinctive beak-like mouth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Ghost sharks like this one are largely confined to the ocean floor," said research scientist Brit Finucci.</p>

<p>Finucci gave the new species its scientific name "Harriotta avia" in memory of her grandmother.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Their habitat makes them hard to study and monitor, meaning we don't know a lot about their biology or threat status, but it makes discoveries like this even more exciting."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The spookfish was previously thought to be part of a single globally distributed species until scientists discovered it is genetically and morphologically different to its cousins.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

Earlier, the British rock band officially announced the Asia dates for their highly anticipated <em>Music of the Spheres World Tour. </em>They are to hold three shows at DY Patil Sports Stadium in Mumbai on January 18, and 19, and a newly added performance on January 21, 2025. When ticket sales opened at noon on Sunday, fans flooded the BookMyShow website and app in hopes of snagging one of the 1.5 lakh available tickets, each concert accommodating 50,000 attendees. However, the <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bookmyshow-site-crashes-seconds-before-sale-for-coldplay-mumbai-concert-begins-6622286">overwhelming traffic</a> led to a rapid sell-out, with all tickets disappearing within minutes.<br />
<br />
The <em>Music of the Spheres World Tour, </em>which began following the announcement on October 14, 2021, is being staged to promote Coldplay's ninth and tenth studio albums,<em> Music of the Spheres</em> (2021) and <em>Moon Music</em> (2024). The tour marks the band's return to live performances after the COVID-19 pandemic, as they previously did not tour their 2019 album, <em>Everyday Life,</em> due to environmental concerns.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Boeing Co offered a 30% pay bump directly to striking workers, angering union leaders, as the embattled planemaker tries to overcome a debilitating strike that has shut down plants across the Pacific Northwest.</p>

<p>The proposal is an improvement over the initial 25% increase turned down earlier this month by members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, but still less than the 40% initially sought by the union. Boeing said the terms are final and only valid until the end of September 27, ratcheting up pressure on workers to accept.</p>

<p>However, Jon Holden, president of IAM District 751, said his negotiating team was blindsided by the offer and the union has no intention of putting it before rank-and-file members for a vote. Doing so on such short notice simply isn't feasible, he said in an interview.</p>

<p>"Setting up a vote for 33,000 people isn't just something you snap your fingers on," Holden said. Union leaders also want to talk to members about the offer, he said, adding: "We know already that it doesn't meet our members' needs."</p>

<p>The maneuvering has brought a harder edge to the pay negotiations. In a harsh statement posted online, IAM District 751 said that by skirting the collective bargaining process, "Boeing took it upon itself to disrespect our entire union."</p>

<p>The sparring injects new tension to talks that have been at a standstill since September 18, when two days of federal mediation yielded little progress. After workers voted almost unanimously to strike earlier this month, the local district said it intended to push for a substantially higher wage increase and for Boeing to reinstate a defined benefit pension plan for members.</p>

<p>The showdown between Boeing and workers at its main manufacturing hub is being closely watched by Wall Street and the White House as labor strife flares up in the US ahead of November's presidential election.</p>

<h2><strong>Strained Finances</strong></h2>

<p>Machinists also walked off the job on Monday at Textron Aviation, which makes Cessna Citation business jets, after rejecting a 26% contract offer over the weekend. And a potential strike by Longshoremen threatens to cripple US maritime shipping.</p>

<p>An extended walkout would worsen Boeing's already strained financial situation, after the company burned through more than $8 billion in cash in the first half as it slowed output to address quality lapses exposed by an aircraft accident in January.</p>

<p>"We heard your feedback," Boeing said in a post on its website touting the latest contract offer. "We've made significant improvements to provide more money in key areas."</p>

<p>The planemaker's shares jumped as much as 3.3% in New York. Boeing has tumbled 40% in value this year, the second-worst performance among members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p>

<p>The conflict has shut down production of Boeing's cash-cow 737 Max and other jetliners, and could drain an additional $1.3 billion in cash from the company each month, according to Sheila Kahyaoglu, an analyst at Jefferies. As Boeing risks losing its investment-grade credit rating, the planemaker has begun to furlough workers and take other steps to preserve cash during the strike.</p>

<p>Senior managers, including new Chief Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg, have also agreed to take pay cuts for the duration of the furloughs.</p>

<p>The strike pits the financially ailing aerospace manufacturer against workers with a history of activism and an ax to grind with their employer. The Machinists are embittered by a 2014 agreement that cost them their pensions and locked in only modest wage increases while inflation soared earlier this decade.</p>

<h2><strong>War of Words</strong></h2>

<p>The company's latest offer includes reinstating an annual bonus that averaged around 3.7% of wages and was dropped from the initial agreement, a flash point that striking Machinists cited repeatedly in interviews. Boeing also doubled to $6,000 the bonus that workers would get if the latest deal is passed, and increased its contribution to a pension plan, which would be run by the company rather than the union.</p>

<p>Boeing has refused to meet since talks broke down last week, Holden said. The company did provide a brief overview of the latest terms Monday morning, but the two sides were still talking when Boeing went public with the offer, he said.</p>

<p>Holden said he tried again on Monday to get Boeing back to the negotiating table. "They said, 'No. The offer is the offer,'" he said.</p>

<p>As the war of words escalated, Boeing hit back with its own version of events.</p>

<p>"We have bargained in good faith with the IAM since formal negotiations began in March," Boeing said in an emailed statement late Monday. "After an unsuccessful federal mediation last week, we presented a best and final offer that made significant improvements and addresses feedback from the union and our employees. We first presented the offer to the union and then transparently shared the details with our employees."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Maky Zanganeh became a billionaire after shares of Summit Therapeutics, where she serves as co-CEO, soared following positive trial data for its promising cancer drug.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maky Zanganeh, co-CEO of Summit Therapeutics, a biopharmaceutical oncology company, is now a billionaire. An Iranian immigrant, Ms Zanganeh's rise came after shares of Summit Therapeutics, under her leadership, surged 17-fold, pushing its market valuation to $17 billion, according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2024/09/20/iranian-immigrant-becomes-billionaire-as-her-biotech-firms-stock-soars/">Forbes</a>.</p>

<p>The 54-year-old holds just under 5 per cent&nbsp;of the company's shares along with stock options. She is now worth an estimated $1.1 billion, one of only 34 self-made women billionaires in the US and one of just three in the healthcare sector.<br />
<br />
The 21-year-old company, with no approved drugs and just 130 employees, has recently caught the eye of investors due to its experimental lung cancer drug, ivonescimab. Data presented at the World Conference on Lung Cancer in San Diego showed the drug outperformed Merck's blockbuster Keytruda, generating massive investor interest. “The big news was that we could beat Keytruda,” Ms Zanganeh was quoted as saying by Forbes.<br />
<br />
Summit's stock nearly doubled after the announcement, peaking at $31.93 on September 13 before settling at $23.16 by September 19.<br />
<br />
Ms Zangesh was born in Tehran, Iran, to architect parents. Her life was forever altered when the Shah of Iran was overthrown in 1979. The subsequent Iran-Iraq war intensified the uncertainty. “We constantly had to face the fear of bombing,” she shared in her 2021 memoir, ‘The Magic of Normal.' When Ms Zanganeh was about 11, a friend of her father in Germany arranged for her family to obtain German visas.<br />
<br />
After many flight cancellations due to airport closures in Tehran, they eventually fled to Germany via Austria. Settling in Oldenburg, a small town in northern Germany, she learned German while her parents returned to Iran. Ms Zanganeh stayed behind, living with a friend and then an uncle, to finish high school.<br />
<br />
Ms Zanganeh's father, seeing both of her sisters in medical school in Strasbourg, France, encouraged her to follow suit. She mastered French and pursued dentistry at the University of Strasbourg, specialising in paediatric dentistry, and graduated in 1995. However, she remained unsure about pursuing a career in dentistry. In 1997, through an Iranian friend working for US robotic surgery company, Computer Motion, Ms Zanganeh became intrigued by the industry and took on a role as the company's European coordinator, while also earning an MBA from Schiller International University.<br />
<br />
She rose quickly, becoming Computer Motion's head of Europe and the Middle East, and later, its global vice president for training and education, which led her to Santa Barbara, California. When Intuitive Surgical acquired Computer Motion in 2003, Ms Zanganeh left the company to explore new opportunities.<br />
<br />
Ms Zanganeh then found her true calling in biotech, eventually teaming up with fellow billionaire Robert Duggan to lead Summit Therapeutics.</p>

<p>Together, Mr Duggan and Ms Zanganeh are betting big on ivonescimab. Summit licenced the drug from Hong Kong-listed Akeso in 2022 for $500 million upfront, with the potential for an additional $4.5 billion in milestone payments.<br />
<br />
Ms Zanganeh, diagnosed with breast cancer in 2020 and now fully recovered, joined Summit's board later that year and was appointed co-CEO in September 2022, just months before securing the deal with Akeso.<br />

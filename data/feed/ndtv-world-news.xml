       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The number of people killed after Typhoon Yagi swept through northern Vietnam bringing flash floods and landslides has risen to 197, the government said Thursday.</p>

<p>About 128 people are still missing and more than 250,000 hectares of crops have also been destroyed, disaster officials under the Ministry of Agriculture said in an official report.</p>

<p>Yagi is the most powerful typhoon to hit northern Vietnam in 30 years, according to meteorologists.</p>

<p>The storm downed bridges, tore roofs off buildings and damaged factories after making landfall on Saturday carrying winds in excess of 149 kilometres (92 miles) per hour.</p>

<p>The north of the country has since been battling severe flooding, with several communities partially underwater.</p>

<p>Thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes, while others are struggling with power cuts.</p>

<p>In one badly hit district on the outskirts of Hanoi, more than 15,000 people have been affected by the floods.</p>

<p>Farmers have also suffered. About 1.5 million chickens and ducks have been killed, as well as 2,500 pigs, buffalo and cows, officials said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris and Donald Trump return to the campaign trail Thursday, with the Democrat hoping her dominant display in their first presidential debate will boost her chances in the knife-edge US election.</p>

<p>The rivals are heading to crucial battleground states that will decide November's vote, two days after Harris forced Republican Trump onto the defensive in a fiery clash that drew 67 million viewers across the United States.</p>

<p>But it remains unclear whether the vice president's punchy performance will turn the dial with less than two months to go in an agonizingly tight race that will be decided by a handful of undecided voters across the country.</p>

<p>Harris, 59, will seek to capitialize on her debate momentum as she heads to North Carolina on Thursday, holding back-to-back rallies in the cities of Charlotte and Greensboro promising a "new way forward."</p>

<p>Harris has erased a six-point Trump lead over the last month to draw level in North Carolina, where she is aiming to fire up crucial Black and young voters to back her bid to become America's first woman commander in chief.</p>

<p>Amid media reports of turmoil in his camp over the way Harris succeeded in goading him at the debate, the 78-year-old former president is due onstage in Tucson, Arizona to focus on "our struggling economy."</p>

<p>Arizona was one of the most bitterly fought states in the 2020 election, with Joe Biden winning there by around 10,000 votes against Trump, and promises to be closely contested again.</p>

<p>Their return to the swing states at the heart of the election came a day after a brief truce when they attended Wednesday's anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in New York.</p>

<h3><strong>'Missed opportunity'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The debate in Philadelphia was a welcome boost for Harris as the honeymoon from her sudden replacement of the ageing Biden as Democratic candidate seemed to be wearing off.</p>

<p>Trump insisted it was one of his best debates, but snap polls and even allies disagreed as Harris riled him up with taunts about crowd sizes and his 2020 election loss, then scored points on issues like abortion.</p>

<p>Close Trump ally Senator Lindsay Graham told reporters afterwards that it was a "missed opportunity" while US media reported there was discontent among Trump donors.</p>

<p>But while Harris has erased the lead Trump held in polls, the candidates remain neck and neck and she insists she is the underdog in the White House race.</p>

<p>And America's deeply polarized politics mean however that big showpiece events like debates rarely move the polls that much -- even if it was a disastrous debate against Trump that forced Biden to drop his reelection bid.</p>

<p>Both candidates will keep bashing the battlegrounds in the coming days, knowing a few thousand undecided votes in the northeastern "Rust Belt" and the booming southern "Sun Belt" could decide everything.</p>

<p>Harris returns to Pennsylvania, the most crucial and bitterly fought of all the swing states, on Friday for campaign events in Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre before attending an awards dinner Saturday with Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff.</p>

<p>Trump will deliver remarks in Las Vegas on Friday on the cost of living, as he targets Nevada, yet another key swing state. He is also due to give a press conference in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Harris's running mate Tim Walz will travel to Michigan and Wisconsin from Thursday to Saturday as part of the campaign's New Way Forward swing state tour.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's running mate JD Vance today took a dig at American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift after she endorsed Kamala Harris. Swift voiced support for the Democratic candidate in an Instagram post on Tuesday, calling her a "steady-handed, gifted leader."</p>

<p>She signed off her post - which has so far <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/taylor-swifts-instagram-post-endorsing-kamala-harris-draws-9-million-likes-6545522" target="_blank">drawn nearly 10 million likes</a> - by dubbing herself a "childless cat lady," a swipe at a JD Vance, who in a 2021 interview called some Democrats "a bunch of childless cat ladies." He has since said it was merely a sarcastic remark.</p>

<p>"We admire Taylor Swift's music, but I don't think most Americans, whether they like her music or are fans of hers or not, are going to be influenced by a billionaire celebrity who I think is fundamentally disconnected from the interests and the problems of most Americans," Vance told Fox News.</p>

<p>"When grocery prices go by 20%, it hurts most Americans. It doesn't hurt Taylor Swift. When housing prices become unaffordable, it doesn't affect Taylor Swift or any other billionaire. It does affect middle-class Americans all over our country," he added.</p>

<h3><strong>Taylor Swift Endorses Kamala Harris</strong></h3>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/fine-taylor-you-win-elon-musk-after-taylor-swift-backs-kamala-harris-6538352" target="_blank">Taylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris</a> minutes after the televised presidential debate between the Democrat and Donald Trump.</p>

<p>"I'm voting for Kamala Harris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them," the 34-year-old singer said in a long post on Instagram.</p>

<p>"I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos," she added.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[For Mr Gates, the key question during a future pandemic would be whether nations are better prepared than they were for the outbreak of Covid-19.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates has repeatedly warned the public about pressing issues like climate disasters and devastating cyberattacks. However, the two crises that concern him the most are war and pandemics.</p>

<p>The Microsoft co-founder told CNBC Make It that the current global unrest could potentially trigger "a major war," and even if a large-scale conflict is avoided, "there will be another pandemic, most likely in the next 25 years."</p>

<p>For Mr Gates, the key question during a future pandemic would be whether nations are better prepared than they were for the outbreak of Covid-19. Reflecting on the United States' response, he noted, "The country that the world expected to lead and be the model fell short of those expectations."</p>

<p>In his 2022 book, "How to Prevent the Next Pandemic," Mr Gates criticised various governments for their lack of preparedness in 2020. He also outlined recommendations for countries worldwide, including stronger quarantine measures, enhanced disease monitoring, and increased investment in vaccine research and development.</p>

<p>Speaking about Covid-19, Mr Gates remarked, "Although some lessons from the coronavirus pandemic have been learned, it's been far less than I would have expected, sadly. We're still not fully reflecting on what we did well and where we fell short. Maybe in the next five years, that will improve, but so far, it's quite surprising."</p>

<p>Earlier,&nbsp;Microsoft co-founder said that the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) will be transformative for people in the next five years. Speaking to CNN, he added that there is no need to be scared of the latest technology as it will create new opportunities. The comment comes days after International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Kristalina Georgieva said that AI will affect 60 per cent of jobs in advanced economies and 40 per cent across the globe.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 attacks, NASA released a letter from the only American astronaut in space at the time, Frank Culbertson, who was reflecting on witnessing the tragedy from the International Space Station (ISS).</p>

<p>In the letter, dated September 12, 2001, Culbertson recollects the moment he learned of the attacks while being aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Describing his shock and horror upon hearing about the events, he wrote, "Well, obviously the world changed today. What I say or do is very minor compared to the significance of what happened to our country today when it was attacked by.... by whom? Terrorists is all we know, I guess. Hard to know at whom to direct our anger and fear..."</p>

<p>Culbertson, who was serving as the commander of Expedition Three at that time, captured images of the smoke plume rising from lower Manhattan shortly after the collapse of the Twin Towers. His letter vividly narrates his experience of seeing his country under one of the biggest terrorist attacks of all time that killed 3000 people.</p>

<p>"It's difficult to describe how it feels to be the only American completely off the planet at a time such as this. The feeling that I should be there with all of you, dealing with this, helping in some way, is overwhelming," he wrote.</p>

<p>Culbertson&nbsp;witnessed the smoke rising from New York City as they passed overhead. He captured video footage of the smoke, which he described as having an "odd bloom" at its base. He later learned that the pilot of the plane that hit the Pentagon was his classmate, Captain Charles Burlingame.</p>

<p>Today, 23 years after the attack, a memorial exists where the Twin Towers once stood to remember those who lost their lives in the terror attack. Pew Research in its study said, "It is difficult to think of an event that so profoundly transformed US public opinion across so many dimensions as the 9/11 attacks." Culbertson's photograph and his letter serve as a lasting record of that fateful day in American history, noting that things would "never be the same again" after that.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Mr Niccol, 50, is seen by many as a "dream hire" and a "hall of fame restaurant CEO."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brian Niccol, a seasoned executive with a proven track record of turning around troubled companies, has taken the helm at Starbucks. The coffee giant faces mounting pressure from activist investors, unionization efforts, and sluggish sales in its two largest markets.</p>

<p>Mr Niccol, 50, who previously led Chipotle through a foodborne illness scandal and the pandemic, is seen by many as a "dream hire" and a "hall of fame restaurant CEO."&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a commencement speech, Niccol shared his go-to career advice. "I know it's a cliche, but you absolutely have to believe in yourself and have the grit to not give up, when it at first might not be going your way,” &nbsp;He also shared his strategy of using a beat-up notebook to track his career progress and stay focused on his goals, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/09/starbucks-new-ceo-brian-niccol-swears-by-this-cliche-career-advice.html" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>CNBC Make It </em></a>reported.</p>

<p>Mr Niccol's "gut instinct" has played a crucial role in his career decisions, including his move from Taco Bell to Chipotle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Whatever it is you need to do to keep yourself focused on your goal, do it, and believe you can do it,” he added.</p>

<p>“There will be times in your career when your gut will be tingling,” he said, noting that he had that feeling when he left Taco Bell to become Chipotle's CEO in 2018. “Make space for that instinctive intelligence and take action. Trust your instincts.”&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Niccol's appointment is critical for Starbucks. The company has been grappling with several challenges, including declining sales, increased competition, and unionization efforts. Niccol's experience in turning around troubled companies could be a valuable asset to Starbucks as it seeks to navigate these challenges.</p>

<p>In addition to his strong leadership skills, Mr Niccol also has a deep understanding of the restaurant industry. He has spent his entire career working in the food service sector, and he has a proven track record of driving growth and profitability.</p>

<p>Mr Niccol's appointment has been met with optimism by many analysts and investors. They believe that he has the potential to turn Starbucks around and restore the company to its former glory. However, it will take time to see whether Niccol can deliver on these expectations.</p>

<p>"When I talked to him I remember him saying, 'I know what to do,'" Hobson, who ceded her position as chair of the Starbucks board to Niccol and is now lead independent director, said in an Aug. 13 appearance on CNBC's "Squawk Box."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hobson continued: "He said, 'This is a speed bump in this company's history. This is not something that I fear going into,' and that was something for our board that was extremely encouraging."&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his new role, Mr Niccol will be getting paid a base salary of $1.6 million annually and supercommuting from his home in Newport Beach, California to Starbucks' Seattle headquarters on a corporate jet.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A homeless man has been convicted of stabbing a college student 46 times and recording the brutal attack in US' Los Angeles, reports said. In the audio recording, the man can be heard promising not to hurt her.</p>

<p>According to prosecutors, 34-year-old Shawn Laval Smith was "hunting for a woman alone" in 2022 when he found 24-year-old Brianna Kupfer at the furniture store where she worked.</p>

<p>When he entered the store, Ms Kupfer sent a text message to her friend saying she felt uncomfortable about a man who was inside the shop, they said.</p>

<p>Around 20 minutes after that text, she was found dead on the floor covered in blood.</p>

<p>The audio recorded by Smith was key in convicting him of the horrific murder. In the clip, a man can be heard saying he was "not gonna hurt" a woman and ordered her to "just get down on the floor."</p>

<p>A woman can be heard screaming as the man says, "It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over."</p>

<p>After the stabbing, he fled the furniture store through the back door and left Ms Kupfer bleeding to death.</p>

<p>Prosecutors say Smith had planned to attack a woman who alone and left his house prepared to kill. Ms Kupfer's lawyer called him a Hannibal Lecter-style sicko who liked the idea of slaughtering women, the New York Post said.</p>

<p>"This man hated women. It's easier probably to sleep at night to think something is wrong with him rather than face the truth that this man was on a crusade to hunt, to destroy and to kill for the mere fact that she was female," he said.</p>

<p>At the crime scene, the police found an audio recorded and a filet knife (used to slice and prepare fish). The knife had bent after the frenzied attack.</p>

<p>Both the items were covered in his DNA which was key in proving his guilt.</p>

<p>Smith, who had a long criminal history including assaulting police officer and vandalism, was out on bail after he was accused of firing a flare gun from a vehicle.</p>

<p>"Brianna Kupfer was a promising young woman whose life was tragically taken far too soon. I thank the jury for their thoughtful deliberation and dedication in finding the defendant guilty," Ms Kupfer's lawyer said in a statement after the verdict.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pop megastar Taylor Swift drew more than 9 million "likes" to her Instagram post backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president from celebrities that included Jennifer Aniston, US basketball star Caitlin Clark and Selena Gomez. Soon after Harris, a Democrat, finished debating her Republican rival Donald Trump on Tuesday night, Swift, 34, told her 283 million followers that Harris and running mate Tim Walz would get her vote in the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>Her post encouraged first-time voters to be sure to register for the election, and a US General Services Administration spokesperson reported on Wednesday receiving 337,826 visitors at vote.gov from a custom URL that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/taylor-swift-endorses-kamala-harris-on-instagram-after-debate-with-trump-6537920">Taylor Swift</a> had shared.</p>

<p>"I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them," Swift posted.</p>

<p>She called Harris a "steady-handed, gifted leader" who could lead the country with calm rather than chaos.</p>

<p>Swift was pictured with her cat in her post, which she signed as "Childless Cat Lady" in a dig at Trump's running mate JD Vance, who in a 2021 interview called some Democrats "a bunch of childless cat ladies." He has since said it was merely a sarcastic remark.</p>

<p>Supermodel Karlie Kloss, who is married to Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner's brother, liked Swift's post.</p>

<p>"Parks and Recreation" and "The White Lotus" actor Aubrey Plaza echoed Swift's endorsement in her own Instagram post on Wednesday, where she held a cat alongside the caption "HARRIS WALZ" with an American flag emoji.</p>

<p>Trump supporter <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/fine-taylor-you-win-elon-musk-after-taylor-swift-backs-kamala-harris-6538352">Elon Musk</a>, who is chief executive of Tesla and owns social media platform X, wrote on his platform, "Fine Taylor ... you win ... I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life."</p>

<p>His message was branded "disgusting," "misogynistic" and "creepy."</p>

<p>"I've done my research, and I've made my choice," Swift wrote to her followers on Instagram. "Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered!"</p>

<p>Swift wrote that she was impressed by Walz, the Minnesota governor, and described him as someone "who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman's right to her own body for decades."</p>

<p>Walz, who was on MSNBC when the endorsement was announced, said he was "incredibly grateful" and urged the singer's large fan base of "Swifties" to "Get things going."</p>

<p>Shortly after Swift's endorsement, the Harris-Walz campaign announced pre-orders for its latest campaign wear: Swift fan inspired friendship bracelets.</p>

<h3><strong>TRUMP DISMISSES ENDORSEMENT</strong></h3>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/shell-pay-for-it-says-donald-trump-after-taylor-swift-endorses-kamala-harris-for-president-6542169">Donald Trump</a> on Wednesday dismissed Swift's endorsement of Harris, saying he "was not a Taylor fan".</p>

<p>"It was just a question of time," Trump told Fox News in an interview. "She's a very liberal person. She seems to always endorse a Democrat. And she'll probably pay a price for it ... in the marketplace."</p>

<p>In August, Trump posted a fake social media image of Swift asking people to vote for him in the November election.</p>

<p>Swift referred to that in her Tuesday post, saying Trump had "really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation."</p>

<p>She added: "It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter."</p>

<p>Opinion polls show the race essentially tied between the two candidates.</p>

<p>Harris, who supports abortion rights, has criticized Trump for appointing three of the Supreme Court justices who in 2022 helped overturn the 1973 Roe v Wade ruling ensuring a constitutional right to abortion.</p>

<p>Trump has defended the court's abortion ruling but said a federal abortion ban is unnecessary and that the issue should be resolved at the state level.</p>

<p>Swift backed President Joe Biden in 2020. Many Hollywood actors, producers and filmmakers have said they view Harris, a former U.S. senator from California, as their hometown candidate.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden donned one of his predecessor and adversary Donald Trump's signature red hats on Wednesday in a move the White House said was a show of "unity" on the anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks.</p>

<p>The veteran Democrat was dared to put on the cap as he attended commemorative events with Vice President Kamala Harris -- Trump's opponent in the November presidential election -- at the Pennsylvania site where Flight 93 crashed.</p>

<p>"As a gesture, he gave a hat to a Trump supporter who then said that in the same spirit, (Biden) should put on his Trump cap. He briefly wore it."</p>

<p>Biden, 81, who was replaced by Harris on the Democratic ticket after withdrawing from the race in July, has repeatedly characterized Trump as an existential threat to US democracy.</p>

<p>Several commenters noted that the episode came the day after a prime-time televised presidential debate between Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, in which the Republican told his opponent: "Biden hates you."</p>

<p>The Trump campaign's War Room rapid reaction account quipped that Biden had put the cap on because "Kamala did so bad in last night's debate."</p>

<p>In reality, Trump is considered by neutral observers to have had a poor night, coming across as defensive, unprepared, and obsessed with the past and personal grievances.</p>

<p>Across three national polls conducted since the showdown on ABC, an average of 57 percent of viewers said Harris turned in the better debate performance, while only 34 percent said Trump came out on top.</p>

<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Harris and Trump shook hands at New York's 9/11 memorial.</p>

<p>Wearing commemorative blue ribbons, they watched with other assembled dignitaries, including Biden, as the names of the almost 3,000 victims of the attacks on the Twin Towers were read out.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris and Donald Trump shook hands Wednesday at New York's 9/11 memorial to mark the anniversary of the attacks, briefly putting politics aside hours after they clashed in a fiery presidential debate.</p>

<p>The solemn display of unity was a stark contrast to the evening before, when the Democratic vice president forced the rattled Republican former president onto the defensive in a bruising televised encounter.</p>

<p>Any sense of harmony from the commemoration of the 2001 Al-Qaeda attacks is likely to be short-lived, with the US election still on a knife-edge with less than eight weeks to go, despite polls showing a crushing debate win for Harris.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old Trump came out swinging even before the ceremony, claiming -- without evidence -- in an interview with Fox News that the ABC News debate in Philadelphia was "rigged" against him.</p>

<p>"It was a rigged deal, as I assumed it would be, because when you looked at the fact that they were correcting everything and not correcting with her," he complained -- referring to pushback from the moderators to some of his brazenly false statements.</p>

<p>The debate was watched by 57.5 million Americans, according to preliminary figures from ratings agency Nielsen -- more than the 51.3 million who watched the catastrophic performance in June that forced President Joe Biden out of the race.</p>

<p>Trump appeared to be in two minds about the Harris campaign's call for a second debate. He initially said on social media "why would I do a rematch?" but later said he'd be ready for two more.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Stand in solidarity' -</strong></p>

<p>The rivals kept their animosity hidden at the Ground Zero memorial, however, in an extraordinary encounter that also included the outgoing president.</p>

<p>Biden, 81, looked on as Harris and Trump shared their second handshake in the space of a few hours -- having had their first ever such greeting at the start of the debate, in an unexpected move initiated by Harris.</p>

<p>Wearing commemorative blue ribbons, they all then watched as the names of the almost 3,000 victims of the attacks on the Twin Towers were read out.</p>

<p>"We stand in solidarity with their families and loved ones. We also honor the extraordinary heroism on display that fateful day by ordinary Americans helping their fellow Americans," Harris said in a statement.</p>

<p>She and Biden headed later to the site in Pennsylvania where a hijacked plane crashed on 9/11, with Trump following later.</p>

<p>During his visit, Biden briefly donned a red "Trump 2024" cap given to him by a Trump-supporting firefighter. The image went viral but the White House said it was a gesture of "unity."</p>

<p>Biden and Harris later visited the site where another jet was flown into the Pentagon outside Washington in 2001.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Good job' -</strong></p>

<p>The solemn atmosphere could not have been more different to Wednesday night's debate.</p>

<p>Both candidates declared victory but it was former prosecutor Harris who landed blows on issues including abortion, and repeatedly managed to bait convicted felon Trump into angry remarks on past grievances.</p>

<p>Trump also boosted a debunked claim about migrants eating pet cats and dogs in Ohio, earning a correction from the ABC moderator.</p>

<p>A CNN snap poll said Harris performed better than Trump by 63 percent to 37, while a YouGov poll said Harris laid out a clearer plan by 43 to 32 percent.</p>

<p>US media and commentators broadly agreed Harris had come out on top -- but that it may not move the dial much in a deeply polarized and entrenched electorate.</p>

<p>"I thought Kamala did a good job... and kind of gave us hope," Tanya James, a retired teacher from Texas, said Wednesday outside the White House.</p>

<p>Ikaika Juliano, a musician from Florida, thought however that the Democratic contender "is fake."</p>

<p>Harris meanwhile got a boost with pop megastar Taylor Swift offering her backing minutes after the debate. Trump said Swift would "probably pay a price for it in the marketplace."</p>

<p>But the race remains neck and neck going into the final stretch.</p>

<p>Harris heads Thursday to North Carolina and Trump is due onstage in Arizona, two of the half-dozen swing states expected to decide the election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;A group of private astronauts is set to carry out the first private spacewalk in orbit on Thursday from a SpaceX capsule, testing a new line of spacesuits.</p>

<p>A billionaire entrepreneur, a retired military fighter pilot and two SpaceX employees have been orbiting Earth aboard SpaceX's Crew Dragon since their pre-dawn launch from Florida on Tuesday for the Polaris Dawn mission, the company's latest and riskiest bid to push the boundaries of commercial spaceflight.</p>

<p>The spacewalk is slated to begin at 2:23 a.m. ET (0623 GMT) while the crew is 700 km (435 miles) in altitude, with two astronauts venturing outside Crew Dragon while the other two remain inside. The capsule will be completely depressurized, and the whole crew will need to rely on their slimmed-down SpaceX-developed spacesuits for oxygen.</p>

<p>Jared Isaacman, 41, a pilot and the billionaire founder of electronic payment company Shift4, is bankrolling the Polaris mission, as he did for his Inspiration4 flight with SpaceX in 2021. He has declined to say how much he is paying for the missions, but they are likely to cost hundreds of millions of dollars based on Crew Dragon's roughly $55 million per-seat price for other flights.</p>

<p>The others in Polaris include mission pilot Scott Poteet, 50, a retired U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel, and SpaceX employees Sarah Gillis, 30, and Anna Menon, 38, both senior engineers at the company.</p>

<p>Isaacman and Gillis will exit the spacecraft tethered by an oxygen line while Poteet and Menon stay inside the cabin.</p>

<p>Only government astronauts with several years of training have done spacewalks in the past. There have been roughly 270 on the International Space Station (ISS) since its creation in 2000, and 16 by Chinese astronauts on Beijing's Tiangong space station.</p>

<p>The first U.S. spacewalk was in 1965, aboard a Gemini capsule, and used a similar procedure to the one planned for Polaris Dawn: the capsule was depressurised, the hatch opened, and a spacesuited astronaut ventured outside on a tether.</p>

<p>The private Polaris astronauts during the mission will be key subjects for a range of scientific research into how the human body reacts to deep space, adding to decades of astronaut health studies enabled by government astronauts on the ISS.</p>

<p>Crew Dragon, the only U.S. vehicle capable of reliably putting humans in orbit and returning them to Earth, since 2021 has flown more than a dozen astronaut missions, mainly for NASA. The agency seeded development of the capsule under a program meant to establish commercial, privately built U.S. vehicles capable of ferrying U.S. astronauts to and from the ISS.</p>

<p>Boeing's Starliner capsule was also developed under that NASA program, but it is farther behind. Starliner launched its first astronauts to the ISS in June in a troubled test mission that ended this month with the capsule coming back empty, leaving its crew on the space station for a Crew Dragon capsule to fetch next year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea fired multiple short range ballistic missiles into waters east of the Korean peninsula Thursday, Seoul's military reported, days after the nuclear-armed North marked a state anniversary.</p>

<p>Seoul's Joint Chief of Staff said it had detected multiple "short-range ballistic missiles launched into the East Sea around 07:10 from Pyongyang today (2210 GMT on Wednesday)," referring to the body of water also known as the Sea of Japan.</p>

<p>It said it was analysing details of the launch and "closely sharing information on the North Korean ballistic missile with the U.S. and Japanese authorities, while strengthening surveillance and vigilance in preparation for further launches".</p>

<p>Japan's defence ministry also confirmed the launch of at least one suspected North Korean ballistic missile, with the coastguard warning vessels to take care.</p>

<p>It is Pyongyang's first apparent weapons test since July 1, and comes days after the isolated, nuclear-armed country marked a key anniversary celebrating the founding of the ruling regime.</p>

<p>North Korea has regularly launched missiles around September 9, its foundation day, including conducting its fifth nuclear test on the same day in 2016.</p>

<p>The country's sixth nuclear test was conducted on September 3 in 2017.</p>

<p>At a speech to mark the 76th anniversary of its founding this week, leader Kim Jong Un said the country was moving to steadily increase its nuclear arsenal.</p>

<p>North Korea "will steadily strengthen its nuclear force capable of fully coping with any threatening acts imposed by its nuclear-armed rival states", Kim said.</p>

<p>- Trash balloons -<br />
Relations between North and South Korea are at one of their lowest points in years, with the North recently announcing the deployment of 250 ballistic missile launchers to its southern border.</p>

<p>The North has also been bombarding the South with trash-carrying balloons, including a five-day straight blitz last week.</p>

<p>North Korea has sent more than 5,000 trash-filled balloons south since May, saying they are retaliation for propaganda balloons launched northwards by South Korean activists.</p>

<p>In response, Seoul has suspended a tension-reducing military deal with Pyongyang and restarted some propaganda broadcasts from loudspeakers along the border.</p>

<p>North Korea has recently bolstered military ties with Moscow, and analysts have said the North could be testing and ramping up production of artillery and cruise missiles before sending them to Russia for use in Ukraine.</p>

<p>The United States and Seoul have accused North Korea of supplying ammunition and missiles for Russia's war effort, a claim Pyongyang has called "absurd".</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Pyongyang declared the South its "principal enemy".</p>

<p>It has shuttered agencies dedicated to reunification and threatened war over "even 0.001 mm" of territorial infringement.</p>

<p>The North's latest ballistic missile launch comes weeks after South Korea and the United States wrapped their annual Ulchi Freedom Shield joint military drills.</p>

<p>North Korea -- which attacked its neighbour in 1950, triggering the Korean War -- has always been infuriated by joint US-South Korean military exercises, decrying them as rehearsals for invasion.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ma, who worked for the CIA from 1982 to 1989, conspired with a relative, now deceased, who was also employed by the CIA, the DOJ said.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Palestinian Hamas group said on Wednesday that its negotiators reiterated its readiness to implement an "immediate" ceasefire with Israel in Gaza based on a previous U.S. proposal without new conditions from any party.</p>

<p>The Palestinian group said in a statement that their negotiation team, led by senior official Khalil al-Hayya, met mediators on Wednesday including Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Egypt's intelligence chief Abbas Kamel in Doha to discuss the latest developments in Gaza.</p>

<p>Talks have so far failed to reach a deal to end the 11-month-old war. Lingering issue include control of the Philadelphi corridor, a narrow stretch of land on Gaza's border with Egypt, persisting.</p>

<p>CIA Director William Burns, who is also the chief U.S. negotiator on Gaza, said on Saturday that a more detailed ceasefire proposal would be made in the next several days.</p>

<p>The previous proposal put forward by U.S. President Joe Biden in June laid out a three-phase ceasefire in return for the release of Israeli hostages.</p>

<p>The recent war in Gaza started after Hamas militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7 killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's offensive has thus far killed at least 41,084 Palestinians and wounded 95,029 others, the Gaza health ministry says.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Germany's foreign ministry mocked US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's false assertion about immigrants eating pets in a post on the social platform X on Wednesday while pushing back against his criticism of German energy policy.</p>

<p>Trump amplified a false claim in Tuesday's debate with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris that numerous Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were stealing residents' pets or taking wildlife from parks for food.</p>

<p>He also attacked Harris' bid to move the country towards what she says will be a more diverse and sustainable mix of energy sources, saying Germany had tried and failed to give up fossil fuels.</p>

<p>"Like it or not: Germany's energy system is fully operational, with more than 50% renewables. And we are shutting down - not building - coal &amp; nuclear plants. Coal will be off the grid by 2038 at the latest," the foreign ministry said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>

<p>"PS: We also don't eat cats and dogs. #Debate2024"</p>

<p>The economy ministry, which is also run by the Greens party, retweeted the post, saying: "New coal-fired power plants? No way!"</p>

<p>Chancellor Olaf Scholz has not directly endorsed Harris but praised her in July as a "competent and experienced politician who knows exactly what she is doing" and who could well win the US election.</p>

<p>Germany was a frequent focus of Trump's ire during his 2017-21 term as president due to its trade surplus with the United States and low spending on defence.</p>

<p>Trump vows to impose higher tariffs on imports if elected and to condition US support for members of the NATO military alliance on them spending the agreed 2% of GDP on defence. German officials have said they expect to meet the 2% target this year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's foreign minister said on Wednesday that Tehran had not delivered any ballistic missiles to Russia and sanctions imposed on Iran by the United States and three European powers would not solve any problems between them.</p>

<p>"Once again, US and E3 act on faulty intelligence and flawed logic. Iran has NOT delivered ballistic missiles to Russia. Period... Sanctions are not a solution, but part of problem," Minister Abbas Araqchi said in a post on X.</p>

<p>The E3 comprises of Britain, Germany and France.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday that Russia had received ballistic missiles from Iran and was likely to use them in Ukraine within weeks. Cooperation between Moscow and Tehran threatened wider European security, he said.</p>

<p>The United States, Germany, Britain and France on Tuesday imposed new sanctions on Iran, including measures against its national airline Iran Air.</p>

<p>The Kremlin on Wednesday dismissed reports that Iran had shipped missiles to Russia, saying claims about various arms transfers were baseless.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Netherlands summoned the Iranian ambassador, and Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp said on X that it was calling for "new, robust EU sanctions".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia and Ukraine will have to resolve their conflict by negotiating off the battlefield and India is willing to advise them, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishakar's remarks came at a time when National Security Adviser Ajit Doval is in Moscow for a crucial meeting of NSAs. Sources have said that Mr Doval is carrying a peace plan proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which he will share with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

</div>

<p>Whether or not Russia and Ukraine accept India's proposal is not known yet, but India has offered to help end the conflict. During his visit to Ukraine, PM Modi told President Volodymyr Zelensky that India is ever ready to play an "active role" in every effort to restore peace and he would like to contribute personally in ending the conflict.</p>

<p>PM Modi is perhaps one of the very few leaders who shares friendly ties with both Mr Putin and Mr Zelensky and was warmly welcomed by both leaders during his recent visits to both nations.</p>

<p>The foreign minister was speaking at the Annual Ambassadors' Conference of the German Foreign Office in Berlin, a day after he held a "useful conversation" with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov at the margins of the India-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) foreign ministers' meeting in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>"We don't think this conflict is going to be resolved on the battlefield. At some stage, there's going to be some negotiation. When there is a negotiation, the main parties - Russia and Ukraine - have to be at that negotiation," Mr Jaishankar said.</p>

<p>He cited Prime Minister Modi's visits to Russia and Ukraine and how the Indian leader had once told the Russian President that this was not "an era of war".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We don't think you're going to get a solution out of the battlefield. If you want advice, we are always willing to give it," Mr Jaishankar added.</p>

<p>The minister also spoke about Quad, which he said has been a successful experiment. Quad is a strategic security dialogue between India, United States, Australia and Japan.</p>

<p>"We have revived the Quad. It is a major diplomatic platform and India is committed to it," he said.</p>

<p>Notably, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that India is among the three countries he is constantly in touch over the Ukraine conflict and said they are sincerely making efforts to resolve it.</p>

<p>"If there is a desire of Ukraine to carry on with the negotiations, I can do that." Mr Putin's remarks came within two weeks after Prime Minister Modi's historic visit to Ukraine, where he held talks with President President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>

<p>"We respect our friends and partners, who, I believe, sincerely seek to resolve all issues surrounding this conflict, primarily China, Brazil and India. I constantly keep in touch with our colleagues on this issue," Mr Putin was quoted as saying by Russia's TASS news agency.</p>

<p>Last week, Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told daily newspaper Izvestia that India could help in establishing a dialogue on Ukraine.</p>

<p>He spoke about the "highly constructive, even friendly relations" between PM Modi and President Putin and added the Indian leader can "lead the line on getting first-hand information from the participants in this conflict," as he "freely communicates with Putin, Zelensky and the Americans."</p>

<p>"This gives a great opportunity for India to throw its weight in world affairs, to use its influence that would drive the Americans and Ukrainians towards using a greater political will and entering the peaceful settlement track," Mr Peskov said, adding that there are "no specific plans" for PM Modi to mediate on the issue.</p>

<p>PM Modi, on his visit to Ukraine last month, told President Volodymyr Zelensky that both Ukraine and Russia should sit together without wasting time to end the ongoing war and that India was ready to play an "active role" to restore peace in the region.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar also talked about India's relations with China at the conference in Berlin, saying that India is not "closed to business from China", but the issue is in which sectors the country does business with Beijing and on what terms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military said Wednesday that an army helicopter crashed in the south of war-ravaged Gaza overnight, killing two soldiers and injuring seven.</p>

<p>"An initial inquiry... indicates that the crash was not caused by enemy fire... Two IDF (Israeli) soldiers were killed as a result of the crash," the military said in a statement, adding that the seven injured had been evacuated to hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>The military said it was investigating the cause of the crash, which occurred when the helicopter was landing near the southern city of Rafah.</p>

<p>The latest deaths bring the military's losses in the Gaza campaign to 344 since the start of the ground offensive on October 27.</p>

<p>The war erupted after Hamas operatives attacked southern Israel on October 7, resulting in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures, which also include hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>During the attack, Hamas operatives abducted 251 people, 97 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 41,020 people, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not provide details of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>The United Nations human rights office says most of the dead in Gaza are women and children.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Twelve-year-old Heba Dawas lost her footwear in the chaos while fleeing Israel's military offensive in Gaza. So her carpenter father made wooden-soled sandals for her so she can tread more safely through the tonnes of rubble.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twelve-year-old Heba Dawas lost her footwear in the chaos while fleeing Israel's military offensive in Gaza.</p>

<p>So her carpenter father made wooden-soled sandals for her so she can tread more safely through the tonnes of rubble, hot sand and twisted metal of the besieged Palestinian enclave.</p>

<p>"When we were displaced, we started running and the sandals broke," said Heba, who lives in a tent camp with her family in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis.</p>

<p>"I threw them off and started running. Our feet became very hot. So, we had to make sandals from wood," she said, walking on hot sand with her new footwear.</p>

<p>Her father Saber Dawas, 39, came up with the idea after finding the price of sandals too expensive. Now his daughter does not have to go barefoot amid the ruins of Gaza.</p>

<p>"I had to make a tailored size for each daughter," he said.</p>

<p><strong>SANDALS IN DEMAND</strong></p>

<p>Soon enough, his neighbours noticed him making the sandals and started asking him to make some for their children.</p>

<p>Using basic carpentry tools, he made them for "a symbolic price," he says.</p>

<p>The sandals have a wooden sole and a strap made of a rubber strip or fabric. But there was a challenge in finding more wood because Palestinians needed it for cooking and fires.</p>

<p>"Everything here in Gaza is difficult to find," Dawas said, rubbing the base of a sandal with one of his young daughters watching by his side.</p>

<p>Making wooden sandals may ease the pressure of the war but life is still fraught with challenges in Gaza, where the Israeli offensive against Hamas has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry.</p>

<p>Nearly 2 million people have been displaced, often repeatedly, Gazan health officials say.</p>

<p>Hamas triggered the war on October 7 when the Palestinian group attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking over 250 hostage, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>A humanitarian crisis has gripped Gaza since then with Palestinians struggling to find food, water and fuel as they move up and down the territory seeking a safe place to shelter.</p>

<p>The United States, Qatar and Egypt have failed to secure a ceasefire through mediation after many attempts.</p>

<p>The border crossing with Egypt has been shut, bringing the flow of aid and basic goods such as shoes to a halt.</p>

<p>"People now are walking around with mismatched shoes," said Momen al-Qarra, a Palestinian cobbler repairing old shoes in a little market in Khan Younis.</p>

<p>"If the situation continues like this for two weeks or a month at the most, without the opening of the border, people will be barefoot."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Astronomers have detected two closely spaced supermassive black holes in the galaxy MCG-03-34-64, located 800 million light-years away.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Astronomers have been observing one of the most curious cosmic incidents: the possible collision between supermassive black holes in the nearby galaxy MCG-03-34-64, approximately 800 million light-years away, according to <em>Universe Today.</em> Using the Hubble Space Telescope, three bright optical 'hot spots' were identified in this galaxy. Following this observation with Chandra X-ray Observatory and radio data, scientists have established that two of these hot spots would be more likely caused by a pair of closely spaced supermassive black holes.</p>

<p>The discovery provides a rare snapshot of galaxy collisions in the modern universe. The two black holes are expected to meet their demise in about one hundred million years, sending gravitational waves rippling through space and triggering vigorous galactic activity, including bursts of star formation.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.universetoday.com/168439/two-supermassive-black-holes-on-a-collision-course-with-each-other/#more-168439">the news portal, </a>understanding the merger of close-together AGNs such as the ones seen in MCG-03-34-64 offers a unique window into the final stages of what astronomers call "SMBH binary coalescence." Such events are and will continue to be a major way to measure the effects of these mergers. They'll offer a rich field of study using observatories sensitive to light across the spectrum, as well as future gravitational wave detectors.</p>

<p>This result is of much use to provide insight into the very last stages of mergers of black holes and glimpses into future gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA. The study helps clarify several concepts about galaxy evolution and those that involve supermassive black holes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A report by an investigative site reveals that Russian President Vladimir Putin has two sons with former Olympic gymnast Alina Kabaeva.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and his rumoured partner, former Olympic gymnast Alina Kabaeva, have two sons-ages five and nine-according to <em>the Dossier Centre</em>, a report in <em>Forbes</em> claimed. The outlet has attributed the info to a Russian investigative organisation that cited unnamed sources who claimed to regularly see the children.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://dossier.center/succession-en/">The<em> portal </em></a>claims that the couple's children are growing up in a highly secured residence in complete privacy. The boys live a solitary existence away from the spotlight and seldom see their parents.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/vladimir-putin-buys-luxury-mansion-shares-it-with-girlfriend-alina-kabaeva-report-3826223"><strong>Also Read | Vladimir Putin Buys Luxury Mansion, Shares It With "Girlfriend" Alina Kabaeva: Report</strong></a></p>

<p>Mr Putin, 71, has <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://en.putin.kremlin.ru/bio/page-3">declared in public</a> that he is the father of two daughters, Maria, 39, and Katerina, 38, with his former spouse Lyudmila Putin, whom he wed in 1983.</p>

<p><em>The Dossier Centre </em>claims Ms Kabaeva and Mr Putin started dating in 2008, which was six years prior to the official end of his divorce from Lyudmila. According to the report, Ms Kabaeva, 41, gave birth to Ivan in a maternity centre in Lugano, Switzerland, and to Vladimir Jr in Moscow.</p>

<p>Both Ivan and Vladimir Jr live in Mr Putin's mansion northwest of Moscow, though they have no interaction with other children their age, the Dossier Centre report claimed, and they receive music lessons and have personal trainers for swimming and artistic gymnastics.</p>

<p>Ivan has reportedly competed in artistic gymnastics competitions and often plays in hockey matches with his father.</p>

<p>Last year, a report about Russian President Vladimir Putin secretly spending millions on his girlfriend to buy big properties for her and their young children came out. <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/02/28/putin-secretly-living-gymnast-girlfriend-children-luxury-mansion/">The Telegraph</a>&nbsp;</em>claimed that the leader allegedly funnelled millions in illicit funds to buy a big mansion and a large penthouse for his girlfriend, Alina Kabaeva.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump has revealed his initial plans, should he be voted to power in the 2024 US presidential election. Mr Trump said he will set up a task force shortly after assuming office, aimed at conducting a thorough financial and performance audit of the entire federal government.</p>

<p>Donald Trump went on to say that once the audit is complete, the new task force will then make recommendations for drastic reforms, which he believes, is the need of the hour.</p>

<p>Elaborating his plan about the committee and who will head it, Donald Trump said that SpaceX, Tesla and X CEO Elon Musk shall head the task force, adding that Mr Musk has already agreed to take up the responsibility. A video of Donald Trump announcing this was shared on social media website X by local media outlet CSpan News Network.</p>

<p>Elon Musk too, welcomed Donald Trump's decision stating that such a move is "badly needed."</p>

<p>Talking more about his plans for the United States, Mr Trump said he aims to "Make America the world's capital for crypto and bitcoin." He also said he plans to eliminate at least ten old regulations and will bring in ten new ones to replace them.</p>

<p>Addressing the Economic Club of New York, Donald Trump said on September 5, "To stop this onslaught at lower prices, I'm pledging today that in my second term we will eliminate a minimum of ten old regulations. For every one new regulation, we'll be able to do that quite easily. Actually, and instead of attacking industries of the future, we will embrace them, including making America the world capital for crypto and bitcoin."</p>

<p>Donald Trump heaped praise on Elon Musk saying, "At the suggestion of Elon Musk, who has given me his complete and total endorsement, that's a nice smart guy. He knows what he's doing. Very much appreciated. I will create a Government Efficiency Commission task with conducting a complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government and making recommendations for drastic reforms we need to do. It can't go on the way we are now. And Elon, because he's not very busy, has agreed to head that task force, be interesting if he has the time be good one to do it, but he's agreed," Donald Trump said.</p>

<p>Mr Trump spoke about how improper and fraudulent payments cost US taxpayers an estimated "hundreds of billions of dollars" in 2022. He announced that the commission will create an action plan to eliminate payments within months and added that it will "save trillions of dollars", according to the video posted by CSpan on X.</p>

<p>Donald Trump said, "In 2022, fraud and improper payments alone cost taxpayers an estimated hundreds of billions of dollars. As the first order of business, this commission will develop an action plan to totally eliminate fraud and improper payments within six months. This will save trillions of dollars trillions. It's massive for the same service that you have right now, trillions of dollars is wasted and gone, and nobody knows where it went further, taming inaction and bringing prices way down."</p>

<p>He also pledged to make 'Trump tax cuts' permanent and announced that there will be no tax on tips. He alleged that US Vice President Kamala Harris copied his plan and announced to impose no tax on tips. He claimed that Kamala Harris will not move ahead with it and will stick to her plan.</p>

<p>Mr Trump said, "The 5th pillar of my plan is to make the Trump tax cuts permanent. They are massive tax cuts, biggest ever permanent and to cut tax even more, and we will have no tax on tips, something which they copied four weeks after I said it. She got upset and said no tax on tips. I said I just said that she is actually copying a lot of my plan. In fact, we're going to send her a MAGA sometime in the next week....But we also know she doesn't mean it. She's going to stick with what has been about and also no tax on Social security benefits."</p>

<p>Pledging to save social security, Donald Trump said that he will not impose tax on the benefits of people in social security, stressing that they have been wiped out by inflation.</p>

<p>Mr Trump said, "People in social security have been wiped out by inflation and now on top of it, we tax their benefits. We're not going to tax their benefits. We have so many different ways of making so much money. This country, the potential is so incredible. We don't have to take it away from people on social security. We're not going to do that. We're going to save social security. She's going to destroy Social Security."</p>

<p>The former US President said that his administration has proved that targeted tax cuts do not increase the deficit. He said that it reduces the deficit by growing the economy and raising revenue, according to the video posted by CSpan on X.</p>

<p>He said, "After we gave the massive tax cuts, we took in the following year with a much lower rate. Billions and billions of dollars more than we did the previous year with a high rate, think of that. So, with a much lower rate, we took in more money because people were incentivised."</p>

<p>Speaking about reducing the corporate tax burden, Mr Trump said he plans to reduce the corporate tax rate from 21 per cent to 15 per cent for companies that make their product in the US.</p>

<p>"Corporate tax revenues are 31 per cent higher today than before, my tax law was signed with all of those cuts 31 percent higher. To further support the revival of American manufacturing, my plan calls for expanded R&amp;D tax credits, 100 percent bonus depreciation, expensing for no manufacturing investments, and a reduction in corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 15 per cent solely for companies that make their product in America," he said.</p>

<p>Responding to the video which shows Donald Trump announcing his plans, Elon Musk took to X to post, "This is badly needed."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American space agency NASA has confirmed that early on Wednesday afternoon, over Luzon Island in the Philippines, a minor asteroid, about the size of a meter, broke apart in Earth's atmosphere.</p>

<p>Astronomers in Arizona initially discovered the space rock, known as 2024 RW1, a few hours before it entered the Earth. There was a brilliant flare in the sky as the asteroid burnt up over the Philippine shore.</p>

<p>2024 RW1 is only the ninth asteroid to be detected before impact, according to the European Space Agency. The incident strengthens astronomers' increasing capacity to foresee the presence of near-Earth objects.</p>

<p>The beautiful celestial event was caught on camera and shared on social media: an orange tail that vanished fast and a green fireball that flashed, lighting up the sky behind clouds. A bright green flame could be seen blazing across the Philippines in many of the internet videos.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2017-05/pakistan-flag_650x400_71493967261.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>On August 26, one of the bloodiest attacks in Pakistan's Balochistan province occurred, with over 70 people, including Pakistan Army soldiers, reportedly killed by the separatist group Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA). The date held significant meaning for Balochistan as it marked the 18th death anniversary of Nawab Akbar Bugti, a Baloch nationalist leader killed by the Pakistani military in 2006.</p>

<p>The BLA's Majeed Brigade, its suicide squad, conducted a coordinated attack across various parts of Balochistan. The assault involved blowing up infrastructure such as railway tracks and bridges and resulted in the deaths of migrant labourers from Punjab.</p>

<p>The Baloch rebellion in Pakistan stems from both historical and contemporary resentments, impacting stability in India and the broader region. Balochistan has a long history of political unrest, economic oppression, anti-Punjabi sentiment, enforced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings. These issues have rekindled the fight for Baloch nationalism. For two decades, the mineral-rich province has experienced low-level insurgency against Pakistan's central government, accompanied by brutal retaliatory actions.</p>

<p>Pakistan has described the recent attacks as a "nefarious scheme supported by external rivals to undermine its development ties with Beijing".</p>

<p>The BLA is considered the largest armed group in Balochistan, with thousands of members. It collaborates closely with the Baloch Liberation Front (BLF), another major separatist militant group advocating for Baloch self-determination. Both groups have been labelled as "terrorist organisations" by Pakistan.</p>

<h2><b>The 1999 Coup</b></h2>

<p>Many Baloch believe they were coerced into joining Pakistan in 1948. The princely state of Kalat, now part of Balochistan, briefly enjoyed independence before being 'forced' into accession with Pakistan. Apart from initial resistance, there were uprisings in 1958 and 1977 seeking either independence or greater autonomy.</p>

<p>Pervez Musharraf's military coup in 1999 further alienated the Baloch from Pakistan. Distrust of Punjabi dominance in the Pakistani army and bureaucracy, along with the lack of Baloch representation, has been a persistent issue. In one of Musharraf's counter-insurgency operations, Baloch leader Nawab Akbar Bugti was killed in 2006. Pakistan has not made significant efforts to integrate the region or address the local issues of its inhabitants.</p>

<p>"The Baloch have been alienated by the Pakistani state since the country's inception. This alienation has intensified over the past two decades due to Pakistan's failure to engage in meaningful reflection and its numerous cases of enforced disappearances, torture, and killings of Baloch activists," says Malik Siraj Akbar, a political analyst based in Washington, D.C.</p>

<h2><strong>How Things Stand Today</strong></h2>

<p>Balochistan is Pakistan's largest province by area but remains one of its most impoverished regions. Years of poverty, neglect, and mistreatment by the central government have fueled anger, which is exploited by separatists. Revenue from Balochistan's rich natural resources has been used to develop other parts of Pakistan, including Punjab and Sindh, which are more prosperous. Balochistan contributes only 4% to Pakistan's economy.</p>

<p>The province also lags in social development indicators, with the highest infant and maternal mortality rates, the highest poverty rate, and the lowest literacy rate in Pakistan.</p>

<p>There is no forum for dissent, as enforced disappearances of thousands of Balochs continue. Political parties in Balochistan, which previously formed most provincial governments, lost power in controversial elections. Later, Islamabad supported puppet leaders, worsening the situation.</p>

<p>"While Pakistan may appear to be a democratic state, real power rests with its military and intelligence agencies, which are primarily blamed for the violence in Balochistan," says Akbar. "Unless the military ends its illegal operations and is held accountable, any confidence-building measures with the Baloch and prospects for negotiations are unlikely," he adds.</p>

<p>Apart from using brutal force and repression, the Pakistani establishment has also failed to engage with civil rights movements in Balochistan. Resentment is so high that in the current uprising, the Baloch nationalist movement has garnered support from women, children, and the families of the missing persons, with some even joining the suicide bombers.</p>

<p>Baloch separatists are also opposed to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which passes through Balochistan and is seen as an example of exploitation. They have targeted Chinese workers as part of their resistance. Balochistan is a crucial location in China's multi-billion-dollar CPEC, part of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). In January, insurgents attacked government offices in Gwadar, a key hub for Chinese investments in energy and infrastructure. The BLA also targeted Pakistan's largest naval air force base.</p>

<p>The current insurgency is driven by the construction of Gwadar, a Chinese-funded project announced in 2001 intended to transform the small village into a port city like Dubai. The Pakistani government has excluded Baloch from the development process, employing Chinese engineers and non-Baloch Pakistani workers, fueling antipathy and violence. The Taliban's seizure of neighbouring Afghanistan has also enhanced the capabilities of armed groups in the region, including Baloch separatists.</p>

<h2><b>Pakistan Should Stop Blaming Others</b></h2>

<p>Pakistan has accused India of providing arms, training, and financial support to insurgent groups in Balochistan. India denies these allegations and has urged Pakistan to examine its own support for terrorism. In 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's remarks highlighting Pakistan's atrocities and repression of the Baloch people had sparked controversy in Islamabad.</p>

<p>India has been closely monitoring the situation in Balochistan and has expressed concerns about rising attacks in both Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan since the Taliban's return to Kabul. Pakistan needs to abandon the policy of rewarding those who attack Baloch nationalists and stop promoting conspiracy theories that India, Iran, and Afghanistan are behind all the tumult in Balochistan.</p>

<p>"Pakistan has mastered the art of externalising responsibility for its self-created problems. Unable to address the two-decade-long insurgency in Balochistan despite using brutal tactics similar to those in East Pakistan in 1971, Pakistan has intermittently blamed India for its troubles," says Tilak Devasher, a member of the National Security Advisory Board, India. "It has, however, failed to produce any evidence to substantiate its claims. Consequently, its assertions are not taken seriously by the international community," adds Devasher.</p>

<p>Pakistan must demonstrate political will to address the Balochistan issue by engaging with civil rights groups, involving Baloch in the development process, and alleviating their poverty and suffering. Meanwhile, India continues to observe the situation closely.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Researchers at Stanford University were able to peer into the bodies of living animals as they discovered that a common food dye made their skin, muscle and connective tissues temporarily transparent.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wouldn't the doctors have it easier if our skin were transparent and they could see everything beyond or underneath it? Sounds hypothetical, no? Even with advanced technologies and highly sophisticated imaging techniques, doctors get unclear results while peeking inside a living body. However, recent research showed this distant dream may soon be a reality, surprisingly by just applying a common food dye.</p>

<p>Researchers at <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2024/09/using-a-common-food-dye-researchers-made-mouse-skin-transparent">Stanford University</a> have managed to peer into the bodies of living animals with the help of common food dye, making their skin, muscle and connective tissues temporarily transparent, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/sep/05/common-food-dye-found-to-make-skin-and-muscle-temporarily-transparent?CMP=share_btn_url">The Guardian</a> reported.</p>

<p>Published in Science on September 5, the research details how rubbing the FDA-approved dye solution on a mouse's skin allowed the researchers to see through the skin, without making an incision. They were able to do this with the naked eye.<br />
<br />
The liver, intestines and bladder of the mouse were visible through the abdominal skin after the dye was applied to the belly. Not just that, the researchers even witnessed the blood vessels in the rodent's brain.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the treated skin regained its normal colour once the researchers washed off the dye.</p>

<p>“As soon as we rinsed and massaged the skin with water, the effect was reversed within minutes. It's a stunning result," said Guosong Hong, assistant professor of materials science and engineering.<br />
<br />
<strong>How does it work?</strong></p>

<p>The idea behind this echoes the approach of a character in the popular 1897 novel, The Invisible Man. In the science fiction novel, written by HG Wells, a scientist discovers how the secret to invisibility depends on matching the object's refractive index -- or the ability to bend light -- with that of the surrounding air.</p>

<p>When the light waves strike the biological tissue, it scatters them, thus making it appear opaque and non-transparent to the eye. The effects take place due to the difference in the refractive indices of various tissue components, like lipids and water. In the visible spectrum, water generally has a lower refractive index than lipids. This causes visible light to scatter while it passes through tissue containing both.</p>

<p>The researchers massaged a solution of red tartrazine on the sedated mouse's abdomen, scalp, and hindlimb to match the refractive indices of various tissue components.</p>

<p>Soon after, the rodent's skin turned red, indicating that much of the blue light got absorbed due to the light-absorbing molecule's presence, the study states.</p>

<p>The increase in absorption further altered the refractive index of water at different wavelengths -- which was red in this case. As a result, the refractive index of water matched with that of lipids in the red spectrum. Ultimately, this led to reduced scattering and made the mouse's skin appear more transparent at the red wavelength.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A California man has&nbsp;been arrested&nbsp;after his nighttime shooting spree left over 80 animals dead, sparking panic among residents. The incident occurred on Tuesday in Prunedale, a rural community roughly 100 miles south of San Francisco. The sheriff's office responded to reports of gunfire and issued a shelter-in-place order for residents within a five-mile radius, according to a report in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/us/california-man-kills-animals-shooting.html">NYT</a>.</p>

<p>The suspect, 39-year-old Vicente Joseph Arroyo of Salinas, was taken into custody after<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8efwX7W2t2s&amp;authuser=1"> firing multiple weapons</a>&nbsp;for over three hours in a vineyard. Law enforcement described the scene as&nbsp;extremely&nbsp;dark and heavily vegetated, making it challenging to locate the suspect immediately.</p>

<p>Officers from several agencies eventually tracked down Arroyo and found his vehicle crashed along a vineyard road by dawn. He&nbsp;was arrested&nbsp;without resistance. A search of the area revealed a large cache of firearms, including rifles, shotguns, handguns and an illegal assault weapon. The authorities also found a stockpile of ammunition and bulletproof vests at the scene.</p>

<p>Among&nbsp;the animals killed were miniature horses, goats, rabbits, chickens and various birds, according to Commander Andres Rosas of the Monterey County Sheriff's Office.&nbsp;Most animals were kept&nbsp;in pens on rented land adjacent to Arroyo's trailer. While some initially survived, many had to&nbsp;be euthanised&nbsp;due to severe injuries. Authorities confirmed the animals did not belong to Arroyo but were the property of a neighbouring landowner and a tenant who rented the land.</p>

<p>Following his arrest, Arroyo&nbsp;was booked&nbsp;on multiple charges, including animal cruelty, wilful discharge of a firearm, illegal possession of an assault weapon and vandalism. His bail was Initially set at $50,000 (around Rs 41.96 lakh) but&nbsp;was then raised&nbsp;to $1,000,000 (around Rs 8.39 crore), stated a report in <a href="https://www.ktvu.com/news/california-man-arrested-after-killing-80-animals-sheriff">KTVU FOX 2</a>.</p>

<p>The report quoted Commander Rosas as saying, “I've been doing this for 24 plus years now, and no, I've unfortunately never seen anything like this when it comes to animal life lost.”</p>

<p>The incident has left the small community of Prunedale in shock. Jason Maynard, a resident, described the chaos of that night, telling KSBW that upon hearing the gunshots, he instructed his wife and child to get down on the floor for safety.</p>

<p>The reports added that officials have not yet identified a motive for the shooting.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A US woman, suspected of killing two of her children, attended her extradition hearing in London on Wednesday, reported BBC. Kimberlee Singler, 36, is accused of murdering her son Aden, 7, and daughter Elianna, 9.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US woman, suspected of killing two of her children, attended her extradition hearing in London on Wednesday,<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gqyerxjnyo"> reported BBC</a>. Kimberlee Singler, 36, is accused of murdering her son Aden, 7, and daughter Elianna, 9. The two kids were found dead in their bedrooms on December 19, 2023 in the state of Colorado.</p>

<p>Singler allegedly also stabbed her oldest kid, who was eleven years old at the time. She, however, survived the attack and underwent an emergency surgery after which, she was moved into foster care. Singler has denied all the accusations in court.</p>

<p>Singler was arrested in London on December 30, 2023 after an arrest warrant was issued against her by Colorado police. She faces seven&nbsp;charges, including two counts of first-degree murder, one count of attempted murder, three counts of child abuse, and one act of assault.</p>

<p>The father of the children claims he and his ex-wife <a href="http://https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/colorado-springs-mother-kimberlee-singler-attends-hearing-london-after-deaths-2-children/">Singler have been embroiled in a bitter divorce and custody battle since 2018.</a> A Larimer County Court ruled that the children would spend more time with their father.</p>

<p>Singler was supposed to bring the kids for the exchange on December 16 but she never came and efforts to get in touch went in vain. According to investigators, Singler killed her youngest daughter and son on December 18 last year.</p>

<p>She called the police early on December 19 on the pretext of a burglary investigation. Upon reaching the residence, the officers discovered two dead children and one with a severe neck injury, who was immediately taken to the hospital.</p>

<p>The prosecution stated that a "blood-stained handgun" was found on the bedroom floor and live rounds and spent cartridges were recovered from the closet. There was also a blood-stained knife discovered in the home's living room.</p>

<p>Kimberlee Singler's London hearing is expected to last three days. The UK home secretary will decide whether or not to extradite her to the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India has overtaken the US to become the world's second-biggest 5G handset market for the first time, behind China, a report has mentioned.</p>

<p>Global 5G handset shipments grew 20 per cent (year-on-year) in the first half of 2024, according to the Counterpoint Research. Apple led the 5G handset shipments, accounting for more than 25 per cent share.</p>

<p>Apple led the 5G handset shipments globally, accounting for more than 25 per cent share, driven by strong shipments of the iPhone 15 series and 14 series, reported news agency IANS.</p>

<p>5G handset shipments have been growing steadily and with the increased availability of 5G handsets in the budget segment, the emerging markets have witnessed high growth in this segment.</p>

<p>"India became the second-biggest 5G handset market during the first half, overtaking the US. The strong shipments from Xiaomi, Vivo, Samsung and other brands in the budget segment were the main reason for this trend," said senior analyst Prachir Singh.</p>

<p>Samsung followed in the second position, capturing more than 21 per cent share, driven by the Galaxy A series and S24 series. Apple and Samsung took five spots each in the top-10 list for 5G models in the first half of 2024, with Apple taking the top four spots.</p>

<p>Other emerging markets also witnessed high growth in 5G handsets. Consumers in emerging markets are looking at 5G handsets as an upgrade to their devices, even in the lower price segments.</p>

<p>Asia-Pacific accounted for 63 per cent of the overall global net adds and commanded a 58 per cent 5G shipment share. In Europe and the Middle East and Africa (MEA) regions also, 5G handset shipments witnessed double-digit growth.</p>

<p>Research Director Tarun Pathak said that as the democratisation of 5G handsets increases with increasing 5G penetration in lower price segments as well as increasing expansion of 5G networks, this trend will further grow.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The fintech firm backed by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has made a foray into products powered by artificial intelligence after announcing a "life assistant" mobile app.</p>

<p>Ant Group said its Zhixiaobao app can help users "order meals, hail taxis, book tickets, and discover local dining and entertainment options" as well as access services in the digital payment app Alipay.</p>

<p>Unveiled in Shanghai on Thursday, comes as tech giants such as Google, Meta and Microsoft ramp up investment in the AI market, with many firms touting tighter integration of chatbots.</p>

<p>"Alipay is committed to harnessing AI's potential to improve the user experience, ensuring that AI assistants like Zhixiaobao become valuable tools in everyday life for all," Ant Group president Cyril Han said in a news release.</p>

<p>Since Ant's initial public offering was scrapped by Chinese authorities in 2020, the firm has been forced to overhaul its business model to satisfy financial regulators.</p>

<p>Last year, it was fined 7.1 billion yuan (US$984 million) for "illegal" acts months after its billionaire founder Jack Ma relinquished control.</p>

<p>The Hangzhou-based company saw its profits fall 10 percent in the January-March quarter, Bloomberg News reported, adding that Ant's valuation has fallen more than 70 percent since the aborted IPO.</p>

<p>Ant on Thursday described its new product as an "AI-native application powered by Ant Group's BaiLing foundation model", referring to the company's large language model.</p>

<p>The Chinese government gave the green light last year for Ant to offer products that used BaiLing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the Shanghai event, the firm also announced AI-powered products for merchants, healthcare service users and insurance</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The family of 70-year-old William Bryan accused Dr Thomas Shaknovsky of removing the wrong organ from his body.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Florida doctor has been accused of removing the wrong organ from a man's body, resulting in his death. The family of William "Bill" Bryan, 70, claimed that surgeon Dr Thomas Shaknovsky mistakenly removed Bryan's liver instead of the spleen,&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/04/alabama-man-death-wrong-organ-surgery" rel="nofollow,noindex">reported The Guardian</a>. As of Wednesday, Shaknovsky has not been charged but the law firm appointed by Bryan's family stated that they planned to move the court.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the law firm, Bryan visited the Ascension Sacred Heart Emerald Coast Hospital on August 18 after experiencing pain in his flank area. The patient and his wife Beverly were given a rundown of the "risks, benefits, and alternatives" of the surgery before he underwent a splenectomy under surgeon Thomas Shaknovsky on August 21. However, instead of removing Bryan's spleen as intended, the doctor removed his liver, resulting in his untimely death.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"Dr Shaknovsky removed Mr Bryan's liver and, in so doing, transected the major vasculature supplying the liver, causing immediate and catastrophic blood loss resulting in death,” read the statement. "The surgeon proceeded with labeling the removed liver specimen as a 'spleen,' and it wasn't until following the death that it was identified that the organ removed was Mr Bryan's liver, as opposed to the spleen."</p>

<p>The lawyers also claimed that Shaknovsky had a history of "wrong-site surgery". In 2023, the surgeon mistakenly removed a portion of a patient's pancreas instead of performing the intended adrenal gland resection. The law firm claimed the matter was settled and the terms were not made public. Beverly Bryan stated she hired the legal team to pursue "justice" for her husband.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In a statement, she said, “My husband died while helpless on the operating room table by Dr Shaknovsky. I don't want anyone else to die due to his incompetence at a hospital that should have known or knew he had previously made drastic, life-altering surgical mistakes.” She is pursuing both civil and criminal actions in the case.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The Ascension Sacred Heart Emerald Coast Hospital has also released a statement, saying it “take[s] allegations like this very seriously, and our leadership team is performing a thorough investigation into this event”.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It was around 8:30 or 9 in the evening on the last day of 1999. I was in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, and was visiting a fellow Bihari friend, Tabish Khair - now an established novelist and poet - to celebrate the New Year festivities. While waiting for others to get ready, I switched on the TV to get an update on IC 814, an Indian Airlines plane hijacked eight days earlier with 155 passengers on board. The news was that the terrible saga had ended, and all passengers had been freed. But, of course, their freedom was secured in exchange for the release of three terrorists.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two of them released from jail were known in India - Maulana Masood Azhar (founder of terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed) and Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar (Al Umar Mujahideen). But except the police and intelligence agencies, only a few had heard of the third person: Omar Saeed Sheikh. Just two years later, Sheikh would become infamous worldwide for kidnapping and beheading a US journalist. He also nearly caused a diplomatic crisis between India and Pakistan following the November 26 terror attacks in Mumbai in 2008.</p>

<h2><strong>The Kidnapping Of 3 Westerners</strong></h2>

<p>The Netflix web series <em>IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack</em> has sparked a controversy over names and the portrayal of a few of the hijackers. But it has taken me back to my chance encounter with Sheikh.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The year was 1994. My cameraman and I were out to cover a story for a Delhi-based TV channel; it was going through dry runs before the launch. We had barely reached Ghaziabad when we witnessed elaborate security arrangements outside a private hospital. The road was cordoned off. We were told that a terrorist was admitted to the hospital after being wounded in a police encounter in Saharanpur the previous night, during which a police inspector had been shot dead.</p>

<p>Security was tighter inside the hospital. But some smooth-talking with an amiable Uttar Pradesh '<em>daroga ji</em>' did the trick. He allowed us in on the condition that we would brief him on our conversation with the man inside, Omar Sheikh, whose English accent, he admitted, he did not understand. We rolled the camera as we entered the room, not knowing who Sheikh was and how big a catch he was for the police. The only piece of information we had was that the injured man had kidnapped three Britons and an American in Delhi and hid them in a house in Saharanpur on their way to Kashmir. He had told his captives that his name was Rohit Sharma, and that he was taking them to his quaint ancestral village in Kashmir. But when a Saharanpur police patrol party stumbled upon the captives, a shootout ensued. A police inspector was killed, and Sheikh got injured. All the captives though were freed.</p>

<h2><strong>Omar Sheikh, The London-Born, LSE-Educated Terrorist</strong></h2>

<p>The hospital was posh, Sheikh's room big and clean. He lay in bed with a bandage around his right shoulder. The camera was rolling as we came face to face with a tall and bearded young man, propped up against hospital pillows, looking puzzled and befuddled. His first reaction was to shout a barrage of questions at us, "Who are you, why are you here, who has sent you?".&nbsp;</p>

<p>We asked for an interview, but he refused to speak to us in protest because he said he had no prior notice we were going to do an interview with him. He relented after I produced my press ID card. Before the interview began, he told us his name and that he was 20 years old. He was a student at the prestigious London School of Economics (LSE). He also said he was born in London and was raised both there and in Lahore. His Pakistani immigrant parents lived in London, where they ran a clothes business.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the half-hour interview, Sheikh Omar looked extremely worried. He told me he would give anything to return to life in Britain. He also kept pleading with me, "Brother, take me out of here, please." During the interview, he revealed how at the age of 18, he had already done 'jihad' in Bosnia, fighting alongside and on behalf of Bosnian Muslims, who, he said, were being butchered by the Serbs. He was strikingly young and his accent was distinctly British. I thought he had the gift of the gab. I am not surprised he managed to lure foreign tourists and later, in 2002, used the same trick to lure American journalist Daniel Pearl into captivity.</p>

<h2><strong>Fooled by Extremists</strong></h2>

<p>He also recounted how he had been indoctrinated on the campus by an Islamist organisation that wanted to establish an Islamic society in Britain. He said he had been fooled by the hard-luck stories he had heard about the plight of Muslims and Kashmiris in India.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sheikh admitted that he was charged with kidnapping some foreign tourists to barter for Maulana Masood Azhar, who was then held in prison in India. He also admitted that he had been in Delhi for more than a month before the kidnapping and was struck by the religious freedom he saw. "I had been told that Muslims in India had no religious rights and Kashmiri Muslims were being subjected to torture and rape by the Hindu army," he said.</p>

<p>I asked him, if released, would he go back and tell people in Britain that Indian Muslims were free to build mosques, say prayers, and work in government offices? He said he would. He appeared repentant, but clearly not enough.</p>

<h2><b>Meeting Masood Azhar</b></h2>

<p>Why Omar Sheikh chose the path of destruction was hard to say. He was exposed to Islamist extremism at a tender age. But that doesn't fully explain the path he chose early in his life. He was privileged. He went to the private Forest School in London - the same school former cricketer Nasser Hussain studied in. But while Sheikh became a terrorist, Hussain went on to become the captain of the England cricket team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At LSE, Sheikh was known for his academic brilliance, especially in maths and economics. But he dropped out before completing his degree to join the 'jihad' in Bosnia. It is reported that he met a couple of Pakistani "fighters" there, who introduced him to Maulana Masood Azhar upon his return to Pakistan. He trained in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.</p>

<p>After his release, it's unclear where Sheikh went in Pakistan. According to some Pakistani papers, he lived in Lahore, where he married a local woman and had a child.</p>

<p>Until this time, Omar Sheikh was known mostly to Indian investigators and intelligence communities. His name cropped up at the time of his release in December 1999 from Tihar, but outside of India, he remained unknown.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Kidnapping Of Daniel Pearl</strong></h2>

<p>That changed after the kidnapping of American journalist Daniel Pearl. Suddenly, everyone wanted to know who Sheikh was. A foreign media outlet published my encounter with him, and I was inundated with requests for interviews by the Western media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sheikh was found guilty of kidnapping and murdering Pearl. He was given a death sentence, which was later turned into life imprisonment. According to a respected Pakistani journalist, who met a prison officer where Sheikh was lodged, Omar was shuttled regularly between Karachi and Hyderabad jails, spending a fortnight in each. The officer told the journalist that it was necessitated by the fact that he used his gift of the gab and often cast his spell on prison officials, who would then do him favours, like smuggling cellphones.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>When Sheikh Posed As Pranab Mukherjee</strong></h2>

<p>It is precisely this gift that once landed the authorities into hot water and led to a near diplomatic crisis between India and Pakistan. A year after the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, Karachi's Dawn newspaper ran an investigative story claiming that Sheikh had called the Pakistani President at the time, Asif Zardari, claiming to be India's then-foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee. It was reported that he used unparliamentary language on the call and threatened Zardari with dire consequences for the Mumbai attacks. The English daily claimed, "Omar Saeed Sheikh, a detained Pakistani militant, had made hoax calls to President Asif Ali Zardari and the Chief of Army Staff, Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, in a bid to heighten Pakistan-India tensions after last year's terrorist attacks on Mumbai, investigators have told Dawn."</p>

<p>A diplomatic crisis was averted after the call was traced to his cell in Hyderabad jail. The cell was raided, and it was found that Sheikh used a British SIM card to make the threatening calls.</p>

<p>Despite Daniel Pearl's wife, Mariane Pearl, writing a book, titled A Mighty Heart, and despite the book being made into a Hollywood film with the same title, the story of Omar Sheikh remains shrouded in mystery. In dozens of court appearances, he often appeared affable and charming, but not a lot of his terror connections have been confirmed.</p>

<h2><strong>Omar Sheikh Is Still A Mystery</strong></h2>

<p>Former dictator Pervez Musharraf called him a British spy in his autobiography. Omar himself boasted of his deep links to Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) in his off-the-cuff remarks to journalists during court hearings. He was known to have good relations with Jaish-e-Mohammed's Maulana Masood Azhar and Lashkar-e-Toiba's Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi. Some journalists, who investigated the roles terror outfits played in the &nbsp;9/11 attacks, claimed he was an operative of Al-Qaeda.</p>

<p>Omar is being held in jail despite his release order by the Supreme Court in Pakistan. It is believed the country has kept him in prison after re-arresting him because of international pressure. But some also claim that he is better off in jail, lest he reveal too much.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 72-year-old French woman, whose husband admitted to drugging her and inviting dozens of men to rape her over a decade, told a court that she was treated "like a rag doll" and was "sacrificed on the altar of vice".<br />
<br />
In a calm and clear voice, Gisele Pelicot, in the southern French city of Avignon, detailed the horror of how her husband Dominique Pelicot, 71, allegedly lined up scores of men to rape her while she was unconscious.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This happened close to 100 times in their home for nearly a decade, while her husband systematically filmed the suspected rapes and stored thousands of images as well as videos later found by the investigators.<br />
<br />
“I was sacrificed on the altar of vice... They regarded me like a rag doll, like a garbage bag... I no longer have an identity. I don't know if I will ever rebuild myself," she testified, as per a report in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/france-wife-rape-trial-gisele-dominique-pelicot-b2607529.html">The Independent</a>.<br />
<br />
She added, “For me, everything collapses. These are scenes of barbarity, of rape.”<br />
<br />
She said she was abused at least six times by someone, who was known to have HIV.<br />
<br />
“My life was in danger but not one second did anyone stop... I was tested for HIV as one man who came (to rape me) six times was seropositive,” Gisele told the court, testifying about the abuse inflicted on her between 2011 and 2020, <a href="http://https://nypost.com/2024/09/05/world-news/french-husband-accused-of-drugging-wife-allegedly-let-hiv-positive-attacker-rape-her-six-times/">New York Post</a> reported.<br />
<br />
<strong>Police 'saved my life'</strong><br />
<br />
The woman said the “police saved my life” after they investigated her husband's computer back in November 2020 after he was caught by a security guard filming up the skirts of women at a supermarket near their home in a village in southern France, <a href="http://https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/05/french-woman-world-fell-apart-alleged-rapes-men-invited-by-husband-gisele-pelicot">The Guardian</a> reported.<br />
<br />
Describing the moment the investigators first showed her the videos of images of sexual abuse orchestrated and filmed by her husband, Gisele Pelicot termed it as “an explosion, a tsunami”.<br />
<br />
“My world is falling apart. For me, everything is falling apart. Everything I have built up over 50 years... Frankly, these are scenes of horror for me,” she said while Dominique Pelicot kept listening to her in court with his head bowed.<br />
<br />
The report stated that while investigating the case, police saw a file, labelled "abuses" on the USB drive that was connected to Dominique Pelicot's computer. While searching the drive, officials found nearly 20,000 images and films of the woman getting raped almost 100 times.<br />
<br />
<strong>The crime</strong><br />
<br />
According to police, the accused husband used to crush sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication and mix them into his wife's meal or wine. He then used to invite men to rape her after contacting them through an online chatroom.<br />
<br />
Dominique Pelicot as well as 50 other men, aged between 26 and 74, are on trial, reports said.<br />
<br />
According to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/09/05/french-rape-trial-latest-updates/">The Telegraph</a>, the woman's husband and 14 other co-accused have admitted to rape, while 35 men, belonging to all walks of life, have denied the charges, claiming the woman was in some way consented to libertine sex.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 17 children died after a fire ripped through their primary school dormitory overnight in central Kenya, police said Friday.</p>

<p>The blaze in Nyeri county's Hillside Endarasha Academy broke out at around midnight, police said, engulfing rooms where the children were sleeping.</p>

<p>The primary school caters to some 800 pupils, aged between roughly five and 12.</p>

<p>"There are 17 fatalities from this incident and there are also others who were taken to hospital with serious injuries," national police spokesperson Resila Onyango told AFP.</p>

<p>"The bodies recovered at the scene were burnt beyond recognition," she said.</p>

<p>Police said the average age of the victims was around nine years old.</p>

<p>Several others were injured, Onyango said, 16 of them seriously, and had been rushed to a nearby hospital.</p>

<p>"More bodies are likely to be recovered once (the) scene is fully processed," she said.</p>

<p>The cause of the fire remains unknown, she said, but an investigation had been launched.</p>

<p>President William Ruto expressed his condolences for those killed.</p>

<p>"Our thoughts are with the families of the children who have lost their lives in the fire tragedy," he said in a post on X.</p>

<p>"This is devastating news."</p>

<p>He said he had instructed officials to "thoroughly investigate this horrific incident", and promised that those responsible will be "held to account".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The school is located around 170 kilometres (100 miles) north of the capital Nairobi, in Nyeri county.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Kenyan Red Cross said it was on the ground assisting a multi-agency response team.</p>

<p>In a post on X, it said it was "providing psychosocial support services to the pupils, teachers and affected families".</p>

<h2>Deadly blazes</h2>

<p>There have been numerous school fires in Kenya and across East Africa.</p>

<p>In 2016, nine students were killed by a fire at a girls' high school in the Kibera neighbourhood of Nairobi.</p>

<p>In 2001, 67 pupils were killed by an arson attack on their dormitory at the Kyanguli Mixed Secondary School David Mutiso in Kenya's southern Machakos district.</p>

<p>Two pupils were charged with the murder, and the headmaster and deputy of the school were convicted of negligence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1994, 40 school children were burned alive and 47 injured in a fire that ravaged the Shauritanga Secondary School for Girls in the northern region of Kilimanjaro in Tanzania.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An EasyJet flight, bound for Kos International Airport in Greece, was forced to make an emergency landing at Munich International Airport after an allegedly drunk passenger caused midair chaos and terrorised others onboard. According to the <em>New York Post,</em> the incident took place on Tuesday. The trouble began about two hours after flight U28235 took off from London Gatwick Airport. As the Airbus A320 flew through some turbulence during the scheduled four-hour flight, the passenger, who was clearly intoxicated, stood up to disrupt the flight and also berated the Captain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A video shared on X by @FlightModeblog captured the dramatic aftermath. In the clip, passengers were seen erupting into cheers, with some even shouting, "Get off, you loser", as German police escorted the rowdy traveller off the plane. Another passenger also received applause for reportedly holding the man down until the Captain landed the plane safely.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/05/world-news/easyjet-flight-makes-emer/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>The Post</em></a>, EasyJet said that the emergency landing stemmed from a "passenger behaving disruptively on board".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The outlet reported that the passenger, whose identity hasn't been revealed, got into a war of words with other passengers. He even broke the onboard intercom and fought with the flight crew, which led to a brawl and the traveller being detained.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Safety is easyJet's highest priority and our cabin crew are trained to assess and act quickly and appropriately in all situations to ensure that the safety of the flight and other passengers is not compromised at any time," the airline told <em>The Post</em>. "While such incidents are rare, we take them very seriously and do not tolerate abusive or threatening behaviour onboard," it added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The remaining passengers, on the other hand, disembarked the plane and received hotel and meal accommodations overnight before the flight departed for Greece on Wednesday. "While this was outside of our control, we are sorry for the inconvenience caused," the airline said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in another incident, a US man was arrested in August for his alleged disruptive and life-threatening behaviour on an American Airlines flight. Twenty-six-year-old Eric Nicholas Gapco, travelling on flight 2101 from Seattle to Dallas on July 18, exhibited what authorities described as "unruly" behaviour.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apart from propositioning a female crew member for sex, Gapco also reportedly attempted to open the plane's door mid-flight multiple times, forcing the emergency landing. According to the outlet, he removed his shirt mid-flight and began inhaling on a vape pen while cursing and hitting on a crew member, proposing to her for sex. The passenger also allegedly assaulted a flight attendant.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A team of US researchers on Friday said that they have found a connection between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and night time light pollution from the outdoors.</p>

<p>Researchers at Rush University Medical Center, US have found that night time light pollution is more strongly correlated with the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in people aged under 65, than other risk factors like alcohol abuse, chronic kidney disease, depression, and obesity.</p>

<p>“We show that there is a positive association between AD prevalence and exposure to light at night, particularly in those under the age of 65. Nightly light pollution – a modifiable environmental factor, may be an important risk factor for AD,” said Dr Robin Voigt-Zuwala, Associate Professor at Rush University Medical Center.</p>

<p>Other risk factors, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and stroke, were more strongly associated with AD than light pollution.</p>

<p>However, for people under 65, higher night time light intensity was associated with a greater AD prevalence than any other risk factor.</p>

<p>This could be due to individual differences in light sensitivity and lifestyles in urban areas.</p>

<p>“Awareness of the association should empower people – particularly those with risk factors for AD – to make easy lifestyle changes. Easy to implement changes include using blackout curtains or sleeping with eye masks. This is useful, especially for those living in areas with high light pollution,” noted Dr Voigt-Zuwala.</p>

<p>The researchers hope that their findings can help educate people about the potential risks of light at night and encourage lifestyle changes to prevent the onset of diseases like Alzheimer's and other debilitating conditions.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Nga Wai Hono I Te Po was anointed as the new Maori Queen in New Zealand on Thursday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nga Wai Hono I Te Po was anointed as the new Maori Queen in New Zealand on Thursday. The decision was taken by a council of the Indigenous Maori chief after the death of King Kiingi Tuheitia Potatau Te Wherowhero VII. Although the monarch is primarily a ceremonial role and has little official authority, it is still regarded by many tribes as the supreme chief.<br />
<br />
<strong>Role and responsibilities</strong><br />
<br />
<a href="http://https://monarchy.org.nz/home/kingitanga/">As per the official Monarchy New Zealand website</a>, the role of the Maori monarch is different from that of the King of New Zealand. However, the role of monarchy remains important.<br />
<br />
"When Kingitanga, the Maori King movement, was established in 1858, it was hoped that by creating a King, Maori tribes could deal with the settlers on a more equal political footing," reads the website.<br />
<br />
The current <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-new-zealand-s-new-maori-queen-5-points-on-nga-wai-hono-i-te-po-paki-6495087">Maori Queen</a>, Nga Wai Hono I Te Po, has a major symbolic function but no constitutional role. The Maori King or Queen is the paramount chief of several tribes, or iwi, but is not affiliated with all of them, according to Reuters.<br />
<br />
The Queen -- like her predecessor -- has no judicial or legal authority in New Zealand.<br />
<br />
The <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/new-zealands-maori-crowned-new-queen-after-fathers-death-6494926">Maori monarchy </a>might be old, but it is not an outdated institution and is still relevant. It persists as a lasting manifestation of unity. It is fundamental to Maori communities' cultural and social identities as well as the larger New Zealand identity.<br />
<br />
The Kingitanga movement in New Zealand serves as an example of why monarchies are popular. A monarch is a mana person who dedicates their life to serving others. He or she is the centre of culture and a live representation of a group of people or a country.<br />
<br />
While the Maori Queen functions solely at the cultural level, New Zealand's current monarch Charles III acts on both constitutional and cultural levels. As of now, there seems to be no tension between the two positions. The monarchs enhance each other and share mutual respect, allowing both to better represent New Zealand.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In 1992, Malik Obama was the best man during his half-brother Barack Obama’s wedding to Michelle.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Abon'go Malik Obama, half-brother of former US president Barack Obama, is in the spotlight after declaring he will vote for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in the November 5 elections.<br />
<br />
"I am Malik Obama. I'm a registered Republican and I'm voting for President Donald Trump," Malik wrote on the social media site X.<br />
<br />
However, this was not the first time he extended support to Trump. He backed the former US president in 2016 as well, saying he supported Trump's policies, especially his focus on security.<br />
<br />
Who is Abon'go Malik Obama?<br />
<br />
Born in Kenya, Malik is the son of economist Barack Obama Sr and his first wife Kezia Obama. The Kenyan-American businessman and philanthropist is a US citizen.<br />
<br />
He serves as the Lead Ambassador at Puppet, a software configuration management tool,<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-malik-obama-barack-obamas-half-brother-now-backs-donald-trump-following-tim-walz-family-controversy/articleshow/113087800.cms"> The Times of India</a> reported.<br />
<br />
In the US, he has majorly worked as an accountant for organisations in and around Washington DC. Some of these include Lockheed Martin, the American Red Cross and Fannie Mae.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Earlier, Malik tried to run for governor in Kenya's Siaya district, where his father hailed from. However, he only managed to get 1% of the vote.<br />
<br />
As per public records, he still maintains a residence in Maryland and is a registered voter there.<br />
<br />
Personal life<br />
<br />
Malik has often been in the limelight due to his controversies and political endorsements. His relationship with his half-brother Barack Obama has witnessed several ups and downs.<br />
<br />
In 1992, Malik was the best man during Barack's wedding to Michelle. He even visited the White House during his half-brother's time in office, <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/05/us-news/barack-obamas-half-brother-malik-says-hes-voting-for-trump/">New York Post</a> reported.<br />
<br />
Earlier, several media reports even suggested that Malik was married to between three and 12 women, but he refuted these claims later.<br />
<br />
Malik had a fallout with the former US president after he launched a charity, named Barack H. Obama Foundation. However, he failed to register it and even lied about it being a tax-exempt organisation.<br />
<br />
"My brother didn't help me at all. He wanted me to shut it down when I set it up. He hasn't supported me at all," Malik said in an earlier interview.<br />
<br />
Malik even added fuel to the conspiracy theory, which was earlier spread majorly by Donald Trump, claiming that Barack Obama was not born in the US and was rather a citizen of Kenya.<br />
<br />
To prove his claims, Malik reportedly even shared a fake image of a birth certificate, dated from before the 1964 establishment of the Republic of Kenya. It purportedly showed Barack Obama was born outside the US.<br />
<br />
Calling his younger half-sibling a “deep disappointment,” Malik earlier also slammed Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, for his exit from the party.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus has said the interim government would pursue with India ways to resolve the differences over the long-pending Teesta water sharing treaty, as delaying it for years serves no purpose for either nation.</p>

<p>In an interview with PTI at his official residence in Dhaka, Muhammad Yunus stated that the water-sharing issue between the two countries must be resolved according to international norms, emphasising that lower riparian countries like Bangladesh have specific rights that they seek to uphold.</p>

<p>"By sitting over this issue (water sharing), it is not serving any purpose. If I know how much water I will get, even if I am not happy and sign it, it would be better. This issue has to be resolved," he said.</p>

<p>Replying to a query on whether the interim government would push for resolving the issues over the Teesta water-sharing treaty at the earliest, he said the new regime will pursue it.</p>

<p>"Push is a big word; I am not saying it. We will pursue it. But we have to sit together and resolve it," he told PTI.</p>

<p>India and Bangladesh were set to sign a deal on Teesta water sharing during then-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to Dhaka in 2011, but West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee declined to endorse it, citing a scarcity of water in her state.</p>

<p>"This is not a new issue but a very old issue. We have spoken on this issue on several occasions. The discussions began during the period of Pakistan's rule. While we all wanted this treaty to be finalised, even the Indian government was ready for it. However, the state government of West Bengal was not ready for it. We need to resolve it," he said.</p>

<p>Muhammad Yunus reiterated that lower riparian countries like Bangladesh have specific rights that they seek to uphold.</p>

<p>"We have to resolve this issue according to international norms. The lower riparian countries have certain rights, and we want those rights," he said.</p>

<p>His remarks come days after the interim government's Adviser on Water Resources, Syeda Rizwana Hasan, told PTI that Dhaka would push for restarting the dialogue regarding the Teesta water-sharing treaty with New Delhi and asserted that both countries should adhere to international principles regarding water-sharing between upper riparian and lower riparian countries.</p>

<p>Speaking about the flood situation in Bangladesh and reports from Dhaka blaming India for the floods, Muhammad Yunus said that until the treaty is signed, a humanitarian approach can be adopted to deal with such crises.</p>

<p>"When the High Commissioner (of India) came to meet me, I said that we can work on better management to see how the situation can be controlled during the floods. For such coordination between two countries, we don't need any treaty." "We can work on this together on humanitarian grounds and resolve this, as this will ease the suffering of the masses. Such humanitarian steps would really help," he said.</p>

<p>Monsoon rainfall-triggered floods in deltaic Bangladesh and upstream Indian regions have killed several people and marooned or affected nearly three million others in Bangladesh, posing a huge administrative challenge to the newly installed interim government amid a political transition.</p>

<p>India has described as factually incorrect the reports from Bangladesh that the current flood situation in certain parts of the country has been caused by the opening of a dam on the Gumti River in Tripura.</p>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in New Delhi stated that floods in the shared rivers between the two countries are a "shared" problem affecting people on both sides and require close mutual cooperation to resolve.</p>

<p>Speaking about the contentious issue of border killings, Muhammad Yunus condemned it and said killing is not a solution to dealing with it.</p>

<p>The Border Security Force (BSF) of India has accused Bangladeshi smugglers and infiltrators of crossing over the border and attacking Indian forces when challenged.</p>

<p>They have raised the issue with the Bangladesh counterpart BGB on several occasions. West Bengal shares a total of 2,217 kilometres of its border with Bangladesh, along with Tripura (856 km), Meghalaya (443 km), Assam (262 km), and Mizoram (318 km).</p>

<p>Deaths at times occur along the Bangladesh-India border due to alleged infiltrators trying to cross into India illegally, cross-border firing, and cattle smuggling.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Polls&nbsp;prophet Allan Lichtman, often&nbsp;called&nbsp;the "Nostradamus of US presidential elections", has predicted that Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris will win the race to the White House this year. In an exclusive interview with NDTV, Mr Litchman, who has&nbsp;correctly predicted&nbsp;nine out of&nbsp;10&nbsp;election&nbsp;results, said that Vice President Kamala Harris will beat Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump.</p>

<p>To accurately predict who will occupy the Oval Office, Mr Lichtman has <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/nostradamus-of-us-presidential-polls-makes-his-prediction-for-2024-5569902">designed what he calls "13 keys to the White House</a>," a groundbreaking method that revolutionized election forecasting. The keys, comprising a series of true or false questions, assess various factors such as party mandate, contest, incumbency, third party, short-term economy, long-term economy, foreign success, social unrest, incumbent charisma and challenger charisma.</p>

<p>Mr Lichtman explained that if six or more keys go against the White House party, they are predicted losers, or else they are predicted winners. While Kamala Harris has secured eight of Mr Litchman's keys to the White House, Trump only has three of his keys.</p>

<p>"They lost the mandate key, which is based on losses in US house election. They have obviously lost the incumbency key with Biden not running. But with the party uniting around Harris, the avoided the loss of the contest key. Finally, the third key that they lost was incumbent charisma key," he explained, adding that Democrats will hold on the White House.</p>

<h3><strong>Foreign Policy Success, Failures Undecided</strong></h3>

<p>Mr Litchman, who has successfully predicted election outcomes since 1984, said foreign policy failure and success remain undecided.</p>

<p>"The only other two keys that are shaky are the two foreign policy keys, he explains, because the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine are so fluid. I think those keys will split and Harris will be down 4 keys. But even if they both flip negative, this means Harris is down only 5 keys, still one key short of defeat. All other keys are locked in her favour," he added.</p>

<p>Asked about areas of uncertainty, the US historian said "Two areas of uncertainty are two foreign policy keys- foreign military success and failure. We don't know exactly what could happen in Ukraine or Middle East. But they won't affect my prediction that Kamala Harris is going to be the next President of the United States. These two keys are not enough to predict that Donald Trump could regain the White House."</p>

<h3><strong>On Short-Term, Long-Term Economy</strong></h3>

<p>"My two economic keys are statistical and they are very specifically defined. The short-term economy key says there is no recession in the election year. You can't just have recession in a couple of months, it takes much longer than that.</p>

<p>"The long term economy key asks whether the per capita growth on the current term is equal to the average of previous two terms. &nbsp;And per capita growth under Biden is double or more that that of the average of previous two terms," he explained.</p>

<p>Asked if Republicans could do anything to fare better, the election forecaster said, "There is actually nothing they can do. That's the whole point of the keys. It is fundamentally different that all of the conventional wisdoms."</p>

<p>Mr Lichtman's predictive prowess faced its most significant test in the tumultuous 2000 election between Al Gore and George W Bush. While he forecasted a victory for Gore, the controversial outcome cast a shadow over his prediction.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2024 northern summer saw the highest global temperatures ever recorded, beating last year's record and making this year likely Earth's hottest ever, the EU's climate monitor said Friday. The data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service followed a season of heatwaves around the world that scientists said were intensified by human-driven climate change.</p>

<p>"During the past three months of 2024, the globe has experienced the hottest June and August, the hottest day on record, and the hottest boreal summer on record," Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus, said in a report.</p>

<p>"This string of record temperatures is increasing the likelihood of 2024 being the hottest year on record."</p>

<p>The average global temperature at the Earth's surface was 16.82C in August, according to Copernicus, which draws on billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations.</p>

<p>The June and August global temperature broke through the level of 1.5C above the pre-industrial average -- a key threshold for limiting the worst effects of climate change.</p>

<p>Human-caused greenhouse gas emissions are warming the planet, raising the likelihood and intensity of climate disasters such as droughts, fires and floods.</p>

<p>Heat was exacerbated in 2023 and early 2024 by the cyclical weather phenomenon El Nino, though Copernicus scientist Julien Nicolas told AFP its effects were not as strong as they sometimes are.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the contrary cyclical cooling phenomenon, known as La Nina, has not yet started, he said.</p>

<h2>Emissions reductions</h2>

<p>Against the global trend, regions such as Alaska, the eastern United States, parts of South America, Pakistan and the Sahel desert zone in northern Africa had lower than average temperatures in August, the report said.</p>

<p>But others such as Australia -- where it was winter -- parts of China, Japan and Spain experienced record warmth in August.</p>

<p>Globally, August 2024 matched that month's previous global temperature record from one year earlier, while this June was hotter than last, Copernicus data in the report showed.</p>

<p>July was slightly hotter in 2023 than this year, but on average the three-month period broke the record in 2024.</p>

<p>Governments have targets to reduce their countries' planet-heating emissions to try to keep the rise below 1.5C under the 2015 Paris Agreement.</p>

<p>Scientists will not consider that threshold to be definitively passed until it has been observed being breached over several decades. The average level of warming is currently about 1.2C, according to the World Meteorological Organisation.</p>

<p>Copernicus said the 1.5C level has been passed in 13 of the past 14 months.</p>

<h2>Wildfires, hurricanes</h2>

<p>The oceans are also heating to record levels, raising the risk of more intense storms.</p>

<p>Copernicus said that outside of the poles, the average sea surface temperature in August was just under 21C, the second-highest level on record for that month.</p>

<p>It said August "was drier than average over most of continental Europe" -- noting the wildfires that struck countries such as Greece.</p>

<p>But places such as western Russia and Turkey were wetter than normal, with floods in some places.</p>

<p>The eastern United States had more rain than usual, including areas lashed by Hurricane Debby.</p>

<p>"The temperature-related extreme events witnessed this summer will only become more intense, with more devastating consequences for people and the planet unless we take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions," Copernicus's deputy director Burgess said.</p>

<p>Some researchers say that emissions in some of the biggest countries may have peaked or will soon do so, partly as a result of the drive towards low-carbon energy.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

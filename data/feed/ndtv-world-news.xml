       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military said on Thursday its troops killed five Palestinian fighters who were hiding inside a mosque in the West Bank city of Tulkarm, in one of the largest assaults on the occupied territory for months.</p>

<p>The operation, which a Reuters witness said has yet to conclude, began in the early hours of Wednesday with hundreds of Israeli troops backed by helicopters, drones and armoured personnel carriers raiding the flashpoint cities of Tulkarm, Jenin and areas in the Jordan Valley.</p>

<p>There was also a complete network outage at Jawwal, one of the two main telecommunications companies in the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West Bank, according to the Reuters witness.</p>

<p>Palestinian health authorities said at least 12 Palestinians were killed in Wednesday's operations.</p>

<p>In Jenin earlier, bulldozers edged along empty, rubbish-strewn streets as the sound of drones pierced the sky.</p>

<p>Israeli troops searched ambulances on deserted city streets and in front of Jenin's main hospital, having blocked off access to it on Wednesday to prevent fighters from seeking refuge there.</p>

<p>Israel said one of the five fighters killed in the Tulkarm mosque was Muhhamad Jabber, known as "Abu Shujaa", the head of a network of fighters in the Nur Shams refugee camp next to the city.</p>

<p>The Tulkarm division of Islamic Jihad's armed wing said: "As part of the response to the assassination of our leader, our fighters were able to ambush an infantry force in the Manshiyya axis behind Abu Ubaida Mosque".</p>

<p>The group claimed "direct hits" on Israeli troops after it detonated an explosive device near them.</p>

<p>The armed wings of the Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Fatah factions said in separate statements on Wednesday their gunmen were detonating bombs against Israeli military vehicles in Jenin, Tulkarm and Far'a, a town in the Jordan Valley.</p>

<p>Clashes in the West Bank have escalated since Israel's war with Hamas began in Gaza nearly 11 months ago.</p>

<h3><strong>Escalating Clashes</strong></h3>

<p>Israel says Iran provides weapons and support to factions there and has stepped up West Bank operations, while Jewish settlers have launched frequent vigilante-style attacks on Palestinian communities.</p>

<p>Referring to the latest West Bank assault, Israel's foreign minister Israel Katz said in a post on X overnight: "This is a war in every sense, and we must win it."</p>

<p>He accused Iran of working to destabilize Jordan and establish an eastern front against Israel, like it has done in Gaza and in Lebanon, where Israel has been trading almost daily fire with operatives from the Iranian proxy group Hezbollah.</p>

<p>To address the threat of an eastern front, Katz said Israel would have to use "all necessary means, including, in cases of intense combat, allowing the population to temporarily evacuate from one neighbourhood to another to prevent civilian harm".</p>

<p>In nearby Gaza, evacuation orders have displaced nearly all of the enclave's 2.3 million people multiple times, giving rise to deadly hunger and disease.</p>

<p>The latest round of Israeli-Palestinian violence began on Oct. 7 after Hamas stormed from Gaza into southern Israel, killing 1,200 and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel's Gaza campaign has since demolished swathes of the enclave, and killed more than 40,500 people, Palestinian health officials say.</p>

<p>Internationally mediated talks to end the conflict continue.</p>

<p>Since the Gaza war began, thousands of Palestinians have been arrested in West Bank and East Jerusalem raids and more than 660 - fighters and civilians - have been killed, according to Palestinian health ministry figures.</p>

<p>At least 30 Israelis have been killed in attacks in Jerusalem and the West Bank during the period, according to Israeli tallies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation or FBI, which is investigating the assassination attempt on Donald Trump at the Republican rally in Pennsylvania last month, has revealed that the gunman Thomas Crooks acted alone.</p>

<p>The FBI said it has found no evidence of any foreign involvement in the case. The investigating agency however said that the motive behind the assassination attempt still remains unclear.</p>

<p>Sharing details about the gunman's search history, the FBI said, Thomas Crooks, 20, has varied ideologies. They also also shared photos of the weapon used and said they had found Improvised Explosive Devices or IEDs in his vehicle.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">Improvised Explosive Devices or IEDs were found in Thomas Gates' vehicle.</p>
</div>

<p>Speaking about Thomas Crooks' search history, the FBI revealed that he had searched more than 60 times for information about the Republican presidential candidate, as well as his then-rival, Democratic candidate and President Joe Biden. The gunman's online searches date as far back as September 2023. After nearly a year-long extensive search, the gunman chose to register for the Trump rally.</p>

<p>The FBI explained that the gunman had mounted a "sustained, detailed effort" to attack a major gathering of some sort before finally deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at the rally in Pennsylvania in July.</p>

<p>"We saw a sustained, detailed effort to plan an attack on some events, meaning he looked at any number of events or targets," Kevin Rojek, the FBI's top official in western Pennsylvania, told reporters.</p>

<p>Mr Rojek further said that Crooks became "hyper-focused" on the Trump rally when it was announced "and looked at it as a target of opportunity."</p>

<p>The assassination attempt on Donald Trump took place on July 13, 2024 when the former president was addressing a Republican campaign rally in Buttler, Pennsylvania. The shooter Thomas Crooks, was from Bethel Park, a village 40 miles south of where Trump's rally was held.</p>

<p>Crooks fired multiple gunshots from an AR-15-style rifle during the rally, of which, one grazed Donald Trump's ear. The shooter planted himself on the roof of a manufacturing plant located around 130 yards away from the stage at Butler Farm Show grounds. While Donald Trump survived the assassination bid with the US Secret Service agents storming the stage to protect him, the shooting led to the death of one civilian and caused severe injuries to two others.</p>

<p>Last week, I visited my favourite cafe in South London, known for its Illy coffee beans that I relish. As I savoured my coffee, a young man, wearing a sleeveless hoodie and shorts, casually walked in. He was carrying a hold-all bag, and I thought he had just come from the gym. But he had other plans. In the blink of an eye, he swept every last sandwich into his bag from a stocked shelf. As he walked past me, our eyes met. I thought about confronting him but instead took another sip of my coffee and pretended to be engrossed in my smartphone. The lone waiter and the manager behind the counter seemed helpless or perhaps paralysed with fear. The boy walked out as if he had come in for his daily grocery shopping.</p>

<p>I turned to the manager, still tucked safely behind his counter, and asked whether he would report the incident to the police. Still shaken, he gave me a weary smile and said there was no point calling the police. He explained that shoplifting under £200 was not worth reporting. In fact, a 2014 law had categorised shoplifting as a "low-value" crime, inviting minimal or no punishment.</p>

<p>London is a paradise for shoplifters. But it's not the only one. Shoplifting cases are spiralling out of control across the UK. According to the Office for National Statistics, last year was the worst on record for shoplifting, with police recording 4,30,000 offences. The retailers' body, the British Retail Consortium, says these figures are a fraction of the actual incidents, many of which are not reported for fear of violence. The body believes the cases crossed 8 million last year, with retailers losing over £1.8 billion.</p>

<h2><strong>A Broken Britain</strong></h2>

<p>Far-right politicians claim, without much evidence, that shoplifting is a pastime of 'illegal' immigrants. That they exist outside the system and therefore escape scrutiny. These politicians lament the fact that the country's resources are being overwhelmed as huge amounts of money are being spent on housing and feeding immigrants.</p>

<p>However, human rights activists and community workers believe the alarming rise in shoplifting is linked to a grave cost of living crisis. Brexit and then the Covid-19 pandemic led to an upswing in unemployment and pushed scores of communities below the poverty line. There are numerous reports that claim that much of Britain's woes are due to its breaking free from the European Union and its inability to deal with the devastating pandemic.</p>

<h2><strong>"We Haven't Got Food Tonight. Can You Help?"</strong></h2>

<p>Poverty has affected many deprived communities and pushed them into a situation where they have become dependent on food charities. A recent report by Bristol University cited a pupil's letter to his school, saying, "We haven't got any food tonight. Please can you help?" The university research, focusing on food charity in schools, revealed that there are over 4,000 school-based food banks in primary and secondary schools across England. This is in addition to various charities - including some run by Indian Sikhs - that run food banks both in schools and at other places.</p>

<p>Great Britain is manifestly becoming poorer. Even for a casual visitor to the country, it's hard to miss its bloated underbelly. Many years ago, a White colleague visiting Mumbai from London was shocked to see scores of homeless people sleeping under flyovers and on footpaths. She told me she was genuinely moved by the squalor. London's homeless may be fewer in number than India's, but they are ubiquitous.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>A Deeply Unequal Society</strong></h2>

<p>The decline is visible everywhere. Wherever you go in London - or even other big cities in Britain - you cannot miss homeless people along the high streets and open public spaces. They sleep or rest in beds made of cardboard and tattered blankets. They take refuge under railway bridges and public parks, where benches serve as their beds. They look fatigued and lost.</p>

<p>Despite its wealth, London has pockets of severe poverty and deprivation. Child poverty rates are higher in London than in any other English region. London's crime rates are higher than any other major European cities, with rising concerns about knife attacks, gang violence and terrorism.</p>

<p>Beneath London's gleaming surface lies social inequalities, economic woes, and extreme poverty that form the city's dark netherworld. The wealth gap between the rich and the poor is staggering, with the top 10% of earners holding 30% of the city's income.</p>

<h2><strong>Historical perspective</strong></h2>

<p>Though it wasn't always like this, London, and much of England, has been through a cycle of decay and regeneration. A very impressionable young Trinidadian writer, CLR James, visited England in 1932. His portrayal of London in the 1930s in Letter from London could be true of today's time as well. "I saw London with new eyes; I saw the vast multitudes toiling to make a few wealthy; I saw the rich with their money, their resources, their million servants, exploiting the great, blind, unconscious masses of the poor," he observed in one of his essays. In another place, he captured his uneasy feeling thus, "I feel both a stranger and a prisoner, trapped in a society that is indifferent to the suffering of the majority and obsessed with its own decline."</p>

<p>Today, too, much like in the 1930s, many here have started complaining that Britain is broken. Its economy is stagnating, its politics is divisive, and its society is in disarray. Actually, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has been saying for a long time that the UK's "economy is broken, the health service is broken, and public service is broken". His Labour Party was voted to power in the July election on its promise of fixing a "broken Britain".</p>

<h2><strong>India Is Marching Ahead</strong></h2>

<p>It's true that the British economy has been stagnating for years. But the country was far ahead of India in 2014, which was the world's 10th biggest economy at the time. Over the years, however, India grew steadily. In 2021, it left the UK behind and became the fifth-largest economy in the world. The Indian government's economic policies stand in sharp contrast to the lacklustre vision of successive British governments over 15 years. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government ensured that India had political and economic stability and continuity. Britain was not that lucky, seeing six different governments led by six different prime ministers in the same period.</p>

<p>After being voted to power, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he had "a lot of mess to fix", blaming the outgoing Tory government that had been in power from 2010 to 2024 for leading the country here. As historian Niall Ferguson notes, "The UK's decline is a long-term process, driven by a combination of factors, including economic mismanagement, social inequality, and political polarisation".</p>

<p>As a first step towards "fixing the mess", Starmer has proposed to raise taxes. But that is likely to be seen as a betrayal because the party had promised not to increase taxation. The Prime Minister has even warned that the forthcoming budget is "going to be painful". It will get worse, he said, before it gets better.</p>

<p>While the debate rages on in the media, Starmer quietly set out on an official trip to Germany and France to "reset" Britain's relations with Europe.&nbsp;If all goes well, this reset might help Britain steady the post-Brexit ship.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recent Democratic National Convention in Chicago was a <a href="https://theconversation.com/kamala-harris-and-her-fellow-democrats-used-ancient-greek-rhetorical-tricks-to-keep-their-audiences-spellbound-237406">showcase of impressive speeches</a>. Presidential nominee Kamala Harris <a href="https://theconversation.com/harris-delivers-warm-and-strong-acceptance-speech-as-democrats-take-joy-hope-and-renewal-to-the-electorate-237136">justified the newfound enthusiasm of Democrats</a> with a strong acceptance speech, but even she couldn't match the oratorical power of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9zAk8t9qZ8">Michelle</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwLmOI6r_XY">Barack</a> Obama two nights earlier.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">US political culture is marked by visionary speeches, from Abraham Lincoln's <a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbpe.24404500/?st=text">Gettysburg Address</a> and William Jennings Bryan's “<a href="https://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5354/">Cross of gold</a>” to Martin Luther King's “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smEqnnklfYs">I have a dream</a>” and Ronald Reagan's “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX00QkvK-mQ">Tear down this wall</a>”. This rhetorical tradition infuses events such as party conventions, where memorable speeches can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWynt87PaJ0">lay the groundwork for presidential careers</a>.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">Australia also has some justly famous political speeches. There was Robert Menzies' “<a href="https://www.menziesrc.org/the-forgotten-people">Forgotten People</a>” address of 1942, Paul Keating's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6dnDkvdTXA">Redfern speech</a> in 1992, and Julia Gillard's “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCNuPcf8L00">misogyny speech</a>” to parliament in 2012. Noel Pearson's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsXmYHiuJ8s">eulogy for Gough Whitlam</a> in 2014 was a <a href="https://theconversation.com/a-closer-look-at-noel-pearsons-eulogy-for-gough-whitlam-33932">rhetorical masterpiece</a>.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">But these speeches are memorable because they are so rare. Australian politicians need to be good communicators, but they are not expected to deliver the kind of soaring, visionary rhetoric we see so often in the US. Why is this?</p>

<h3 class="theconversation-article-title"><strong>Politics with the soul of a church.</strong></h3>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">US party conventions often look like <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/08/23/chicago-dnc-obama-clinton-harris-walz/">Hollywood awards ceremonies</a>, and <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/steven-spielberg-biden-campaign-democratic-national-convention-plan-1235882108/">Steven Spielberg was involved in the planning</a> of the recent DNC. Hollywood has become an indelible part of US political culture.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">Reagan, a former Hollywood actor, set new standards for how <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/nov/12/the-reagans-showtime-docuseries">telegenic</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTIfGFJqLko">entertaining</a> presidents could be. Donald Trump may not be everyone's idea of a great orator, but the former reality TV star is certainly a <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/7/17/trump-elections-and-the-politics-of-spectacle">master of televised spectacles</a>.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">The tradition of preaching is an even deeper cultural source of US political rhetoric. With about <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/245491/church-attendance-of-americans/">30% of Americans attending religious services regularly</a>, the sermon is the most prevalent form of public speech in the US.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">American preachers need to be compelling, given the level of religious competition, and church is where many future politicians first encounter the craft of public speaking. American political speeches often reflect the combination of <a href="https://www.preaching.com/articles/should-the-sermon-beat-up-or-lift-up/">uplift and warning</a> found in preaching.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">While evangelical Christianity is usually associated with the Republican Party, it is also in the DNA of Democrats because of the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/02/16/a-brief-overview-of-black-religious-history-in-the-u-s/">Civil Rights Movement and the black church</a>. One of the standout speakers of the DNC was <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/08/raphael-warnock-dnc-speech/">Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock</a>, senior pastor of the <a href="https://time.com/5927777/martin-luther-king-warnock-history/">same Baptist church in Atlanta where Martin Luther King Jr preached</a>.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">Warnock described Trump in biblical terms as a “plague on the American conscience”. But he also described a vote as “a kind of prayer for the world we desire for ourselves and for our children”.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">Australia has no shortage of politicians who were raised as Christians and have Christian commitments. But unlike in the US, where even secular politicians must pay lip service to prayer, Christian politicians in Australia must <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/27/scott-morrison-is-a-pentecostal-but-he-doesnt-need-believers-like-trump-does">adapt themselves</a> to the <a href="https://theconversation.com/a-christian-nation-no-longer-why-australias-religious-right-loses-policy-battles-even-when-it-wins-elections-165169">secularism of Australian culture</a>. This culture does not expect politicians to preach.</p>

<h3 class="theconversation-article-title"><strong>Strong speeches for weak parties</strong></h3>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">Michelle Grattan last week described Australian party conferences as “<a href="https://theconversation.com/grattan-on-friday-presidential-battle-showcases-the-differences-between-us-political-system-and-ours-237313">mind-numbing</a>” compared with the “Hollywood extravaganzas” of their US counterparts.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">But the spectacles at US party conventions testify to the <a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2024/06/27/why-are-political-parties-so-much-weaker-than-they-once-were/">weakness</a> of American political parties. The Democratic and Republican National Committees have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/modern-politics-public-is-more-partisan-parties-are-more-powerless-idUSL1N12Z2QO/">little power</a>. Party organisations are localised and fragmented. They lack the central authority found in Australian parties, and the national convention every four years is the only time a nationwide party truly comes into existence.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">Even in Congress, parties have few mechanisms for <a href="https://jackson.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Kustov-et-al.-2021.pdf">disciplining their members</a>. Party leaders are forced to negotiate with their own side, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/03/kevin-mccarthy-oust-republican-house-speaker-vote-result-matt-gaetz">not always successfully</a>. Party conventions see an extravagant display of unity behind a newly nominated candidate. This is one of the few moments party unity is guaranteed.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">While there is plenty of competition for power within Australian parties, in Australia it mostly takes place <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-party-preselections-are-still-a-mess-and-the-courts-havent-helped-181054">behind closed doors within party hierarchies</a>. In the US, would-be legislators and executives need to campaign publicly to win the often brutal primary elections that earn them the party's nomination.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">Successful candidates must create their own personalised campaigns. They have help from local party organisations, which coordinate resources and volunteers, but they need much more than that. A candidate for national office must build their own coalition of donors that would <a href="https://issueone.org/articles/the-congressional-fundraising-treadmill-2022-election/">dwarf</a> anything a party could provide.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">Hence the need for good speech-making. Competition for the attention of donors and voters is fierce, and a compelling speech is a vital way to stand out. This is especially true of <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/obama-once-democratic-outsider-now-043532690.html">candidates such as Barack Obama</a>, who came from outside the party's traditional power bases.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">In Australia, inspirational speeches don't have the same political currency. A system of <a href="https://theconversation.com/politicians-inability-to-speak-freely-on-issues-that-matter-leaves-democracy-all-the-poorer-60055">strict party discipline</a>, small preselection contests and <a href="https://thedailyaus.com.au/stories/heres-why-us-election-campaigns-are-so-expensive-and-australia-is-a-bit-cheaper/">short, relatively cheap election campaigns</a> means candidates are rewarded more for other political skills.</p>

<h3 class="theconversation-article-title"><strong>The Australian advantage: debating</strong></h3>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">While a US politician might give a more entertaining stump speech than an Australian one, an Australian politician would probably perform better in any scenario that requires unscripted comments – especially a debate with an opponent.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">Even superb US political orators can be <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/25/politics/obama-debate-election-2012/index.html">underwhelming</a> when they don't have a script and a receptive audience. Congressional debates consist of prepared speeches with little direct engagement between opponents. There is no equivalent to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13572334.2014.895121">Parliamentary Question Time</a>, and holders of executive office (such as the president or state governors) aren't even in the legislature.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">While Congressional committee hearings can sometimes provide a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/senate-mullin-obrien-teamsters-fight-hearing-153e28d131973d1e10b539491c9e94a6">simulation of the rowdiness</a> we associate with Question Time, the structure of Congress isn't conducive to debate in the same way.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">The physical format of Westminster parliaments, with opponents facing each other directly, attests to an adversarial nature that was <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/palace/architecture/palace-s-interiors/commons-chamber/">there from the beginning</a>. The power of Gillard's “misogyny speech”, which went viral globally, came partly from the way she delivered it <a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/julia-gillard-misogyny-speech/8r2ue1lt9">straight into Tony Abbott's face</a>.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">US Congress was designed differently. The framers of the Constitution loathed the idea of <a href="https://www.history.com/news/founding-fathers-political-parties-opinion">factions</a>, and imagined a legislature made up of representatives who would negotiate with each other to find consensus. Congress in turn would have to negotiate with the president, who would <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union">rarely need to engage publicly</a> with its members.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">This may explain why, despite the routine brilliance of convention speeches, US presidential debates are so tedious and forgettable. Commentators who try to hype these debates by citing “great moments” from past debates inevitably reach for the same ancient zinger, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iDn6ndavA0">you're no Jack Kennedy</a>”, delivered by forgotten vice-presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen in 1988.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">The sad reality is that the most memorable and consequential presidential debate in living memory is the one we just saw, where Joe Biden performed so badly he ended his hopes of a second presidency.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">In the land of the scripted, the <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/mike-johnson-makes-sharp-exit-184330436.html?">teleprompter is king</a>.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris will give her first interview Thursday since becoming the Democratic standard-bearer, after intense criticism from Republicans that she has been hiding from tough questions.</p>

<p>Harris and her running mate Tim Walz will sit down with CNN during a campaign trip to Georgia, in a major test of the buzz surrounding her campaign on the 10-week sprint to election day.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-2024-donald-trump-amplifies-false-claims-against-kamala-harris-veep-pick-tim-walz-6442005/amp/1" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a>'s spokesman has slammed her for not doing the interview alone and accused her of using energetic Minnesota Governor Walz as a "human shield."</p>

<p>Republican former president Trump, itching to take the limelight back from Harris after her rapid rise, will separately be campaigning in the battleground states of Michigan and Wisconsin on Thursday.</p>

<p>The CNN encounter with journalist Dana Bash, which is being broadcast at 9:00 pm local time (0100 GMT Friday) will be the first in-depth interview for <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/kamala-harris-and-tim-walz-s-first-interview-of-campaign-830815" target="_blank">Harris and Walz</a> since President Joe Biden dropped out of the White House race on July 21.</p>

<p>It is also the first since the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which saw the party riding a wave of energy following her nomination.</p>

<p>Harris's spokesman Ian Sams responded to the Republican criticisms by saying the "joint ticket interview is an election year summer tradition going back 20 years."</p>

<p>He cited previous interviews given "almost always" around convention time, including by Trump and his then-running mate Mike Pence, and Biden and Harris.</p>

<p>"Harris/Walz join this rich tradition on CNN tomorrow," Sams said on X.</p>

<p>But then, the 2024 election is anything but traditional.</p>

<p>A relatively untested Harris, 59, has been thrust onto the campaign stage at record speed after one of the biggest upheavals in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-rally-shooting-long-history-of-shootings-in-us-presidential-politics-6101507" target="_blank">US political history</a>.</p>

<p>Yet so far she has only had a handful of exchanges with reporters on the campaign trail.</p>

<h3><strong>Human shield</strong></h3>

<p>Her failure to give an interview or press conference in that time has given Republicans fodder for attacks, saying voters have been left in the dark about her policies.</p>

<p>"They have a candidate they can't wheel out to the media," Trump spokesman Jason Miller told Newsmax on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"What they're going to do is they're going to use Tim Walz as a human shield for Kamala Harris," Miller said.</p>

<p>Trump has done a series of interviews in recent weeks, but they have mainly been with sympathetic interviewers including X boss Elon Musk. He has also given two press conferences, which included long monologues.</p>

<p>Harris said on August 8 that she wanted to get an interview scheduled by the end of the month, so she has just lived up to her pledge.</p>

<p>Her interview will be closely watched in an extraordinary year where big set-piece political events have shown their ability to produce surprises.</p>

<p>It was <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joe-biden-vs-donald-trump-presidential-debate-when-and-where-to-watch-5984315" target="_blank">Joe Biden's</a> stumbling performance during a June 27 debate with Trump -- coincidentally also on CNN -- that caused Democrats to dump him over fears about his age and mental acuity.</p>

<p>Further adding to the pressure is the fact that Harris developed a reputation for word salads and gaffes in unscripted settings earlier in her spell as vice president.</p>

<p>In one notorious exchange with NBC in 2021, after Biden designated her to look into the causes of illegal migration, she insisted that "we've been to the border" with Mexico even when she had not.</p>

<p>Pressed further, she retorted "And I haven't been to Europe" before breaking into a laugh.</p>

<p>Republicans have since used the exchange to hammer Harris over the border issue, one of the Democrats' biggest vulnerabilities heading into the election.</p>

<p>As a former prosecutor, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/us-election-watch-kamala-harris-targets-crucial-swing-state-georgia-831195" target="_blank">Harris</a> may well be looking to her first debate with Trump on September 10 to make a bigger impact.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Kamala Harris' campaign for US president has hired an Egyptian American lawyer and former Department of Homeland Security official to help lead outreach to Arab American voters who hold sway in some states that could help decide the Nov. 5 election]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris' campaign for US president has hired an Egyptian American lawyer and former Department of Homeland Security official to help lead outreach to Arab American voters who hold sway in some states that could help decide the November 5 election, the campaign said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Brenda Abdelall would be tasked with shoring up support from a community frustrated with&nbsp;US support for Israel's war in Gaza. Vice President Harris, a Democrat, has already hired Afghan American lawyer Nasrina Bargzie for outreach to Muslim Americans.</p>

<p>Harris is in a tight race with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Votes from Muslim and Arab Americans could help decide the outcome in battleground states like Michigan, which has seen street protests over the Israel-Gaza war.</p>

<p>US&nbsp;President Joe Biden won a large share of the Arab and Muslim vote in 2020, but his support for Israel despite the huge death count in Gaza has frustrated many community members. They launched an "uncommitted" campaign against him in the Democratic nominating contests.</p>

<p>Michigan, where Harris is due to visit next week, is home to one of the largest Muslim and Arab American populations in the United States. More than 100,000 voters cast their ballot "uncommitted" instead of Biden, who stepped aside as candidate on July 21, in the state's primary.</p>

<p>Some activists say they hold Harris responsible for the Biden administration's Israel policy and the crisis in Gaza.</p>

<p>Following last week's Democratic convention, pro-Palestinian activists said Harris had failed to demonstrate any break from the status quo.</p>

<p>While pro-Palestinian voices are not expected to vote for Trump and have indicated no support for the Republican, some activists have launched a campaign called "Abandon Harris" and have urged their supporters to back third-party candidates.</p>

<p>Abdelall, Harris' pick for Arab American outreach, most recently served as senior counsellor to the Department of Homeland Security's secretary. She joined the agency in January 2021, shortly after Trump left office, to be chief of staff for the department's civil rights office.</p>

<p>Abdelall, who grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan, previously ran a food blog and website focused on Middle Eastern cuisine. She has taught Middle Eastern cooking classes at a culinary school in northern Virginia.</p>

<p>The latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on Oct. 7 when Palestinian Islamist group Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent assault on the Hamas-governed enclave has since killed over 40,000 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry, while also displacing nearly the entire population of 2.3 million, causing a hunger crisis and leading to genocide allegations at the World Court that Israel denies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a part of the national survey to preempt the Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF), the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has started surveying the Eastern Himalayas to map all glacial lakes in the country and assess the feasibility of installing early warning sensors and other mitigation measures. The agency is conducting surveys in Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim, the two important areas of the Eastern Himalayas along the China border.</p>

<p>Expert teams have fanned out to carry out a survey-cum-study at <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/experts-sent-to-6-high-risk-glacial-lakes-in-arunachal-to-assess-flood-risk-6384947" target="_blank">six high-risk glacial lakes</a> in Tawang and Dibang Valley districts in Arunachal Pradesh, which shares a 1,080 km-long border with China. There are reports of the washing away of more than five bridges due to a glacial lake outburst from Sangnga Nehgu Lake in the Tawang district. It is also the first such survey of glacial lakes in the border state.</p>

<p>Sikkim has also sent an expedition of 32 experts to five <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/plans-on-to-tackle-dangerous-glacial-lakes-in-himalayas-6389964" target="_blank">under-threat glacial lakes</a> - Gurudongmar A, B, and C, Sakho Chu, and Khangchu, all in the Mangan district, which borders Tibet.</p>

<p>The experts will survey the lakes from August 28 to September 14 at an estimated cost of Rs 32 lakh.</p>

<p>The expedition is being led by State Science and Technology Secretary Sandeep Tambe along with experts from six different departments of the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) under the Land Revenue Department, Mines and Geology, Water Resources, Forest, Science and Technology and research scholars from Sikkim University.</p>

<p>The expedition will also be aided by the Indian Army and Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) with a collective manpower of 56 individuals including drivers and porters...</p>

<p>"We are going to do very hi-tech studies to understand the geology of the glacial lake, understand the glacial behaviours, study the slope stability and probabilities of avalanches and GLOF. This will be a study at an altitude of 18,000 feet. Once our study is done, we will plan the mitigation plan," said Sandeep Tambe, Secretary of the Science and Technology Department, Sikkim.</p>

<p>The previous expedition was carried out by the NDMA and experts from Switzerland before the 2023 lake outburst in South Lhonak in Sikkim.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Countries adopting their own AI applications and models will contribute about low double-digit billions to Nvidia's revenue in the financial year ending in January 2025, Nvidia forecasts]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nations building artificial intelligence models in their own languages are turning to Nvidia's chips, adding to already booming demand as generative AI takes center stage for businesses and governments, a senior executive said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Nvidia's third-quarter forecast for rising sales of its chips that power AI technology such as OpenAI's ChatGPT failed to meet investors' towering expectations. But the company described new customers coming from around the world, including governments that are now seeking their own AI models and the hardware to support them.</p>

<p>Countries adopting their own AI applications and models will contribute about low double-digit billions to Nvidia's revenue in the financial year ending in January 2025, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on a call with analysts after Nvidia's earnings report.</p>

<p>That's up from an earlier forecast of such sales contributing high single-digit billions to total revenue. Nvidia forecast about $32.5 billion in total revenue in the third quarter ending in October.</p>

<p>"Countries around the world (desire) to have their own generative AI that would be able to incorporate their own language, incorporate their own culture, incorporate their own data in that country," Kress said, describing AI expertise and infrastructure as "national imperatives."</p>

<p>She offered the example of Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, which is building an AI supercomputer featuring thousands of Nvidia H200 graphics processors.</p>

<p>Governments are also turning to AI as a measure to strengthen national security.</p>

<p>"AI models are trained on data and for political entities -particularly nations - their data are secret, and their models need to be customized to their unique political, economic, cultural, and scientific needs," said IDC computing semiconductors analyst Shane Rau.</p>

<p>"Therefore, they need to have their own AI models and a custom underlying arrangement of hardware and software."</p>

<p>Washington tightened its controls on exports of cutting-edge chips to China in 2023 as it sought to prevent breakthroughs in AI that would aid China's military, hampering Nvidia's sales in the region.</p>

<p>Businesses have been working to tap into government pushes to build AI platforms in regional languages.</p>

<p>IBM said in May that Saudi Arabia's Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority would train its "ALLaM" Arabic language model using the company's AI platform Watsonx.</p>

<p>Nations that want to create their own AI models can drive growth opportunities for Nvidia's GPUs, on top of the significant investments in the company's hardware from large cloud providers like Microsoft, said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11100893/">study</a> from the United States has, for the first time, found microplastics in human brains. The study, which has yet to be independently verified by other scientists, has been described in the media as <a href="https://people.com/study-microplastics-found-in-brain-tissue-liver-kidneys-and-lungs-8700882">scary</a>, <a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/percentage-brains-microplastics">shocking</a> and <a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/microplastics-contamination-human-brain-health.html">alarming</a>.</p>

<p>But what exactly are microplastics? What do they mean for our health? Should we be concerned?</p>

<h3><strong>What are microplastics? Can you see them?</strong></h3>

<p>We often consider plastic items to be indestructible. But plastic breaks down into <a href="https://www.epa.gov/water-research/microplastics-research">smaller particles</a>. Definitions vary but generally, microplastics are smaller than five millimetres.</p>

<p>This makes some too small to be seen with the naked eye. So, many of the images the media uses to illustrate articles about microplastics are misleading, as some show much larger, clearly visible pieces.</p>

<p>Microplastics have been reported in many sources of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135419301794">drinking water</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722069340?casa_token=VSEsoEXWnjQAAAAA:M1PYZLjEQtqb1bojduo6awulmd6rOwvva6pAhq0aJK_Zv7DZmTGRUAf18BHqM67lgLC7tRNOkw">everyday food items</a>. This means we are constantly exposed to them in our diet.</p>

<p>Such widespread, chronic (long-term) exposure makes this a serious concern for human health. While research investigating the potential risk microplastics pose to our health is limited, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10038118/">it is growing</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>How about this latest study?</strong></h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11100893/">study</a> looked at concentrations of microplastics in 51 samples from men and women set aside from routine autopsies in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Samples were from the liver, kidney and brain.</p>

<p>These tiny particles are difficult to study due to their size, even with a high-powered microscope. So rather than trying to see them, researchers are beginning to use complex instruments that identify the chemical composition of microplastics in a sample. This is the technique used in this study.</p>

<p>The researchers were surprised to find up to 30 times more microplastics in brain samples than in the liver and kidney.</p>

<p>They hypothesised this could be due to high blood flow to the brain (carrying plastic particles with it). Alternatively, the liver and kidneys might be better suited to dealing with external toxins and particles. We also know the brain does not undergo the same amount of cellular renewal as other organs in the body, which could make the plastics linger here.</p>

<p>The researchers also found the amount of plastics in brain samples increased by about 50% between 2016 and 2024. This may reflect the rise in environmental plastic pollution and increased <a href="https://www.unep.org/interactives/beat-plastic-pollution/">human exposure</a>.</p>

<p>The microplastics found in this study were mostly composed of polyethylene. This is the most <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-37100-1.00002-8">commonly produced</a> plastic in the world and is used for many everyday products, such as bottle caps and plastic bags.</p>

<p>This is the first time microplastics have been found in human brains, which is important. However, this study is a “pre-print”, so other independent microplastics researchers haven't yet reviewed or validated the study.</p>

<h3><strong>How do microplastics end up in the brain?</strong></h3>

<p>Microplastics typically enter the body through contaminated food and water. This can disrupt the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389423020848?via%3Dihub">gut microbiome</a> (the community of microbes in your gut) and cause inflammation. This leads to effects in the whole body via the immune system and the complex, two-way communication system between the gut and the brain. This so-called <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1467-3045/46/5/256">gut-brain axis</a> is implicated in many aspects of health and disease.</p>

<p>We can also <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389421010888">breathe in</a> airborne microplastics. Once these particles are in the gut or lungs, they can move into the bloodstream and then travel around the body into <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030438942201932X?via%3Dihub">various organs</a>.</p>

<p>Studies have found microplastics in human <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c03924">faeces</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132640">joints</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2022.104147">livers</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167760">reproductive organs</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2022.107199">blood</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0280594">vessels</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c07179">hearts</a>.</p>

<p>Microplastics also migrate to the brains of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36711285/">wild fish</a>. In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.128431">mouse studies</a>, ingested microplastics are absorbed from the gut into the blood and can enter the brain, becoming lodged in other <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46687">organs</a> along the way.</p>

<p>To get into brain tissue, microplastics must cross the <a href="https://theconversation.com/our-blood-brain-barrier-stops-bugs-and-toxins-getting-to-our-brain-heres-how-it-works-230965">blood-brain-barrier</a>, an intricate layer of cells that is supposed to keep things in the blood from entering the brain.</p>

<p>Although concerning, this is not surprising, as microplastics must cross similar cell barriers to enter the <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2305-6304/11/1/40">urine</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165922">testes</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.140301">placenta</a>, where they have already been found in humans.</p>

<h3><strong>Is this a health concern?</strong></h3>

<p>We don't yet know the effects of microplastics in the human brain. Some laboratory experiments suggest microplastics increase <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653522007548">brain inflammation</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001393512301215X?via%3Dihub">cell damage</a>, alter <a href="https://particleandfibretoxicology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12989-020-00358-y">gene expression</a> and change <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389421027849">brain structure</a>.</p>

<p>Aside from the effects of the microplastic particles themselves, microplastics might also pose risks if they carry <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749123021929">environmental toxins</a> or <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-11890-7">bacteria </a> into and around the body.</p>

<p><a href="https://annalsofglobalhealth.org/articles/10.5334/aogh.4459?_rsc=13r6v">Various plastic chemicals</a> could also leach out of the microplastics into the body. These include the famous <a href="https://theconversation.com/science-shows-that-bpa-and-other-endocrine-disruptors-are-harmful-to-human-health-which-should-incite-tighter-regulations-178872">hormone-disrupting chemicals</a> known as BPAs.</p>

<p>But microplastics and their effects are difficult to study. In addition to their small size, there are so many different types of plastics in the environment. More than <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/report/chemicals-plastics-technical-report">13,000 different chemicals</a> have been identified in plastic products, with more being developed every year.</p>

<p>Microplastics are also weathered by the environment and digestive processes, and this is hard to reproduce in the lab.</p>

<p>A goal of our research is to understand how these factors change the way microplastics behave in the body. We plan to investigate if improving the integrity of the gut barrier through diet or probiotics can prevent the uptake of microplastics from the gut into the bloodstream. This may effectively stop the particles from circulating around the body and lodging into organs.</p>

<h3><strong>How do I minimise my exposure?</strong></h3>

<p>Microplastics are widespread in the environment, and it's difficult to avoid exposure. We are just <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10038118/">beginning to understand</a> how microplastics can affect our health.</p>

<p>Until we have more scientific evidence, the best thing we can do is reduce our <a href="https://www.cspinet.org/cspi-news/reduce-plastic-use-home-planets-health-and-ours">exposure to plastics</a> where we can and <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House/Climate_Change_Energy_Environment_and_Water/Plasticpollution/Report/Chapter_3_-_A_national_approach_to_reducing_plastic_pollution">produce less plastic waste</a>, so less ends up in the environment.</p>

<p>An easy place to start is to avoid foods and drinks packaged in single-use plastic or reheated in plastic containers. We can also minimise exposure to synthetic fibres in our homes and clothing.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Swift's three concerts in Vienna, part of her sold-out Eras Tour, were cancelled in early August after authorities got word of the threats. Officials had been expecting tens of thousands of fans inside and outside the stadium where the concerts were set to take place.</p>

<p>The main suspect in the planned attack, a 19-year-old Austrian citizen, was in contact with two minors, including a person who was slated to work at the concert venue, officials told reporters at the time. The suspect has made a confession, and all others allegedly involved in the plot have been detained, they said.</p>

<p>Investigators searching the main suspect's home about an hour's drive south of Vienna found chemical substances, manuals on how to prepare explosive devices, knives, and material promoting the Islamic State.</p>

<p>Cohen offered no other details about the information the CIA had about the plot against Swift's concerts in Vienna. In a statement to social media last week, Swift said that while she felt guilty for canceling the shows, “we were grieving concerts and not lives” thanks to the authorities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States has reported over 58 cases in a Listeria outbreak, with eight deaths according to the latest data released by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This marks the largest listeriosis outbreak since the 2011 incident linked to cantaloupe.</p>

<h3><strong>What Is Listeria</strong></h3>

<p>Listeria is a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/listeria-outbreak-in-us-us-reports-more-illnesses-deaths-in-listeria-outbreak-linked-to-deli-meat-6441348">bacterial infection</a> that can occur in moist environments, soil, water, decaying vegetation, and animals. It can survive and even grow under refrigeration and other food preservation methods. When people consume contaminated food, they may develop a disease called listeriosis.</p>

<h3><strong>Symptoms</strong></h3>

<p>Symptoms can vary depending on the individual and the affected part of the body. Common symptoms include fever, muscle aches, fatigue, loss of balance, stiff neck, and seizures. In some cases, it can take up to 10 weeks for symptoms of listeriosis to appear.</p>

<h3><strong>Who Is At Risk</strong></h3>

<p>Listeria most commonly affects pregnant individuals, newborns, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems. While others can also contract Listeria, they rarely become seriously ill.</p>

<h3><strong>Prevention</strong></h3>

<p>Listeria is a hardy bacterium that can spread to and from food. Certain foods are more likely to be contaminated with Listeria, such as soft cheeses, raw milk, deli meats, prepared meats, pât&amp;#233;, cold-smoked fish, sprouts, and melons.</p>

<p>To prevent infection, it is essential to clean the inside walls and shelves of the refrigerator, cutting boards, and countertops. Hands should be washed with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds before and after handling food.</p>

<p>Pregnant women, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems should avoid certain foods, including unpasteurised or raw milk, cheeses made from unpasteurised milk, raw fish, raw sprouts, and some other raw foods.</p>

<p>People with pets should be particularly cautious to avoid cross-contamination when preparing their pet's food.</p>

<h3><strong>Diagnosis</strong></h3>

<p>Listeria infection is typically diagnosed when a laboratory test detects Listeria in a sample of the ill person's body fluids or tissues.</p>

<h3><strong>Treatment</strong></h3>

<p>Treatment varies depending on the type and severity of the illness. Antibiotic therapy is the preferred treatment for invasive listeriosis.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The World Health Organization declared the last mpox global emergency over in May 2023. And just over a year later, here we are again.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Health Organization declared the last mpox global emergency over in May 2023. And just over a year later, here we are again.</p>

<p>Since the start of 2024, a deadlier, more transmissible strain of the virus has killed about 575 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo and infected 30 times more. New cases have recently appeared in Europe and Asia. In August, the WHO declared a new mpox global health emergency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bloomberg's Ashleigh Furlong joins host Sarah Holder to explain why the latest outbreak could have been avoided - and what it will cost to beat it.</p>

<h3><strong>Here is a lightly edited transcript of the conversation:</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Sarah Holder</strong>: Mozart had it. So did Beethoven, George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. For nearly 3,000 years, smallpox wreaked havoc, killing a third of people who were infected, and severely disfiguring many others.</p>

<p><strong>Archive</strong>: Because it is here that most of the fatal cases of smallpox have occurred...</p>

<p><strong>Holder</strong>: Even though a vaccine - the world's first vaccine! - was created in 1796 - it took hundreds of years to figure out how to get it to enough people.</p>

<p><strong>Archive</strong>: The focus, of course, is on Bradford, where tens of thousands of people have waited their turn for vaccination.</p>

<p><strong>Holder:</strong> A concentrated effort to vaccinate the world against smallpox started in 1959. Two decades later, it had mostly succeeded.</p>

<p><strong>Archive:</strong> In October, the Somalia smallpox eradication program recorded the last case in Merca town. And it seems to me that this was the last known case of smallpox in the world.</p>

<p><strong>Holder</strong>: By 1980, health officials announced that smallpox was officially eradicated. And with that came the end of the vaccination push that had led to one of the greatest achievements in public health history. But that achievement also had some unintended consequences.</p>

<p><strong>Ashleigh Furlong</strong>: We had the smallpox vaccines and that actually also protected against mpox. When we eradicated smallpox, stopped giving people smallpox vaccines, that's when we started to see mpox cases rise in certain countries in Africa.</p>

<p><strong>Holder</strong>: Ashleigh Furlong is a health reporter for Bloomberg. She says that mpox has been infecting humans in West and Central Africa with increasing frequency since it was first reported in a nine-month-old boy in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1970.</p>

<p><strong>Furlong</strong>: It's been spreading in Africa for decades. It's called endemic at the moment because it's sort of constantly there. It's not sporadic.</p>

<p><strong>Holder</strong>: Allowing that spread - and not instituting a comprehensive vaccine program - has allowed the mpox virus to mutate. Now, a dangerous new strain has been detected in at least six African countries - and the world is watching.</p>

<p><strong>Archive</strong>: The World Health Organization declares an Mpox outbreak in Africa a global health emergency, as it seeks to contain the potentially deadly virus.</p>

<p><strong>Holder:</strong> Vaccinations are part of the key to getting this outbreak under control. But things are different today from when the world beat smallpox. And public health experts are saying that the worst part about mpox being back on the map is that it was entirely avoidable.</p>

<p><strong>Archive</strong>: This is something that should concern us all.</p>

<p><strong>Holder</strong>: Today on the show: missed warnings, $100 vaccines and red tape - why the latest mpox outbreak didn't have to happen like this - and what it will now cost to beat it. I'm Sarah Holder and this is the Big Take from Bloomberg News.</p>

<p><strong>Furlong</strong>: So the epicentre of where we're seeing the spread is in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We're seeing it in neighbouring countries as well. And then we're seeing a couple of cases in European countries. We saw one in Sweden and then we also saw one outside of Africa in Thailand.</p>

<p><strong>Holder</strong>: Bloomberg's Ashleigh Furlong says the epicentre of this current mpox outbreak is in the country where the virus was first spotted: Congo. And one thing that's notable about this particular outbreak is how mpox is spreading.</p>

<p><strong>Furlong</strong>: So what we've been seeing at the moment is that it's being transmitted often through sexual contact. But it could be through, you know, just touching a friend or, you know, sharing bed sheets with someone who has been infected by the virus.</p>

<p><strong>Holder</strong>: And what does a mpox case look like? What does it do to the body?</p>

<p><strong>Furlong</strong>: A lot of the symptoms are kind of like any old virus that you might get and could be confused with another virus. But I think what is quite significant about mpox are these lesions that you get, sort of small sores, kind of like chicken pox. And we've seen a few cases where actually they thought it could be mpox, but it turned out to be chickenpox. So I think that the little round lesions that you see on people with mpox - that's sort of a strong attribute of mpox - but otherwise, it can cause people to sort of feel unwell, tired, things that you might get with another kind of virus.</p>

<p><strong>Holder</strong>: Historically, mpox has shown a limited ability to spread. The virus has mostly been transmitted from animals to humans - like from eating bush meat - and amongst humans in very close proximity, like those who live in the same household or share the same bed sheets. But that's changed with this latest outbreak, which began in December with the emergence of a new strain, called clade Ib.</p>

<p><strong>Furlong</strong>: Now what we're seeing is sort of a change in transmission and it's spreading from human to human in these long chains of transmission. And that's what's got scientists really quite worried.</p>

<p><strong>Holder</strong>: Can it be fatal?</p>

<p><strong>Furlong</strong>: It can.</p>

<p><strong>Holder</strong>: The key thing to know about this outbreak is that it's different from the one that happened in 2022. That year saw the first-ever global outbreak of the virus. And fresh off the heels of the COVID-19 crisis, the US and western Europe acted fast.</p>

<p><strong>Furlong</strong>: We saw vaccines rolled out to at-risk communities, which at that time was mainly men who have sex with men, and we were seeing the transmission within those communities. There was a lot of public health messaging as well around safe sex practices, about how mpox is transmitted, how to stop it being transmitted.</p>

<p><strong>Holder</strong>: That messaging and those resources seemed to work in some places, particularly in the US, which had stockpiled vaccines.</p>

<p><strong>Furlong</strong>: The US has always been really worried about a smallpox outbreak, potentially. And this vaccine is effective against smallpox. So that's why they had those contracts and why they had those stockpiles.</p>

<p><strong>Holder</strong>: But Ashleigh says in Congo and other African countries, where mpox is endemic, the response was different.</p>

<p><strong>Furlong</strong>: In many African countries, mpox cases continue to appear and vaccines never arrived there. Public health messaging around stopping mpox- there might've been that messaging, but there's obviously many other priorities when you're a country, like the DRC, like Congo, where measles kills way more people than mpox does. So there's obviously different priorities that governments have when handling health crises.</p>

<p><strong>Holder</strong>: Another factor governments have to contend with is the price of the mpox vaccine.</p>

<p><strong>Holder</strong>: How much do those shots cost?</p>

<p><strong>Furlong</strong>: So there's several vaccine developers who have mpox vaccines, and the one that is approved in the US and in Europe is from Bavarian Nordic. And we don't have an exact price because the company hasn't actually revealed how much they're charging for their shot. But the Africa CDC estimates that it's about $100 a dose. You need two doses to be fully vaccinated against the virus. So that's quite pricey. Vaccines are normally quite cheap.</p>

<p><strong>Holder</strong>: In mid-2020, the US government was able to buy COVID-19 vaccines for about $20 a dose. So I asked Ashleigh what makes the mpox vaccine five times as expensive. She said there was one main reason.</p>

<p><strong>Furlong</strong>: There's not a huge market for them. You know, mpox we might see - there's obviously quite a few cases, and there's currently a global health emergency around it - but it's still quite small. So if you're a vaccine developer figuring out how to price your vaccine, you need to make considerations about, you know, you're only producing maybe several million doses of this vaccine. So you need to still make a profit. And that's what Bavarian Nordic has said, basically, is that to be viable they have to charge the price that they have set, and they don't have that much flexibility. You know, when you're distributing a measles vaccine, for example - most childhood immunization campaigns will include a measles vaccine - so that's a massive, massive market compared to the mpox vaccines.</p>

<p><strong>Holder</strong>: While fewer people might have needed an mpox vaccine, Ashleigh's sources told her that making sure the vaccine was available to the people who did need it could have changed the course of this current outbreak.</p>

<p><strong>Furlong</strong>: When I spoke to scientists last week, they were really saying that if vaccines had gotten to the DRC, for example, to Congo in January, we wouldn't be in the situation.</p>

<p><strong>Holder</strong>: But this is the situation we're in. So what will it take to get the outbreak under control - and what's at stake if the world fails to act. That's next.</p>

<p><strong>Holder</strong>: The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention reported Sunday that mpox has killed 575 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo since the start of this year - and it's infected 30 times more. And new cases are now being found in Asia and in Europe. I asked Bloomberg's Ashleigh Furlong where efforts to combat the outbreak currently stand.</p>

<p><strong>Holder</strong>: So are vaccines available now for the folks around the world who are at most risk?</p>

<p><strong>Furlong</strong>: No. So, Congo doesn't have any doses at the moment, they said, for the next couple days, but there's no clear timeline yet.</p>

<p><strong>Holder</strong>: How many vaccines are needed?</p>

<p><strong>Furlong</strong>: The Africa CDC says that about 10 million are needed for the African continent. That's quite small. In the DRC and in Congo, the population is nearly a hundred million. So we're talking about a tiny amount of vaccines really that are needed potentially to control the outbreak. Obviously, we would have needed probably less if we were talking about this several months ago.</p>

<p><strong>Holder</strong>: The US is planning to donate 50,000 doses, but it has millions more in its stockpiles. Germany will donate 100,000 doses of its 117,000-dose reserve. Almost none of these donations are expected to get to Congo until September at the earliest.</p>

<p><strong>Furlong</strong>: That won't get us up to the 10 million, so the rest will probably need to be bought. And countries like Congo don't have the budgets to buy those vaccines. So, we're going to be looking at who's going to help pay for those. There's some money being pledged by several aid organizations and organizations that might administer and roll out these vaccines. But at the moment, it doesn't look like we have the full amount that's needed.</p>

<p><strong>Holder</strong>: But Ashleigh says containing the outbreak is not just a matter of getting enough vaccines.</p>

<p><strong>Furlong:</strong> Rolling it out is going to also require quite a lot of resources. Healthcare workers, campaigns about educating people about getting the vaccine - because just because you have a vaccine on the ground, as we saw during COVID doesn't mean people will want to take it. And also, in some of these communities, there might be quite a lot of stigma around mpox vaccines. There might be concern that, oh, if I get an mpox vaccine, everyone's going to know that I might be at risk of mpox through my sexual network or through my sexual contacts. So we're going to have to see how that plays out on the ground.</p>

<p><strong>Holder</strong>: Given all these challenges, how likely is it that mpox will be contained?</p>

<p><strong>Furlong</strong>: We are seeing quite a strong finally, you know, response from sort of the global players in a sense from the US, from countries like Germany, et cetera. So we are seeing that reaction. It might have been a little bit delayed. I think there's a sense that this is not going to be the next pandemic. And that there's a strong desire to stop the outbreak and we're seeing from the WHO, from the Africa CDC, a really strong message that this needs to be stopped now. I suppose it'll depend on when that point's reached where it's no longer a global threat, then what happens? Are we going to go back to what happened last year when the global threat ended, the world health organization said this is no longer a global emergency, and then things kind of went back to the status quo where, which basically meant nothing really happened to stop the spread of mpox?</p>

<p><strong>Holder</strong>: So there's a risk that there could be a false sense of complacency, and that could snowball into a much bigger problem.</p>

<p><strong>Furlong</strong>: Exactly. But I think that we've seen what that risk has done now. So hopefully some of those lessons might be learned. But this is a disease that, as we've spoken about, has been spreading for a very long time. But there's been a push to end measles for years and we still haven't reached that, and we're seeing more spread of measles in high-income countries as well. So, I think global health experts don't get their hopes up too much.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang, addressing concerns about the company's new Blackwell chips, said that supplies will be plentiful after manufacturing gains momentum.</p>

<p>"We're going to have lots and lots of supply, and we will be able to ramp," he said Wednesday in an interview on Bloomberg Television. Samples of the chip are already going out "all over the world today," and the company has started volume production.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The availability of the Blackwell chip, first announced earlier this year, has become a key focus for Nvidia investors and analysts. The product is a much-anticipated successor to the company's Hopper line of so-called AI accelerators, which have sent its revenue and stock price soaring. However, production challenges have raised concerns about delays.</p>

<p>Earlier, Nvidia disclosed that it had to revamp part of the manufacturing process. Even with the changes, the company expects to have billions of dollars of revenue from Blackwell in its fiscal fourth quarter.</p>

<p>Huang discussed the issue during Nvidia's quarterly earnings call on Wednesday, when analysts pressed the CEO for more details about Blackwell revenue. When he declined to elaborate, it weighed on the stock in late trading. The shares fell more than 7%, despite Nvidia's overall results and forecast topping analysts' estimates.</p>

<p>Heading into the earnings report, analysts had expressed concerns that Blackwell's problems might derail Nvidia's rapid growth and even slow the spread of artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Huang said on Bloomberg Television that he thought he was clear enough about Blackwell's prospects. "Functionality of Blackwell is wonderful," he said.</p>

<p>Beyond the revenue it will generate in the fourth quarter, which ends in January, "we will have a great next year as well," Huang said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meet "Eva," "Sophia," and "Samantha" -- fake accounts which pose as chic American women who support Donald Trump on the platform X, disguising themselves by using stolen photographs of European fashion and beauty influencers, according to a study published Wednesday.</p>

<p>The report by the nonprofit Center for Information Resilience (CIR) comes as researchers express alarm ahead of the US election in November that the site owned by Elon Musk -- who has endorsed Trump -- is plagued with fake accounts and political disinformation.</p>

<p>CIR said it uncovered 16 accounts that used images of European influencers -- without their permission -- to pose as young women promoting Trump and encouraging thousands of followers to vote for the Republican nominee.</p>

<p>These accounts, which use stolen images of real people to appear authentic, were among 56 profiles that appear to be part of a coordinated campaign to push pro-Trump content, it added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"By using images of the influencers, the accounts recognize the value of creating a believable human persona, steering clear of the generic photos and bot-like usernames usually associated with fake accounts," CIR's report said.</p>

<p>It was unclear who was behind the digital deception or whether the accounts were pushing pro-Trump content for ideological or monetary gain.</p>

<p>The fake profiles use everyday images from the influencers' Instagram accounts -- including pictures of them at the beach or walking their dog -- which are captioned with MAGA-related hashtags or pledges to vote for Trump, CIR said.</p>

<p>MAGA, or Make America Great Again, is a political slogan associated with Trump and his campaign.</p>

<p>Many of the accounts have attempted to spread misinformation about hot-button political subjects such as a recent assassination attempt against Trump, his Democratic rival Kamala Harris's ethnicity and US military aid to Ukraine, the report said.</p>

<p>Some accounts also promote anti-vaccine and COVID-19 conspiracies, with some posts viewed hundreds of thousands of times.</p>

<p>"They post about divisive issues in US politics in a bid to exploit pre-existing tensions," the report said.</p>

<p>One of the impersonators is "Luna," a self-described 32-year-old "MAGA Trump supporter," who used images of a German fashion influencer named Debbie Nederlof, according to CNN, which jointly conducted the investigation with CIR.</p>

<p>Nederlof, a single mother, voiced anger and frustration over the misuse of her images, saying she had "nothing to do with the United States, with Trump, the political things over there."</p>

<p>"What the hell do I -- from a small place in Germany -- care about US politics?" she said.</p>

<p>X did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Impersonation is a violation of the platform's rules, and accounts posing as another person, group or organization may be "permanently suspended," according to X's website.</p>

<p>Musk appears to exert an outsized influence on US voters through the platform and his own personal account, which is regularly flagged by fact-checkers for spreading political falsehoods to his nearly 196 million followers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since Musk's 2022 acquisition of X, the platform has gutted trust and safety teams and scaled back content moderation efforts once used to tame misinformation, making it what researchers call a haven for disinformation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An unguarded exchange between Australia's prime minister and a veteran US diplomat about a sensitive Pacific policing plan was caught on camera, causing blushes at a regional summit Thursday.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell were heard celebrating a deal at the Pacific Islands Forum in Tonga that is seen as a way of stymying similar Chinese-led efforts.</p>

<p>"We had a cracker," Albanese told Campbell, celebrating a deal to establish a police training facility and a crisis reaction force of about 200 personnel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It will make such a difference," he said, with a coffee cup in hand.</p>

<p>Campbell hailed the agreement as "fantastic" and said Washington had considered doing something similar, before allowing Australia to take the lead.</p>

<p>"We've given you the whole lane, so take the lane," Campbell urged Albanese, in an exchange filmed by a reporter.</p>

<p>Albanese seized the moment to jokingly ask if Washington would like to help bankroll the project: "You can go us halfsies on the cost if you like".</p>

<p>"It would only cost you a bit."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Here's the originating conversation. How can Albo even fein any outrage being recorded in public?<br />
<br />
Credit <a href="https://twitter.com/LydiaLewisRNZ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LydiaLewisRNZ</a> for the capture. <a href="https://t.co/ib5dH74SNp">pic.twitter.com/ib5dH74SNp</a></p>
— Aus Integrity (@QBCCIntegrity) <a href="https://twitter.com/QBCCIntegrity/status/1829044144079286490?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 29, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Australia has set aside US$271 million for the initial phase of the project.</p>

<p>The exchange will fuel often-repeated Chinese allegations that Australia is doing America's bidding in the region, and that both countries are preoccupied with countering Beijing's growing influence.</p>

<p>Sydney has tried to paint the police initiative as coming from the Pacific Islands -- despite Australia bankrolling the project and hosting the training facility in Brisbane.</p>

<p>Asked later Thursday about whether the pair had been guilty of saying "the quiet part out loud", Albanese bristled.</p>

<p>"This has come from the Pacific. And I'm aware of the video of a private conversation. Kurt Campbell's a mate of mine, it's us having a chat," he claimed.</p>

<p>"People try and read something into it, you must be pretty bored, frankly," he said.</p>

<p>"It is Pacific-led, this has been led by police ministers who have been meeting about this for a year," he said.</p>

<p>China's Pacific allies -- most notably Vanuatu and Solomon Islands -- had voiced concern that the policing plan represented a "geo-strategic denial security doctrine", designed to box out Beijing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China tried and failed to ink a region-wide security pact in 2022, but has since been plying some under-resourced Pacific police forces with martial arts training and fleets of Chinese-made vehicles.</p>

<p>While all members of the forum have endorsed the deal in principle, national leaders will have to decide how much they participate, if at all.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US has reported more than 50 illnesses and eight deaths in Listeria outbreak, according to the latest data released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>

<p>Listeria is a hardy germ that can remain on surfaces, like meat slicers, and foods, even at refrigerated temperatures, Xinhua news agency reported on Wednesday.</p>

<p>It can also take up to 10 weeks for some people to have symptoms of listeriosis, according to CDC.</p>

<p>Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback data show that meats sliced at delis, including Boar's Head brand liverwurst, are contaminated with Listeria and are making people sick, according to CDC.</p>

<p>Listeria spreads easily among deli equipment, surfaces, hands, and food.</p>

<p>A total of 57 people have been hospitalised due to Listeria infections in the country, and eight deaths have now been reported, according to CDC.</p>

<p>This is the largest listeriosis outbreak since the 2011 outbreak linked to cantaloupe.</p>

<p>The CDC requested the public not to eat recalled deli products.</p>

<p>People who are at higher risk of getting sick with Listeria, such as those who are pregnant, are aged 65 or older, or have a weakened immune system, are suggested to avoid eating meats sliced at deli counters, unless heated until steaming hot just before serving.</p>

<p>The new deaths include two in South Carolina and one each in Florida, Tennessee and New Mexico. Illinois, New Jersey and Virginia have also reported deaths in the outbreak, which genetic testing has linked to liverwurst products manufactured by Boar's Head.</p>

<p>Boar's Head has recalled more than 7 million pounds of 71 different meat and poultry products as of July 30, according to the US Department of Agriculture.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean authorities called on Telegram and other social media platforms on Wednesday to work together with them in deleting and blocking sexually explicit deepfake content, seeking to appease public and political outrage over the problem.</p>

<p>The steps follow reports by several domestic media outlets that sexually explicit deepfake images and videos of South Korean women were often found in Telegram chatrooms.</p>

<p>A 24-hour hotline for victims will also be set up and the number of regulatory personnel monitoring digital sex crimes will be doubled from the current number of 70, the Korea Communications Standards Commission said.</p>

<p>The Korean National Police Agency also said it will make a seven-month push to crack down on online sex crimes.</p>

<p>The media watchdog plans to set up a consultative body to enhance communication with social media firms about deleting and blocking sexual deepfake content, its chairman, Ryu Hee-lim, told a meeting on the issue.</p>

<p>For companies that don't have offices in South Korea, it wants to set up a face-to-face channel for regular consultation.</p>

<p>"Production, possession and distribution of deepfake sex crime videos are a serious crime that destroys the individual dignity and personal rights," Ryu said.</p>

<p>In addition to Telegram, the commission said it would be seeking cooperation from X as well as Meta's Facebook and Instagram and Google's YouTube.</p>

<p>Telegram said it actively moderates harmful content on its platform including illegal pornography.</p>

<p>"Moderators use a combination of proactive monitoring of public parts of the platform, sophisticated AI tools and user reports in order to remove millions of pieces of harmful content each day," it said in a statement.</p>

<p>The other companies did not respond to Reuter's requests for comment.</p>

<p>Criticism of Telegram in South Korea has coincided with the arrest of Pavel Durov, Telegram's Russian-born founder, on the weekend - part of a French probe into child pornography, drug trafficking and fraud on the encrypted messaging app.</p>

<p>The number of deepfake sex crime cases in South Korea has surged from 156 in 2021 when data was first collated to 297 so far this year, with most of the perpetrators being teenagers, according to police.</p>

<p>The victims are usually female and include school students as well as female soldiers in South Korea's military.</p>

<p>This year, South Koreans have made more than 6,400 requests for help from the Korea Communications Standards Commission to have sexually explicit deepfake content taken down. That compares with nearly 7,200 cases last year in which the commission agreed to help take down content.</p>

<p>Telegram is now the main platform of choice for perpetrators of sexually explicit deepfake content, said Kim Yeo-jin, the head of the Korea Cyber Sexual Violence Response Center, adding that police need to do more.</p>

<p>In many cases, victims have been told by police that filing a report wouldn't be effective because the content was on Telegram, making it tough to catch the criminals, she said.</p>

<p>Police officials did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p>

<p>Information on how social media firms respond to requests by South Korean authorities is hard to come by.</p>

<p>But police data published by lawmaker Kim Young-bae in 2020 showed that police made seven requests to Telegram via email for help with investigations into digital sex crimes between February and August of that year and Telegram did not respond to any of them.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The push, which includes false assertions that Walz signed a law protecting paedophiles, has been amplified by Donald Trump and top Republicans as political campaigning kicks into high gear ahead of the November 5 election.</p>

<p>Walz -- the popular two-term governor of Minnesota -- has also faced a torrent of misinformation about his legislative record on transgender rights and gender-affirming care.</p>

<p>Trump recently heaped scorn on Walz, saying he was "heavy into the transgender world."</p>

<p>Trump's supporters have mocked him as "Tampon Tim," falsely asserting that he forced schools to make tampons and pads available in boys' toilets after he signed a law that requires schools to make the products available for free for menstruating students.</p>

<p>But -- unlike an issue such as abortion, which has driven voters to polls at local, state and national levels since the Supreme Court overturned the right to the procedure in 2022 -- the attacks appear to have failed to move the needle on Walz.</p>

<p>"People are getting 'issue fatigue' with regards to the culture wars," Todd Belt, director of the political management program at George Washington University, told AFP.</p>

<p>"As the election gets closer, people want to hear out kitchen-table issues that have a material effect on their well-being."</p>

<h3><strong>'Real issues'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"Inflation is Americans' most important issue," said an Economist-YouGov poll in mid-August, with 26 per cent expressing concern about prices.</p>

<p>When asked about other issues "important" to Americans, jobs and the economy, immigration, healthcare and climate change were listed as the top answers.</p>

<p>Abortion, which many Americans regard as a hot-button culture war issue, appeared on the list, at sixth place.</p>

<p>"Voters are insisting that politicians focus instead on the real issues facing our nation, including inflation, abortion rights, and climate change," said GLAAD president Sarah Kate Ellis.</p>

<p>Her statement followed a survey in March which concluded that campaigning on anti-transgender issues was a "losing strategy," with candidates who frequently discuss them creating more opposition than support for their campaigns.</p>

<p>That has not stopped both Republicans and Democrats from putting the culture wars at the centre of their campaigns, and in a volatile election cycle issues other than abortion could yet break through.</p>

<p>But for now, despite the hammering of his pro-LGBTQ record, Walz has stayed easily ahead of Republican vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance in national polling.</p>

<h3><strong>'People are tired'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Much of the rhetoric against Walz involves children, including a viral claim across social media that he signed a bill last year protecting paedophiles in Minnesota, AFP fact-checkers reported.</p>

<p>The false claim, which garnered tens of thousands of views on sites such as Instagram, deploys a long-standing disinformation trope tying the LGBTQ community to paedophilia.</p>

<p>While lawmakers did remove a reference to paedophilia in the state's human rights law, experts including Naomi Cahn, a University of Virginia professor, said the move does not affect the "criminal laws concerning sexual contact with a child."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other posts falsely accuse Walz of allowing the state to terminate parental custody if trans children are stopped by their parents from receiving gender-affirming care.</p>

<p>"Tim Walz signed a bill that lets the state take away (your) kids... in the name of 'gender-affirming care,'" conservative talk show host Megyn Kelly wrote on the platform X, a falsehood that garnered over 2.5 million views and was widely shared by Trump supporters.</p>

<p>Walz battled such misinformation after he signed the Trans Refuge Bill last year, granting legal protection to transgender people who come to Minnesota to seek medical care, even if the treatment is illegal in their home state.</p>

<p>Top Republicans such as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin did see electoral success in past voting cycles by stoking anti-LGBTQ rhetoric.</p>

<p>But polls showed that -- unlike Democrats with abortion rights -- Republicans had little success mobilizing voters around anti-trans issues in the 2022 midterm elections.</p>

<p>"It's not working right now" before the November election, Belt said, adding that "people are tired" of the messaging.</p>

<p>"You can't win an election just by being against something."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A local Australian news channel has come under fire after a video of a dancing group of "sexy Santas" emerged from what has been described as a routine staff meeting. According to the <em>New York Post,</em> the meeting of Seven Network's parent company Seven West Media in Perth was held last week on Friday and was intended to introduce new appointments. It was when the Deputy news director was discussing an upcoming programme when Mariah Carey's '<em>All I Want for Christmas' </em>started playing, and a group of female dancers wearing Santa hats and short red dresses appeared on stage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/26/media/news-station-under-fire-over-sexy-santas-at-staff-meeting/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Post</em></a>, a photo of the meeting was shared on social media and it drew heavy criticism, with many saying it was a scene pulled directly from the 1980s. In the meeting, female staff reacted with shock, and some even walked out in protest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"OMG - if they thought that was even slightly appropriate given everything we've found out about them, the cultural makeup of that organization is badly broken," wrote one social media user. "That will help fix the culture issues which have been uncovered," said another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A Seven West Media staff meeting last Friday featured women dancers dressed as sexy Santas. I thought this was a parody news report until I saw it confirmed by numerous news media. So Seven is STILL stuck in the 1970's," commented a third.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A spokesman for Seven West Media, on the other hand, defended the dancers, explaining that they were part of the Christmas Pageant, which is a "Perth institution".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, according to the <em>Post</em>, the incident comes amid ongoing scrutiny over alleged inappropriate behaviour at the media network. In recent weeks, veteran Sydney reporter Robert Ovadia launched legal action in the Federal Court against the company. Mr Ovadia reportedly stood down in June following an investigation into allegations of inappropriate behaviour.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Ovadia lodged proceedings in the Federal Court against the Seven Network and its news boss, Anthony De Ceglie. He claimed that Seven told him that no complaints had been made against him. "Any suggestion that I have behaved inappropriately at any time is false, malicious and will be defended," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The media group, for its part, said that it takes any allegations in retaliation to sexual harassment, bullying and other behaviours deemed to be inappropriate "seriously".&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

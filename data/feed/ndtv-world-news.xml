       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A massive blast on a road near the airport of Pakistan's largest city killed two Chinese nationals, Beijing's embassy said Monday, after a separatist militant group claimed an attack in the area.</p>

<p>An AFP journalist heard the explosion in Pakistan's southern megacity of Karachi around 11:00 pm (1800 GMT) Sunday.</p>

<p>The regional government of southern Sindh province said on X that a "tanker" had exploded on the airport motorway.</p>

<p>The separatist militant group the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) said in a statement that it had "targeted a high-level convoy of Chinese engineers and investors" coming from Karachi's airport.</p>

<p>Beijing's embassy to Pakistan said in a statement on Monday that two Chinese citizens had been killed in a "terror attack" on a convoy of personnel from the Chinese-funded Port Qasim power project.</p>

<p>The attack also left one Chinese and several Pakistani citizens wounded, the embassy said.</p>

<p>The embassy urged authorities to "conduct a thorough investigation of the attack and severely punish the killers, while at the same time taking practical measures to fully ensure the safety of Chinese citizens, institutions and projects".</p>

<p>The BLA is a separatist militant group advocating for the autonomy of Pakistan's Balochistan province, the largest but poorest region of the country.</p>

<p>The group has regularly targeted Chinese nationals, claiming ethnic Baloch locals are not receiving their fair share of wealth extracted by foreign investors.</p>

<p>Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority said flights from Karachi were continuing "as usual" and "agencies are investigating the cause at the scene of the accident/explosion".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Recently, the officer was assigned to the Fugitive Unit of the Atlanta Police Department (APD). He joined the department in November 2015.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An off-duty police officer in Georgia, USA, who was previously honoured as "Investigator of the Year," was shot and killed while allegedly attempting to enter a neighbour's home, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/06/us-news/atlanta-police-officer-aubree-horton-shot-killed-while-breaking-into-neighbors-home/" rel="NoFollowNoIndex">New York Post reported</a>. Aubree Horton reportedly entered Winston's residence through the front door, where he confronted the homeowner. The police had been called to the scene regarding a suspected burglary in the St Andrews Country Club neighbourhood at around 5am.&nbsp;Authorities suspect that Horton was either undergoing a mental health crisis or was under the influence of drugs.</p>

<p>"When he entered the home, the homeowner acted in self-defence and shot him," said Captain John Mauney, as reported by Fox 5 Atlanta.</p>

<p>The officer was reported to be living only half a mile from where the incident took place, leaving residents in shock.</p>

<p>"I've been living here for five years, and this is something you'd never expect to happen," said resident Milton Johnston. Another neighbour commented, "It's a quiet golfing community. You just don't think something like this would ever happen here."</p>

<p>Recently, Mr Horton was assigned to the Fugitive Unit of the Atlanta Police Department (APD). He joined the department in November 2015. His recent recognition was linked to his work on a high-profile case involving the disappearance and death of 21-year-old Leondre Flynt, whose remains were found in July. Three suspects were arrested in connection with Flynt's death.</p>

<p>At the awards ceremony, Horton expressed his commitment to solving the case, saying, "It was a challenging investigation, but I felt the family deserved justice." Reflecting on the case's resolution, he added, "It was a significant achievement to provide the family with closure and hold someone accountable. That's why I do this job-to bring closure to people."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump's much-hyped return to Butler, Pennsylvania, came exactly one month before the November 5 presidential election, the outcome of which President Joe Biden suggested on Friday might not be peaceful.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump defiantly returned Saturday to the site of a campaign rally where an assassin's bullet almost killed him in July, questioning whether his opponents were responsible and declaring he would "never quit."</p>

<p>"Exactly 12 weeks ago this evening, on this very ground, a cold-blooded assassin aimed to silence me," the Republican candidate told tens of thousands of supporters after taking the stage behind bulletproof glass.</p>

<p>Calling the gunman a "vicious monster," Trump vowed he would "never quit... never bend... never break" to cheers of "fight, fight, fight" from the crowd.</p>

<p>Trump's much-hyped return to Butler, Pennsylvania, came exactly one month before the November 5 presidential election, the outcome of which President Joe Biden suggested on Friday might not be peaceful.</p>

<p>Trump lashed out at his political opponents, calling them the "enemy within" who had pushed to indict him and "who knows, maybe even tried to kill me."</p>

<p>"I wasn't supposed to make it," he said ominously.</p>

<p>Security was noticeably tighter than Trump's July rally, with sniper squads atop surrounding buildings, and a surveillance drone deployed overhead.</p>

<p>"There's a lot going on that's unnerving," said Heather Hughes, 43, who had travelled from New Castle in must-win Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>"Do I think he's safe? No, I think there's going to be another attempt. But I think he's going to make it through."</p>

<p>After the assassination attempt, pictures of Trump -- with a blood-streaked face, pumping his fist and shouting "fight, fight, fight" -- became defining images of the campaign.</p>

<p>On Saturday, many Trump supporters wore shirts emblazoned with the iconography, and some sported ear coverings recalling the bandage the former president wore after the shooting.</p>

<p>Billionaire Elon Musk joined Trump on stage, stressing the tight margins that will likely decide the election in battleground states like Pennsylvania and encouraging voter registration.</p>

<p>Trump "must win to preserve democracy in America," said Musk, echoing the alarmist messaging he frequently pushes to his 200 million followers on his X platform.</p>

<h3><strong>Race upended&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Much has changed since Trump's last visit to Butler, when he was riding high in polls after crushing Biden in a TV debate.</p>

<p>Barely a week after the failed assassination bid, the presidential race was turned on its head when Biden dropped out and was replaced as the Democratic nominee by Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Harris has clawed back the poll deficit -- reversing it in some states -- and the seismic events in Butler that had threatened to unleash chaos were largely overtaken.</p>

<p>Trump's rally appeared aimed at recovering the momentum as a bruising campaign enters its final phase.</p>

<p>Harris, who Trump called incompetent, was in North Carolina Saturday meeting first responders and people hit by Hurricane Helene, which killed at least 220 as it ripped through the southeast.</p>

<p>The emergency response is "an example of the best we can do when we bring resources together at the federal, state and local level and tap into the kind of collegiality that produces results," she told officials at a briefing.</p>

<p>Trump has criticized the federal response, alleging without evidence that the Biden-Harris administration wrongly redirected relief funds to migrants.</p>

<h3><strong>Election violence?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The heavy security presence on Saturday highlighted persistent security fears, underscored when another attempt on Trump's life was foiled last month.</p>

<p>The Secret Service has been pilloried for failing to secure the building where the Butler shooter managed to fire at Trump eight times before being shot dead.</p>

<p>Along with Trump, two supporters were wounded and one -- firefighter Corey Comperatore -- was killed.</p>

<p>Trump and his campaign have sought to challenge Democrats' warnings about the former president representing a threat to democracy.</p>

<p>"The Republicans aren't violent... I think they (the Democrats) incite. They keep talking about Hitler and the end of democracy," said retiree Glen Scheirer, who was with five relatives wearing identical "By the grace of God" T-shirts showing Trump after the shooting. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In the immediate aftermath of the Butler incident, all sides urged a lowering of the political temperature.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Trump quickly reverted to his signature inflammatory rhetoric and refused to commit to accepting the eventual result in November.</p>

<p>He has been indicted over the effort to subvert the 2020 election that culminated in his supporters storming the Capitol.</p>

<p>Asked about the possibility of further election-related violence, Biden said Friday he did not know if the vote would be peaceful.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Maldives will not act to undermine India's security and views Delhi as a "valued partner and friend", with cooperation in several fields will "always be a priority", President Mohamed Muizzu said Sunday as he arrived in the national capital.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/maldives" target="_blank">Maldives</a> will not act to undermine India's security and views New Delhi as a "valued partner and friend", with cooperation in several fields - including defence - will "always be a priority", President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/mohamed-muizzu" target="_blank">Mohamed Muizzu</a> said Sunday as he arrived in the national capital for his first bilateral visit.</p>

<p>Mr Muizzu - seen by some as a 'pro-China' leader who ran his election campaign on an 'India Out' platform - told a national English daily Maldives' relationship with India is "built on respect and shared interests" and that Delhi has been, and is, one of his country's largest trade and development partners.</p>

<p>The Maldives leader is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi later today.</p>

<p>"Maldives would never do anything to undermine security of India. While we enhance cooperation with other countries in various sectors, we remain committed to ensuring our actions do not compromise the security and stability of our region..." he told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/president-muizzu-in-india-will-never-hurt-indias-security-interests-maldives-first-but-will-prioritise-ties-with-india/articleshow/113989329.cms" target="_blank">The Times of India</a>&nbsp;in an extensive interview.</p>

<p>Mr Muizzu, while not naming China, also underlined his administration's resolve to "fostering growth and development through diverse international collaborations". He flagged his 'Maldives First' policy, saying "it is essential for the Maldives to diversify international relations and reduce over-dependence on any one country". However, he said that such engagements would not undermine India's interests.</p>

<p>"Respect for our neighbours and friends is embedded in our DNA," he said as he also called on Indian tourists to return. "Indians make a positive contribution... Indian tourists are welcome," he said, batting for his country's most important economic sector, which took a hit last year after the diplomatic row.</p>

<p>This is Mr Muizzu's first bilateral visit and the comments reflect growing bonhomie after a months-long diplomatic stand-off last year, over three Maldivian ministers' comments about Prime Minister Modi after a social media post about Lakshadweep as an alternate tourist destination to the Maldives.</p>

<p>The Maldives' Foreign Ministry distanced itself from the remarks and the ministers were suspended; two - Mariyam Shiuna and Malsha Shareef - <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/maldivies-president-mohamed-muizzu-to-visit-india-soon-2-ministers-resign-amid-strained-ties-6533861" target="_blank">resigned last month</a>&nbsp;after the bilateral visit was confirmed.</p>

<p>And then the request in May - weeks before attending Mr Modi's swearing-in ceremony - to remove 90 military personnel deployed to three aviation platforms gifted by India - also raised eyebrows.</p>

<p>Delhi accepted the request and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/centre-confirms-withdrawal-of-indian-military-personnel-from-maldives-5627860" target="_blank">replaced military personnel with "competent technical" staff</a>.</p>

<p>The ejection of Indian military personnel and an 'India Out' agenda was seen as one of Mr Muizzu's key poll promises. Pressed on these topics, the Maldives President said he "did what the people of Maldives asked of me", but stressed India remains a key partner in efforts to secure regional stability.</p>

<p>"This historic relationship is intertwined like the roots of a tree... built on centuries of exchange and values shared. The relationship between the Maldives and India has always been strong..."</p>

<p>Earlier Mr Muizzu denied having an 'India Out' agenda but insisted his country had a "serious problem" with the presence of foreign military on its soil.&nbsp;"The people of Maldives do not want a single foreign soldier in the country," news agency PTI quoted his comments to local website adhadhu.com.</p>

<p>Mr Muizzu also spoke about India-assisted infrastructure projects, like the Greater Male connectivity scheme and water and sewerage facilities for 28 islands in the archipelago.</p>

<p>The Maldives is one of India's key maritime neighbours in the Indian Ocean region and the overall bilateral ties, including in the areas of defence and security, witnessed an upward trajectory under the previous government led by President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday vowed to achieve victory and said his country's military "completely transformed reality" in the year since Hamas's October 7 attack, which has left the country fighting two wars.</p>

<p>Netanyahu told troops Israel "will win" as it battles militants in both the Gaza Strip and Lebanon and prepares to strike Iran, almost a year since the unprecedented attack by Palestinian Hamas militants sparked the Gaza war.</p>

<p>Israel's army chief, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said that, one year on, "we have defeated the military wing of Hamas".</p>

<p>Netanyahu had pledged to "crush... and destroy" the militants as fighting began last October, but troops have returned to several areas across Gaza where they had previously conducted operations against Hamas, only to find militants regrouping.</p>

<p>In late September Israel turned its focus north, intensifying military action against Iran-backed Hezbollah, which had been routinely sending rockets over the border from Lebanon in support of Hamas.</p>

<p>"A year ago, we suffered a terrible blow. Over the past 12 months, we have completely transformed reality," Netanyahu said during a visit to the Lebanon border, according to his office.</p>

<p>Hamas on Sunday called the October 7 attack "glorious" and said the Palestinians were "writing a new history with their resistance".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Their attack resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity. Dozens of other hostages are still held.</p>

<p>At last 370 people were killed at one location alone, the Nova rave in the Negev desert, which was commemorated with candles, prayer and music in Tel Aviv on Sunday.</p>

<p><strong>Destroyed, displaced</strong></p>

<p>In northern Gaza, the military said it had encircled the Jabaliya area after indications Hamas was rebuilding there despite a year of air strikes and fighting.</p>

<p>Rescuers said 17 people, including nine children, had been killed on Sunday by Israeli air strikes on the area.</p>

<p>Israel's military offensive in Gaza has killed at least 41,870 people, the majority of them civilians, according to figures provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry and described as reliable by the UN.</p>

<p>Most of Gaza's population is displaced and much of the territory's housing and other infrastructure destroyed.</p>

<p>Despite fighting, which has escalated in Lebanon since late September, and the threat of war with Iran, Netanyahu told French President Emmanuel Macron in a phone call that Israel's actions in Lebanon would help bring "stability, security and peace in the entire region", according to Netanyahu's office.</p>

<p>Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati appealed to the international community to push Israel for a ceasefire.</p>

<p>US Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris said in a pre-recorded interview that Washington was "not going to stop" pressuring Israel and Arab leaders to agree a Gaza truce.</p>

<p>The leaders of Jordan and the United Arab Emirates called for intensified international efforts to stop both wars. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani warned the fighting could "plunge the region and the world into prolonged conflicts".</p>

<p>Such appeals, and efforts by mediators, failed to secure a truce and hostage-release deal in Gaza. Critics of Netanyahu accuse him of obstructing such a deal.</p>

<p>Israel has been on high alert in the run-up to the October 7 anniversary, which the military said could lead to "attacks on the home front".</p>

<p><strong>Policewoman killed</strong></p>

<p>In southern Israel's Beersheba central bus station, a border policewoman was killed and 10 other people injured, first responders said. Police called it a suspected "terrorist" attack, adding that the assailant had also been killed.</p>

<p>Official Lebanese media late Sunday reported four Israeli strikes on Hezbollah's south Beirut stronghold, shortly after the latest calls by Israel's military for residents to leave the area.</p>

<p>Israel's military said it struck weapons storage facilities and infrastructure while taking measures "to mitigate the risk of harming civilians".</p>

<p>In a later statement, they said the latest strikes had "struck Hezbollah terrorist targets and weapons storage facilities in Beirut".</p>

<p>Late Sunday, Lebanon's health ministry said six people were killed and 13 wounded in an Israeli strike on the village of Keyfoun, 20 kilometres (12 miles) from Beirut.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It said Israeli strikes around the country killed 25 people the day before.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said Sunday it launched attack drones towards a military base near the northern Israeli city of Haifa. It later said it had targeted a second base nearby with a salvo of rockets.</p>

<p>Israel's military said rockets fired from northern Gaza had crossed into Israel, with one intercepted and the rest falling on open areas.</p>

<p>UN peacekeepers accused the Israeli military of compromising their safety by operating "immediately adjacent" to one of their positions in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>UNIFIL previously said it had rejected an Israeli request to relocate some of its peacekeepers.</p>

<p>- Foreigners flee -<br />
Israel, which began ground operations in Lebanon last Monday, says it aims to allow tens of thousands of Israelis displaced over the past year by Hezbollah rocket fire into northern Israel to return home.</p>

<p>Tehran, which backs armed groups across the Middle East, on Tuesday launched around 200 missiles at Israel in revenge for Israeli killings of militant leaders including Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah.</p>

<p>Israeli officials including Netanyahu have said Israel will respond to Iran's missile barrage, most of which was intercepted by the country's sophisticated air defences.</p>

<p>Iran has prepared its own plan to respond to a possible Israeli attack, Tasnim news agency reported, citing an informed source.</p>

<p>Flights at some Iranian airports were suspended Sunday, Tehran's aviation body announced, citing "operational restrictions".</p>

<p>Across Lebanon, strikes have killed more than 1,110 people since September 23, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Director General of Education Imad Achkar said Sunday that 40 percent of Lebanon's 1.25 million school pupils had been displaced by Israel's strikes.</p>

<p>Several countries have been evacuating their nationals from Lebanon.</p>

<p>Gaza's health ministry said Sunday an Israeli strike on a mosque-turned-shelter in central Deir el-Balah had killed 26 people. Israel said it had targeted Hamas militants.</p>

<p>Ahead of the October 7 anniversary, tens of thousands of protesters marched in cities around the world over the weekend calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On October 7, 2023, Hamas - a militant group which controlled Gaza - crossed over into Israel and launched 'Operation Al Aqsa Flood', a deadly terror attack, that killed over 1,200 people across the country. Israel was caught off-guard. Hamas operatives fired over 5,000 rockets, they came through paragliders, broke the Gaza wall and went on a killing spree. Israel responded with an air-ground invasion of Gaza, which has killed over 40,000 since last year.</p>

<p>Israel primarily has three objectives - Avenge the killing of people, uproot Hamas from Gaza and ensure the safe return of hostages from the territory. Gaza is left to ruins with over 66 per cent of buildings have been flattened, lakhs have been displaced and thousands have died in bombings. Hamas' Command and Control structure has been disrupted while several hostages have returned, some (assumed to be alive) are still in Gaza.</p>

<h2><b>Reduced To Rubble</b></h2>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/two-thirds-of-buildings-in-gaza-damaged-since-war-began-last-year-un-6685216">UN Satellite Centre (UNOSAT)</a> analysed satellite images of the 365 sq km of land. The report compares satellite images from September 2024 with pictures taken before the invasion began. "UNOSAT identified 52,564 destroyed structures, 18,913 severely damaged structures, 56,710 moderately damaged structures, and 35,591 possibly damaged structures for 163,778 structures," the report said.</p>

<p>Open-source satellite images from EOS Landviewer, accessed by NDTV, show the structural changes in north Gaza, primarily near the Jabalia refugee camp which was established in 1948 after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. NDTV analysed four images - three after the war and one from 2022 to understand the changes to the buildings and loss of cropland after the bombing.</p>

<h2><strong>What Satellite Images Say</strong></h2>

<p>A picture taken on September 26, 2024, by Sentinel-2 shows a razed area, with almost no vegetation after the bombing campaign. When the image of the same area is compared with one taken on December 16, 2022 - A year before the invasion - a massive change is visible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The grey patch represents buildings, while green represents croplands. Gaza is one of the most densely populated regions in the world with over 2.3 million living in an area 1/4th the size of Delhi. By September 26, the density was reduced after the area was bombed several times.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/wiped-off-the-map-gazans-back-in-war-ravaged-jabalia-refugee-camp-5795492">Several families in the region</a> have relocated and moved south to escape death. With their belongings on bullock carts, cars, trucks and other modes of transportation, the mass evacuation took place amid air strikes and ground assault.</p>

<p>The images were compared with UNOSAT's cropland damage analysis to underpin the notable changes. UNOSAT used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a widely used metric to quantify the health and density of vegetation using sensor data. North Gaza has 31.3 sq km of cropland, of which 24.6 sq km or 79 per cent has been destroyed, leaving just 6.7 sq km.</p>

<p>During a conflict, natural vegetation is the most vulnerable to damage, leading to soil erosion and damage to croplands, impacting food production and causing other health impacts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The UN report states "The methodology evaluated the damage as a decline in the health and density of crops in September 2024, in comparison to the preceding seven seasons spanning from 2017 to 2024. The decline in the health and density of the crops can be observed due to the impact of activities such as razing, heavy vehicle activity, bombing, shelling, and other conflict-related dynamics. The analysis includes damage assessment for orchards and other trees, field crops and vegetables."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The analysis shows that the agricultural extent in the Gaza Strip is estimated to be 150 sq. km, accounting for approximately 41% of the total area of the Gaza Strip."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The United Nations estimates there are over <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/a-year-of-devastation-and-tonnes-of-rubble-to-deal-with-gazas-continued-struggle-6728537">42 million tonnes of debris</a>, including both shattered edifices that are still standing and flattened buildings across Gaza.</p>

<h2><strong>Israel: One Year After Attacks</strong></h2>

<p>Israel is still under attack from all directions. The frequency of attacks from Gaza has significantly reduced, but the war opened several fronts for the nation to deal with. Hezbollah - A Shia militant group in Lebanon - has been relentlessly attacking north Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, forcing over 70,000 Israelis to leave their homes for a safer location.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel said the gravity of the conflict has moved north to ensure the safe return of its citizens that have been under attack but the pager and walkie-talkie blasts across Lebanon to target Hezbollah, led to a wider conflict where the militant group alleged that Israel was behind the explosions. The conflict escalated to an air, artillery campaign, similar to Gaza, killing thousands including the group's chief, Hassan Nasrallah, and his potential successor Hashem Safieddine a week later. Israel has eliminated a majority of Hezbollah leaders.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Houthi rebels - a group backed by Iran - in Yemen have carried out several attacks since last year, opening another front for Tel Aviv.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since last year, Israel and Iran - two arch-rivals in West Asia - have confronted each other directly with missile and drone attacks. In April, Iran launched a missile and drone attack on Israel after strikes on its consulate in Damascus, Syria. The projectiles were mostly aimed at non-civilian areas. An Israeli response followed it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/rockets-fired-from-iran-on-israel-civilians-hiding-in-bomb-shelters-says-israel-defence-forces-6694961">Six months later,</a> Iran launched over 200 missiles targetting military and civilian areas, a paradigm shift in its approach to confront Israel after it killed Nasrallah. An Israeli response to the attack is expected soon.</p>

<p>Since last year, the US and other regional powers have failed to broker a ceasefire since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is adamant about fulfilling the military objectives and attacks from Gaza have not stopped.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Palestinian group Hamas on Sunday praised its October 7 attack on Israel in a video message ahead of the first anniversary of the deadly storming of southern Israel which sparked the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>"The crossing of the glorious 7th of October shattered the illusions the enemy had created for itself, convincing the world and the region of its supposed superiority and capabilities," Qatar-based Hamas member Khalil al-Hayya said in a video statement.</p>

<p>Last year's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>At least 41,870 Palestinians, a majority of them civilians, have been killed in Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip since the war began, according to data provided by the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. The UN has acknowledged these figures as reliable.</p>

<p>Al-Hayya, said a year after the October 7 attack, "all of Palestine, particularly Gaza, and our Palestinian people are writing a new history with their resistance, blood, and steadfastness".</p>

<p>The Hamas member, who has emerged as the Islamist group's public face following the killing of its former leader Ismail Haniyeh in July, said Gazans had remained "resilient to all attempts at displacement... despite the kinds of torture and terrorism you have endured, and the horrific genocide and daily massacre".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese hackers accessed the networks of US broadband providers and obtained information from systems the federal government uses for court-authorized wiretapping, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday.</p>

<p>Verizon Communications, AT&amp;T and Lumen Technologies are among the telecoms companies whose networks were breached by the recently discovered intrusion, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>The hackers might have held access for months to network infrastructure used by the companies to cooperate with court-authorized US requests for communications data, the Journal said. It said the hackers had also accessed other tranches of internet traffic.</p>

<p>China's foreign ministry responded on Sunday that it was not aware of the attack described in the report but said the United States had "concocted a false narrative" to "frame" China in the past.</p>

<p>"At a time when cybersecurity has become a common challenge for all countries around the world, this erroneous approach will only hinder the efforts of the international community to jointly address the challenge through dialogue and cooperation," the ministry said in a statement to Reuters.</p>

<p>Beijing has previously denied claims by the US government and others that it has used hackers to break into foreign computer systems.</p>

<p>Lumen Technologies declined to comment, while Verizon and AT&amp;T did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>The Journal said the attack was carried out by a Chinese hacking group with the aim of collecting intelligence. US investigators have dubbed it "Salt Typhoon."</p>

<p>Earlier this year, US law enforcement disrupted a major Chinese hacking group nicknamed "Flax Typhoon," months after confronting Beijing about sweeping cyber espionage under a campaign named "Volt Typhoon."</p>

<p>China's foreign ministry said in its statement that Beijing's cybersecurity agencies had found and published evidence to show Volt Typhoon was staged by "an international ransomware organization."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military said Sunday it deployed more troops to defend southern communities and areas bordering Gaza, ahead of the anniversary of the October 7 attack by Hamas.</p>

<p>"The IDF's (army) Gaza Division has been reinforced with several platoons, with forces stationed to defend both the communities and the border area," the military said.</p>

<p>"The soldiers are fully equipped to defend the region in coordination with local security forces," it said in a statement.</p>

<p>Inside Gaza, the military said three divisions were working to "dismantle terrorist infrastructure and degrade Hamas's capabilities".</p>

<p>"The Southern Command remains at a heightened state of vigilance and readiness for the coming days," commanding officer Major General Yaron Finkelman was quoted as saying.</p>

<p>Earlier, the military said its forces had surrounded the area of Jabaliya in central Gaza where Hamas was trying to rebuild its operational capabilities.</p>

<p>On October 7 last year, Hamas militants broke through the border from Gaza into Israel in what would become the deadliest attack in Israel's history.</p>

<p>At the end of the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, the militants launched their assault by land, air, and sea.</p>

<p>A year later, the confirmed death count from the attack, including hostages killed in captivity, has reached 1,205 on the Israeli side, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Militants abducted 251 hostages, 97 of whom are still captive in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military has said are dead.</p>

<p>Hours after the attack Israel launched a lightning military offensive on Gaza, which has reduced large swathes of the territory to rubble, and nearly all of the 2.4 million residents have been displaced at least once as a humanitarian crisis worsened.</p>

<p>Israel's relentless offensive on Gaza has so far killed at least 41,870 people, a majority of them civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>The figures have been found to be reliable by the United Nations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gazan mother Rana Salah cradles her one-month-old daughter Milana in her arms in a sweltering tent for the displaced, and speaks of the guilt she feels for bringing her child into a world of war and suffering.</p>

<p>"If it were up to me, I wouldn't have gotten pregnant or given birth during the war because life is completely different; we've never lived this life before," she said, speaking at a camp in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>"I gave birth twice before, and life was better and easier for me and the child. Now, I feel like I've wronged both myself and the child because we deserve to live better than this."</p>

<p>Milana was born in a hospital tent by caesarean owing to complications with Salah's pregnancy. The family have not been able to return home due to the conflict, moving instead from one tent to another.</p>

<p>Milana is one of around 20,000 babies to have been born in Gaza in the last year, according to UNICEF statistics.</p>

<p>The current war, a particularly deadly episode in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict, was triggered on October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israeli air and artillery strikes in response have reduced much of the Palestinian enclave to rubble and more than 41,500 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli assault, according to the Gaza health ministry. Most of Gaza's 2.3 million residents have been displaced.</p>

<p><strong>INFECTION RISK</strong></p>

<p>Salah fans Milana with cardboard and says the heat is bad for the baby's skin.</p>

<p>"Instead of returning to our house, we keep moving from one tent to another... where diseases are widespread and the water is contaminated."</p>

<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has said postnatal services have decreased significantly in Gaza, so women who have complications have less access to the care they need, as do their babies.</p>

<p>Rick Brennan, the WHO's Eastern Mediterranean Regional emergency director, said malnutrition was a threat to newborns, particularly if their mothers were unable to breastfeed, as there was no access to breast milk substitutes.</p>

<p>Displacement and being constantly on the move are disruptive for a newborn and expose them to risks of infection, he said.</p>

<p>Manar Abu Jarad is staying in a school shelter run by the UN Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA). Her youngest daughter Sahar was born on Sept. 4th, also by caesarean section. Her husband was killed in the war.</p>

<p>On hearing she would need a caesarean for the birth, she worried about how she would care for her other children.</p>

<p>"I already have three girls. I started shouting... How can I carry (water) buckets? How can I bathe my daughters? How can I help them and my husband is not with me, he was martyred."</p>

<p>Children rock baby Sahar, who is swaddled in a crib, next to Jarad.</p>

<p>"I've reached the point where I cannot carry the responsibility for this girl ... Thank God I found some help here," she said. She has borrowed what she can from family and uses one diaper a day for the baby as she can't afford more.</p>

<p>"I don't have the money to provide diapers or milk for her."</p>

<p>Jarad longs for an end to the war and a return to her home, even if it is just a tent next to her former home.</p>

<p>"The important thing is to go home. Enough of all the exhaustion we are experiencing here, enough carrying buckets, enough of the dirt in the bathrooms. It's really, really hard and really tiring for us. Diseases are everywhere."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The southern French city of Marseille was this week shaken by two apparently drug-related killings, including the murder of a 15-year-old boy who was "stabbed 50 times" and burned alive, prosecutors said on Sunday.</p>

<p>Marseille, France's second-largest city but also one of its poorest, is plagued by drug-related violence.</p>

<p>The historic port city on the Mediterranean coast has in recent years witnessed a turf war for control of the highly profitable drug market between various clans including DZ Mafia and Yoda.</p>

<p>The problem was once again thrust into public eye this week, with Marseille prosecutor Nicolas Bessone telling a news conference on Sunday that victims and perpetrators of such violence were getting increasingly younger.</p>

<p>The 15-year-old teenager was murdered on Wednesday in a case Bessone described as one of "unprecedented savagery".</p>

<p>On Friday, a 36-year-old football player, Nessim Ramdane, was shot and killed "in cold blood" by a 14-year-old in a case linked to Wednesday's murder.</p>

<p>The two latest cases mean that the number of drug-related killings in Marseille has risen to 17 since the start of the year.</p>

<p>Marseille's drug lords have been recruiting foot soldiers with ads on social media, "outsourcing" street dealing to youngsters known as "jobbeurs".</p>

<p>Bessone said on Sunday that now young boys were responding to ads not only to sell cannabis resin but also to kill "without any remorse or reflection".</p>

<p>The teenager had been hired via social networks by a 23-year-old prisoner to intimidate a competitor by setting fire to his door, the prosecutor said, adding the youth had been promised 2,000 euros.</p>

<p>The detainee of the Luynes prison south of Aix-en-Provence had described himself as a member of DZ Mafia.</p>

<p><strong>Shot in the head</strong></p>

<p>During his mission, the teenager was spotted by members of a rival gang who searched him and discovered that he was carrying a gun. To punish the minor, they repeatedly stabbed him then set him on fire.</p>

<p>"He was stabbed 50 times and taken to the Fonscolombes housing estate, where, according to the results of the autopsy, he was burned alive," said Bessone. His friend, also aged 15, was able to escape, Bessone added.</p>

<p>The same prisoner then again turned to social media, recruiting a 14-year-old minor to carry out a revenge attack and kill a member of the Blacks gang, promising to pay him 50,000 euros.</p>

<p>The 14-year-old for his part hired Ramdane, a football player who also worked as a chauffeur to support his family, the prosecutor said.</p>

<p>The minor, accompanied by a friend, asked the driver "to drop them off and wait for them, but he apparently "didn't comply", Bessone said.</p>

<p>The teenager then "shot him in the back of the head", he added.</p>

<p>The minor was taken into custody and admitted shooting the driver, but insisted that the shot had "gone off accidentally".</p>

<p>In September, Franck Rastoul, public prosecutor at the Aix-en-Provence court of appeal, warned of the scourge of drug-related violence.</p>

<p>"It is imperative that we fully understand the ravages of drug trafficking, which undermines the very foundations of our society," he said.</p>

<p>Rastoul said young people were "intoxicated by easy drug money" to the point of "total disregard for human life."</p>

<p>Drug-related violence caused a record number of 49 deaths in Marseille last year.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a groundbreaking discovery, experts have identified ancient remnants of a long-lost tectonic plate, dubbed Pontus, dating back an astonishing 120 million years. This finding sheds new light on Earth's history and underscores the ongoing quest for knowledge about our planet. According to<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.indy100.com/science-tech/lost-earth-crust-northern-borneo-2669278686"> Indy100.com</a></em>, researchers Suzanna van de Lagemaat and Douwe van Hinsbergen from Utrecht University made the breakthrough by analysing geological data from the Asia-Pacific region. Their prediction has now been confirmed, revealing the existence of Pontus, a previously unknown part of Earth's crust in Borneo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Geologist Suzanna van de Lagemaat said, "We thought we were dealing with relics of a lost plate that we already knew about. But our magnetic lab research on those rocks indicated that our finds were originally from much farther north, and had to be remnants of a different, previously unknown plate."</p>

<p>Researchers reconstructed the ancient Pontus plate, estimating it covered an area roughly one-quarter the size of the Pacific Ocean. Formed during the supercontinent Pangaea, Pontus lay beneath the vast ocean separating Eurasia and Australia 160 million years ago. As Pangaea broke apart, the Pontus plate was gradually subducted or swallowed by neighbouring plates. This geological process carried countries like the Philippines and Borneo to their present-day locations.</p>

<p>Notably, van de Lagemaat focussed her research on the intricate Junction Region, where tectonic plates converge between Japan, Borneo, the Philippines, New Guinea, and New Zealand. Her groundbreaking research enabled the creation of a stunning visual reconstruction.</p>

<p>During an interaction at the Kautilya Economic Conclave here, he also said that two very serious conflicts are going on in the world. "And where is the UN on them, essentially a bystander," the minister said.</p>

<p>In response to a query on the possible outcome of the US elections, he said the US actually has "made a shift", geopolitically and in its economic outlook, and irrespective of the outcomes in November, many of these trends will "intensify" in the days to come.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>S Jaishankar took part in the interactive session on 'India and the Globe' and spoke of India's role and challenges amid changing global dynamics.</p>

<p>"So, we are both a lifting tide and a bit of paradoxical one, a ballast as well," S Jaishankar said as he enumerated some of the steps India has taken to help other countries, including its neighbours such as Sri Lanka.</p>

<p>Asked about his upcoming visit to Pakistan to attend a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), he again sought to rule out any bilateral talks with his Pakistani counterpart.</p>

<p>"I am going there for a certain job, a certain responsibility. And, I take my responsibilities seriously. So, I am going there to represent India at the SCO meeting, and that is what I am going to do," S Jaishankar said.</p>

<p>At an event on Saturday, the external affairs minister said that he was going to Islamabad for a "multilateral event" and not to discuss India-Pakistan relations.</p>

<p>In his response to a query on the United Nations' role amid the changing global scenario, he took a rather critical view of the world body that was born in 1945 after the Second World War. Initially, it had 50 countries, which has grown over these years to nearly four times.</p>

<p>"The UN is in a way like an old company, not entirely keeping up with the market, but occupying the space. And, when it's behind times, in this world you have start-ups and innovations, so different people start doing their own things," S Jaishankar said.</p>

<p>"So, what you have today is that yes you have a UN at the end, however suboptimal in functioning, it is still the only multilateral game in town," he added.</p>

<p>"But, when it doesn't step up on key issues, countries figure out their own ways of doing it. For example, let's take the last five-10 years, probably the biggest thing that happened in our life was Covid. Now, what did the UN do on Covid? I think the answer is -- not very much," the minister said.</p>

<p>S Jaishankar said, "Now, you have two conflicts going on in the world today, two very serious conflicts, where is the UN on them, essentially a bystander," he said.</p>

<p>So, what is happening, as it did during Covid also, countries did their own thing such as the initiative like Covax that was done by a group of countries, the minister said. "When it comes to big issues of the day, you have an increasing combination of countries coming together to agree to do something." He cited the examples of connectivity initiatives like the India-MiddleEast-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), QUAD in Indo-Pacific to look after the global commons, the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), saying all these bodies came outside the UN framework.</p>

<p>"Today, the UN will continue, but increasingly there is a non-UN space which is the active space and I think it's telling on the UN," Jaishankar added.</p>

<p>More than 75 years after its inception, the United Nations is still working to maintain international peace and security, give humanitarian assistance to those in need, protect human rights, and uphold international law, according to the UN website.</p>

<p>India has been demanding reforms in the world body and its UN Security Council in sync with the changed times.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, S Jaishankar suggested that the "short-sighted" approach of the five permanent members of the UNSC is holding back forward movement in the long-pending reform of the global body.</p>

<p>The five permanent members are Russia, the UK, China, France and the US and these countries can veto any substantive resolution.</p>

<p>S Jaishankar was asked about a possible outcome of the US elections and how will India engage with the new administration.</p>

<p>"You spoke of one possibility of the two in the American elections. I stress to you, look back over the last five years, how many of the policies which in 2020 people thought were the Trump administration's policies actually not just carried over by Biden but they doubled down on those policies," he said.</p>

<p>So, this is not just a politician, it's not just a fashion, just one administration. "I think there are very deep shifts happening," the minister added.</p>

<p>"This is... America which actually has made a shift, geopolitically and in its economic outlook and has come to the conclusion that the order which itself devised many years ago no longer works to its benefit to that degree," he said.</p>

<p>"So, I would argue, irrespective of the outcomes in November, many of these trends will intensify in the days to come. And, you are going to get, I would call it a more fractured world, but I would say, in some ways, reliability and transparency are going to be two very key factors which will become a metric for countries to have enterprises and domains to have dealings with each other," he said.</p>

<p>On a question on the Global South, S Jaishankar said that it itself has a "great value".</p>

<p>"It is a collective. We don't expect to be the leader. We are seen as a trusted member, an articulate member... So, I am not really comfortable with the idea that you walk away from the Global South. On the contrary, I see value," the minister said.</p>

<p>He also spoke on the role and impact of artificial intelligence in shaping the world going forward.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli police on Sunday said a female border officer was killed in a shooting attack on a bus station that first responders say injured 10 others.</p>

<p>The incident took place a day before the first anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack.</p>

<p>"Paramedics have pronounced a 25-year-old female deceased, and are evacuating 10 casualties," emergency service provider Magen David Adom said in a statement.</p>

<p>Police identified the victim as Sergeant Shira Haya Suslik, a member of the border police, and said she "fell during an encounter with a terrorist in an attack that occurred today at the central bus station in Beersheba."</p>

<p>Police said the incident was being treated as a "suspected terrorist attack".</p>

<p>"A number of injured on the scene. The terrorist was neutralised at the scene and many police forces of the southern district are at the scene," said a police spokesman in a statement.</p>

<p>Hamas praised the "heroic" attack, saying it "came in defence of our people, our land, and our holy sites".</p>

<p>The incident comes just days after a Hamas-claimed shooting attack last week in which seven people were killed in Israel's commercial hub of Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>The Tel Aviv attack -- one of the deadliest in the country since the October 7 Hamas attack -- came as Iran fired about 200 missiles at Israel, sending hundreds of thousands of people into public shelters.</p>

<p>Israel and Hamas have been at war in Gaza since the October 7 attack on Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 41,870 people in Gaza, the majority of them civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The United Nations has said the figures are reliable.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chaos erupted on an easyJet flight from Turkey to London Gatwick after a reportedly intoxicated passenger caused a disturbance, prompting an emergency landing in Athens. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/10/05/easyjet-captain-pleads-drunk-passengers-midair-brawl-21741849/">Metro</a></em>, the topless man had been arguing with fellow travellers, leading the captain to issue a stern warning over the intercom.&nbsp;The captain was heard saying: "This is the captain speaking. To the people fighting, the police are waiting for you at the gate. You're only making things worse for yourself. Please sit down."</p>

<p>Despite cabin crew and passengers' efforts to calm the situation, the disruptive man refused to comply. Passengers grew increasingly frustrated, shouting insults at the delay. A woman exclaimed, "You've messed us all up, you silly fool!"</p>

<p>It is unclear what started the fight, but the original TikTok post was captioned: "POV your flight back from Turkey gets diverted to Athens because boys can't handle their drink."</p>

<p>Later, staff attempted to dress the man and guide him off the plane, but he continued to provoke others, including a passenger in a white jacket who sarcastically applauded the captain's announcement. As tensions escalated, the captain's warning proved ineffective, and the man was eventually escorted off the flight by authorities.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for EasyJet stated, ''Flight EZY8558 from Antalya to London Gatwick on 1 October diverted to Athens and was met by police after landing due to two passengers behaving disruptively onboard. easyJet's cabin crew are trained to assess and evaluate all situations and to act quickly and appropriately to ensure that the flight's and other passengers' safety is not compromised at any time. Whilst such incidents are rare, we take them very seriously and do not tolerate disruptive behaviour onboard. The safety and wellbeing of passengers and crew is always EasyJet's highest priority.''</p>

<p>The footage has elicited strong reactions from internet users, who called for severe consequences, including billing the disruptive passengers thousands of dollars for the diversion and imposing lifetime bans on flying. Others suggested prohibiting alcohol on flights, citing the excessive drinking culture among some travellers.</p>

<p>One user wrote, ''It's only a matter of time before they ban drinking because of people like these who can't handle their drink. Jail them and they may think twice.''&nbsp;Another commented, ''Why do Brits revolve their life around drink, drink, drink? This is what ends up happening. I'm not generalizing, but this is why alcohol is not the way.''</p>

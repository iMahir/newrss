       <description><![CDATA["Joe, Forever Grateful To You": Kamala Harris At Democratic Convention]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President and Democratic nominee Kamal Harris has thanked US President Joe Biden for his "lifetime of service" to the nation. Addressing the opening of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, the Indian-origin leader said the country was "forever grateful" to the 81-year-old for his leadership.</p>

<p>"I want to kick us off by celebrating our incredible president, Joe Biden. Joe, thank you for your historic leadership, for your lifetime of service to our nation. We are forever grateful to you," she said in a surprise speech on the first day of the party's convention.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 59-year-old leader is expected to officially accept her nomination for the November US elections at the convention.</p>

<p>"People from every corner of our country and every walk of life are here and this November we will come together and declare with one voice that we are moving forward. Let us always remember --- when we fight, we win," she said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Mpox cases and deaths are rising in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) as the central African country awaits vaccines from the United States and Japan, the health minister said on Monday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mpox cases and deaths are rising in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) as the central African country awaits vaccines from the United States and Japan, the health minister said on Monday.</p>

<p>The count this year has risen in a few days from 16,000 cases and 548 deaths to 16,700 cases and "a little more than 570" deaths, Health Minister Samuel-Roger Kamba said.</p>

<p>"We are talking about a continental emergency," Kamba told a press briefing as the World Health Organisation (WHO) called on affected countries to step up vaccination programmes to counter a more deadly strain of mpox.</p>

<p>The WHO on Wednesday declared the mpox surge in Africa a global public health emergency. Outbreaks have been reported in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda since July. A case of the new strain has also been detected in Sweden.</p>

<p>The United States has promised 50,000 vaccine doses for DRC, while Japan on Monday agreed Monday to send 3.5 million doses, "only for children," a medical source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told AFP.</p>

<p>The source said that DRC "plans to vaccinate four million people including 3.5 million children".</p>

<p>"I hope by the next week we will already be able to see the vaccines arriving," Kamba said.</p>

<p>"The vaccine is a solution to our problems," he added, urging people to get jabbed.</p>

<p>"Our strategic vaccination plan is ready. We are just waiting for the vaccines to arrive."</p>

<h3><strong>WHO calls for vaccines&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Cases have now surfaced in all 26 provinces in the country of around 100 million people.</p>

<p>The WHO has declared the outbreak "a public health emergency of international concern" -- its highest alert category.</p>

<p>On Monday it released updated guidelines on countering the surge, including by "the agile adaptation of immunization strategies and plans to concerned areas".</p>

<p>It called on countries to "scale up efforts to thoroughly investigate cases and outbreaks of mpox disease" to understand its transmission and prevent the spread "to household members and communities".</p>

<p>Health authorities must report new cases on a weekly basis and "identify, monitor and support the contacts of people with mpox to prevent onward transmission," it said.</p>

<p>It added that countries had to be ready to provide food and other support for mpox patients "including, as warranted and possible, isolation in care centres and guidance for home-based care".</p>

<p>The WHO said there has to be greater "cross-border collaboration" to monitor and handle suspected mpox cases "without resorting to general travel and trade restrictions unnecessarily impacting local, regional or national economies".</p>

<p>While mpox has been known for decades, a new more deadly and more transmissible strain -- clade 1b -- causes death in about 3.6 per cent of cases, with children more at risk, according to the WHO.</p>

<p>Kamba said that mpox is reaching "more and more young people" in DRC and there are a lot of children under 15 who have been affected.</p>

<p>A total of 18,737 suspected or confirmed cases of mpox were reported in Africa since the beginning of the year, including 1,200 cases in one week, the African Union health agency said Saturday.</p>

<p>Formerly called monkeypox, the virus was discovered in 1958 in Denmark, in monkeys kept for research.</p>

<p>It was first discovered in humans in 1970 in what is now the DRC.</p>

<p>Mpox is caused by a virus transmitted to humans by infected animals but can also be passed from human to human through close physical contact.</p>

<p>The disease causes fever, muscular aches and large boil-like skin lesions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Disgraced former Republican lawmaker George Santos, who was expelled from the US Congress for using stolen donor cash to bankroll a lavish lifestyle, pleaded guilty on Monday to wire fraud and identity theft.</p>

<p>Judge Joanna Seybert ordered Santos to pay more than $370,000 in restitution during a court hearing in Central Islip and set sentencing for February 7.</p>

<p>Santos, 36, faces at least two years in prison and a maximum of 22 years.</p>

<p>"After years of telling lies, George Santos stood in the courthouse right behind me and finally, under oath, told the truth," Breon Peace, US attorney for the Eastern District of New York, told reporters.</p>

<p>"And that truth is that he is a criminal," Peace said. "He lied, he stole and he conned people."</p>

<p>An emotional Santos, speaking to reporters after entering his guilty plea, apologized to his former constituents and said he had allowed "ambition to cloud my judgment," leading him to make "decisions that were unethical."</p>

<p>"This plea is not just an admission of guilt but an acknowledgement that I need to be held accountable like any other American that breaks the law," he said through tears.</p>

<p>The downfall of the congressman from Long Island came after it was revealed he had fabricated almost his entire backstory including his education, religion and work history.</p>

<p>Santos was elected to the US House of Representatives in 2022 and indicted the following year for stealing from campaign donors and engaging in credit card fraud, money laundering and identity theft.</p>

<p>Santos used donor money for Botox treatments and the OnlyFans porn website, as well as luxury Italian goods and vacations to the Hamptons and Las Vegas, according to an investigation by a congressional ethics committee.</p>

<p>He had been scheduled to go on trial on September 9 on some two dozen charges but opted instead to enter a guilty plea to wire fraud and identity theft.</p>

<p>Santos's bizarre biographical fabrications included claiming to have worked for Goldman Sachs, being Jewish and having been a college volleyball star.</p>

<p>He was ultimately doomed by the congressional probe that found overwhelming evidence of misconduct and accused him of seeking to "fraudulently exploit every aspect of his House candidacy."</p>

<p>Santos was expelled from the House last year, becoming only the third person to be ejected as a US lawmaker since the Civil War, a rebuke previously reserved for traitors and convicted criminals.</p>

<p>In February, voters in his suburban New York district picked Democrat Tom Suozzi to replace him.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge on Monday denied a bid by U.S. President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, to dismiss a federal tax evasion case brought against him in California.</p>

<p>Hunter Biden was convicted in Delaware in June for lying about his illegal drug use to buy a gun, and is scheduled to go to trial in September in the tax evasion case.</p>

<p>Biden, who has pleaded not guilty to the tax charges, had argued that David Weiss, the special counsel leading both prosecutions, was illegally appointed.</p>

<p>The president's son had relied on a federal judge's decision dismissing a criminal case accusing former President Donald Trump of illegally retaining classified documents after leaving office.</p>

<p>Florida-based U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon found the appointment of the special counsel in that case, Jack Smith, violated the U.S. Constitution because Congress had not given him the authority to pursue the case. Smith's office is appealing.</p>

<p>But U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi in Los Angeles said on Monday there was no valid basis to reconsider a prior order denying Hunter Biden's bid to throw out the tax evasion indictment.</p>

<p>"The court declines to reach the merits of the motion because there is no valid basis for reconsideration of the court's order denying Mr. Biden's motion to dismiss," the judge wrote.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Monday that if elected he would consider ending a $7,500 tax credit for electric-vehicle purchases and that he would be open to naming Tesla CEO Elon Musk to a cabinet or advisory role.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Monday that if elected he would consider ending a $7,500 tax credit for electric-vehicle purchases and that he would be open to naming Tesla CEO Elon Musk to a cabinet or advisory role.</p>

<p>"Tax credits and tax incentives are not generally a very good thing," Trump told Reuters in an interview after a campaign event in York, Pennsylvania, when asked about the EV credit.</p>

<p>Asked if he would consider naming Musk to an advisory role or cabinet job, Trump said he would. "He's a very smart guy. I certainly would, if he would do it, I certainly would. He's a brilliant guy," Trump said.</p>

<p>Musk last month publicly endorsed Trump in the U.S. presidential race. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>If elected, Trump could take steps to reverse Treasury Department rules that have made it easier for automakers to take advantage of the $7,500 credit or could ask the U.S. Congress to repeal it entirely. While president, Trump sought to repeal the EV tax credit which was later expanded by President Joe Biden in 2022.</p>

<p>"I'm not making any final decisions on it," Trump said of the EV tax credit. "I'm a big fan of electric cars, but I'm a fan of gasoline-propelled cars, and also hybrids and whatever else happens to come along."</p>

<p>He added that he would rescind the Biden administration rules that will prod automakers to build more EVs and plug-in hybrids to meet stricter emissions standards and said he sees a "much smaller market" for EVs because of cost and battery range issues.</p>

<p>Trump also said on Monday he would take steps to discourage exports of vehicles produced by the Detroit Three automakers and others from Mexico for U.S consumers by imposing new tariffs and would prevent Chinese automakers from building new plants in Mexico for U.S. market vehicles. He made similar threats during his presidency.</p>

<p>"If you put tariffs on those cars, they're going to make it here" Trump said. "It's very simple. It's not complicated. If you tell Mexico, 'look, you're stealing our car industry,' which they're doing now."</p>

<p>But Trump is open to Chinese and other automakers building vehicles in the United States. "We're going to give incentives, and if China and other countries want to come here and sell the cars, they're going to build plants here, and they're going to hire our workers," Trump said. "We will make our own cars. I want to make our own cars."</p>

<p>Separately, Trump harshly criticized Alphabet's Google but declined to say if he thought the technology company should be broken up after a judge ruled this month that Google was an illegal monopoly.</p>

<p>"They're almost like the Wild West," Trump said of Google, without elaborating on what penalty it should face. "They're going to have to pay a great price."</p>

<p>Trump has previously said he would prevent short video app TikTok from being banned despite a law approved in April that sets a deadline of Jan. 19, 2025, for Chinese owner ByteDance to divest TikTok's U.S. assets. Asked if he could accept continued Chinese ownership of TikTok, Trump did not directly answer but said ByteDance might sell.</p>

<p>"It's very hard to ban something like that, because you're talking about free speech," Trump said. "You're talking about a lot of different things go into that equation, but TikTok has treated me very well."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US intelligence officials said on Monday that they considered Iran to be responsible for a recent hack of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, according to a statement, adding that it was part of ongoing cyber attacks by Tehran.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran was behind a recent hack targeting Donald Trump's presidential campaign, US security agencies said on Monday, accusing Tehran of seeking to influence the 2024 election.</p>

<p>The statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) confirmed the Trump campaign claim from earlier this month that it had been targeted, potentially by Iran.</p>

<p>"We have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting presidential campaigns," the security agencies said.</p>

<p>"This includes the recently reported activities to compromise former President Trump's campaign, which the (intelligence community) attributes to Iran," they said.</p>

<p>The intelligence community "is confident that the Iranians have through social engineering and other efforts sought access to individuals with direct access to the presidential campaigns of both political parties. Such activity, including thefts and disclosures, are intended to influence the US election process."</p>

<p>Trump's campaign said on August 10 that it had been hacked, blaming "foreign sources" for distributing internal communications and a dossier on running mate J.D. Vance.</p>

<p>"These documents were obtained illegally from foreign sources hostile to the United States, intended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our Democratic process," Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign implied Iran was behind the move as news outlet Politico reported it had received emails with the campaign material from a source who refused to identify themselves.</p>

<p>Cheung cited a report from Microsoft this week that said Iranian hackers "sent a spear phishing email in June to a high-ranking official on a presidential campaign."</p>

<p>The materials received by Politico included research on vetting Vance, Trump's vice presidential pick.</p>

<p>In 2016, a hack of Democratic National Committee emails -- blamed on Russians -- exposed internal party communications, including about candidate Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>Trump, who would go on to win the election, was criticized for encouraging the hack.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's jailed former prime minister Imran Khan has applied to become the next chancellor of Britain's prestigious University of Oxford, his party said.</p>

<p>Khan, prime minister from 2018 to 2022, has just marked one year in prison on various charges from corruption to inciting violence that he said are politically motivated and designed to keep him from power.</p>

<p>"Imran Khan had given instructions that he would like to submit his application and now the application scrutiny will take place," Sayed Zulfikar Bukhari, the London-based spokesman for Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, told AFP.</p>

<p>"It's a ceremonial post but one with utmost prestige and importance and Imran Khan, being one of the larger or more popular names coming out of Oxford, it would be brilliant to see him as chancellor," he said.</p>

<p>Conservative peer Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, announced in February he was stepping down as Oxford chancellor.</p>

<p>The list of candidates for the 10-year term will not be made public until October, according to the university's website, with voting taking place at the end of the month.</p>

<p>Khan graduated from Oxford in 1975 after studying philosophy, politics, and economics.</p>

<p>He led a playboy lifestyle during his career as one of Pakistan's greatest cricket players, regularly gracing the pages of Britain's gossip magazines.</p>

<p>Married three times, including to British socialite and filmmaker Jemima Goldsmith, he later turned to philanthropy and politics.</p>

<p>He faced a backlash from women's rights groups while prime minister for linking Pakistan's high rates of sexual violence to the clothes that women wear.</p>

<p>Khan was ousted in 2022 and then launched a comeback campaign in which he criticised Pakistan's powerful military, whose leading generals had once backed him, and drew massive crowds onto the nation's streets.</p>

<p>"If he does become the chancellor, he would be the first of Asian descent. It wouldn't be something only for Pakistan, but it would be a great achievement for all of Asia and the rest of the world," Bukhari said.</p>

<p>Other prominent applicants and Oxford alumni include former foreign secretary William Hague and former EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson, according to British media reports.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Hamas senior official Osama Hamdan criticized U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's statement on Monday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted an updated proposal, saying it "raises many ambiguities" because it is "not what was presented to us nor what we agreed on."</p>

<p>Hamdan told Reuters that Hamas has already confirmed to mediators that "we don't need new Gaza ceasefire negotiations, we need to agree on an implementation mechanism."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The 2024 Democratic National Convention will officially declare US Vice President Kamala Harris as its official nomination for the Presidential election today, replacing incumbent Joe Biden, who withdrew from the race last month.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>The four-day event, which will end on August 22, will officially nominate Kamala Harris's Vice President pick, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, in the presidential elections.</li>
	<li>Former US Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton are expected to speak at the National Convention and bid adieu to Joe Biden. The Democrats will also honour Hilary Clinton, their official candidate who lost to Donald Trump in the 2016 US Presidential Elections.</li>
	<li>Last month, Mr Biden dropped out of the Presidential race just 100 days before the election, an unprecedented move in modern US political history. Concerns over the 81-year-old's health surrounded the Presidential campaigns, with rival Republicans targeting the Democrats over the issue. The concerns were aggravated after Biden's presidential debate with Trump in June.</li>
	<li>To designate a formal nominee, delegates chosen from 50 US states, the US capital and overseas territories attend their party's nominating convention to officially anoint the candidate. Biden backed Kamala Harris as the candidate which was later endorsed by several leaders including former US President Barack Obama.</li>
	<li>Joe Biden will give a prime-time address and make a case for his incumbent deputy, Kamala Harris, who is up against Donald Trump, the former US President, with multiple court cases and survivor of an assassination attempt.</li>
	<li>In the Primary Election, a poll where parties select their candidates for the general election, Joe Biden won overwhelmingly with 87.1 per cent votes. The 26th Democratic National Convention will serve as a farewell for Mr Biden as he hangs up his boots. In 1968, President Lyndon B Johnson declared in the middle of the Vietnam War that he would not run for re-election.</li>
	<li>Kamala Harris, the first Black and South Asian US Vice President, is expected to share the stage with Mr Biden. Kamala Harris, who considers herself an "underdog" in the race against Trump, earlier said, "A lot of work has to be done to earn the vote of the American people,"</li>
	<li>Security has been increased near the convention centre in Chicago after an array of possible threats, including tens of thousands of protesters opposing Biden's support for Israel's actions in Gaza. They are expected to march through the city outside the security perimeter.</li>
	<li>The Secret Service, FBI and the local police reportedly spent a year formulating a security plan and cordoning off areas near the United Center Arena where the convention will take place. Musicians and Hollywood celebrities are expected to attend the event.</li>
	<li>Last week, Biden and Harris had put up a show of unity in Maryland when they made their first joint trip since the change of the Democratic Party's plans for the Presidential Elections.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States on Monday announced its approval of a $3.5-billion sale to South Korea of up to 36 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters and related equipment, including missiles.</p>

<p>"The proposed sale will improve the Republic of Korea's capability to meet current and future threats by providing a credible force capable of deterring adversaries and participating in regional operations," the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) said in a statement.</p>

<p>The sale will improve "the security of a major ally that is a force for political stability and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific region," the statement said, using the US foreign policy term for the Asia Pacific region.</p>

<p>The State Department approved the possible sale of the helicopters to South Korea, and the DSCA on Monday provided the required notification to Congress, which still needs to sign off on the transaction.</p>

<p>The principal contractors for the deal will be Boeing and Lockheed Martin, the DSCA said.</p>

<p>The announcement came on the same day that Washington and Seoul began major annual joint military drills, with new exercises aimed at containing the nuclear-armed North.</p>

<p>The Ulchi Freedom Shield exercise runs until August 29 and will involve thousands of military personnel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A case of mpox in Pakistan announced last week was not the new strain spreading through Africa, health officials said Monday.</p>

<p>The mpox diagnosis in a 34-year-old man recently returned from a Gulf country was declared by health officials on Friday, while testing over the exact strain was carried out.</p>

<p>"The virus has been classified as Clade 2b," the health ministry said in a statement on Monday.</p>

<p>"Currently, the ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is primarily associated with Clade 1b. Notably, as of now, there have been no reported cases of Clade 1b in Pakistan."</p>

<p>Mpox infections surged worldwide in May 2022, mostly affecting gay and bisexual men due to the Clade 2b subclade, but cases have largely subsided.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization declared last week the rapid spread of the new Clade 1b strain in Africa a public health emergency of international concern -- the highest alarm it can sound.</p>

<p>Sweden's Public Health Agency said Thursday that it had registered a case of the Clade 1b subclade, the first to be diagnosed out of Africa.</p>

<p>Around 16,000 cases have been recorded in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the epicentre of the epidemic which has killed 548 people in the country so far.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In Gaza, a mother worries that her month-old son, Mohammed, could be infected with polio after the Palestinian health ministry confirmed the first case in the enclave on Friday, ending a 25 year period in which the Strip was polio-free.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Gaza, a mother worries that her month-old son, Mohammed, could be infected with polio after the Palestinian health ministry confirmed the first case in the enclave on Friday, ending a 25 year period in which the Strip was polio-free.</p>

<p>Just three days after his birth, Ghada al-Ghandour's son Mohammed started developing skin rashes.</p>

<p>"He had skin rashes as if he was burnt," she said.</p>

<p>A doctor told her there were no creams to treat her child.</p>

<p>She later brought him to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza to seek a diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<p>The rash fueled his mother's fears that other symptoms and diseases could follow due to a lack of hygiene and medical supplies in Gaza after more than 10 months of conflict.</p>

<p>In a statement, the Palestinian health ministry confirmed the first case of polio in the city of Deir al-Balah had been detected in a 10-month-old baby who had not been vaccinated.</p>

<p>Likewise, Mohammed has not received a polio vaccine.</p>

<p>"My son was deprived of the first vaccine in his first month," his mother said.</p>

<p>Polio was detected in sewage in Gaza's Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis governorates, Dr. Hamid Jafari, a polio specialist at the World Health Organization (WHO), said on Aug. 7, adding it was possible the virus had been circulating since September.</p>

<p><strong>'YET ANOTHER THREAT TO CHILDREN'</strong></p>

<p>Poliomyelitis, which is spread mainly through the fecal-oral route, is a highly infectious virus that can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis.</p>

<p>Children under 5 are most at risk from the viral disease, and especially infants under 2 since normal vaccination regimens have been disrupted by the war.</p>

<p>"If the occupation (Israeli forces) continues to close the (border) crossing and denies access to vaccines, it will lead to a health disaster," said Khalil al-Daqran, spokesperson of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital.</p>

<p>Israel announced on Sunday that it would facilitate the transfer into Gaza of polio vaccines for around one million children.</p>

<p>More than 43,000 vials of the vaccine were expected to arrive in Israel in the coming weeks and would be sent to Gaza, according to a statement from COGAT, the Israeli defence agency that coordinated civilian matters with the Palestinians. This would be enough for two rounds of doses for over a million children, it said.</p>

<p>But Al-Daqran of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital said a vaccination campaign could not happen without a pause in fighting.</p>

<p>The reemergence of polio "represents yet another threat to the children in the Gaza Strip and neighbouring countries," the WHO said on Aug. 16.</p>

<p>Nearly half of Gaza's 2.3 million population are under the age of 18 and around 15% are children under the age of 5, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics.</p>

<p>Aside from the resurgence of polio and the threat of other diseases, Palestinians face a humanitarian crisis with shortages of food, fuel and water inflicting suffering every day.</p>

<p>The war in Gaza started after Hamas attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking over 250 hostage, according to Israeli tallies. The death count of Palestinians killed by the Israeli military campaign has exceeded 40,000, according to Gaza authorities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility on Monday for a bomb blast near a synagogue in Tel Aviv that Israeli police and the Shin Bet intelligence agency described as a terrorist attack.</p>

<p>A man who was carrying the bomb was killed and a passerby was injured in the incident late on Sunday, according to police at the scene in Israel's commercial capital.</p>

<p>Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer said the man was carrying a backpack loaded with explosives that detonated "before he managed to reach a more heavily populated area".</p>

<p>In a joint statement, the two Palestinian groups said their "martyrdom operations" inside Israel would return to the forefront as long as the "occupation's massacres and assassination policy continue". This was an allusion to Israel's offensive in Gaza and the July 31 killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.</p>

<p>Israel has neither claimed nor denied responsibility for Haniyeh's death in the Iranian capital.</p>

<p>The war in Gaza began on Oct. 7 last year when Hamas gunmen entered across the border into Israeli communities, killing around 1,200 people and abducting about 250 hostages according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's military campaign has since levelled wide swathes of the Gaza Strip and killed at least 40,000 people, according to the enclave's health authorities.</p>

<p>Sunday's explosion in Tel Aviv came about an hour after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Tel Aviv to push for a ceasefire in Gaza to end the 10-month-old war between Israel and Hamas.</p>

<p>There has been increased urgency to reach a ceasefire deal amid fears of an escalation across the wider region. Iran has threatened to retaliate against Israel after the assassination of Haniyeh.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday urged Hamas to accept a US bridging proposal for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal after what he said was a "very constructive" meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday urged Hamas to accept a US bridging proposal for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal after what he said was a "very constructive" meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

<p>He had earlier said the latest push for a deal was probably the best and possibly last opportunity, urging both sides towards agreement.</p>

<p>Talks in Qatar last week paused without a breakthrough, but the negotiations are expected to resume this week based on the US proposal to bridge the gaps between Israel and Hamas.</p>

<p>However, with the Palestinian Islamist group announcing a resumption of suicide bombing inside Israel after many years, and medics saying Israeli military strikes killed at least 30 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip on Monday, there are few signs of conciliation on the ground.</p>

<p>"In a very constructive meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu today, he confirmed to me that Israel accepts the bridging proposal - that he supports it," Blinken told reporters in Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>"It's now incumbent on Hamas to do the same, and then the parties, with the help of the mediators - the United States, Egypt and Qatar - have to come together and complete the process of reaching clear understandings about how they'll implement the commitments that they've made under this agreement."</p>

<p>Despite US expressions of optimism and Netanyahu's office describing the meeting as positive, both Israel and Hamas have signalled that any deal will be difficult.</p>

<p>Hamas accused Netanyahu on Sunday of "thwarting the mediators' efforts" and Turkey said Hamas envoys had told it that US officials were "painting an overly optimistic picture".</p>

<p>Months of on-off talks have circled the same issues, with Israel saying the war can only end with the destruction of Hamas as a military and political force and Hamas saying it will only accept a permanent, and not a temporary, ceasefire.</p>

<p>There are disagreements over Israel's continued military presence inside Gaza, particularly along the border with Egypt, over the free movement of Palestinians inside the territory, and over the identity and number of prisoners to be freed in a swap.</p>

<p>The current war in Gaza began on October 7 last year when Hamas gunmen rushed across the border into Israeli communities, killing around 1,200 people and abducting about 250 hostages according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's military campaign has since levelled swathes of Gaza, driving nearly all of its 2.3 million people from their homes, giving rise to deadly hunger and disease and killing at least 40,000 people according to Palestinian health authorities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 95-year-old Kenyan man married his 90-year-old long-time sweetheart at the weekend, six decades after they first met, local media reported on Monday.</p>

<p>Ibrahim Mbogo walked down the aisle with Tabitha Wangui at a white wedding at a church on Sunday, private media outlet Citizen Digital reported.</p>

<p>"We met and fell in love in 1960, do you hear?" Mbogo was quoted as saying outside the church in Mukurweini, a town about a three-hour drive northeast of the Kenyan capital Nairobi.</p>

<p>"We deliberated together and decided it would be great if we did a white wedding, we know in our Kikuyu custom that we are legally married, but since we are also Christians, we decided to do a church wedding."</p>

<p>The groom wore a smart grey suit and silver tie for their special day, while his new bride was dressed in a white hat with a cream brocade jacket over a white outfit.</p>

<p>Asked about their secret, Wangui told Citizen Digital: "Women, you must respect your husbands, if you do that, then you will live as we have."</p>

<p>"Don't do any wrong, and when you do, just apologise and seek forgiveness."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump has shared doctored images on social media showing Taylor Swift and her fans supporting his presidential campaign, in an apparent effort to tap into the pop singer's mega star power in the US election.</p>

<p>Ms Swift has not yet publicly thrown her weight behind any presidential candidate in the November 5 election, but she backed President Joe Biden in 2020 and has previously been critical of Trump.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Trump shared screenshots of posts with manipulated images -- including some that an expert said appeared to be AI-generated -- suggesting that the pop star and her fans, popularly known as Swifties, support his campaign.</p>

<p>In his Truth Social post, which includes a poster of Swift clad in an Uncle Sam outfit and instructing her fans to vote for Trump, the former president wrote: "I accept!"</p>

<p>That poster is either "AI generated or just classically manipulated," Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at the University of California, Berkeley, told AFP.</p>

<p>The post also includes photos of women wearing shirts with the slogan "Swifties for Trump," some of which Farid said had the "tell-tale signs of being AI-generated."</p>

<p>What makes the mash-up "particularly devious" is that is a combination of real and fake imagery, with at least one photo of a woman wearing such a shirt looking legitimate, Farid said.</p>

<p>There was no immediate comment from Swift about the post by Trump, who separately shared on Truth Social a video of a supporter voicing the dubious claim that "Swifties were rallying for Trump."</p>

<p>Swift's soaring popularity and sway over her fans could make her support valuable in the upcoming presidential election.</p>

<p>Both Republicans and Democrats have long wanted to count on her support, but the megastar has been largely reticent about her political leanings.</p>

<p>In a demonstration of her star power, when Swift encouraged her fans to register to vote last fall, directing them to the nonpartisan nonprofit Vote.org, her plea had an immediate impact.</p>

<p>Following her message, the institution said it recorded more than 35,000 new registrations, 23 per cent more than last year and the most since 2020.</p>

<p>Swift's feelers into politics have been heavily scrutinized, making her a ripe target for political misinformation and right-wing conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Her reserve led many critics to speculate Swift was a closet Republican, until 2018, when she broke both her silence and the internet by endorsing the Democratic opponent of far-right US Senator Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee.</p>

<p>She has since spoken out in particular for the legal right to an abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, intense speculation has swirled on social media that Swift will endorse Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the November election.</p>

<p>The megastar has not commented publicly, but that has not stopped legions of fans from forming a group called "Swifties for Kamala," attracting tens of thousands of followers on platforms such as Instagram and X, formerly Twitter.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Chief Executive Officer of Google, Eric Schmidt, has said that the Ukraine war has turned him into a licensed arms dealer, a career path he "doesn't recommend". Mr Schmidt's new venture aims to &nbsp;converge AI and defense technology to help Ukraine fight in the ongoing war against Russia.</p>

<p>Mr Schmidt reportedly delivered a lecture in Stanford University in April where he talked about how Russian atrocities in Ukraine affected him. "Watching the Russians use tanks to destroy apartment buildings with little old ladies and kids just drove me crazy," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Schmidt, who was Google's CEO from 2001 to 2011, along with Sebastian Thrun, CEO of Udacity, is working on a new start up called White Stork. "The idea basically is to do two things- use AI in complicated, powerful ways for these essentially robotic wars and the second one is to lower the cost of robots," he said.</p>

<p>The lecture Mr Schmidt delivered at Stanford in April was posted by the university on its YouTube last week, according to a report in Business Insider. The lecture quickly went viral, however, it was later taken down.</p>

<p>In the lecture, Mr Schmidt reportedly informed that White Stork will mass-produce drones equipped with Artificial Intelligence to identify targets to eliminate the need for ground battles with tanks, artillery and mortar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a clip of the lecture, now in wide circulation on X, formerly twitter, Mr Schmidt says, "The whole theory of armies is tanks, artilleries and mortar and we can eliminate all of them, and we can make the penalty for invading a country, at least by land, essentially be impossible."</p>

<p>Mr Schmidt said that he is now a licensed arms dealer "because of the way the system works". "A computer scientist, businessman, arms dealer. I do not recommend this in your career path, I'd stick with AI," he said.</p>

<p>"Because of the way the laws work, we're doing this privately and this is all legal with the support of the government, so it goes straight into Ukraine and then they fight the war," he added.</p>

<p>The Russia-Ukraine war, which started in February 2022, has been going on for almost two and a half years now.</p>

<p>In the latest development, Ukrainian forces struck a third bridge in an attack on Russia's Kursk region. According to Ukraine, the ongoing offensive in the Kursk region is aimed at creating a "buffer zone" and to bring war closer to an end.</p>

<p>Ukraine's ongoing offensive in Kursk is said to be the biggest attack on Russia since World War II.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK businessman Mike Lynch, who was recently acquitted in the United States of an $11 billion fraud, is among those missing Monday after a superyacht sank off southern Italy, according to the head of the Civil Protection Agency.</p>

<p>The 56-metre-long luxury yacht, The Bayesian, had been moored off Porticello, east of Palermo, when the storm swept suddenly up the coast before dawn, tearing through beach clubs and little fishing ports.</p>

<p>Lynch's wife was among 15 people rescued after the luxury yacht sank amid violent winds and rains off the Sicily coast, according to Salvo Cocina of the Civil Protection Agency, leaving six others missing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Italian authorities have opened a probe into the incident as the emergency response continued Monday.</p>

<p>Lynch, 59, was acquitted on all charges in a San Francisco court in early June after he was accused of the massive fraud linked to the sale of his software firm Autonomy to Hewlett-Packard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He co-founded Autonomy in Cambridge in 1996.&nbsp;</p>

<p>US prosecutors accused Lynch of wire fraud and securities fraud, and conspiracy to commit offenses involving years of falsified records.</p>

<p>He had been extradited to the US from Britain to stand trial on the criminal charges.</p>

<p>A University of Cambridge graduate from Suffolk in eastern England, Lynch had disputed all charges and denied any wrongdoing. He was facing two decades in jail if convicted of the 17 charges.</p>

<p>A celebrated technology sector entrepreneur and investor, sometimes referred to as the UK's answer to Bill Gates, he had won numerous awards and plaudits in Britain and beyond.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Invoke Capital, another firm he founded, declined to comment.</p>

<p>Lynch was reportedly on board the boat with colleagues from the company when the storm struck.</p>

<p>Following his US acquittal, he had been critical of his prosecution in the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He had told the BBC that the only reason he was free was "because I had enough money not to be swept away by a process that's set up to sweep you away".</p>

<p>"You shouldn't need to have funds to protect yourself as a British citizen", he said in the interview aired earlier this month.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a key address to diplomats in Dhaka on Sunday, Muhammad Yunus, the Chief Adviser to Bangladesh's interim government, called for comprehensive reforms before holding the next general elections. This meeting marked Mr Yunus' first engagement with the diplomatic community since assuming office on August 8, following the resignation of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>Mr Yunus, a Nobel laureate, took charge amid a volatile political landscape that saw mass protests and violence resulting in the ousting of Ms Hasina. In his address, Yunus outlined the interim government's roadmap for a stable and democratic Bangladesh, starting with a free, fair, and participatory election.</p>

<p>"We will hold a free, fair participatory election as soon as we can complete our mandate to carry out vital reforms in our election commission, judiciary, civil administration, security forces and media," he told diplomats, including India's High Commissioner in Dhaka, Pranay Verma.</p>

<h3><strong>Restoring Normalcy&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>On August 5, Ms Hasina, aged 76, fled Bangladesh by helicopter to India as protesters overran the streets of Dhaka. Her 15-year rule, marked by allegations of human rights abuses, came to a dramatic end. The weeks leading up to her ousting were bloody, with more than 450 dying during the unrest and several reports of attacks on Bangladesh's Hindu minority community.</p>

<p>The Chief Adviser said restoring law and order in the country is a top priority for his government. "We will be close to normalcy within a short period, with the unwavering support of our people and patriotic armed forces," Mr Yunus said. "The top priority of the Interim Government would be to bring the law and order situation under control...The armed forces will continue to serve in aid of civil power as long as the situation warrants."</p>

<h3><strong>Reviving Economy&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In addition to political reforms, Mr Yunus spoke about the need for robust economic reforms. The country had suffered under what he described as Ms Hasina's "brutal dictatorship," which, according to Mr Yunus, had led to widespread corruption and mismanagement.</p>

<p>"Our government will undertake far-reaching economic reforms to restore macroeconomic stability and sustain growth," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Yunus accused Sheikh Hasina of systematically destroying the country's institutions during her 15-year tenure. He alleged that elections under Ms Hasina's rule were rigged, and democratic rights were suppressed.</p>

<p>"In their efforts to stay in power, Sheikh Hasina's dictatorship destroyed every institution of the country," Mr Yunus said. He described the judiciary as broken and accused the former administration of allowing political patronage to rob banks and plunder the state coffers.</p>

<p>The Nobel laureate described the recent mass uprising as a "Second Revolution," led by students and ordinary citizens who sought to reclaim their democratic rights.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>International Support</strong></h3>

<p>In his message to the international community, Mr Yunus called for continued support in rebuilding Bangladesh and transitioning to a fully functional democracy. He assured the diplomats that Bangladesh would maintain its role as a proponent of multilateralism, with the United Nations at the core of its foreign policy.</p>

<p>"We believe all our friends and partners in the international community will stand by our government and people as we chart a new democratic future," Yunus said.</p>

<p>"Bangladesh stands at the crossroads of a new beginning. Our valiant students and people deserve a lasting transformation of our nation. It is a difficult journey and we need your help along the way. We need to fulfil their aspirations. The sooner the better," he added.</p>

<p>Mr Yunus also welcomed the United Nations' decision to send a fact-finding mission to investigate the recent violence, committing to cooperate fully with the international inquiry.</p>]]></content:encoded>

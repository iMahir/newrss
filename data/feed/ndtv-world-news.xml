       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 18 people were killed and 19 seriously wounded in a string of suicide attacks in northeastern Nigeria on Saturday, emergency services said.</p>

<p>In one of three blasts in the town of Gwoza, a female attacker with a baby strapped to her back detonated explosives in the middle of a wedding ceremony, according to a police spokesman.</p>

<p>The other attacks in the border town across from Cameroon targeted a hospital and a funeral for victims of the earlier wedding blast, authorities said.</p>

<p>At least 18 people were killed and 42 others injured in the attacks, according to the Borno State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA).</p>

<p>"So far, 18 deaths comprising children, men, females and pregnant women" have been reported, said Barkindo Saidu, the head of the agency, in a report seen by AFP.</p>

<p>Nineteen "seriously injured" people were taken to the regional capital Maiduguri, while 23 others were awaiting evacuation, Saidu said in the report.</p>

<p>A member of a militia assisting the military in Gwoza said two of his comrades and a soldier were also killed in another attack on a security post, though authorities did not immediately confirm this toll.</p>

<p>Boko Haram militants seized Gwoza in 2014 when the group took over swathes of territory in northern Borno.</p>

<p>The town was taken back by the Nigerian military with help from Chadian forces in 2015 but the group has since continued to launch attacks from mountains near the town.</p>

<p>Boko Haram has carried out raids, killing men and kidnapping women who venture outside the town in search of firewood and acacia fruits.</p>

<p>The violence has killed more than 40,000 people and displaced around two million in Nigeria's northeast.</p>

<p>The conflict has spread to neighbouring Niger, Cameroon and Chad, prompting the formation of a regional military coalition to fight the militants.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[A Russian strike on the south Ukrainian town of Vilniansk killed at least seven people, Kyiv said, in an attack that came hours after Russia said a Ukrainian drone killed five people on its border village.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Russian strike on the south Ukrainian town of Vilniansk killed at least seven people, Kyiv said, in an attack that came hours after Russia said a Ukrainian drone killed five people on its border village.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both countries said two children were killed in each attack, in a deadly day in the more than two-year war.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kyiv also said four people were killed in eastern frontline villages in the Donetsk region.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned the death toll in Vilniansk -- near the regional hub of Zaporizhzhia -- may increase.</p>

<p>"Seven people, including two children, have been killed by a Russian missile strike in the Zaporizhzhia region," Zelensky said on social media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He called for his Western allies to speed-up weapons deliveries, saying: "Any delay in decisions in this war means the loss of human lives."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ukraine's Internal Minister, Igor Klimenko, said 18 people -- including four children -- were wounded in Vilniansk.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He posted images of a local burnt out low-rise building and blackened cars.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The head of the Zaporizhzhia region, Ivan Fedorov, earlier said a "critical infrastructure facility, a shop and residential buildings were damaged" in the strike.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vilniansk lies 29 kilometres (18 miles) north-east of the city of Zaporizhzhia, the main regional city which is under Ukrainian control.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Russia's attack on Vilniansk came hours after Moscow said a Ukrainian drone on a house in a Russian border village killed five people, including two children.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Five dead in Russian village</h3>

<p>Moscow said the drone hit a house in the village of Gorodishche, a tiny village in Russia's Kursk region, just a few metres from the border with Ukraine.</p>

<p>"To our great grief, five people were killed ... including two small children. Another two members of the family are in a serious condition," Kursk governor Alexei Smirnov said in a post on Telegram.</p>

<p>The attack was with a "copter"-style drone, he added, a small device that can be fitted to carry grenades or other explosives that are dropped over targets.</p>

<p>Both sides have used drones, including larger self-detonating craft with ranges of up to hundreds of kilometres, extensively throughout the conflict which began in February 2022.</p>

<p>Ukraine has stepped up its attacks on Russian territory this year, targeting both energy sites that it says fuel Russia's military, as well as towns and villages just across the border.</p>

<p>Fighting in Ukraine has intensified in several directions as Russia has launched offensives from several directions, taking advantage of Kyiv being on the back foot militarily.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Four dead in eastern Ukraine</h3>

<p>Kyiv's army said Saturday Moscow was attacking from several directions and that "the total number of hostile attacks along the entire frontline has now risen to 90."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ukrainian officials reported deadly attacks on Saturday morning that killed four people in eastern villages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In (the village of) Zarichne, Russians killed three people," Vadym Filashkin, the head of the Donetsk region, said on social media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The office of Ukraine's General Prosecutor later said another person, a resident of the eastern village of New York "also sustained fatal injuries."&nbsp;</p>

<p>New York has been intensely attacked since mid-June as Russian forces push towards the city of Toretsk, further north.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the central city of Dnipro, police said they found a woman who was killed in an attack a day earlier that also wounded 13 people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Police identified a woman killed in a missile attack on Dnipro city. She is a 76-year-old resident of a destroyed apartment block," Ukraine's National Police said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It said the number of wounded in the attack rose to 13, "including an infant and a pregnant woman."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and wife Akshata Murty on the last weekend of the general election campaign prayed at London's iconic BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir, popularly known as Neasden Temple.</p>

<p>The couple was greeted with loud cheers as its convoy drove into the grand temple grounds on Saturday evening and went on to perform puja guided by the priests.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It was a pleasure to welcome <a href="https://twitter.com/RishiSunak?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RishiSunak</a> and Akshata Murty to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NeasdenTemple?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NeasdenTemple</a> today. <a href="https://t.co/EEOC9SXccE">pic.twitter.com/EEOC9SXccE</a></p>&mdash; Neasden Temple (@NeasdenTemple) <a href="https://twitter.com/NeasdenTemple/status/1807162600725032972?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2024</a></blockquote></p>

<p>After a tour of the grand temple complex and interaction with volunteers and community leaders, cricket fan Sunak began his address to the congregation with a reference to India's winning the T20 World Cup before speaking about the inspiration he draws from his faith.</p>

<p>"I am Hindu and like all of you, I draw inspiration and comfort from my faith," he said.</p>

<p>"I was proud to be sworn in as a member of parliament on the 'Bhagavad Gita'. Our faith teaches us to do our duty and not fret about the outcome as long as one does it faithfully.</p>

<p>"That is what I was brought up to believe by my wonderful and loving parents and that is how I live my life; and that is what I want to pass on to my daughters as they grow up. It is dharma which guides me in my approach to public service," he said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A senior Palestinian Hamas official said Saturday in Beirut that negotiations for an agreement with Israel on a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal had not made any progress.</p>

<p>A plan presented last month by US President Joe Biden, which he said was proposed by Israel, included a six-week truce accompanied by an Israeli withdrawal from densely populated areas and the release of some hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to US news site Axios, "three sources with direct knowledge" said Washington had presented a "new language for parts of" the proposed deal.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Osama Hamdan, a Hamas official based in Lebanon, confirmed that the Islamist movement had received the latest proposal on June 24, but that it included "nothing new".</p>

<p>"We can say that there is no real progress in the negotiations to stop the (Israeli) aggression so far", he said at a press conference.</p>

<p>The plan presented by Biden has so far failed to result in a deal, with both sides sticking to their demands.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he will continue the war until Hamas is totally defeated and all hostages are freed.</p>

<p>Hamas insists on a permanent ceasefire and a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Hamdan said the proposals were "merely a waste of time and provide additional time for the occupation (Israel) to practise genocide".</p>

<p>He also said Hamas was being pressured to accept Israel's deal "as it is without modification".</p>

<p>The war started with Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The militants also seized hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza although the army says 42 are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,834 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 40 Palestinians were killed and 224 others injured in Israeli attacks across the besieged Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours, according to health authorities controlled by Hamas.</p>

<p>The latest casualties bring the total Palestinian death count to 37,834, with 86,858 injuries reported since the outbreak of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in October 2023, the health authorities said on Saturday.</p>

<p>Officials added that rescue teams faced significant obstacles in reaching areas targeted by attacks due to fuel shortages and intense clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed factions, particularly in the city of Rafah in southern Gaza and the Shujaeya neighbourhood in eastern Gaza City, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Avichay Adraee, an Israeli military spokesperson, said in a press statement on Saturday that the Israeli forces are continuing the attack on "terrorist" targets in the Shujaeya area, fighting simultaneously above and below ground.</p>

<p>During the past hours, the forces eliminated many "saboteurs" in clashes, and the troops found a weapons depot inside a school complex in the area, he added.</p>

<p>In Rafah, the Israeli forces eliminated several "saboteurs" and destroyed many "terrorist" infrastructure, including tunnel openings, according to Adraee.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East highlighted on social media platform X that hundreds of thousands of Gazans continue to endure severe shortages of shelter, food, medicine, and clean water, exacerbated by restricted access through border crossings.</p>

<p>A temporary floating aid pier operated by the US, anchored off the coast of Gaza to facilitate humanitarian deliveries, has been removed due to adverse weather conditions, the Pentagon announced on Friday. This marks the third interruption since mid-May.</p>

<p>"Temporarily relocating the pier will prevent potential structural damage that could be caused by the heightened sea state," said Sabrina Singh, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary, during a briefing on Friday.</p>

<p>The pier is not an end-all solution to getting aid into Gaza, Singh said, adding that land routes are the most effective delivery method.</p>

<p>Israel launched a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on October 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and around 250 were taken hostage.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A Serbian police officer on Saturday killed a man who shot him in the neck with a crossbow in front of the Israeli embassy in Belgrade, in what the prime minister called a "terrorist act".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Serbian police officer on Saturday killed a man who shot him in the neck with a crossbow in front of the Israeli embassy in Belgrade, in what the prime minister called a "terrorist act".</p>

<p>Police identified the assailant as being a "convert" to Islam, who was born in 1999 in the town of Mladenovac, some 50 kilometres from Belgrade.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The attack happened around 11:00 am (0900 GMT) on Saturday in the Serbian capital, when the attacker shot the officer who was on duty outside the Israeli embassy.</p>

<p>The policeman in self-defence opened fire from his gun at the attacker "who died as a result of his injuries", said Interior Minister Ivica Dacic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Authorities said some arrests had been made for "preventive reasons" and a number of people known to the security services were suspected of being linked to the attack.</p>

<p>The arrested included a man from Belgrade who was already held two years ago for being the administrator of several militant internet sites that called for "jihad", or holy war, but was released from custody, Dacic said.</p>

<p>"It is suspected that he directly participated in the logistical support and organisation of this terrorist act."</p>

<p>Police also said they were carrying out searches in a number of locations.</p>

<p>"There are several more persons that we are looking for, certainly for one who is on the territory of Serbia," President Aleksandar Vucic told reporters after visiting the wounded officer.</p>

<p>The attacker and his associates were tracked by the authorities before Saturday's attack but there was not enough evidence to arrest them, he added.</p>

<p>The 34-year-old officer, who underwent surgery in hospital, was in his guard booth when the attack happened.</p>

<p>According to authorities, the assailant had moved to live in Novi Pazar, which is a historical and political centre of the Bosniak Muslim minority in Serbia, and a centre of Islam in the country.</p>

<p>Dacic told reporters that there were early indications connecting the attack with people suspected of being linked to the Wahhabi movement -- an ultra-conservative branch of Islam that dominates in Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>He said that overall security had been stepped up in Belgrade while special prosecutors had taken over the case.</p>

<h2>'Terrorist act'</h2>

<p>Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic strongly condemned what he labelled a "heinous terrorist act".</p>

<p>The prime minister said his country would firmly respond to the threat of terrorism and stressed Serbian citizens could "feel safe".</p>

<p>"The embassy is closed and no employee of the embassy was injured," in an "attempted terrorist attack" in its vicinity, an Israeli foreign ministry statement said. The circumstances are still being investigated, it added.</p>

<p>Later on Saturday, Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz on X thanked Serbian authorities for their "strong support and cooperation following the attempted terror act on the Embassy of Israel in Belgrade today".</p>

<p>"Terrorism cannot be tolerated!"</p>

<p>Israeli ambassador to Serbia Yahel Vilan on X voiced his gratitude to the wounded officer, "who courageously prevented the attack".</p>

<p>"I am convinced that the investigation by the competent authorities of this shameful attack will identify all responsible persons and further contribute to the preservation of Serbia as a safe country."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Serbia's top Islamic cleric Senad Halitovic strongly condemned the attack and wished the wounded officer a quick recovery.</p>

<p>"Such crimes are against all religious teachings, especially the teachings of Islam. Today's crime is the work of a mindless individual," he said in a statement.</p>

<p>The Balkan nation has continued arms sales to Israel after the war in Gaza started with Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which claimed 1,195 lives, mostly of civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The militants also seized hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza although the army says 42 are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,834 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on Saturday that Iran's message of an "obliterating war" made it worthy of destruction.</p>

<p>⁠"A regime that threatens destruction deserves to be destroyed," Katz said in a post on X. He also said Israel will act with full force against Iran-backed Hezbollah if it does not stop firing at Israel from Lebanon and move away from the border.</p>

<p>Iran's UN mission said on Friday that if Israel embarks on a "full-scale military aggression" in Lebanon, "an obliterating war will ensue."</p>

<p>The Iranian mission also said in the post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that in such an event "all options, incl. the full involvement of all resistance fronts, are on the table."</p>

<p>Hezbollah has been exchanging fire with Israel since October, in parallel with the Gaza war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said this week they prefer a diplomatic path to resolving the situation.</p>

<p>Though Katz is a member of Israel's security cabinet, war policy has largely been led by Netanyahu and a small circle of ministers that includes Gallant, who visited Washington this week for talks on Gaza and Lebanon.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The comment from Iran's mission to New York comes with fears of a wider regional war involving Israel and Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement. The two sides have engaged in near-daily exchanges of fire since the war in Gaza began.</p>

<p>Such exchanges have escalated this month, alongside bellicose rhetoric from both sides. Israel's military said plans for a Lebanon offensive had been "approved and validated", prompting Hezbollah to respond that none of Israel would be spared in a full-blown conflict.</p>

<p>In a post on social media platform X, the Iranian mission said it "deems as psychological warfare the Zionist regime's propaganda about intending to attack Lebanon".</p>

<p>But, it added, "should it embark on full-scale military aggression, an obliterating war will ensue. All options, incl. the full involvement of all Resistance Fronts, are on the table."</p>

<p>The war in Gaza began in October when Hamas Palestinian operatives attacked southern Israel.</p>

<p>Iran, which backs Hamas, has praised the attack as a success but has denied any involvement.</p>

<p>Alongside Hezbollah's attacks on northern Israel, Iran-backed rebels in Yemen have repeatedly struck commercial ships in the Red Sea area in what they say are acts of solidarity with the Palestinians.</p>

<p>Iran also backs other groups in the region.</p>

<p>The Islamic republic has not recognised Israel since the 1979 revolution that toppled Iran's United States-backed shah.</p>

<p>Fears of regional war also soared in April, after an air strike that levelled Iran's consulate in Damascus and killed seven Revolutionary Guards, two of them generals.</p>

<p>Iran hit back with an unprecedented drone and missile attack on Israel on April 13-14.</p>

<p>Iran's state media later reported explosions in the central province of Isfahan as US media quoted American officials saying Israel had carried out retaliatory strikes on its arch-rival.</p>

<p>Tehran downplayed the reported Israeli raid.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A United Nations agency said it has discovered five bombs in a wall of Mosul's iconic Al-Nuri mosque, planted years ago by Islamic State group jihadists, during restoration work in the northern Iraqi city.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A United Nations agency said it has discovered five bombs in a wall of Mosul's iconic Al-Nuri mosque, planted years ago by Islamic State group jihadists, during restoration work in the northern Iraqi city.</p>

<p>Five "large-scale explosive devices, designed to trigger a massive destruction of the site," were found in the southern wall of the prayer hall on Tuesday by the UNESCO team working at the site, a representative for the agency told AFP late Friday.</p>

<p>Mosul's Al-Nuri mosque and the adjacent leaning minaret nicknamed Al-Hadba or the "hunchback", which dates from the 12th century, were destroyed during the battle to retake the city from IS.</p>

<p>Iraq's army accused IS, which occupied Mosul for three years, of planting explosives at the site and blowing it up.</p>

<p>UNESCO, the UN cultural agency, has been working to restore the mosque and other architectural heritage sites in the city, much of it reduced to rubble in the battle to retake it in 2017.</p>

<p>"The Iraqi armed forces immediately secured the area and the situation is now fully under control," UNESCO added.</p>

<p>One bomb was removed, but four other 1.5-kilogram (3.3-pound) devices "remain connected to each other" and are expected to be cleared in the coming days, it said.</p>

<p><strong>'Complex manufacturing'</strong></p>

<p>"These explosive devices were hidden inside a wall, which was specially rebuilt around them: it explains why they could not be discovered when the site was cleared by Iraqi forces" in 2020, the agency said.</p>

<p>Iraqi General Tahseen al-Khafaji, spokesperson for the Joint Operations Command of various Iraqi forces, confirmed the discovery of "several explosive devices from ISIS jihadists in Al-Nuri mosque."</p>

<p>He said provincial deminers requested help from the Defence Ministry in Baghdad to defuse the remaining munitions because of their "complex manufacturing".</p>

<p>Construction work has been suspended at the site until the bombs are removed.</p>

<p>It was from Al-Nuri mosque that Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, the then-leader of IS, proclaimed the establishment of the group's "caliphate" in July 2014.</p>

<p>The jihadists took over large swathes of territory in Iraq and neighbouring Syria, which they ruled with brutality.</p>

<p>Iraqi forces backed by a US-led coalition drove IS out of Mosul in 2017.</p>

<p>The Al-Nuri mosque derives its name from Nureddine al-Zinki, the unifier of Syria who also reigned for a time over Mosul and ordered its construction in 1172.</p>

<p>It was destroyed and rebuilt in 1942 in a renovation project, with only the ancient minaret remaining from the original structure.</p>

<p>The current restoration of Al-Nuri, largely funded by the United Arab Emirates, is still expected to be completed in December 2024.</p>

<p>This, said UNESCO, will finally erase "the stigma" of IS occupation.</p>

<p>The minaret -- which will be reconstructed at a slant upon the request of locals -- is being rebuilt with 45,000 of the original bricks saved from the rubble, only a third of the original structure.</p>

<p>The bomb scare was not the first surprise discovery at Al-Nuri. In January 2022, restoration teams unearthed an underground prayer room from the original 12th century building.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine and Russia said Saturday that priests were among the dozens of captured soldiers and civilians they had exchanged earlier this week.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said two Ukrainian Greek Catholic priests taken captive in Moscow-occupied Berdiansk were handed back to Ukraine thanks to the mediation of the Vatican.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Russia said a high-ranking Ukrainian Orthodox cleric was handed over to Moscow along with two other priests.</p>

<p>Churches have been heavily affected by the war, with Kyiv's Orthodox church breaking ties with Moscow and Ukraine regularly accusing clerics of treason.</p>

<p>Moscow and Kyiv exchanged 90 POWs and some civilians each earlier this week.</p>

<p>Speaking at an event in Kyiv, Zelensky named the two released Ukrainian Greek Catholic priests as Bogdan Geleta and Ivan Levytskyi, and said they had been preaching in Berdiansk.</p>

<p>Bediansk, on the Azov Sea, fell to Russian forces in the first days of their February 2022 invasion. The priests had been held by the Russians since 16 November 2022, Zelensky added.</p>

<p>He said they were freed "thanks to the efforts of our team and the mediation of the Vatican, for which I am especially grateful."</p>

<p>Pope Francis earlier this year expressed hopes for a "general" prisoner exchange between the two countries.</p>

<p>Metropolitan Ionafan, the Ukrainian Orthodox cleric handed over to Moscow, had been convicted in August 2023 of justifying the Russian invasion and was facing five years in prison.</p>

<p>Moscow's ombudsman Tatiana Moskalkova said Ionafan was received by the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill in Moscow.</p>

<p>She said two other Orthodox priests who had remained with Moscow's patriarchy when the church split were also handed over to Russia in the course of the exchange.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Robert Maudsley, dubbed "Hannibal the Cannibal," has been held in solitary confinement at Wakefield Prison for 45 years due to his extreme danger, locked behind 17 steel doors resembling conditions akin to Hannibal Lecter.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert Maudsley, 70, has been held in solitary confinement at Wakefield Prison for the past 45 years due to the extreme danger he poses to other inmates, according to a report by <em>the Manchester Evening News.</em> Originally sentenced for murder, Maudsley went on to kill three more people while incarcerated.</p>

<p>New details about Maudsley's extreme confinement are emerging from the book <em>"Inside Wakefield Prison: Life Behind Bars in the Monster Mansion"</em> by authors Jonathan Levi and Emma French. The book describes conditions mirroring those of the fictional serial killer Hannibal Lecter, with Maudsley reportedly kept in a specially designed transparent cell.</p>

<p>The writers detail: "Today, in Wakefield Prison, Maudsley is kept in confinement for twenty-three hours of the day. Everything in his cell is made of cardboard, and you have to go through 17 steel doors to get to it."</p>

<p>As per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/uks-most-dangerous-prisoner-locked-29432901">news outlet,</a> his confinement closely mirrors Hannibal Lecter, played by Anthony Hopkins in the film Silence of the Lambs, which has led to Maudsley being dubbed "Hannibal the Cannibal." The authors spoke to a prison insider named Pete, who gave more insights about the infamous "strongbox" in which he resides.</p>

<p>Pete remarked on Maudsley's harsh reality, asserting: "The sad thing is, if he were living with someone else, he'd kill somebody else. It'd have been more humane to just put him down."</p>

<p>As per the news report, he was unequivocal in his belief that Maudsley would kill again if released. Levi and French delved into the myth of the "Perspex Cell," noting that "every contributor tells a different story".</p>

<p>"Pete, for example, described the box in the following terms: 'Metal with thick Perspex around them that looked out into the middle, and there was a metal door with thick Perspex on it and then an outer cell door," they said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The upcoming general elections will shape the composition of the House of Commons, ultimately determining the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In May 2024, to everyone's shock, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced snap polls for July 4. Now, that means electing the members to the House of Commons, which will then determine the next Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The Conservative Party, in power for 14 years, is facing a formidable challenge from the Labour Party.<br />
<br />
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is the head of government, responsible for advising the sovereign on the exercise of the royal prerogative, chairing the Cabinet and selecting its ministers.<br />
<br />
<strong>How a new PM is elected</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The UK holds a general election to choose Members of Parliament to represent their constituencies.</li>
	<li>The political party with the majority of seats in the House of Commons typically forms the government.</li>
	<li>The leader of the party with the most seats becomes the Prime Minister.</li>
	<li>The monarch (currently King Charles III) formally appoints the Prime Minister, usually the party leader with the most seats.</li>
	<li>The PM must maintain the confidence of the House of Commons, meaning they must command the support of a majority of MPs.</li>
	<li>If the PM loses the confidence of the House or their party loses a general election, they may resign or be replaced by a new PM.</li>
	<li>The office of the prime minister is not established by any statute or constitutional document but exists by a long-established convention.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Responsibilities of the Prime Minister</strong><br />
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom leads the government and the Cabinet, heading a major political party and typically controlling a majority in the House of Commons. This position wields significant legislative and executive powers.<br />
<br />
The Prime Minister holds various responsibilities, including serving as First Lord of the Treasury, Minister for the Civil Service, Minister for National Security and Minister for the Union. The Prime Minister's official residence and office is 10 Downing Street in London.<br />
<br />
The Prime Minister's key responsibilities include guiding law-making in the House of Commons, appointing and managing Cabinet members and ministers and coordinating government departments and the Civil Service. The PM also represents the UK at home and abroad, serving as public face and voice of His Majesty's Government.<br />
<br />
The Prime Minister also advises the sovereign, playing a central and influential role in the UK government. It includes appointing judges, officials and ecclesiastical leaders as well as conferring honours and peerages.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So far, fifty-seven people have served as UK Prime Minister, with Robert Walpole being the first (1721) and longest-serving (over 20 years), while Liz Truss was the shortest-serving (seven weeks).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Polling day&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
On July 4, voters will vote in person at polling stations from 7 am to 10 pm, or by post beforehand.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Photo ID will be required for in-person voting, a first for a UK general election. Once polls close at 10 pm, an exit poll will be announced, based on a survey of voters in around 150 constituencies across England, Scotland and Wales.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A top Pakistani court on Saturday directed the Prime Minister's Office to issue directives to the country's powerful intelligence agencies, including ISI, and ask them not to approach any judge or member of their staff to obtain favourable verdicts.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A top Pakistani court on Saturday directed the Prime Minister's Office to issue directives to the country's powerful intelligence agencies, including Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and ask them not to approach any judge or member of their staff to obtain favourable verdicts.</p>

<p>The intelligence agencies, especially ISI, Military Intelligence (MI) and Intelligence Bureau (IB) have been accused by several judges of pressuring them through different means to get desired verdicts, especially in the cases of the former prime minister and founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Imran Khan, his party leaders and supporters.</p>

<p>Almost all -- six of eight judges of the Islamabad High Court -- and a couple of judges of the anti-terrorism courts in Punjab have written to the chief justice of Pakistan and chief justice of the Lahore High Court (LHC), respectively, drawing their attention towards the intelligence agencies' open interference in judicial matters .</p>

<p>Some of them had complained that their family members were picked up by intelligence agencies to put pressure on them (judges).</p>

<p>Lahore High Court Justice Shahid Karim on Saturday issued written directions to the Prime Minister's Office on the complaint of an ATC judge in the Sargodha district of Punjab against harassment by the personnel of ISI.</p>

<p>"The prime minister is responsible and answerable for the actions of intelligence agencies as they come under his command. Instructions shall go out by the Prime Minister's Office to all civil or military agencies, including the ISI and IB, regarding strict directions not to approach or contact any judge whether of the superior judiciary or subordinate judiciary or any member of their staff for any purpose in the future," the judge said in his written order. Similar directions have also been issued for the Punjab police.</p>

<p>The court said the inspector general and police chief would be held personally responsible and contempt proceedings would be initiated in case of non-implementation of its order.</p>

<p>The LHC also directed ATC judges across Punjab to "download call-recording applications on their mobile phones to have the record of all such calls (from intelligence agencies) made to influence judicial proceedings." The Sargodha ATC judge was scheduled to hear the cases of some PTI leaders including opposition leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub when he was told that a senior ISI officer wanted to meet him at his chamber. As the judge refused, several harassment incidents targeted at his family took place in the following days.</p>

<p>PTI spokesperson Raoof Hasan said as part of a malicious and well-thought-out plot the mandate-thief government and its handlers are coercing the judiciary into making decisions of their choice.</p>

<p>"The trend of holding judges and their family members hostage and occupying the courts are being used as new tactics to prevent the courts from delivering justice, as such brazen interference in judicial affairs has already been described by six judges of the Islamabad High Court in their letter," he said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Keir Starmer, the Labour Party leader, is currently in poll position to become the UK Prime Minister after the July 4 elections. While PM Rishi Sunak's Conservative Party faces an uphill battle to retain power, the return of Nigel Farage to front-line politics has only added to his woes. Leading the right-wing Reform UK, the pro-Brexit campaigner has been buoyed by a strong presence on TikTok.<br />
<br />
The 60-year-old leader has become an unlikely breakout star on the app, with a five-second clip of him lip-synching Eminem's "Guess Who's Back?" pulling in over eight million views.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Nigel Farage, the leader of the Reform UK (formerly the Brexit Party), taunts the British PM Rishi Sunak with Eminem's "Without Me". <a href="https://t.co/Ym3uX0G2Vu">pic.twitter.com/Ym3uX0G2Vu</a></p>
— The Eminem Bible (@Shadyind) <a href="https://twitter.com/Shadyind/status/1801819347683577894?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 15, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Mr Farage's TikTok account has twice the followers as Labour, the Conservatives, and the Liberal Democrats combined. The Reform UK's TikTok presence stands out among political parties. With a following of 1,97,000, they far surpass their closest competitor, the Green Party.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The Tories, Labour, and the Lib Dems did not even have official channels on the app until recently, with parody accounts the first to surface when users searched for the big three. By establishing a presence on TikTok, Mr Farage and Reform UK tapped into a younger demographic, setting themselves apart from other political parties.<br />
<br />
The Conservatives top-performing clip, "this will change lives," features British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promoting his national service policy, It has 4.2 million views. However, Labour's 11-second response, a clever takedown using Cilla Black's "Surprise, Surprise," surpassed it with 5.1 million views.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">

<p>Nigel Farage's success on TikTok comes courtesy of 23-year-old Jack Anderton, a self-described "concerned citizen" and right-wing Zoomer. "Zoomer" refers to a member of Generation Z, specifically someone born between 1997 and 2012.<br />
<br />
Mr Anderton, a contractor for Farage, has been instrumental in creating content that resonates with a younger voter, as per Politico. His views align with Farage's, and he has expressed concerns about immigration and Britain's future. Mr Anderton represents the growing phenomenon of the "Zoomer Right," a Gen Z conservative movement gaining traction across Europe. Polling shows a large proportion of 18-24-year-olds plan to vote for Reform UK than 25-29-year-olds.<br />
<br />
Reform UK's emergence on TikTok has surprised even party insiders. Initially, their views were modest, but as the party grew nationwide, their TikTok views "rocketed way ahead of any other platform," says Matt Stevens, Reform's press officer.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This surge in popularity has been a pleasant surprise, given TikTok's predominantly young demographic. Mr Stevens believes this age group is "crying out for change" after years of Conservative rule, making them a key audience for Reform's message.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The prestigious Washington Post is in crisis, with pressure on from owner Jeff Bezos to change its money-losing ways.</p>

<p>The Post's managing editor abruptly resigned; a chosen successor withdrew under fire, and a boss has been targeted in the newspaper's columns.</p>

<p>At the heart of the storm is "WaPo"'s new CEO, Briton William Lewis, who was given a mission by Amazon founder Bezos when he appointed him last autumn.</p>

<p>Lewis was asked to turn around a newspaper that continues to pile up Pulitzer Prizes half a century after the Watergate scandal it instigated, but which has lost $77 million in 2023 despite job cuts and the disappearance of its Sunday supplement.</p>

<p>However, the former journalist, who made history in the late 2000s with a scoop on the expenses of British MPs when he was editor of the Daily Telegraph, is finding his position increasingly vulnerable.</p>

<p>For weeks now, revelations have multiplied about his role, when he was working for the Murdoch family's conservative media group about 12 years ago, in a scandal of illegal phone tapping by the tabloid The News of the World.</p>

<p>On Friday, Lewis was at the center of an investigation by his own journalists.</p>

<p>According to the Washington Post, he gave the go-ahead in 2011 for the destruction of thousands of emails, fueling suspicions that he was destroying evidence, which he denies.</p>

<p><strong>"Trump Bump"</strong></p>

<p>As the US presidential election approaches, the affair is poisoning the atmosphere at a long-vaunted newspaper that is "not doing well economically," Northeastern University journalism professor Dan Kennedy tells AFP.</p>

<p>The Post was among trusted news outlets that benefited from the upheaval that marked Trump's four years in the White House which ended with his loss to President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>The Post "was seen as a place that offered really tough, truth-telling coverage" of Trump, according to the professor.</p>

<p>Trump's departure from the White House meant fewer attention-grabbing stories to keep readers engaged.</p>

<p>"When Donald Trump left the White House, the Trump bump that helped a lot of newspapers disappeared," Kennedy said.</p>

<p>"And the Post was hit especially hard."</p>

<p>By the end of 2022, the Post would have 2.5 million subscribers compared with 3 million subscribers when Biden took office in early 2021, according to the Wall Street Journal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, rival New York Times has grown to more than 10 million subscribers, the fruit of a strategy to diversify into fun topics such as games, food, and lifestyle while still serving up hard news.</p>

<p>US media quoted Lewis as telling editorial staff in early June that he "can't sugarcoat it anymore" -- the paper has lost a lot of money and people's interest in its articles.</p>

<p><strong>Third News Team</strong></p>

<p>The day before that editorial meeting, Post journalists learned of the resignation of editor-in-chief Sally Buzbee.</p>

<p>Buzbee is said to have disagreed with Lewis's strategy to split the editorial department into three divisions: news, opinion, and a new third unit devoted to social media and service journalism.</p>

<p>The contours of this "third newsroom" remain unclear, but it seems aimed at reviving readership in a leap into the unknown for the newspaper.</p>

<p>Within the Murdoch family group, Lewis was the boss of the Wall Street Journal (2014-2020), another flagship of the US press.</p>

<p>However, articles in the New York Times and the Post pointed to questionable methods employed under his watch and that of former colleague Robert Winnett, whom Lewis chose to replace Buzbee.</p>

<p>Published allegations include paying informants, using data from hacked phones, or intermediaries using phony identification to get information.</p>

<p>Winnett withdrew from consideration for the post following those revelations.</p>

<p>Professor Kennedy believes Lewis has no choice but to leave the Post because he has lost the confidence of the team there.</p>

<p>"The body is rejecting the transfusion," Post veteran David Maraniss wrote on his Facebook page, adding he didn't know anyone who thinks the situation can stand as it is.</p>

<p>"If he can't inspire the staff (...) the Post will sail without direction and its best people will leave," Kennedy said of Lewis.</p>

<p>For many observers, the outcome of the crisis lies in the hands of billionaire Bezos, who bought the Post for $250 million in 2013.</p>

<p>So far, Bezos has backed his CEO.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden paid tribute to LGBTQ pioneers and British music legend Elton John performed his hits as the pair inaugurated on Friday a historical site in New York City celebrating the 1969 "Stonewall riots".</p>

<p>Appearing sharper than he did in a disastrous debate against Donald Trump the night before, 81-year-old Biden praised those who revolted on June 28, 1969 against yet another police raid on the Greenwich Village gay bar Stonewall Inn -- a foundational moment in the fight for LGBTQ rights.</p>

<p>"You marked a turning point for civil rights in America and inspired the hearts of millions around the world. To this day, Stonewall remains a symbol of a legacy of leadership for the LGBTQ+ community, especially trans women of color," he said.</p>

<p>"We remain in a battle for the soul of America," Biden added, before introducing John to the stage.</p>

<p>The six nights of the Stonewall riots marked the birth of the modern gay rights movement. Gay Pride was born in their wake.</p>

<p>The bar still exists and was designated a national monument by former president Barack Obama in 2016.</p>

<p>Since Friday, a small, free museum has been added where visitors can learn about the site's history.</p>

<p>"Just as Americans visit Independence Hall, Liberty Bell or the Statue of Liberty to embrace the history of our country, now we can pay homage to a place where we began to fight for our freedom, our rights, our equality," said Mark Segal, who was part of the revolt at Stonewall.</p>

<p>Elton John, himself an LGBTQ icon, told attendees: "The job isn't done."</p>

<p>The 77-year-old musician concluded a triumphant farewell tour last year, but returned to the stage on Friday to treat guests to a short recital.</p>

<p>He dedicated the classic "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me" to his friend Larry Kramer, one of the co-founders of the Act Up organization, and to "all the LGBTQ+ people that have gone before us and have paved the way for where we are now."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Within minutes of the conclusion of this week's presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, it became clear to many that the 81-year-old Biden may not be capable of winning the general election in November.</p>

<p>His inability to clearly communicate during the 90-minute debate earned harsh criticism from across the US political spectrum, most notably among Democrats.</p>

<p>Van Jones, a former official in the Obama administration and CNN analyst, <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/ex-obama-adviser-van-jones-045230154.html?guccounter=1">said</a> about Biden:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He had a test to meet tonight to restore confidence in the country and of the base, and he failed to do that.</p>

<p>We're still far from our convention. And there is time for this party to figure out a different way forward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Biden did land a few blows on his predecessor over Trump's various personal indiscretions and the January 6 2021 insurrection on the US Capitol, saying at one point, “you've got the morals of an alley cat”.</p>

<p>But it was not enough to persuade many sceptics that Biden is capable of fighting off the Trump campaign, not to mention performing the duties of US commander-in-chief and the hardest job in the world for another four years.</p>

<p>If polls over the weekend show Biden is losing support after his dreadful debate performance, which seems highly likely, the move to replace him as the Democrats' candidate will become even more intense and, ultimately, irresistible.</p>

<p>How would this play out in the next few weeks?</p>

<h2>Persuading Biden to step aside</h2>

<p>Even with the withering criticism from his party, Biden remains in control of his fate. He won <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/reminder-biden-has-3894-or-99-of-pledged-dnc-delegates/">99% of the pledged delegates</a> in the Democratic primary process earlier this year, meaning he is entitled to the nomination. As a result, any decision to move to a different candidate starts with Biden himself.</p>

<p>Absent dramatic health news or his removal under the 25th amendment to the Constitution, which <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4746165-speaker-johnson-cabinet-biden-25th-amendment/">allows for such action</a> by the vice president and a majority of his cabinet if the president is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office”, Biden would have to agree to step down as the party's nominee.</p>

<p>We should be realistic here: Biden is a very stubborn man. You don't get to be the president of the United States without being enormously self-confident. Biden may not be the smartest or most talented politician, but he is dogged and relentless in his ambitions.</p>

<p>He ran for president twice before his success in 2020. He didn't let a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/14/biden-nearly-died-an-aneurysm-risky-surgery-changed-his-life/">brain aneurysm</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/18/us/biden-admits-plagiarism-in-school-but-says-it-was-not-malevolent.html">plagiarism charges</a>, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/timeline-hunter-biden-legal-political-scrutiny/story?id=102293605">familial dramas</a> or <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/joe-biden-loses-first-wife-and-daughter-in-tragic-car-accident">personal tragedy</a> stop him seeking the highest office in the land. The day after the debate with Trump, he shook his fist at a campaign event in North Carolina and asserted, “When you get knocked down, you get back up”.</p>

<p>Persuading Biden to step down would require collaboration with his wife, First Lady Jill Biden. “Dr Jill”, as she is known, has taken a hands-on role in managing the president's daily life and public appearances.</p>

<p>There are very few Democratic Party elders who can be influential with the Bidens. The list probably starts and stops with former President Barack Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. If those two go to the first lady and forcefully urge Biden's withdrawal, it could be very difficult to resist.</p>

<h2>How could Biden save face?</h2>

<p>If Biden withdraws from the race before the Democratic convention in mid-August, his delegates could then vote for a new nominee at the event. Potential nominees include Vice President Kamala Harris, California Governor Gavin Newsom, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.</p>

<p>Notably, except for Harris, none of these candidates has been vetted publicly during the Democratic primary process for the world's most scrutinised job.</p>

<p>If Biden were to withdraw from the race after the convention, a special meeting of the members of the Democratic National Committee <a href="https://democrats.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2024-Call-for-Convention.pdf">would decide on the new nominee</a>. This committee includes around <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/can-democrats-replace-joe-biden-ballot-rcna159374">500 leading party members</a> from all US states and territories. (Whitmer is one of three vice chairs.)</p>

<p>A question senior Biden confidants might be asking themselves is, which scenario offers Biden a more graceful and successful exit?</p>

<p>He may want to anoint a successor and he would want to choose the method that offers him the most control. That may be the convention route, where he at least can claim the allegiance of his primary delegates.</p>

<p>This would require an announcement in the next few weeks. The sooner the better, so as to build as much public support as possible for a new nominee. Biden could salvage a significant amount of his reputation if his handpicked successor then defeated Trump in November.</p>

<p>Things look grim for Democrats right now, but in the long run, they may be in a strong position. Trump is very unpopular with most Americans. The 2021 insurrection remains a massive stain on his legacy. His vote ceiling among probable voters in November is still likely below 50%.</p>

<p>Veteran Obama strategist David Axelrod <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4745498-biden-debate-trump-challenge/">warned Republicans</a> after the debate:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If, for whatever reason, there's a change at the top of the ticket, you guys are in trouble with Donald Trump. Because the guy who was up there tonight is not a guy who's going to inspire people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A tough and nimble Democratic candidate who can communicate clearly could be very successful in November.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former First Lady Michelle Obama will replace President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee, US Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has predicted. Cruz claims Biden will be replaced at the Democratic National Convention in August, just three months before the election.</p>

<p>The prediction comes after the first presidential debate where Biden's performance was widely criticised by political analysts and news organisations. Some strategists are reportedly discussing ways to replace Biden on the ballot.</p>

<p>Democrats are reportedly “panicked” and actively discussing replacing Biden on the ticket, citing his “hoarse and halting voice”, “unclear” answers and “struggle” to finish his thoughts, according to the <a href="https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/dynamic/render?campaign_id=9&amp;emc=edit_nn_20240628&amp;instance_id=127433&amp;isViewInBrowser=true&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;paid_regi=1&amp;productCode=NN&amp;regi_id=217325255&amp;segment_id=170785&amp;te=1&amp;uri=nyt%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter%2F3a2a8a39-27c8-558a-90ce-8e95b2f8f337&amp;user_id=57b084e23490cb23c6e08fcd268739c6 ">NYT</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/27/biden-democrats-replacement-00165672 ">Politico</a>. Some are even “pushing for him to drop out of the race”,&nbsp; and “replacing him on the ticket.”</p>

<p>Cruz shared his thoughts on his podcast, saying the Democratic Party will likely replace&nbsp;Biden with Michelle Obama due to his poor debate performance. “The odds are north of 80% that the Democratic Party will remove Joe Biden from the ticket and replace him with Michelle Obama because Biden did so disastrously badly tonight that Democrats across the country are in utter freefall and complete panic,” he said.</p>

<p>After the presidential debate on Thursday, leaders from both parties share their thoughts on social media. While Biden supporters attributed his poor performance to a cold, Republicans were more critical.</p>

<p>Nikki Haley, former presidential candidate, posted on X, "Mark my words... Biden will not be the Democratic nominee. Republicans, get your guard up!"</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Mark my words….Biden will not be the Democrat nominee. Republicans, get your guard up!</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Vivek Ramaswamy, a potential VP pick for Trump, shared a series of critical tweets about Biden's debate performance. He suggested that the Democratic Party is using Biden as a "sacrificial lamb" and implied that they should replace him with a different nominee.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Meanwhile, former US President Barack Obama has come out in support of Joe Biden, urging Americans to remember the core values at stake in the election. "Bad debate nights happen, trust me, I know," Obama said, downplaying Biden's poor debate performance.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A low-key moderate and a protege of Iran's supreme leader are neck-and-neck in the vote count in snap presidential elections marked by voter apathy over economic hardships and social restrictions.</p>

<p>More than 14 million votes have been counted so far from Friday's vote, of which the sole moderate candidate Massoud Pezeshkian had won over 5.9 million votes and his hardline challenger former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili over 5.5 million, provisional results by the interior ministry showed.</p>

<p>Some insiders said the turnout was around 40%, lower than expected by Iran's clerical rulers, while witnesses told Reuters that polling stations in Tehran and some other cities were not crowded.</p>

<p>Iran's Tasnim news agency said a run-off election was "very likely" to pick the next president following the death of Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.</p>

<p>If no candidate wins at least 50% plus one vote from all ballots cast, including blank votes, a run-off between the top two candidates is held on the first Friday after the result is declared.</p>

<p>The election coincides with escalating regional tension due to the war between Israel and Iranian allies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as increased Western pressure on Iran over its fast-advancing nuclear programme.</p>

<p>While the election is unlikely to bring a major shift in the Islamic Republic's policies, its outcome could influence the succession to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's 85-year-old supreme leader, in power since 1989.</p>

<p>The clerical establishment sought a high turnout to offset a legitimacy crisis fuelled by public discontent over economic hardship and curbs on political and social freedom.</p>

<p>The next president is not expected to usher in any major policy shift on Iran's nuclear programme or support for militia groups across the Middle East, since Khamenei calls all the shots on top state matters.</p>

<p>However, the president runs the government day-to-day and can influence the tone of Iran's foreign and domestic policy.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian's views offer a contrast to those of Jalili, advocating detente with the West, economic reform, social liberalisation, and political pluralism.</p>

<p>A staunch anti-Westerner, Jalili's win would signal the possibility of an even more antagonistic turn in the Islamic Republic's foreign and domestic policy, analysts said.</p>

<p><strong>LIMITED CHOICES</strong></p>

<p>The election was a contest among a tightly controlled group of three hardline candidates and one low-profile moderate loyal to the supreme leader. A hardline watchdog body approved only six from an initial pool of 80 and two hardline candidates subsequently dropped out.</p>

<p>"Based on unconfirmed reports, the election is very likely heading to a second round ... Jalili and Pezeshkian will compete in a run-off election," Tasnim reported.</p>

<p>Critics of the clerical establishment say that low turnouts in recent years show the system's legitimacy has eroded. Turnout was 48% in the 2021 presidential election and a record low of 41% of people voted in a parliamentary election in March.</p>

<p>All candidates have vowed to revive the flagging economy, beset by mismanagement, state corruption, and sanctions re-imposed since 2018 after the U.S. ditched Tehran's nuclear pact.</p>

<p>"I think Jalili is the only candidate who raised the issue of justice, fighting corruption and giving value to the poor. ... Most importantly, he does not link Iran's foreign policy to the nuclear deal," said Farzan, a 45-year-old artist in the city of Karaj.</p>

<p><strong>DIVIDED VOTERS</strong></p>

<p>Pezeshkian, faithful to Iran's theocratic rule, is backed by the reformist faction that has largely been sidelined in Iran in recent years.</p>

<p>"We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behaviour toward women," Pezeshkian said after casting his vote.</p>

<p>He was referring to the death of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, in 2022 while in morality police custody for allegedly violating the mandatory Islamic dress code.</p>

<p>The unrest sparked by Amini's death spiralled into the biggest show of opposition to Iran's clerical rulers in years.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian attempted to revive the enthusiasm of reform-minded voters who have largely stayed away from the polls for the last four years as a mostly youthful population chafes at political and social curbs. He could also benefit from his rivals' failure to consolidate the hardline vote.</p>

<p>In the past few weeks, Iranians have made wide use of the hashtag #ElectionCircus on X, with some activists at home and abroad calling for a boycott, saying a high turnout would only serve to legitimise the Islamic Republic.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Venezuela's former presidential opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez has left for Spain in the wake of the South American country's contested election, Venezuelan and Spanish officials said on Saturday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Venezuela's former presidential opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez has left for Spain in the wake of the South American country's contested election, Venezuelan and Spanish officials said on Saturday night after a day of rising diplomatic tensions.</p>

<p>Gonzalez, 75, who ran against President Nicolas Maduro in July, left after "voluntarily seeking refuge in the Spanish embassy in Caracas several days ago," Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez posted on Instagram.</p>

<p>"Edmundo Gonzalez has taken off from Caracas heading to Spain on a Spanish Air Force plane," Spain's Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares posted on X, saying Madrid was responding to a request from Gonzalez.</p>

<p>Gonzalez's exit from Venezuela is the latest political development since the country's election on July 28. Democracies around the world have criticized the Venezuelan government's handling of the vote, which election officials and its top court say was won by Maduro.</p>

<p>Venezuela's opposition say the election resulted in a resounding victory for Gonzalez, and published vote tallies online that they say show he won.</p>

<p>This week prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Gonzalez in connection to the online publication of the tallies, accusing him of usurping functions, falsifying public documents and conspiracy, among other charges.</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, Venezuela's government revoked Brazil's authorization to represent Argentine interests in the country, including administering the embassy where six opposition figures are sheltering.</p>

<p>Venezuela broke relations with Argentina after the presidential election. Brazil, like Colombia and Mexico, has asked the Venezuelan government to publish the full results of the vote.</p>

<p>The government has not done so and the country's electoral authority said Maduro won re-election for a third term.</p>

<p>In a statement, Venezuela said the decision, effective immediately, was due to proof that the embassy was being used to plan assassination attempts against Maduro and Rodriguez.</p>

<p>Brazil said it had received the communication that its authorization had been revoked "with surprise." Argentina said it rejected the "unilateral" decision. Both countries urged Maduro to respect the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.</p>

<p>"Any attempt to invade or kidnap asylum seekers who remain in our official residence will be harshly condemned by the international community," Argentina said in a statement. "Actions like these reinforce the conviction that in Maduro's Venezuela, fundamental human rights are not respected."</p>

<p>A Brazilian diplomatic source said on Saturday afternoon that Venezuela had assured Brazil it would not invade the embassy.</p>

<p>In its statement, Brazil insisted it would remain in custody and defense of Argentine interests until Argentina indicated another state acceptable to Venezuela to do so.</p>

<p>"The Brazilian government highlights in this context, under the terms of the Vienna Conventions, the inviolability of the facilities of the Argentine diplomatic mission," it said, adding that it housed six Venezuelan asylum seekers, assets and archives.</p>

<p>The escalation in the spat between the South American countries was first reported by Reuters.</p>

<p>In March, six people sought asylum in the Argentine embassy in Caracas after a prosecutor ordered their arrest on charges including conspiracy. Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado has denied the allegations against her collaborators.</p>

<p>On Friday night, some opposition members in the Argentine residence reported on their X accounts that the building was under surveillance and had no electricity. They posted videos showing men dressed in black and patrols from the government intelligence agency, SEBIN.</p>

<p>Argentina's Foreign Ministry asked the International Criminal Court on Friday to issue an arrest warrant against Maduro and other senior government officials for events that occurred after the elections.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amina Sohail veers through heavy traffic to pick up her next passenger -- the sight of a woman riding a motorcycle drawing stares in Pakistan's megacity of Karachi. The 28-year-old is the first woman in her family to enter the workforce, a pattern emerging in urban households coming under increasing financial pressure in Pakistan.</p>

<p>"I don't focus on people, I don't speak to anyone or respond to the hooting, I do my work," said Sohail, who joined a local ride-hailing service at the start of the year, transporting women through the dusty back streets of the city.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Before, we would be hungry, now we get to eat at least two to three meals a day," she added.</p>

<p>The South Asian nation is locked in a cycle of political and economic crises, dependent on IMF bailouts and loans from friendly countries to service its debt.</p>

<p>Prolonged inflation has forced up the price of basic groceries such as tomatoes by 100 per cent. Electricity and gas bills have risen by 300 per cent compared to July last year, according to official data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sohail used to help her mother with cooking, cleaning and looking after her younger siblings, until her father, the family's sole earner, fell sick.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The atmosphere in the house was stressful," she said, with the family dependent on other relatives for money. "That's when I thought I must work." &nbsp;</p>

<p>"My vision has changed. I will work openly like any man, no matter what anyone thinks."</p>

<h3><strong>'Get her married'</strong></h3>

<p>Pakistan was the first Muslim nation to be led by a woman prime minister in the 1980s, women CEOs grace power lists in Forbes magazine, and they now make up the ranks of the police and military.</p>

<p>However, much of Pakistani society operates under a traditional code that requires women to have permission from their family to work outside of the home.</p>

<p>According to the United Nations, just 21 percent of women participate in Pakistan's work force, most of them in the informal sector and almost half in rural areas working in the fields.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I am the first girl in the family to work, from both my paternal and maternal side," said Hina Saleem, a 24-year-old telephone operator at a leather factory in Korangi, Karachi's largest industrial area.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">

<p>The move, supported by her mother after her father died, was met with resistance from her extended family.</p>

<p>Her younger brother was warned that working could lead to socially unacceptable behaviour, such as finding a husband of her choice.</p>

<p>"My uncles said 'get her married'," she told AFP. "There was lots of pressure on my mother."</p>

<p>At the changeover of shifts outside the leather factory, workers arrive in painted buses decorated with chinking bells, with a handful of women stepping out amid the crowd of men.</p>

<p>Nineteen-year-old Anum Shahzadi, who works in the same factory inputting data, was encouraged by her parents to enter the workforce after completing high school, unlike generations before her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"What is the point of education if a girl can't be independent," said Shahzadi, who now contributes to the household alongside her brother.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bushra Khaliq, executive director for Women In Struggle for Empowerment (WISE) which advocates for political and economic rights for women, said that Pakistan was "witnessing a shift" among urban middle class women.</p>

<p>"Up until this point, they had been told by society that taking care of their homes and marriage were the ultimate objective," she told AFP.</p>

<p>"But an economic crunch and any social and economic crises bring with them a lot of opportunities."&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>'We are companions'</strong></h3>

<p>Farzana Augustine, from Pakistan's minority Christian community, earned her first salary last year at the age of 43 after her husband lost his job during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>"My wife had to take over," Augustine Saddique explained to AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"But it is nothing to be sad about, we are companions and are running our house together."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sprawling port metropolis of Karachi, officially home to 20 million people but likely many millions more, is the business centre of Pakistan.</p>

<p>It pulls in migrants and entrepreneurs from across the country with the promise of employment and often acts as a bellwether for social change.</p>

<p>Nineteen-year-old Zahra Afzal moved to Karachi to live with her uncle four years ago, after the death of her parents, leaving her small village in central-eastern Pakistan to work as a childminder.</p>

<p>"If Zahra was taken by other relatives, she would have been married off by now," her uncle Kamran Aziz told AFP, from their typical one room home where bedding is folded away in the morning and cooking is done on the balcony.</p>

<p>"My wife and I decided we would go against the grain and raise our girls to survive in the world before settling them down."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Afzal beams that she is now an example for her sister and cousin: "My mind has become fresh."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden has spent a significant amount of time on vacation during his term in office, revealed a recent analysis by the Republican National Committee. According to the data, the 81-year-old has taken 532 vacation days in less than four years, which accounts for approximately 40 per cent of his time in office.</p>

<p><meta charset="utf-8" /></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Biden spent today — his 16th straight day on vacation — lounging on the beach.<br />
<br />
He has spent a total of 532 days (40.3% of his presidency) on vacation.<br />
<br />
Who's running the country? <a href="https://t.co/YIStPQR3Vl">pic.twitter.com/YIStPQR3Vl</a></p>
— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) <a href="https://twitter.com/RNCResearch/status/1830025501190373610?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 31, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>This means that President Biden has accumulated more vacation days in a shorter period than the average American worker would in nearly five decades. The average American receives 11 days of vacation per year, making President Biden's vacation time equivalent to about 48 years' worth of vacation days for the average citizen.</p>

<p>Critics argue that the President's extensive vacation time is inappropriate, especially during a time of global uncertainty and domestic challenges. Mark Paoletta, former general counsel of the White House budget office under President Donald Trump, stated, “The image of Biden fast asleep and lying flat on his back in his chair at the beach while America and the world is on fire will define the Biden presidency,” as per the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/07/us-news/biden-took-48-years-worth-of-vacation-while-president/ ">NY Post</a>.</p>

<p>Critics have also pointed to issues such as inflation, border security and international conflicts, suggesting that the President should be more focused on addressing these concerns.</p>

<p>However, presidential aides maintain that President Biden, like his predecessors, works remotely and remains on call even when on vacation. Despite this, some have questioned the frequency and duration of his breaks, with Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-Staten Island/Brooklyn) jokingly suggesting that he should take more time off.</p>

<p>A comparison of President Biden's vacation time to that of previous presidents reveals that he has taken more time off than his predecessors. While former US President Donald Trump spent 26 per cent of his presidency on personal trips, President Biden's 40 per cent out-of-office ratio surpasses that. In contrast, Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama vacationed for just 11 per cent of their two-term presidencies, and Jimmy Carter took only 79 days' worth of breaks during his single term.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, 26, was shot and killed by Israeli troops when she was taking part in a protest against settlement expansion in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli troops shot and killed a Turkish-American woman who had been taking part in a protest against settlement expansion in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Friday, Palestinian and Turkish officials said.</p>

<p>The White House said it was deeply disturbed by the death of Aysenur Ezgi Eygi and called on Israel to investigate. Turkey's foreign ministry said she was shot in the head, and blamed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government for her death.</p>

<p>Palestinian officials described her as a 26-year-old activist from Seattle who held US and Turkish citizenship.</p>

<p>Eygi had recently graduated from the University of Washington in Seattle, the school's president, Ana Mari Cauce, said in a statement describing the news of her death as "awful" and saying Eygi had a "positive influence" on other students.</p>

<p>She studied psychology and Middle Eastern languages and cultures at the university, her family said in a statement late on Friday that was shared by the pro-Palestinian organization Institute of Middle East Understanding.</p>

<p>Israel's military said its troops had fired toward a male "main instigator" who posed a threat by hurling rocks at soldiers.</p>

<p>The military was looking into reports that a female foreign national "was killed as a result of shots fired in the area. The details of the incident and the circumstances in which she was hit are under review."</p>

<p>There was no immediate comment on the incident from Netanyahu's office.</p>

<p>Fouad Nafaa, head of Rafidia Hospital in Nablus, told Reuters that Eygi had arrived there in critical condition with a serious head injury.</p>

<p>"We tried to perform a resuscitation operation on her, but unfortunately she died," he said.</p>

<p>The Palestinian Authority's official news agency, WAFA, said the incident occurred during a regular protest march by activists in Beita, a village near Nablus that has seen repeated attacks on Palestinians by Jewish settlers.</p>

<p>Eygi's family described her as a "fiercely passionate human rights activist" who had recently participated in college campus protests against U.S. support for Israel's war in Gaza. The statement called on President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to pursue an independent U.S. probe into her killing.</p>

<p>"I begged her not to go (to the West Bank), but she had this deep conviction that she wanted to participate in the tradition of bearing witness to the oppression of people and their dignified resilience," Aria Fani, an assistant professor of Middle Eastern languages and cultures at the University of Washington, told the Guardian.</p>

<p>The university president said, "Aysenur was a peer mentor in psychology who helped welcome new students to the department and provided a positive influence in their lives."</p>

<h3><strong>'DEEPLY DISTURBED'</strong></h3>

<p>White House's National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said Washington was "deeply disturbed by the tragic death of an American citizen" in the West Bank on Friday.</p>

<p>"We have reached out to the Government of Israel to ask for more information and request an investigation into the incident," Savett said in a statement.</p>

<p>U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen said Eygi was the third American killed in the West Bank since October 7, when Hamas attack on Israel sparked the war in Gaza and a resurgence of West Bank violence.</p>

<p>The "Biden Administration has not been doing enough to pursue justice and accountability on their behalf", said Van Hollen, a Democrat like Biden and Harris, who sits on the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee. "If the Netanyahu Government will not pursue justice for Americans, the U.S. Department of Justice must."</p>

<p>Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan condemned Eygi's death, saying in a post on social media that Turkey "will continue to work in every platform to halt Israel's policy of occupation and genocide". Israel denies its actions in occupied Palestinian territories amount to genocide.</p>

<p>In a separate incident on Friday near Beita, in the village of Qaryut, a 13-year-old girl was killed by Israeli gunfire, Palestinian health officials said, after settlers attacked the village.</p>

<p>WAFA quoted the girl's father as saying she was in their home when it was hit by gunfire. The Israeli military said it was investigating after its troops had fired in the air to disperse what it described as violent confrontations between dozens of settlers and Palestinians in the area.</p>

<p>A rise in violent attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians in the West Bank has stirred anger among Western allies of Israel, including the United States, which has imposed sanctions on some Israelis involved in the settler movement.</p>

<p>Several weeks ago around 100 settlers attacked the village of Jit in the northern West Bank, drawing worldwide condemnation and an Israeli government promise of swift action against anyone found guilty of violence.</p>

<p>Since the 1967 Middle East war, Israel has occupied the West Bank of the Jordan River, which Palestinians want as the core of an independent state. Israel has built settlements there that most countries deem illegal, which Israel disputes citing historical and biblical ties to the land.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A top Iranian military commander has said his country had, some time ago, hit 12 Israeli vessels north of the Indian Ocean and elsewhere in response to Israel's attacks on 14 Iranian ships, according to state media. Hossein Salami, chief commander of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), made the remarks on Saturday during a meeting in the capital Tehran between Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and commanders of the Khatam al-Anbiya Construction Headquarters, an Iranian firm controlled by the IRGC.</p>

<p>He was detailing a maritime battle between Iran and Israel that occurred sometime after the reimposition of US sanctions on Tehran in 2018, though he did not specify the exact dates of the battle or related events, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>According to Salami, Israel hit 14 Iranian ships to disrupt Iran's oil exports.</p>

<p>"Initially, we did not realise who or which country was targeting the ships, but we eventually found out that it was Israel that had done it in a secretive and vague manner."</p>

<p>"North of the Indian Ocean and in different places, we hit 12 Israeli ships. After hitting the fifth vessel, they raised their hands in surrender and said they would cease the war between the ships," he said.</p>

<p>"When we struck (captured) the fifth Israeli ship, they raised their hands (in surrender) and agreed to cease the naval confrontation," Salami said during a visit to the Khatam al-Anbiya Construction Headquarters.</p>

<p>"They targeted 14 of our ships to prevent our oil from being exported. We didn't know who was behind it at first because it was done so covertly, but we eventually figured it out: the Zionist regime. We targeted 12 of their ships, and when we had the fifth, they raised their hands (in surrender) and declared the naval confrontation over."</p>

<p>He further said, "The British seized our ship in Gibraltar, and we seized the Stena Impero ship in exchange, prompting their surrender. They seized two of our ships in Greece, we took two of theirs, and they eventually surrendered."</p>

<p>General Salami reflected on the past six years, marked by sanctions, the Covid-19 pandemic, and political isolation attempts.</p>

<p>"Our enemy placed us at the crossroads of sanctions, the Covid-19 pandemic, (former US President Donald) Trump (who was no less harmful than Covid-19), the threat of military operations, and pressure for political isolation," Salami said, recounting challenges such as the assassination of Lietenant General Qassem Soleimani and the impact of economic sanctions.</p>

<p>"They tried to politically isolate us. We needed to create deterrence against these threats in multiple directions. First, we needed to secure the shipping lanes. When the Americans attempted to seize one of our ships, our forces prevented it, and the Americans were left humiliated. Following this, the enforcement of sanctions began to deteriorate," he added.</p>

<p>Additionally, he praised the IRGC's success in countering extremist threats abroad and safeguarding Iranian oil tankers, noting that American threats failed to materialise after the IRGC simulated an operation to capture a US tanker.</p>

<p>"We succeeded in closing off all the paths the enemy had opened against us, and today the safest shipping routes are those used by Iranian ships. The Americans threatened to seize two of our oil tankers as they headed to Venezuela. I went out with General Tangsiri and simulated an operation to capture an American tanker, which we announced over the radio. When the Americans saw this, our tankers arrived safely," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Gerald Ford's catastrophic Soviet gaffe to Ronald Reagan's witty remark about his age and Joe Biden's infamous implosion, US presidential debates have featured jaw-dropping moments.</p>

<p>Here are some of the most memorable in modern US politics.</p>

<h3><strong>Kennedy-Nixon, September 26, 1960</strong></h3>

<p>It was the first televised debate of its kind, when broadcasts were in black-and-white, and it established the importance of a politician's public image. Republican Richard Nixon looked poised to win the election, having served two terms as vice president under Dwight Eisenhower.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">"I'm Bill Shadel ABC News...The 2 candidates will not be sharing same platform. In NY John F Kennedy. Separated by 3,000 miles in L.A. studio, Richard Nixon. Joined for discussion by network of electronic facilities which permits each candidate to see &amp; hear the other"<br />
10/13/1960 <a href="https://t.co/9GottJMbPP">pic.twitter.com/9GottJMbPP</a></p>
— Howard Mortman (@HowardMortman) <a href="https://twitter.com/HowardMortman/status/1314194594737926146?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2020</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>But the debate did not go well for him. Nixon refused to wear makeup and appeared pale and sweaty in front of more than 66 million viewers, while young Massachusetts senator John F Kennedy looked tanned and relaxed. While Nixon addressed the moderator, Kennedy looked at the camera, speaking directly to his voters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How much the debate visuals pushed the needle is disputed, but Kennedy went on to defeat Nixon at the polls.</p>

<h3><strong>Ford-Carter, October 6, 1976</strong></h3>

<p>The first debate between Republican president Gerald Ford and Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter was marked by a 27-minute loss of audio. The second debate didn't go well for Ford either when he made a gaffe that arguably cost him the presidency.</p>

<p>At the height of the Cold War, Ford uttered that "there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration," even though the Soviet Union had troops deployed across the Eastern bloc.</p>

<p>Six days passed before Ford explained himself, saying he spoke not of the literal military presence but meant that people's spirits there hadn't been crushed.</p>

<h3><strong>Reagan-Mondale, October 21, 1984</strong></h3>

<p>Republican president Ronald Reagan was 73 when he ran for a second term against 56-year-old Walter Mondale. But he turned his age into his strength with a witty answer that went down in history.</p>

<p>"I will not make age an issue of this campaign," Reagan said when asked whether he was fit for office. "I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience."</p>

<h3><strong>Bush-Clinton-Perot, October 15, 1992</strong></h3>

<p>The second presidential debate in the 1992 race pitted incumbent president George Bush against both his future successor Bill Clinton and Ross Perot, an independent candidate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bush was caught on camera looking at his watch while Clinton talked to an audience member during a town hall debate, a move that cost Bush dearly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Years later, Bush admitted he hated debates. "Maybe that's why I was looking at it -- 'Only 10 more minutes of this crap.'"</p>

<h2><strong>Obama-Romney, October 22, 2012</strong></h2>

<p>During a debate against president Barack Obama, Republican challenger Mitt Romney lamented that the US Navy had fewer ships presently than it did in 1916.</p>

<p>"Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed," Obama retorted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go under water, nuclear submarines."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Obama's comments went viral.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump-Clinton, October 9, 2016</strong></h3>

<p>The second debate of the 2016 US presidential election pitting Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was particularly vicious.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coming shortly after the release of a video in which Trump was heard boasting that his fame allowed him to grope women, the Republican billionaire went after his opponent's husband, former president Bill Clinton, accusing him of being "so abusive to women."</p>

<p>Trump also vowed to have Hillary Clinton investigated over her use of a private email account when she was secretary of state.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country," Clinton said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump shot back: "Because you'd be in jail."</p>

<h3><strong>Trump-Biden, September 29, 2020</strong></h3>

<p>The first debate of the 2020 presidential election, featuring Trump and Democrat Joe Biden, devolved into shouting and insults.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With Trump constantly interrupting him, Biden snapped, saying, "Will you shut up, man?"&nbsp;</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="The then US President Donald Trump (L) and Democratic Presidential candidate Joe Biden exchange arguments during the first presidential debate at Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, on September 29, 2020" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/agq0qis_donald-trump-joe-biden_625x300_08_September_24.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="The then US President Donald Trump (L) and Democratic Presidential candidate Joe Biden exchange arguments during the first presidential debate at Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, on September 29, 2020" /></div>

</div>

<p>The Democrat also called his opponent a "clown" and "Putin's puppy."</p>

<p>Trump for his part kept evading the question of whether he would recognize the results of the election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Powerless to control the two candidates, the debate moderator, Fox News journalist Chris Wallace, later described feeling "desperation."</p>

<h3><strong>Trump-Biden, June 27, 2024</strong></h3>

<p>Organized an unprecedented four months ahead of this year's November vote, the June debate was supposed to give Biden, 81, a chance to shore up concerns about his age.</p>

<p>But it was a debacle for the Democrat, who repeatedly lost his train of thought, stared blankly and spoke at times incoherently and with a raspy voice.</p>

<p>The dismal performance set the stage for Biden to eventually drop out of the race -- passing the torch to Trump's new challenger, Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Harris and Trump will now debate on Tuesday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump will face off in a debate for the first time on Tuesday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump will face off in a debate for the first time on Tuesday, each seeking an edge in what has become a neck-and-neck race for the White House. After weeks of back-and-forth on the where, when and how of the debate, US broadcaster ABC -- which is hosting the event -- announced the final rules of the contest, as agreed to by the two campaigns, this week.</p>

<p>Here are the major takeaways.</p>

<h3><strong>When and where to watch Trump vs Harris debate</strong></h3>

<p>The debate between <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-elections-2024-donald-trump-sounds-dark-tone-at-rally-kamala-harris-says-ready-for-debate-6514936" target="_blank">Donald Trump and Kamala Harris</a> will take place at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia at 9:00 pm local time Tuesday (0100 GMT Wednesday,) and will be aired live. There will be no audience present in the room.</p>

<p>The event will be moderated by ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis, and will run for 90 minutes of debate time, with two commercial breaks.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Muted mics in Donald Trump vs Kamala Harris debate</strong><strong>?</strong></h3>

<p>The issue of whether <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-vs-kamala-harris-the-battle-over-hot-mics-heats-up-ahead-of-key-debate-6435273" target="_blank">microphones would be muted</a> -- as they were during a previous debate between US President Joe Biden and Trump -- was a contentious one, with each side accusing the other of cowardice over the question.</p>

<p>ABC has announced that each candidate's microphone will only be live for when it is their turn to speak, and muted when the time belongs to the other candidate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Only moderators will be allowed to ask questions, and no topics or questions will be shared in advance with the candidates.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Who speaks when?</strong></h3>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/im-going-to-let-her-talk-donald-trump-on-debate-with-kamala-harris-6494910" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a> and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-agrees-to-debate-with-kamala-harris-outlines-specific-rules-6432983" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a> will not offer opening statements. They will be allotted two minutes to answer each question, with two minutes granted to their opponent for a rebuttal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There will be an additional minute for "a follow-up, clarification, or response," according to the rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the end of the debate, each candidate will offer a two-minute closing statement, with Trump to go last, as per the results of a virtual coin toss.</p>

<h3><strong>No props</strong></h3>

<p>Candidates will stand behind podiums through the entire length of the debate, with no props or pre-written notes allowed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump and Harris will each be given a pen, a pad of paper, and a bottle of water.</p>

<p>Campaign staff will not be allowed to speak or interact with the candidates during the commercial breaks.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is no plan to change the national anthem of Bangladesh, the country's Religious Affairs Advisor AFM Khalid Hossain said on Saturday.</p>

<p>“The interim government will not do anything to create controversy,” Hossain told the media after visiting the Islamic Foundation in Rajshahi and attending a gathering of dignitaries.</p>

<p>This comes after Abdullahil Amaan Azmi, the son of former Ameer of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami Ghulam Azam, earlier this week called for a change in the country's national anthem and Constitution.</p>

<p>He said: "I leave the matter of the national anthem to this government. The current national anthem we have is contrary to the existence of our independent Bangladesh. It reflects the time of the Bengal partition and the merging of the two Bengals. How can an anthem created to unite the two Bengals become the national anthem of an independent Bangladesh? This anthem was imposed on us by India in 1971. Many songs could serve as a national anthem. The government should form a new commission to select a new national anthem." Hossain said Bangladesh, as a neighbouring country, wants a friendly relationship with India.</p>

<p>“We have heard reports of attacks on our cricket team in India. Since the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) is in charge, they will decide on the necessary course of action,” Dhaka Tribune quoted the advisor as saying.</p>

<p>Terming attacks on mosques, temples, and shrines as "heinous", Hossain said: “Those who attack places of worship are enemies of humanity. They are criminals, and they will be prosecuted under existing laws.” Hossain further said local citizens as well as madrasa students will guard temples during the Durga Puja to prevent any attack or sabotage.</p>

<p>“Madrasa students were never involved in terrorism. That was propaganda and conspiracy by the previous government.”The advisor said that after the change in government, there had been attacks on the houses of some members of the Hindu community just as Muslim houses were attacked and this should not be viewed differently.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has alleged that several prominent right-wing social media influencers were unknowingly part of a Russian operation designed to sway the 2024 US presidential elections, CNN reported. The influencers, who collectively reach millions of Americans, were allegedly used as "mouthpieces" for Russian propaganda without being aware of the foreign influence behind their financial support.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/07/media/tenet-media-russia-rt-tim-pool-dave-rubin-lauren-chen/index.html" target="_blank">According to the report</a>, court documents unsealed this week revealed that Russian state media funnelled nearly $10 million through a Tennessee-based online media company, identified by CNN as Tenet Media. The company employed well-known right-wing commentators such as Tim Pool, Benny Johnson, Lauren Southern, Tayler Hansen, Matt Christiansen, and Dave Rubin. While these individuals were not directly accused of wrongdoing, the indictment has shed light on how they may have unknowingly advanced Russian interests.</p>

<p>Two employees of Russian state media were charged with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) and money laundering. The DOJ states that Russia's goal was to push narratives that aligned with Kremlin objectives, such as promoting domestic political division, weakening US support for Ukraine, and boosting conservative figures like Donald Trump.</p>

<p>These individuals, unaware of their role in Russian operations, were described in Cold War terms as "useful idiots."</p>

<h2><strong>Tenet Media</strong></h2>

<p>Tenet Media, launched last year, presents itself as a platform for "heterodox views" on Western political and cultural issues. It was founded in 2022 by conservative Canadian YouTuber Lauren Chen and her husband Liam Donovan. The company has not responded to the allegations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Its roster includes several former mainstream journalists turned independent creators, such as Tim Pool, who previously worked with Vice, and Benny Johnson, formerly of BuzzFeed and the Independent Journal Review. The outlet has grown in influence, hosting shows featuring far-right personalities and interviewing high-profile figures like Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Though the influencers claimed to retain full editorial control over their content, the DOJ alleges that the content they produced served Russia's interests. According to court documents, Russian state media employees from RT sought to exploit these influencers' vast audiences by amplifying pro-Russian narratives, including criticisms of US support for Ukraine and divisive discussions on LGBTQ issues.</p>

<p>While none of the commentators have been charged, the DOJ alleges that they were paid by Kremlin-controlled sources to promote content that benefitted Russian interests. At least three of the influencers have been contacted by the FBI for voluntary interviews.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What The Influencers said</strong></h2>

<p>Tim Pool, host of The Culture War Podcast, responded to the allegations by saying that he was a victim. "If these allegations prove true, I as well as the other personalities and commentators were deceived and are victims. I cannot speak for anyone else at the company as to what they do or to what they are instructed," Pool told his 2.1 million followers on X.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

Should these allegations prove true, I as well as the other personalities and commentators were deceived and are victims. I cannot speak for anyone else at the company as to what they do or to what they are instructed…</p>

<p>"Disturbed by the allegations in today's indictment, which make clear that myself and other influencers were victims in this alleged scheme," said Benny Johnson who has 2.7 million followers on X.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Dave Rubin, host of The Rubin Report, claimed that his show with Tenet Media ended months ago. "I and other commentators were the victims of this scheme. I knew absolutely nothing about any of this fraudulent activity," Rubin told his 1.5 million followers on X.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Statement on the DOJ indictment:<br />

<h2><strong>DOJ Action&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>The DOJ has charged two RT employees, Kostiantyn Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva, with conspiracy to commit money laundering and violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act, the BBC reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The indictment accuses these individuals of overseeing funding and editorial operations while secretly directing Tenet Media's output to advance Russian interests. Despite the influencers' claims of independence, federal prosecutors assert that much of the content was strategically aligned with Russian efforts to amplify divisions within the US.</p>

<p>The indictment also alleges elaborate lengths to which the Russian operation went, including the creation of a fake Hungarian investor to mask RT's involvement and the high salaries paid to the influencers allegedly receiving up to $100,000 per video.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CEO of Telegram Pavel Durov has spoken for the first time since his arrest last month. The Russian-born CEO was arrested in Paris on charges of publishing extremist and illegal content.</p>

<p>Calling his arrest "surprising" and the charges against him "misguided", Durov promised that changes will be brought to some features in Telegram features in order to "improve" the app's efforts to prevent criminals from misusing the platform.</p>

<p>The 39-year-old was arrested after he was accused of failing to remove illegal content like child pornography from Telegram. His bail was set at $5.6 million and he is required to report to a police station twice a week.</p>

<p>French authorities said Telegram did not reply to their requests for information regarding suspicious criminal activity on its app, including drug trafficking.</p>

<p>Mr Durov argued that a CEO should not be responsible if a platform is "potentially abused". Stating that building technology is "hard as it is", he said that if CEOs were held responsible, no one would ever innovate.</p>

<p>"Using laws from the pre-smartphone era to charge a CEO with crimes committed by third parties on the platform he manages is a misguided approach. Building technology is hard enough as it is. No innovator will ever build new tools if they know they can be personally held responsible for potential abuse of those tools," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Durov also spoke of his arrest saying he was questioned by police for four days. "I was told I may be personally responsible for other people's illegal use of Telegram because the French authorities didn't receive responses from Telegram," he said, adding that if they wanted to ask for his help, they could have just "Googled Telegram EU address".</p>

<p>While arguing that the level of moderation on Telegram is low compared to other social media or messaging apps, Mr Durov stated that the platform did remove objectionable content.</p>

<p>"Claims in some media that Telegram is some sort of anarchic paradise are absolutely untrue. We take down millions of harmful posts and channels every day. However, we hear voices saying that it's not enough," he said.</p>

<p>He also announced the removal of some features like its blogging tool Telegraph</p>

<p>"While 99.999% of Telegram users have nothing to do with crime, the 0.001% involved in illicit activities create a bad image for the entire platform, putting the interests of our almost billion users at risk," he said.</p>

<p>Citing examples of Iran and Russia, both regimes that he claimed sought to censor and surveil their citizens, the CEO said Telegram was ready to leave any country that abused the app users' right to privacy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Multiple people have been shot along a highway in the US state of Kentucky, authorities said Saturday, as authorities in the southern state hunted for the perpetrator.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kentucky police were searching rugged terrain near a national forest for a suspect after at least seven people were wounded by gunfire while driving down the rural stretch of an interstate highway, officials said on Saturday evening.</p>

<p>The incident began just before 6 p.m. (1000 GMT) about nine miles outside of the town of London, when officers responded to reports of gunshots directed at vehicles traveling on Interstate 75 in Laurel County. The shots came from a wooded area or an overpass, according to local media reports.</p>

<p>Mayor Randall Weddle of London, a small city of about 8,000 near the Daniel Boone National Forest, about 90 miles (145 km) south of Lexington, said in a post on Facebook that seven people were injured, including some who were shot. He said there were no known fatalities. Police offered no further details about the number or nature of any casualties.</p>

<p>Weddle asked everyone in the area to "keep your doors locked while this guy is on the loose."</p>

<p>A stretch of highway near the Kentucky shootings was closed but later reopened even though the suspect was still at large.</p>

<p>About three hours after the shooting, the Laurel County Sheriff's Office named a "person of interest" who it said was "armed and dangerous" and cautioned the public not to approach the 32-year-old man.</p>

<p>"The below individual, Joseph A Couch, is a Person of Interest in the shooting that occurred at the Exit 49/KY-909 area. If you have any information regarding the whereabouts or location of this individual, please contact the London-Laurel County 911 Center by calling 911 or 606-878-7000.&nbsp; ***DO NOT ATTEMPT TO APPROACH***. Joseph A Couch is a 32-year-old white male approximately 5'10 weighing approximately 154lbs," police posted on Facebook.</p>

<p>Agents, from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives have been called in to assist the Kentucky State Police and local law enforcement, the agency posted on X, calling it a "critical incident."</p>

<p>London is a small city of about 8,000 residents near the Daniel Boone National Forest, about 90 miles south of Lexington.</p>

<p>The shooting comes days after two students and two teachers were killed, and nine others wounded, at a high school in Winder, Georgia high school. A 14-year-old student and his father, suspected of giving his son access to the gun used in the shooting, were charged in the shootings, which took place soon after the school year opened.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday Islamic countries should form an alliance against what he called "the growing threat of expansionism" from Israel, drawing a rebuke from the Israeli foreign minister.</p>

<p>He made the comment after describing what Palestinian and Turkish officials said was the killing by Israeli troops of a Turkish-American woman taking part in a protest on Friday against settlement expansion in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>"The only step that will stop Israeli arrogance, Israeli banditry, and Israeli state terrorism is the alliance of Islamic countries," Erdogan said at an Islamic schools' association event near Istanbul.</p>

<p>He said recent steps that Turkey has taken to improve ties with Egypt and Syria are aimed at "forming a line of solidarity against the growing threat of expansionism," which he said also threatened Lebanon and Syria.</p>

<p>Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said in a statement that Erdogan's remark was "a dangerous lie and incitement," and that the Turkish leader has been working for years with Iran to undermine the region's moderate Arab regimes.</p>

<p>Erdogan hosted Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Ankara this week and they discussed the Gaza war and ways to further repair their long-frozen ties during what was the first such presidential visit in 12 years.</p>

<p>Ties between them started thawing in 2020 when Turkey began diplomatic efforts to ease tensions with estranged regional rivals, including the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>Erdogan said in July that Turkey would extend an invitation to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad "any time" for possible talks to restore relations between the two neighbours, who severed ties in 2011 after the outbreak of the Syrian civil war.</p>

<p>Israel's military said after Friday's incident that it was looking into reports that a female foreign national "was killed as a result of shots fired in the area. The details of the incident and the circumstances in which she was hit are under review."</p>

<p>There was no immediate comment on Friday's incident from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX will launch its first uncrewed Starships to Mars in two years when the next Earth-Mars transfer window opens, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said in a post on social media platform X on Saturday.</p>

<p>"These will be uncrewed to test the reliability of landing intact on Mars," Musk said, adding if those landings go well, his space company will launch its first crewed flights to Mars in four years.</p>

<p>"Flight rate will grow exponentially from there, with the goal of building a self-sustaining city in about 20 years," the billionaire said.</p>

<p>In April, Musk, who founded SpaceX in 2002, said the first uncrewed starship to land on Mars would be within five years, with the first people landing on Mars within seven years.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian shelling killed five people in Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine on Saturday, officials said.</p>

<p>Three people were killed and four injured in the town of Kostyantynivka, Donetsk region governor Vadym Filashkin said, while two men in their 50s were reported killed in shelling near the town of Toretsk about 20 km (12 miles) to the southeast.</p>

<p>Filashkin said in a post on the Telegram social media channel that three men aged between 24 and 69 were killed and a multi-storey block, administrative building and shop were damaged in the attack on Kostyantynivka.</p>

<p>Three others were lightly wounded and received medical treatment, he said. Suspilne public broadcaster quoted Anastasiia Medvedeva, a spokesperson for Donetsk prosecutor's office, as saying the fourth injured person was a 57-year-old woman who suffered a shrapnel wound and a head injury.</p>

<p>In separate shelling, Suspilne quoted Medvedeva as saying a man aged 52 and a man aged 53 were killed just outside Toretsk, a focus of recent Russian offences also in Donetsk region.</p>

<p>Kostyantynivka, which before the war was an industrial town of around 70,000 people, has seen many of its residents leave as the frontline has moved closer through the 30-month Russian invasion. It has been hit regularly by missiles, bombs and artillery.</p>

<p>In August, authorities announced a compulsory evacuation of families with children from the city due to the danger posed by Russia's advances.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump delivered a dark speech to a rally Saturday in the US swing state of Wisconsin, while Democrat Kamala Harris hunkered down in another crucial battleground, Pennsylvania, preparing for next week's televised presidential debate.</p>

<p>Trump and Harris are now essentially tied in the polls, with the Republican again shrugging off a mountain of scandals that would have sunk candidates of the past.</p>

<p>At the rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin, the former president delivered his characteristic stream of insults, exaggerations and outright falsehoods, painting a picture of an apocalyptic America run by a leftist dictatorship -- a "rogue regime."</p>

<p>Under President Joe Biden and Vice President Harris, "your government imported murderers, child predators and serial rapists from all over the planet, while weaponizing law enforcement to jail political opponents," Trump told several thousand supporters at an airport in the heartland of Trump's mostly white, conservative base.</p>

<p>"With your vote this election, their lying, cheating, thieving, hoaxing and plotting will come to an end."</p>

<p>He denounced the string of criminal cases he faces over everything from attempting to overthrow his 2020 election loss to Biden, to dozens of felony fraud convictions in New York.</p>

<p>Harris, taking a break from days of debate preparation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, visited a spice store where she drew a contrast to Trump's grim tone.</p>

<p>Asked what message she would most like to get across in their debate Tuesday, she replied: "It's time to turn the page on the divisiveness. It's time to bring our country together -- chart a new way forward."</p>

<p>Harris said she was "honored" by the recent endorsements of two prominent conservatives, former vice president Dick Cheney and his daughter, former representative Liz Cheney, adding, "It's important to put country above party."</p>

<p>Asked if she was ready to face Trump, Harris said simply, "Yes, I am."</p>

<p>Crowds outside cheered as she left the shop, and the Harris campaign released video of the vice president hugging emotional supporters there, including a young girl.</p>

<h3><strong>Police union for Trump</strong></h3>

<p>Trump got a boost Friday when the country's largest police union, the Fraternal Order of Police, endorsed him despite his historic status as a convicted felon.</p>

<p>And he enjoyed a legal victory earlier in the day when a New York judge delayed his sentencing for hush money paid to a porn star until after the November election.</p>

<p>Trump also appeared before reporters to rail against the women who have accused him of sexual impropriety.</p>

<p>Harris, a former California prosecutor, is leaning heavily on her message that she represents law and order in a contest against a convicted criminal who tried to overturn his 2020 election loss -- another unprecedented element in a political season that has the country on edge.</p>

<h3><strong>Harris's policies</strong></h3>

<p>The vice president jumped into the 2024 race at the last minute after Biden abruptly dropped out on July 21, amid fears over his stamina and mental acuity.</p>

<p>Despite a burst of initial enthusiasm from Democrats, Harris has had to race to introduce and define herself.</p>

<p>The debate on Tuesday offers her a prime opportunity to present clear policy proposals -- she has been criticized for a lack of detail -- while sharpening her attack lines against Trump.</p>

<p>The former president, perhaps seeking to set expectations for the debate, said Saturday that the "crooked system" would not acknowledge if he won on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"They'll say, 'Trump suffered a humiliating defeat'," he asserted.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania, where Harris is preparing, is closely divided between Republican and Democratic voters, and may be the deciding piece in the puzzle of the state-by-state Electoral College battle that decides US presidential elections.</p>

<p>The debate will be the first-ever meeting between Harris and Trump. He refused to attend Biden's inauguration -- he would have met her there -- after falsely claiming the 2020 election was stolen from him.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Paris court in May detained and charged a couple on accusations that they were involved in Iranian plots to kill Jews in Germany and France, police sources told AFP.</p>

<p>Authorities charged Abdelkrim S., 34, and his partner Sabrina B., 33, on May 4 with conspiring with a criminal terrorist organisation and placed them in pre-trial detention.</p>

<p>The case, known as "Marco Polo" and revealed Thursday by French news website Mediapart, signals a revival in Iranian state-sponsored terrorism in Europe, according to a report by France's General Directorate for Internal Security (DGSI) consulted by AFP.</p>

<p>"Since 2015, the Iranian (secret) services have resumed a targeted killing policy," the French security agency wrote, adding that "the threat has worsened again in the context of the Israel-Hamas war".</p>

<p>The alleged objective for Iranian intelligence was to target civilians and sow fear in Europe among the country's political opposition as well as among Jews and Israelis.</p>

<p>Iran is accused of recruiting criminals, including drug lords, to conduct such operations.</p>

<p>Abdelkrim S. was previously sentenced to 10 years behind bars over a killing in Marseille and released on probation in July 2023.</p>

<p>He is accused of being the main France-based operative for an Iran-sponsored terrorist cell that planned acts of violence in France and Germany.</p>

<p>A former fellow inmate is believed to have connected the suspect with the cell's coordinator, a major drug trafficker from the Lyon area who likely visited Iran in May, according to the DGSI.</p>

<p>The group intended to attack a Paris-based former employee at an Israeli security firm and three of his colleagues residing in the Paris suburbs.</p>

<p>Three Israeli-German citizens in Munich and Berlin were also among the targets.</p>

<p>Investigators believe that Abdelkrim S. despite his probation made multiple trips to Germany for scouting purposes, including travels to Berlin with his wife.</p>

<p>He denied the accusations and said he simply had purchases to make.</p>

<p>French authorities are also crediting the cell with plots to set fire to four Israeli-owned companies in the south of France between late December 2023 and early January 2024, said a police source.</p>

<p>Abdelkrim S. while in detention rejected the claims, the source added, saying he had acted as a go-between on Telegram for the mastermind and other individuals involved in a planned insurance scam.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bomb threat, which caused a flight operated by India's Vistara Airlines to make an emergency landing in Erzurum, eastern Turkey two days ago has turned out to be false, according to the local governor.</p>

<p>"We have concluded all search and examination activities and have determined that the bomb threat was unfounded," Erzurum Governor Mustafa Ciftci told reporters on Saturday.</p>

<p>As a result, the flight ban at Erzurum's airport has been lifted, he said, noting that an alternate flight from Mumbai, India, has been arranged for the stranded passengers to continue their journey, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>A Vistara spokesperson had said flight UK27 from Mumbai to Frankfurt diverted due to "a security concern". The flight landed at Erzurum at 4.30 p.m. local time.</p>

<p>"As of 23:30, we have completed all search and examination operations. As a result of the work we carried out, we found that the bomb threat was unfounded," Ciftci told reporters at the airport.</p>

<p>"All flights coming or leaving from our province will now be able to fly comfortably," he said.</p>

<p>Vistara said in a post on X that customers, crew and the aircraft were cleared by security agencies and that all necessary checks were conducted.</p>

<p>The airline also said it was sending an alternate aircraft to Turkey by 12:25 p.m. local time on Saturday to take the passengers to Frankfurt.</p>

<p>The plane en route from Mumbai to Frankfurt made an emergency landing in eastern Turkey on Friday following a bomb threat.</p>

<p>Turkish authorities said a note reading "bomb on board" was discovered in a lavatory on the aircraft, prompting the plane, with 247 passengers and crew on board, to make an emergency landing.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 100,000 left-wing demonstrators rallied across France on Saturday to protest against the nomination of the centre-right Michel Barnier as prime minister and denounce President Emmanuel Macron's "power grab".</p>

<p>The interior ministry said 110,000 people took to the streets nationwide, including 26,000 in Paris, while one leading left-winger put the turnout across France at 300,000.</p>

<p>Rallies took place in cities across France including Nantes in the west, Nice and Marseille in the south and Strasbourg in the east.</p>

<p>Macron on Thursday appointed Barnier, a 73-year-old former foreign minister who acted as the European Union's Brexit negotiator, as prime minister, seeking to move forward after snap elections in which his centrist alliance came second.</p>

<p>Barnier said on Friday that he was open to naming ministers of all political stripes, including "people from the left".</p>

<p>But a left-wing coalition, which emerged as France's largest political bloc after the June-July elections, although short of an overall majority, has denounced Macron's appointment of Barnier.</p>

<p>The alliance wanted Lucie Castets, a 37-year-old economist, to become prime minister, but Macron quashed that idea, arguing that she would not survive a confidence vote in the hung parliament.</p>

<p>On Saturday, many demonstrators directed their anger at Macron, 46, and some called on him to resign.</p>

<h3><strong>'Old elephant'</strong></h3>

<p>"The Fifth Republic is collapsing," said 21-year-old protester Manon Bonijol, referring to France's current system of government.</p>

<p>"Expressing one's vote will be useless as long as Macron is in power," she added.</p>

<p>Hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, whose France Unbowed party (LFI) and allies belong to the left-wing bloc, had called for people to take to the streets, arguing that the election had been "stolen from the French".</p>

<p>On Saturday, he urged supporters to prepare for battle.</p>

<p>"There will be no pause," he vowed.</p>

<p>"Democracy isn't just the art of accepting that you've won, it's also the humility of accepting that you've lost," Melenchon said at the Paris march.</p>

<p>Project manager Alexandra Germain, 44, accused Macron of riding roughshod over the wishes of voters.</p>

<p>"Demonstrating is my only way of saying that I don't agree, even if I am well aware that it is useless," said Germain.</p>

<p>Abel Couaillier, a 20-year-old student, said he was stunned by the appointment of Barnier whom he called an "old elephant".</p>

<p>"I am still young, I want to believe that we can change things," added Couaillier.</p>

<p>Leading LFI figure Mathilde Panot claimed on X, formerly Twitter, that 160,000 demonstrators had protested in Paris and 300,000 people across France.</p>

<p>Police said five people had been detained in Paris.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Under surveillance'</strong></h3>

<p>Marine Le Pen, who leads far-right National Rally (RN) lawmakers in parliament, has said her party will not be part of the new cabinet, and that she will wait for Barnier's first policy speech in parliament before deciding whether or not to back him.</p>

<p>"Barnier is a prime minister under surveillance," said RN party president Jordan Bardella on Saturday.</p>

<p>"I am under the surveillance of all French people," said Barnier, on the sidelines of a visit to the Necker children's hospital in Paris.</p>

<p>Barnier will be in charge of the budget, security, immigration and healthcare.</p>

<p>He will have to take into account the interests of the National Rally -- the single-largest party in a fragmented legislature -- if he wants to avoid a motion of no-confidence in parliament.</p>

<p>Barnier -- who is likely to have only minority support in the National Assembly -- faces the urgent task of presenting the 2025 budget by early October.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hezbollah announced retaliatory rocket fire targeting a town in northern Israel early Sunday, hours after Lebanon's health ministry said an Israeli attack killed three civil defence personnel in the country's south.</p>

<p>The Iran-backed Lebanese movement has exchanged near-daily cross-border fire with Israeli forces in support of ally Hamas since the Palestinian militant group's October 7 attack on Israel triggered the war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it had bombarded "Kiryat Shmona with a volley of Falaq rockets" early Sunday "in response to the enemy attacks... and particularly the attack" that killed the emergency workers in the Lebanese village of Froun.</p>

<p>Hezbollah usually says it targets military positions in northern Israel, while Israel has said it targets Hezbollah infrastructure and fighters in south and east Lebanon.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Lebanon's health ministry said the "Israeli enemy targeting of a Lebanese civil defence team that was putting out fires sparked by the recent Israeli strikes in the village of Froun led to the martyrdom of three emergency responders".</p>

<p>Two others were wounded, one of them critically, the ministry added.</p>

<p>Lebanon's civil defence said in a statement that three of its employees were killed in "an Israeli strike that targeted a firefighting vehicle after they had finished a firefighting mission".</p>

<p>The health ministry statement condemned the "blatant Israeli attack that targeted a team from an official body of the Lebanese state".</p>

<p>Hezbollah ally the Amal movement said two of its members were among the dead in Saturday's strike. It said they were killed "while carrying out their humanitarian and national duty defending Lebanon and the south".</p>

<p>Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the attack on the emergency workers, saying in a statement that "this new aggression against Lebanon is a blatant violation of international laws... and human values".</p>

<h3><strong>'Repeated, deliberate'</strong></h3>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry said the attack was "the second of its kind against an emergency team in less than 12 hours".</p>

<p>Earlier Saturday, the ministry said two emergency personnel from the Hezbollah-affiliated Islamic Health Committee were wounded when "the Israeli enemy deliberately targeted" near a fire they were heading to extinguish in south Lebanon's Qabrikha, causing their vehicle to swerve.</p>

<p>Several militant groups operate health centres and emergency response operations in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>Hezbollah had announced a string of attacks on Israeli troops and positions near the border on Saturday, including with Katyusha rockets and "explosives-laden drones", some in a stated response to "Israeli enemy attacks" on south Lebanon.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said Saturday that it had identified "projectiles" crossing from Lebanon and intercepting some of them, adding "a number of UAVs (drones) were identified crossing from Lebanese territory".</p>

<p>It said the air force struck "Hezbollah military infrastructure and a launcher" in the Qabrikha area, while its artillery targeted several other areas of south Lebanon.</p>

<p>The cross-border violence has killed some 614 people in Lebanon, mostly fighters but also including 138 civilians, according to an AFP tally.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, including in the annexed Golan Heights, authorities have announced the deaths of at least 24 soldiers and 26 civilians.</p>

<p>A statement from Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad said that "due to the (Israeli) aggression", 27 emergency personnel and health workers have been killed and 94 others wounded since October.</p>

<p>Two hospitals and 21 health centres have been "targeted", while 32 fire or ambulance vehicles have been "put out of service or partially damaged", the statement said, urging an end to the "repeated and deliberate targeting of health workers and civilians".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>El Nino and La Nina are climate patterns in the Pacific Ocean that can affect weather worldwide.</p>

<p>Earlier on April 26, at least 155 people have lost their lives as a result of flooding and landslides caused by heavy rains in Tanzania, according to Al Jazeera.</p>

<p>In an address at the Parliament on Thursday, Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa said that the current rainy season has been made worse by the El Nino climate pattern, which has resulted in flooding and the destruction of roads, bridges, and railroads.</p>

<p>"The heavy El Nino rains, accompanied by strong winds, floods and landslides in various parts of the country, have caused significant damage," Majaliwa said.</p>

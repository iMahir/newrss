       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police in South Africa have arrested four individuals, including two Mexican nationals, after discovering a multimillion-dollar drug manufacturing lab on a farm in the country's north, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/africa/south-african-police-uncover-meth-lab-farm-intl/index.html"><em>CNN </em></a>reported.</p>

<p>The South African Police Service (SAPS) and the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, known as the Hawks, raided the property in Groblersdal following reports of suspicious activity, according to a SAPS statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Upon searching four structures on the farm, police discovered large quantities of chemicals used in the production of illicit drugs, such as acetone and crystal meth, with an estimated street value of 2 billion South African rand ($109.4 million).</p>

<p>The four suspects arrested on Friday include the farm owner and two Mexican nationals. Police added that the Hawks are not ruling out the possibility of further arrests.</p>

<p>"What makes this different from other [seizures] is the involvement of Mexican citizens," Katlego Mogale, national spokesperson for the Hawks told Reuters, adding: "It means that our task has just become very difficult."</p>

<p>It is unclear whether the seized drugs were meant for the South African market or export.</p>

<p>The Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that its embassy in South Africa had not received the necessary consular notification and is in contact with local authorities to gather details about the case and the alleged involvement of Mexicans.</p>

<p>The suspects are scheduled to appear in Groblersdal Magistrate's court on Monday to face charges of manufacturing, dealing, and possessing illicit drugs, according to the police.</p>

<p>In January, police reported that around 131 drug labs had been shut down across the country since 2019. During the festive season last year, more than 19,000 people were arrested for drug possession.</p>

<p>So far this year, the Hawks have discovered 10 secret drug labs and arrested 34 people as part of their ongoing war on drugs in the country, the statement said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic fundraising group ActBlue said Sunday evening that it had seen its biggest single-day haul of the 2024 election after US President Joe Biden dropped out and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>"As of 9pm ET, grassroots supporters have raised $46.7 million through ActBlue following Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign launch. This has been the biggest fundraising day of the 2024 cycle," said a post on X by the group, which facilitates online fundraising for Democratic candidates.</p>

<p>Biden's withdrawal had been widely expected at some point. The announcement finally came with no warning as he recovered from Covid at his Delaware beach house.</p>

<p>In a letter posted on X, Biden said it had been the "greatest honor of my life" to be president. He said he would address the nation later this week. The White House later said he had no public events scheduled for Monday.</p>

<p>"While it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term," he wrote.</p>

<p>Shortly after, he offered his "full support and endorsement" for Harris, with his campaign filing official notice to change its name to "Harris for President."</p>

<p>Endorsements began streaming in for Harris almost immediately from Democratic big shots as well as those seen as potential rivals for the nomination, such as California Governor Gavin Newsom.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prominent Indian-American businessman Vinod Khosla and billionaire Elon Musk engaged in a war of words this morning after Joe Biden dropped out of the US presidential race against Republican rival Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Biden has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party's new nominee</p>

<p>The stunning move throws Democrats into fresh turmoil ahead of the November 5 election. But it could also reenergize the demoralized party, with Kamala Harris swiftly confirming her goal to become America's first woman president and to "defeat Donald Trump."</p>

<p>Soon after the announcement, Vinod Khosla called for an "open convention" for the Democrats to decide on "a more moderate" candidate.</p>

<p>Time to have an open convention and get a more moderate candidate who can easily beat @realDonaldTrump. @GovWhitmer and @GovernorShapiro would be a great thing for America not held hostage between MAGA extremists and DEI extremism. Unique opportunity for a better moderate path. Every socially liberal, climate and fiscal voter should want it to balance our approach," he posted on X - earlier known as Twitter.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Responding to the post, Elon Musk - the CEO of X, Tesla and SpaceX - pitched for former US president Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance.</p>

<p>"Come on, Vinod. Trump/Vance LFG!!," Musk posted on X.</p>

<p>Hitting back, Mr Khosla asked Musk if he would want his children to be like the Republican presidential contender and said that he can't support someone (Donald Trump) who "lies, cheats and demeans women".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Hard for me to support someone with no values, lies, cheats, rapes, demeans women, hates immigrants like me. He may cut my taxes or reduce some regulation but that is no reason to accept depravity in his personal values. Do you want President who will set back climate by a decade in his first year? Do you want his example for your kids as values?," Mr Khosla said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years Kamala Harris faced criticism that she was not up to the job of being a heartbeat away from the US presidency. Now, she finds herself feted by Democrats as their best hope to stop Donald Trump's comeback.</p>

<p>Despite blazing a trail as the first woman, Black and South Asian vice president in the nation's history, the 59-year-old Democrat long struggled with approval ratings as bad or worse than President Joe Biden's.</p>

<p>The last 12 months, however, have revealed a transformed Harris.</p>

<p>And with Biden's endorsement in hand, after he stunned the world by dropping his own reelection bid Sunday, she's suddenly on the cusp of history.</p>

<p>In a statement full of plaudits for Biden's achievements in office -- it was "unmatched in modern American history," she said -- Harris vowed to "earn and win" the nomination.</p>

<p>"I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party -- and unite our nation -- to defeat Donald Trump," she said.</p>

<p>Harris will hope she has done the hard work to earn her full party's backing in the midst of the political crisis.</p>

<p>As the aging Biden seemed to visibly fade over the last year, his "veep" emerged as a force on the campaign trail, pushing for abortion rights and reaching out to core voters, including suburban women and Black men.</p>

<p>With a fondness for the f-bomb and her family nickname of "Momala" going viral, she has also finally started to cut through the noise to voters who previously paid scant attention.</p>

<p>Harris has won praise in party circles by staying loyal to the 81-year-old president even as political vultures began circling his candidacy.</p>

<p>She now appears likely to face Trump -- a brutal battle against a candidate who defeated Hillary Clinton in her bid to become the first female president in 2016.</p>

<h2>'Ready to serve'</h2>

<p>A child of immigrant parents -- her father was from Jamaica and her mother from India -- Harris grew up in Oakland, California, in an activist household that saw her attend her first rallies in a stroller.</p>

<p>Her focus on rights and justice saw her build an impressive CV, becoming California's first Black attorney general and the first woman of South Asian heritage elected to the US Senate.</p>

<p>Harris then went up against Biden in the 2020 primaries. In one stinging attack, she criticized him for allegedly opposing the busing of students to segregated schools.</p>

<p>"There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me," she said in a barbed attack on her future boss.</p>

<p>But as his running mate, she consolidated the coalition that helped defeat the incumbent Trump in 2020.</p>

<p>Her transition to the White House, however, proved difficult.</p>

<p>Critics said she was underwhelming and gaffe-prone in a job that has been known to flummox many officeholders.</p>

<p>Struggling to carve out a role, she was tasked by Biden with getting to the roots of the country's illegal migration problem, but fumbled and then got defensive in response to a question during a visit to the Mexican border.</p>

<p>Unusually high staff turnover fed rumors of discontent in the vice presidential office.</p>

<p>And Republicans -- often resorting to stereotypes her supporters branded as sexist and racist -- relentlessly targeted her as being unfit to take over, should the worst happen to America's oldest-ever president.</p>

<p>Harris told the Wall Street Journal in February: "I am ready to serve. There's no question about that."</p>

<h2>'Momala'</h2>

<p>Things began to change as the 2024 race got underway.</p>

<p>The Biden campaign repeatedly deployed Harris to battleground states to hammer home the party's message on abortion rights; she became the first vice president to visit an abortion clinic.</p>

<p>Gradually, she began to draw more engaged and fired-up crowds.</p>

<p>Some of the outreach was, however, cringe-inducing. Earlier this year, she was mocked after she told chat show host Drew Barrymore that her family sometimes called her "Momala," and Barrymore replied, "We need you to be Momala of the country."</p>

<p>But voters seemed to be switching on.</p>

<p>A clip of her quoting her mother as often saying, "You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?" became a meme, with a rising sense among supporters that now could be her time.</p>

<p>If elected, Harris would break one of the highest glass ceilings left for women in the United States -- that of occupying the country's top office.</p>

<p>Her husband, Douglas Emhoff, would also be breaking new ground, moving from being the current Second Gentleman to the country's first First Gentleman.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leading Democrats were quick to hail Joe Biden's legacy on Sunday after the US president's historic decision to end his reelection bid, while Republicans instead demanded his resignation.</p>

<p>From former presidents to current lawmakers, Biden's party faithful rallied around him as he passed the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris, endorsing her to take on Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Harris herself praised Biden's "selfless and patriotic act," saying in a statement that his accomplishments are "unmatched in modern American history, surpassing the legacy of many Presidents who have served two terms in office."</p>

<p>In a joint statement, former president Bill Clinton and ex-secretary of State Hillary Clinton said they "join millions of Americans in thanking President Biden for all that he accomplished."</p>

<p>With less than a month until the party's scheduled nominating convention, they too threw their weight behind Harris.</p>

<p>"Now is the time to support Kamala Harris and fight with everything we've got to elect her. America's future depends on it," the Clintons said.</p>

<p>Barack Obama, who picked then-senator Biden as his running mate in 2008, called him a "patriot of the highest order," but warned of "uncharted waters in the days ahead" -- and stopped short of endorsing Harris.</p>

<p>Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, who still wields immense influence among Democratic lawmakers and had reportedly been pushing for Biden's exit, called him "a patriotic American who has always put our country first."</p>

<p>"His legacy of vision, values and leadership make him one of the most consequential Presidents in American history," the California representative said in a statement, expressing her "love and gratitude."</p>

<p>The two top Democratic leaders in Congress also praised Biden's legislative accomplishments without endorsing a replacement.</p>

<p>"President Joe Biden is one of the most accomplished and consequential leaders in American history," House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement.</p>

<p>"His decision of course was not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first," Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said.</p>

<h3><strong>Republican fury&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Republican leaders, including Trump, slammed Biden's presidency and called for the 81-year-old to resign.</p>

<p>"Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve -- And never was! ... We will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!" Trump, 78, posted on his Truth Social network.</p>

<p>Senator JD Vance, Trump's pick for running mate, said Biden "has been the worst President in my lifetime and Kamala Harris has been right there with him every step of the way."</p>

<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson meanwhile said that "if Joe Biden is not fit to run for president, he is not fit to serve as president."</p>

<p>"He must resign the office immediately," he said in a statement.</p>

<p>Many Republicans in recent days openly called for Biden, who was trailing Trump in polling, to stay in the race -- arguing replacing him would be "undemocratic."</p>

<p>Mitch McConnell, the top Senate Republican, claimed "the Democratic Party has been busy in recent weeks trying to upend the expressed will of the American people in primary elections across the country."</p>

<p>"We cannot afford four more years of failure," he added in a statement.</p>

<h3><strong>Family&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Biden's family offered loving support to their patriarch figure, as his five-decade political career now heads to a close.</p>

<p>First Lady Jill Biden reposted her husband's statement on X announcing his exit with a simple two-heart emoji.</p>

<p>Granddaughter Naomi Biden said on X she is "nothing but proud today of my Pop, our President, Joe Biden, who has served our country with every bit of his soul and with unmatched distinction."</p>

<p>Hunter Biden, the president's son, said his father's "unconditional love has been his North Star as a President, and as a parent."</p>

<p>His statement, shared by his daughter Naomi, concluded: "Thank you, Mr. President. I love you, Dad."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Philippines and China have agreed on an "arrangement" for resupplying Filipino troops stationed on a South China Sea reef, Manila said Sunday, after a series of escalating confrontations in the disputed waters.</p>

<p>A remote outpost on Second Thomas Shoal has been a focus of clashes between Chinese and Philippine ships in recent months as Beijing steps up efforts to push its claims to almost the entire South China Sea.</p>

<p>A Filipino sailor lost a thumb in the latest June 17 confrontation when Chinese coast guard members wielding knives, sticks and an axe foiled a Philippine Navy attempt to resupply its troops.</p>

<p>Sunday's announcement follows talks between the Philippines and China this month when they agreed to increase the number of communication channels to resolve maritime disagreements between them.</p>

<p>"The Philippines and the People's Republic of China have reached an understanding on the provisional arrangement for the resupply of daily necessities and rotation missions to the BRP Sierra Madre in Ayungin Shoal," the Philippine foreign ministry, using the Filipino name for Second Thomas Shoal.</p>

<p>The foreign ministry did not provide details of the arrangement, but said both sides recognised the need to "de-escalate the situation in the South China Sea and manage differences through dialogue and consultation".</p>

<p>China's embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>A handful of Filipino troops are stationed on the rusty BRP Sierra Madre warship that was deliberately grounded on Second Thomas Shoal in 1999 to assert Manila's claims to the area.</p>

<p>They require frequent resupplies for food, water and other necessities as well as transport for personnel rotations.</p>

<p>Earlier Sunday, Manila said the resupply missions would remain a Philippine operation, after Washington vowed to "do what is necessary" to support them.</p>

<p>"As far as the RORE (rotation and resupply mission) is concerned, we're keeping it as a purely Philippine operation utilising Philippine ships, personnel and leadership," National Security Council assistant director-general Jonathan Malaya told AFP.</p>

<p>"That may change depending on the guidance from top management but that's the direction or policy at present."</p>

<p>Malaya's remarks came after White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the United States "will do what is necessary" to ensure the Philippines can continue to resupply its troops on the contested atoll.</p>

<p>"We will continue to support the Philippines and stand behind them as they take steps to be able to ensure that," Sullivan said during the Aspen Security Forum conference in Colorado.</p>

<p>Malaya said the National Security Council appreciated the US offer and the Philippines would continue consultations as treaty allies.</p>

<p>Manila has a mutual defence pact with the United States which requires both parties to come to the other's defence in case of an "armed attack" against vessels, aircraft, military and coast guard anywhere in the Pacific theatre, which Washington says includes the South China Sea.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is potentially poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee in the November election. Here are her views and actions related to some key business topics.</p>

<h3><strong>Tech Regulation</strong></h3>

<p>As California attorney general, Harris sued eBay in 2012, alleging anticompetitive hiring practices surrounding a no-poaching agreement with Intuit that led to a nearly $4 million settlement in 2014.</p>

<p>In 2015, she compelled startup Houzz to hire a chief privacy officer after allegations that the home design app had recorded sales calls without proper notification and consent.</p>

<p>One of her signature issues was curtailing the distribution of pornography on social media, particularly "revenge porn," a practice involving the posting of explicit photos without the subject's consent. She took credit for a pressure campaign that led to Facebook, Alphabet's Google, Microsoft and others taking measures to remove certain explicit images.</p>

<p>"I cannot emphasize enough how leaders in technology have stepped up," said Harris at a news conference then. "I'm not suggesting any of them were happy to get a call from the AG saying, 'Come in, we want to talk with you.' But they all did. They did."</p>

<h3><strong>Big Tech</strong></h3>

<p>As a candidate for California attorney general, Harris reportedly assured potential donors that she was "a capitalist." She has generally been seen as cozy with prominent tech executives and investors, the local industry in her home Bay Area. She attended the wedding of Sean Parker, an early Facebook executive. Her brother-in-law, Tony West, is the chief legal officer for Uber.</p>

<p>She also accepted donations from Reid Hoffman, a prominent venture capitalist and co-founder of Linkedin, as well as billionaire John Doerr and venture capitalist Ron Conway. Big tech executives also supported her, including Sheryl Sandberg, then chief operating officer of Facebook, and Marc Benioff, the billionaire CEO of Salesforce.</p>

<h3><strong>Climate And Energy</strong></h3>

<p>Harris' climate and energy positions are similar to Biden's. But throughout her career she has made clear that clean energy and environmental justice are priorities.</p>

<p>When Biden announced Harris as his running mate in the 2020 race, he emphasized her tough stance against big oil when she served in key roles in California, noting lawsuits she had launched both as San Francisco's district attorney from 2004 to 2011 and then as the state's attorney general until January 2017, when she became a U.S. senator.</p>

<p>Last year, Harris made her debut at international climate negotiations, announcing a $3 billion commitment to the Green Climate Fund and making her first major international speech focused on climate.</p>

<p>As vice president, Harris has also been involved in Environmental Protection Agency policy rollouts that tackled long-standing environmental justice issues, such as a multibillion-dollar program to replace lead pipes and lead paint around the country.</p>

<h3><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></h3>

<p>As vice president, Harris has been particularly outspoken on artificial intelligence. She warned against the "existential" threat of AI and said it could "endanger the very existence of humanity," in a November 2023 address.</p>

<p>In meeting with tech execs like Microsoft's Satya Nadella, OpenAI's Sam Altman and Alphabet's Sundar Pichai, Harris warned that they have a "moral" obligation to guard against AI's possible dangers.</p>

<p>She backed an AI executive order from Biden that seeks stronger protections for consumers, singling out AI-generated scam calls and the impacts of unlabeled AI-generated content.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to stick largely to Joe Biden's foreign policy playbook on key issues such as Ukraine, China and Iran but could strike a tougher tone with Israel over the Gaza war if she replaces the president at the top of the Democratic ticket and wins the U.S. November election.</p>

<p>As the apparent frontrunner for the nomination after Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed her on Sunday, Harris would bring on-the-job experience, personal ties forged with world leaders, and a sense of global affairs gained during a Senate term and as Biden's second-in-command.</p>

<p>But running against Republican candidate Donald Trump she would also have a major vulnerability - a troubled situation at the U.S.-Mexico border that has bedeviled Biden and become a top campaign issue. Harris was tasked at the start of his term with addressing the root causes of high irregular migration, and Republicans have sought to make her the face of the problem.</p>

<p>On a range of global priorities, said analysts, a Harris presidency would resemble a second Biden administration.</p>

<p>"She may be a more energetic player but one thing you shouldn't expect - any immediate big shifts in the substance of Biden's foreign policy," said Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East negotiator for Democratic and Republican administrations.</p>

<p>Harris has signaled, for instance, that she would not deviate from Biden's staunch support for NATO and would continue backing Ukraine in its fight against Russia. That stands in sharp contrast to a pledge by former president Trump to fundamentally alter the U.S. relationship with the alliance and the doubts he has raised about future weapons supplies to Kyiv.</p>

<h3><strong>Staying On The Course On China?</strong></h3>

<p>A lawyer by training and a former California attorney general, Harris struggled in the first half of Biden's term to find her footing, not helped by being saddled early on with a major part of the intractable immigration portfolio amid record crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>

<p>That followed a failed 2020 presidential campaign that was widely considered lackluster.</p>

<p>If she becomes the nominee, Democrats will be hoping Harris will be more effective at communicating her foreign policy goals.</p>

<p>In the second half of Biden's presidency, Harris - the country's first Black and Asian American vice president - has elevated her profile on issues ranging from China and Russia to Gaza and become a known quantity to many world leaders.</p>

<p>At this year's Munich Security Conference she delivered a tough speech slamming Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and pledging "ironclad" U.S. respect for NATO's Article 5 requirement for mutual self-defense.</p>

<p>On China, Harris has long positioned herself within Washington's bipartisan mainstream on the need for the U.S. to counter China's influence, especially in Asia. She would likely maintain Biden's stance of confronting Beijing when necessary while also seeking areas of cooperation, analysts say.</p>

<p>Harris has made several trips aimed at boosting relations in the economically dynamic region, including one to Jakarta in September to fill in for Biden at a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). During the visit, Harris accused China of trying to coerce smaller neighbors with its territorial claims in the disputed South China Sea.</p>

<p>Biden also dispatched Harris on travels to shore up alliances with Japan and South Korea, key allies who have had reason to worry about Trump's commitment to their security.</p>

<p>"She demonstrated to the region that she was enthusiastic to promote the Biden focus on the Indo-Pacific," said Murray Hiebert, a senior associate of the Southeast Asia Program at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p>

<p>While she could not match the "diplomatic chops" Biden had developed over decades, "she did fine," he added.</p>

<p>However, like her boss, Harris has been prone to the occasional verbal gaffe. On a tour of the Demilitarized Zone between South and North Korea in September 2022 to reassert Washington's support for Seoul, she mistakenly touted a U.S. "alliance with the Republic of North Korea," which aides later corrected.</p>

<p>If Harris becomes her party's standard-bearer and can overcome Trump's lead in pre-election opinion polls to win the White House, the Israel-Palestinian conflict would rank high on her agenda, especially if the Gaza war is still raging.</p>

<p>Although as vice president she has mostly echoed Biden in firmly backing Israel's right to defend itself after Hamas carried out a deadly cross-border raid on Oct. 7, she has at times stepped out slightly ahead of the president in criticizing Israel's military approach.</p>

<p>In March, she bluntly criticized Israel, saying it was not doing enough to ease a "humanitarian catastrophe" during its ground offensive in the Palestinian enclave. Later that month, she did not rule out "consequences" for Israel if it launched a full-scale invasion of refugee-packed Rafah in southern Gaza.</p>

<p>Such language has raised the possibility that Harris, as president, might take at least a stronger rhetorical line with Israel than Biden, analysts say.</p>

<p>While her 81-year-old boss has a long history with a succession of Israeli leaders and has even called himself a "Zionist," Harris, 59, lacks his visceral personal connection to the country.</p>

<p>She maintains closer ties to Democratic progressives, some of whom have pressed Biden to attach conditions to U.S. weapons shipments to Israel out of concern for high Palestinian civilian casualties in the Gaza conflict.</p>

<p>But analysts do not expect there would be a big shift in U.S. policy toward Israel, Washington's closest ally in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Halie Soifer, who served as national security adviser to Harris during the then-senator's first two years in Congress, from 2017 to 2018, said Harris' support of Israel has been just as strong as Biden's. "There really has been no daylight to be found" between the two, she said.</p>

<h3><strong>Iran Nuclear Threat</strong></h3>

<p>Harris could also be expected to hold firm against Israel's regional arch-foe, Iran, whose recent nuclear advances have drawn increased U.S. condemnation.</p>

<p>Jonathan Panikoff, formerly the U.S. government's deputy national intelligence officer for the Middle East, said the growing threat of "weaponization" of Iran's nuclear program could be an early major challenge for a Harris administration, especially if Tehran decides to test the new U.S. leader.</p>

<p>After a series of failed attempts, Biden has shown little interest in returning to negotiations with Tehran over resuming the 2015 international nuclear agreement, which Trump abandoned during his presidency.</p>

<p>Harris, as president, would be unlikely to make any major overtures without serious signs that Iran is ready to make concessions.</p>

<p>Even so, Panikoff, now at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, said: "There's every reason to believe the next president will have to deal with Iran. It's bound to be one of the biggest problems."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden's withdrawal from the US election offers Democrats the precious opportunity for a late reset in a campaign that was going badly -- but ushers in an uncertain few weeks that will make or break their chances against Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Grassroots voters will hope to be better served than they were during the initial nomination race, when Democrats put up no serious competition to the 81-year-old president's candidacy despite worries over his age.</p>

<p>"Remarkable leadership shown by Joe Biden. Now it falls to the (Democrats) to show equal leadership by having an open process to determine the best candidate(s) to take on Trump-Vance in November," said entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who ran against Biden for the party's nomination in 2020.</p>

<p>"The goal should be simple -- to win," he wrote on X.</p>

<p>With Biden's endorsement, Vice President Kamala Harris, 59, starts out in the strongest position to replace him and may be able to consolidate support in the coming days -- a coronation that would allow Democrats to turn their fire on Trump.</p>

<p>If that doesn't happen then a chaotic -- and potentially damaging -- fight for the votes of almost 4,000 delegates at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in just four weeks looks more likely.</p>

<p>The party's national chairman Jaime Harrison promised a "transparent and orderly process" to replace Biden, the first president since Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968 not to seek a second term.</p>

<h3><strong>Kamala the prosecutor</strong></h3>

<p>His campaign began collapsing after his dismal debate performance against Trump last month prompted concerns over his advanced years and mental capacity.</p>

<p>Trump, who would be 82 at the end of a second term, appeared more robust -- but opposition from a younger candidate would turn the spotlight on his speeches and interviews, where he often appears incoherent and confuses names.</p>

<p>Several rising Democratic stars -- all younger than 60 -- have been floated as Biden alternatives, including governors Josh Shapiro, Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom.</p>

<p>Whitmer immediately appeared to suggest she would not be running and Newsom has previously said he would not challenge Harris, but neither explicitly ruled themselves out.</p>

<p>A campaign led by Harris and backed up by a moderate midwestern running mate could present the best chance for Democrats -- helping turn out more women, who historically vote in greater numbers than men and are a weakness for Trump.</p>

<p>Harris would also give Democrats a chance to redefine the race at their convention as a clash of cultures between a former prosecutor and a convicted felon.</p>

<p>"While she has largely been in the shadows for the last four years it is time for Kamala the prosecutor... to make her comeback," said Sara Sadhwani, an assistant professor of politics at Pomona College in Claremont, California.</p>

<p>A new survey from Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling released Thursday found that Harris -- with the right running mate -- could defeat Trump and Vance in Pennsylvania and Michigan, two of the three "Blue Wall" states seen as critical to electing a Democratic president.</p>

<h3><strong>Clean break?</strong></h3>

<p>Ryan Waite, a political marketing expert from Brigham Young University-Idaho, told AFP a contested nomination might actually benefit Democrats by depriving Trump of headlines for several months.</p>

<p>"A new Democrat candidate will benefit from a short vetting window and significant earned media impact right before the election," he told AFP. "The story is now who will it be and that will take the air out of the room through their convention."</p>

<p>Any new nominee other than Harris would represent a clean break and be immune from much of the criticism directed at the Biden administration over high inflation, the border crisis and the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p>

<p>But while Harris would likely inherit all of the Biden campaign's cash reserves -- about $94 million as of July -- other candidates may have to share the money with down-ballot candidates.</p>

<p>They would also have to make the case anew for endorsements from some of the Biden-Harris campaign's most influential backers, such as the United Auto Workers union. Harris herself could also face this problem, of course.</p>

<p>Republicans have suggested that they might challenge any late substitutions in the courts but Marc Elias, the Democrats' top election lawyer vowed that the eventual nominee would be on all 50 state ballots.</p>

<p>"There is no basis for any legal challenge. Period," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yemen's Houthi rebels on Sunday promised a "huge" retaliation against Israel for a deadly strike on the port of Hodeida, as regional fallout widens from months of war in Gaza.</p>

<p>The Israeli strike, the first claimed by Israel in Yemen, set oil tanks ablaze at the vital port and came a day after the first fatal attack by the Houthis in Israel.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Israel said it intercepted a missile fired from Yemen and struck targets in southern Lebanon. Residents of southern Gaza reported combat in the Rafah area.</p>

<p>The fighting across the region came ahead of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's trip this week to Washington, which has been trying to secure a ceasefire in the more than nine-month war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Netanyahu's office said he was sending a negotiating team -- it was unclear where -- for new talks on a deal under which hostages held by Hamas would be freed.</p>

<p>But Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry warned Israel's attack on Hodeida "aggravates the current tension in the region and halts the ongoing efforts to end the war in Gaza".</p>

<p>Dozens have been killed since Saturday across Gaza, the civil defence agency in the Hamas-run territory said, including in strikes on homes in the central Nuseirat and Bureij areas and near southern Khan Yunis.</p>

<p>Residents said a major operation was underway in a district west of Rafah, where they reported heavy artillery and clashes.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, chief of the Iran-backed group, said the Hodeida strikes would lead to "further escalation and more attacks targeting Israel". He said the deadly Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv had opened "a new phase" in operations.</p>

<p>Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree said the rebels' "response to the Israeli aggression against our country is inevitably coming and will be huge".</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the fire left raging by the strikes on rebel-held Hodeida port "is seen across the Middle East and the significance is clear".</p>

<p>Gallant warned of further operations if the Houthis "dare to attack us" after the rebel strike hit Tel Aviv, at least 1,800 kilometres (1,119 miles) from Yemen.</p>

<p>It appeared to be the first to pierce Israel's intricate air defences but an analyst said Houthi drones do not pose a "strategic threat" to Israel.</p>

<h3><strong>Fuel storage tanks</strong></h3>

<p>In Hodeida, six people were killed and 83 wounded, health officials said in a statement carried by Houthi media.</p>

<p>AFPTV images showed heavy flames and black smoke spiralling into the sky from burning oil tanks. Debris covered the dock where equipment was damaged.</p>

<p>Hodeida port is a vital entry point for fuel imports and international aid for rebel-held areas of Yemen, a country where the United Nations says more than half the population needs humanitarian assistance.</p>

<p>Analysts say the strike on Hodeida will likely only embolden the Houthis. They have already withstood since January repeated United States and British strikes aimed at deterring recurrent Houthi attacks on shipping.</p>

<p>The rebels also endured thousands of air raids during nearly a decade of war against forces backing Yemen's internationally-recognised government.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the Israeli military said it had intercepted a missile fired from Yemen towards the Red Sea resort town of Eilat. The rebel spokesman said ballistic missiles were fired towards the port.</p>

<p>In Lebanon, Iran-backed and Hamas-allied Hezbollah said it fired Katyusha rockets and drones at northern Israel after Israeli strikes hit a weapons depot and wounded six civilians.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, which reported three more of its fighters killed, said Israel's strikes on its Yemeni allies marked "a new, dangerous phase".</p>

<h3><strong>Netanyahu to Washington</strong></h3>

<p>The Gaza war was triggered by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 42 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel has killed at least 38,983 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the Gaza health ministry.</p>

<p>The war has left most of Gaza's population displaced, much of the housing and other infrastructure destroyed, and essential goods in short supply as the UN says diseases are spreading.</p>

<p>Israel has started vaccinating its troops in Gaza against polio and supplying vaccines for the Palestinian population after health agencies said the virus was found there, the military said.</p>

<p>The war has brought Israelis to the streets, sometimes in their tens of thousands, demanding a deal to free remaining hostages.</p>

<p>On Sunday they protested at Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv ahead of Netanyahu's meetings in the United States where he will be under pressure to reach a ceasefire with Hamas.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. President Joe Biden on Sunday ended his reelection campaign. He said in a letter posted on social media platform X that he would remain in office until the end of his term and address the country later this week on his decision.</p>

<p>Below are reactions from politicians, industry and advocacy groups and other observers.</p>

<h3><strong>Vice President Kamala Harris</strong></h3>

<p>"I am honored to have the president's endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination," Harris said in a statement. "I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party - and unite our nation - to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda."</p>

<h3><strong>Former President Donald Trump</strong></h3>

<p>In a phone call with CNN minutes after Biden announced his exit from the 2024 race, former President Trump responded, "He is the worst president in the history of our country. He goes down as the single worst president by far in the history of our country." Trump also said he thought Vice President Kamala Harris will be easier to defeat than Biden would have been, according to CNN.</p>

<h3><strong>Former President Barack Obama</strong></h3>

<p>"I also know Joe has never backed down from a fight. For him to look at the political landscape and decide that he should pass the torch to a new nominee is surely one of the toughest in his life. But I know he wouldn't make this decision unless he believed it was right for America," the former president said in a statement. "I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges."</p>

<h3><strong>Chuck Schumer, Senate Majority Leader</strong></h3>

<p>"Joe Biden has not only been a great president and a great legislative leader but he is a truly amazing human being. His decision of course was not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first. Joe, today shows you are a true patriot and great American," the Democrat said in a statement.</p>

<h3><strong>Elise Stefanik, House Republican Conference Chairwoman</strong></h3>

<p>"If Joe Biden can't run for re-election, he is unable and unfit to serve as President of the United States. He must immediately resign," Stefanik said in a statement.</p>

<h3><strong>Independent Presidential Candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</strong></h3>

<p>"I commend President Biden for stepping down. His infirmities were evident to any unbiased observer from the beginning. It was this progressive deterioration - and his abandonment of Democratic Party principles - that prompted me to enter the race and ensure American voters had a viable, vigorous alternative to Donald Trump," Kennedy said in a post on X.</p>

<h3><strong>Hakeem Jeffries, House Democratic Leader</strong></h3>

<p>"America is a better place today because President Joe Biden has led us with intellect, grace and dignity. We are forever grateful," Jeffries said in a statement.</p>

<h3><strong>Steve Scalise, House Majority Leader</strong></h3>

<p>"Democrat party bosses just proved that they have absolutely no respect for their own voters. After lecturing others about democracy, they just forced Joe Biden off the ticket-trashing the primary choice of 14 million of their own voters," Scalise, a Republican, said on X.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Congressional Black Caucus Political Action Committee</strong></h3>

<p>"Americans and democracy-loving people world owe Joe Biden a debt of gratitude. The Congressional Black Caucus PAC joins President Biden in fully supporting Kamala Harris as our party's nominee," the organization said in a statement posted to X.</p>

<h3><strong>Nancy Pelosi, Former House Speaker</strong></h3>

<p>"President Joe Biden is a patriotic American who has always put our country first. His legacy of vision, values and leadership make him one of the most consequential Presidents in American history. With love and gratitude to President Biden for always believing in the promise of America and giving people the opportunity to reach their fulfillment. God blessed America with Joe Biden's greatness and goodness."</p>

<h3><strong>Gavin Newsom, Governor Of California</strong></h3>

<p>"President Biden has been an extraordinary, history-making president - a leader who has fought hard for working people and delivered astonishing results for all Americans. He will go down in history as one of the most impactful and selfless presidents," Newsom posted on X.</p>

<h3><strong>Nanette Barragan, Chair Of The Congressional Hispanic Caucus</strong></h3>

<p>"I am with you @JoeBiden - I endorse @KamalaHarris as our Democratic nominee &amp; will work tirelessly to make sure she is elected our next President in November," Barragán said in a post on X.</p>

<h3><strong>South Carolina Democratic Congressman Jim Clyburn</strong></h3>

<p>"I echo the good judgment [President Biden] demonstrated in selecting Vice President Harris to lead this nation alongside him, and I am proud to follow his lead in support of her candidacy to succeed him as the Democratic Party's 2024 nominee for president," Clyburn said in a statement</p>

<h3><strong>Andy Beshear, Governor Of Kentucky</strong></h3>

<p>Beshear, whose name has also been floated as a possible contender as president or vice president, praised Biden for acting "in the best interest of our country, and our party" and "for a successful presidency that got big, important things done."</p>

<p>"Now it is time for our nation to come together," he added in his post on X.</p>

<h3><strong>Peter Welch, US Senator</strong></h3>

<p>Welch, the first Democratic Senator to call on Joe Biden to drop his reelection run, on Sunday praised the president for ending his quest, saying he showed "good judgment and great humility" and "put the country first."</p>

<p>"It was an agonizing decision," Welch said in an interview with Reuters. "Every fiber of his being wanted to continue to fight and to beat Trump again."</p>

<p>Welch declined to endorse Harris, who he acknowledged was the frontrunner to replace Biden.</p>

<p>The Democrats should have "an open process so that whoever our nominee is, including Kamala, has the strength of having a process that shows the consensus position of the party," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>Barbara Lee, US Representative</strong></h3>

<p>Lee, a former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, said in a phone interview there is "no other option" but to choose Harris as the party's nominee.</p>

<p>"She is the best vice president," Lee said. "She is experienced, capable and smart. She has been a part of the Biden-Harris legacy that needs to continue."</p>

<h3><strong>Gretchen Whitmer, Governor Of Michigan</strong></h3>

<p>"President Biden is a great public servant who knows better than anyone what it takes to defeat Donald Trump. His remarkable work to lower prescription drug costs, fix the damn roads, bring supply chains home, address climate change, and ensure America's global leadership over decades will go down in history. My job in this election will remain the same: doing everything I can to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump, a convicted felon whose agenda of raising families' costs, banning abortion nationwide, and abusing the power of the White House to settle his own scores is completely wrong for Michigan," Whitmer said on X.</p>

<h3><strong>United Auto Workers</strong></h3>

<p>"Vice President Kamala Harris walked the picket line with us in 2019, and along with President Biden has brought work and jobs back to communities like Lordstown, Ohio, and Belvidere, Illinois. That's the legacy President Biden leaves and that's the work we will continue to build on as a union," the union said in a statement.</p>

<h3><strong>Dick Durbin, Senator And Majority Whip</strong></h3>

<p>"Throughout his public career, Joe Biden always put country first. His four years as President made it clear that he was determined to put our country back on track and restore the soul of our nation. America will be forever grateful for all he has given to this country," Durbin posted on X.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The Clintons</strong></h3>

<p>"We are honored to join the President in endorsing Vice President Harris and will do whatever we can to support her," the Clintons said in a statement. &nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli army has bombed the central Gazan refugee camp of Nuseirat 63 times in seven days, killing 91 Palestinians and injuring 251 others, the Hamas-run Gaza government media office said.</p>

<p>The Gaza-ruling faction on Sunday held the Israeli and the US administrations "fully responsible" for continued killings in the refugee camp, which currently houses nearly 250,000 people, including the recently displaced ones, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>The operations sparked deep concern on Tuesday when a major strike involving the use of rockets killed at least 23 people and injured 73 others at a UNRWA-established school, but the Israeli military later said the attack targeted active "terrorists" there and was "based on precise intelligence".</p>

<p>In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces accused Hamas of "exploiting civilian structures and population as human shields for its terror attacks against the State of Israel".</p>

<p>Israel has been launching a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the besieged Palestinian enclave to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on October 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 were taken hostage.</p>

<p>During the past 24 hours, the Israeli military killed 64 people and wounded 105 others, bringing the total death toll to 38,983 and injuries to 89,727 since the Palestinian-Israeli conflict broke out last October, the Gaza-based health authorities said on Sunday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senator JD Vance, the Republican nominee for Vice-President, sought to tie Vice-President Kamala Harris, who could become the Democratic nominee for President, to President Joe Biden's presidency, saying the latter was the "worst President in my lifetime" and Harris was with him every step of the way.</p>

<p>Vance finds himself in a strange situation. From preparing to take on Harris in a Vice-Presidential debate, he does not know who he will face.</p>

<p>"Joe Biden has been the worst President in my lifetime and Kamala Harris has been right there with him every step of the way," Vance said in a post on X.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Vance ended on a note of nonchalance. "President Trump and I are ready to save America, whoever's at the top of the Democrat ticket. Bring it on," he wrote in conclusion.</p>

<p>If Harris secures the nomination, which she might as she has already been endorsed by Biden, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, with more endorsements on the way. Several names are doing the rounds for her running mate, including Roy Cooper, the Governor of North Carolina, a swing state; Senator Mark Kelly from Arizona, another swing state; and Andy Beshear, Governor of Kentucky, a Republican-ruled state.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four years ago, as he ran for the White House, Joe Biden saw himself as a one-term president -- a savvy conduit from the chaotic years of Donald Trump to a new generation of Democratic leaders.</p>

<p>"Look, I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else," Biden said at a campaign event in March 2020, with a group of much younger politicians vying to be his running mate -- including Kamala Harris, who ultimately got the nod.</p>

<p>"There's an entire generation of leaders you saw stand behind me. They are the future of this country," said Biden, who went on to beat Trump, though the Republican never accepted his defeat.</p>

<p>It was widely seen as his main mission -- dislodge Trump from the White House, then bow out, with elegance, after one term.</p>

<p>Biden, now 81, will indeed be a one-term president, but under tumultuous, agonizing circumstances: long-simmering worries about his age and mental sharpness have exploded to doom him when he decided to go for a second term after all.</p>

<p>On Sunday Biden said he was dropping his bid to run against Trump again in November, yielding to intense and growing pressure as polls showed most people even in his own Democratic Party felt he was too old to run for another term, much less serve four more years.</p>

<h3><strong>Defiance to dropping out</strong></h3>

<p>Presidents tend to see their party take a beating in congressional elections held half way through their term, but Biden and his Democrats did surprisingly well in 2022. A feared hemorraghing of Democratic seats failed to materialize.</p>

<p>This was due in part to Americans' anger over the Supreme Court's ending of the 50-year-old federal right to abortion -- the decision of a court with three new conservatives judges appointed by Trump.</p>

<p>Energized by that strong showing, months later Biden announced that he would seek a second term after all.</p>

<p>"When I ran for president four years ago, I said we are in a battle for the soul of America. And we still are," Biden said in April 2023.</p>

<p>"The question we are facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom. More rights or fewer," Biden said in a video announcing his 2024 run.</p>

<p>Biden and his party went through the motions of the Democratic primary elections with no serious opposition, although some in the party grumbled that Biden was too old to seek a second term.</p>

<p>"No, I've been very clear. I'd like to see a generational change," said Tim Ryan, a Democratic senator from Ohio.</p>

<p>Polls had long shown that many people considered Biden's age an issue, and for him the beginning of the end came on a debate stage with Trump in Atlanta on June 27.</p>

<p>As 50 million people watched on TV, the president performed dismally, struggling to complete sentences, speaking incoherently at times and looking dazed, his mouth agape.</p>

<p>A drum roll of calls for him to bow out began immediately, and grew steadily louder, amid warnings to Biden that he could not beat Trump, might destroy his own legacy if he insisted on running and lost, and could might well drag the Democratic Party down with him in defeat.</p>

<p>To the very end Biden insisted, day after day, he was all in -- the only candidate who could beat Trump as he had once before.</p>

<p>As he isolated at his beach house this weekend to recover from a Covid infection, Biden announced he would go back on the campaign trail next week.</p>

<p>Until Sunday's bomb dropped in a message on X. He said it was in the interest of the country and his party for him to step aside.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Democratic party will be taking a historic gamble if it now turns to Vice President Kamala Harris to become its presidential candidate, betting that a Black woman can overcome racism, sexism and her own missteps as a politician to defeat Republican Donald Trump.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden, 81, announced on Sunday he was ending his campaign for reelection, while staying on as president for the remainder of his term. In a separate post on X, formerly Twitter, he endorsed Harris.</p>

<p>"My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it's been the best decision I've made," Biden wrote. "Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year."</p>

<p>Biden's decision comes after weeks of pressure from Democratic lawmakers and donors who feared he lacked the mental and physical stamina to win and serve four more years.</p>

<p>In more than two centuries of democracy, American voters have elected only one Black president and never a woman, a record that makes even some Black voters wonder if Harris can crash through the hardest ceiling in U.S. politics.</p>

<p>"Will her race and gender be an issue? Absolutely," said LaTosha Brown, a political strategist and co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris would face other big challenges: if promoted to the top of the ticket, she would have barely three months to campaign and unite the party and donors behind her. But many Democrats are excited about her chances.</p>

<p>Harris, 59, is two decades younger than Trump and a leader in the party on abortion rights, an issue which resonates with younger voters and Democrats' progressive base. Proponents argue she would energize those voters, consolidate Black support, and bring sharp debating skills to prosecute the political case against the former president.</p>

<p>Her candidacy would offer a contrast with Trump and his vice presidential running mate, Senator J.D. Vance, the two white men on the Republican ticket, Brown said.</p>

<p>"That to me is reflective of America's past. She is reflective of America's now and future," Brown said.</p>

<p>But despite earning praise in the last few weeks for her strong defense of Biden, some Democrats remain concerned about Harris' shaky first two years in office, short-lived campaign for the 2020 Democratic nomination, and - perhaps most of all - the weight of a long history of racial and gender discrimination in the United States.</p>

<h3><strong>'No Safe Option'</strong></h3>

<p>In a hypothetical head-to-head matchup, Harris and Trump were tied with 44% support each in a July 15-16 Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted immediately after the assassination attempt against Trump. Trump led Biden 43% to 41% in that same poll, though the 2 percentage point difference was within the poll's 3 percentage point margin of error.</p>

<p>Harris's approval ratings, while low, are a tick higher than Biden's. According to polling outfit Five Thirty Eight, 38.6 percent of Americans approve of Harris while 50.4 percent disapprove. Biden has 38.5 percent approval and 56.2 percent disapproval.</p>

<p>"If you think that there is consensus among the people who want Joe Biden to leave that they will support Kamala - Vice President Harris - you would be mistaken," Representative Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, a Biden supporter, said on Instagram. "There's no safe option."</p>

<p>The United States elected Barack Obama, the first and only Black president, in 2008. The only woman to head a presidential ticket of a major party, Hillary Clinton, lost to Trump in 2016.</p>

<p>Supporters of Harris, the first woman and first Black and South Asian person to serve as vice president, argue she has already weathered unfair attacks related to her race and gender and is prepared for more.</p>

<p>"America has a history of racism, sexism, so I'm sure that will factor into this conversation, factor into her campaign," said Jamal Simmons, a former Harris aide.</p>

<p>But he said there is a flip side: Black voters could be galvanized if Harris is put at the top of the ticket, and women, including some who regret not voting for Clinton in 2016, would back her as well.</p>

<p>"It's also true that she will benefit from her race and her gender, that many African Americans may rally to her candidacy," he said.</p>

<p>Harris benefits from greater name recognition than the other Democratic leaders who have been floated as potential presidential candidates, he said. California Governor Gavin Newsom and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer are among those talked about in Democratic circles as possible replacements.</p>

<p>"While she has flaws and faults like everyone, we know those flaws and faults, so you can build a campaign with clarity. Any other candidates are complete unknowns," Simmons said.</p>

<p>One former Democratic lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he thought Harris was a bigger risk because of her record than her race.</p>

<p>Harris was plagued by staff turnover at the beginning of her vice presidency and showed little progress on her portfolios of protecting voting rights and stemming migration from Central America.</p>

<p>"I think the race thing is just a compounding factor or an exacerbating factor," the former lawmaker said. "Any of it's going to be a gamble, but I like the odds with another candidate, even if that means Kamala at the top of the ticket."</p>

<h3><strong>'Patriarchy Is Hell Of A Drug'</strong></h3>

<p>Critics have accused Trump of using racist and sexist language, explicitly and in code. In 2020 he said he had "heard" Harris, a U.S. citizen born in California, did not qualify to be a candidate for vice president.</p>

<p>At a rally in Michigan on Saturday, Trump piled on Harris for the way she laughs.</p>

<p>"I call her Laughing Kamala," Trump said. "You ever watch her laugh? She's crazy."</p>

<p>Trump's campaign said Democrats were deploying "classic disinformation" about his language and noted Harris's dispute with Biden in a 2019 debate about school busing and her criticism of Biden for working with segregationists in the Senate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In contrast, President Trump is polling at record-high levels with African Americans," Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump made false "birtherism" claims against Obama, who was born in Hawaii. Those falsehoods gained traction among far-right activists and his nationalist base, prompting an exasperated Obama, blasting "carnival barkers," to release a longer version of his birth certificate from the White House.</p>

<p>Polling at the time showed a quarter of all Americans - and 45 percent of Republicans - believed Obama had not been born in the country.</p>

<p>"You've got birtherism 2.0," said Cliff Albright, co-founder and CEO of Black Voters Matter Fund, an Atlanta-based non-profit, referring to Harris.</p>

<p>Nadia Brown, director of the women's and gender studies program at Georgetown University, said despite the rise of Black political leaders, there remains a notable reluctance to accept women in key leadership roles.</p>

<p>"Patriarchy is a hell of a drug," Brown said. "With racism, we know it, we can call it out. The mood that we're not seeing as articulately expressed is a real reticence to have a Black woman in particular as a leader."</p>

<p>Harris's standing in the party has improved with her aggressive advocacy for reproductive rights after the Supreme Court in 2022 struck down Roe v Wade, which protected women's right to abortion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biden credited her with helping to prevent a "red wave" of Republican victories in that year's midterm elections, and Harris has crisscrossed the country as a top campaign spokesperson on abortion rights.</p>

<p>Harris could also inherit Biden's strong support among Black voters, who helped propel him to the 2020 Democratic nomination.</p>

<p>But if the party ends up coalescing around Harris, she could receive some of the blame from voters who say Democratic leaders covered up Biden's frailties.</p>

<p>"I'm kind of done with the Democrats. So many knew about Biden's condition and hid it. Kamala was part of that," said Gina Gannon, 65, a retiree in the battleground state of Georgia, who voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden's shock decision Sunday to end his reelection bid drew an outpouring of heartfelt reactions from American voters.</p>

<p>Several people expressed deep sadness that Biden, 81, had essentially been forced out after what they saw as an effective first term.</p>

<p>But others said the decision was a relief, given the growing calls for him to step down, and the clear signs of aging seen in his debate against Republican Donald Trump and other appearances.</p>

<p>Here is a selection of their comments.</p>

<p>"It's a shame. But the leader of the free world needs to be sharp, and needs to be on his game.... He is a kind man, he cares about our country, and so for him to be somewhat forced out of his position that he loved so much -- he served our nation for a long, long time -- it is sad." -- Thomas Watson, 67, amateur presidential historian, interviewed in Grand Rapids, Michigan.</p>

<p>"I think that Biden brought it upon himself. His performance has been a debacle. I think that it made the public very nervous as far as him going into this presidential race as a contender against Donald Trump, who is, although, an older individual as well." -- Tayaba Zahra, a 41-year-old lawyer, in New York.</p>

<p>"It's not a surprise. His mental decline has been obvious, I think. And it's a shame" -- Thomas Watson, 67, an amateur presidential historian at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum, in Grand Rapids, Michigan.</p>

<p>"The honest truth is I do think he wasn't equipped... (but) I'm sure for him personally this is a personal kind of devastation." -- Ingrid Gonzalez, 46-year-old entrepreneur and self-described independent, in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>"I'm stunned. And happy - because the decision has finally been made, and now the Democratic Party can get their crap together and figure it out." -- Barb Katz, 59, a retired teacher from Illinois visiting Grand Rapids.</p>

<p>"I hope that there's no nonsense and they put Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket... Think about how invigorated the Democratic Party is going to be." -- Jill Lake, a Democratic voter from Maryland, interviewed in Grand Rapids.</p>

<p>"It makes me nervous in other ways because I don't know that this country is ready to elect a Black woman. But I think that we have to get ready, quick." -- Mary Biggs, a 58-year-old educator, in New York.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican Party presidential candidate Donald Trump crowed, "the Corrupt and Radical Democrats are throwing him overboard" after President Joe Biden announced he was dropping out of the race for the White House.</p>

<p>"He was annihilated in an Earth Shattering Debate," Trump posted on Saturday on Truth Social, the X-like social media platform he uses, mangling the capitalisation of his text.</p>

<p>After the June 27 debate in which his performance raised questions about cognitive abilities and his capacity to match Trump's campaign vitality, Biden announced he was dropping out of the race and endorsing Vice-President Kamala Harris to be the Democratic Party candidate.</p>

<p>Trump piled on personal insults and questions about Biden's performance in the post, "Crooked Joe Biden is the Worst President, by far, in the History of our Nation."</p>

<p>"He has done everything possible to destroy our Country, from our Southern Border, to Energy Dominance, National Security, International Standing, and so much more," Trump said repeating his constant refrain.</p>

<p>Trump alleged that "the people around him lied to America about his Complete and Total Mental, Physical, and Cognitive Demise" to prop up Biden.</p>

<p>Trump did not mention Harris, but said, "Whoever the Left puts up now will just be more of the same."</p>

<p>On Saturday at a campaign rally, Trump ridiculed Harris.</p>

<p>He said, "Kamaala, I call her laughing Kamaala. Have you seen her laughing? She is crazy. You can tell a lot by a laugh. She is nuts. She is not as crazy as (former Speaker) Nancy Pelosi."</p>

<p>CNN reported that Trump said that she (Harris) will be easier to defeat than Biden.</p>

<p>Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. fired the opening salvo on his father's behalf, "Kamala Harris owns the entire Left-wing policy record of Joe Biden. The only difference is that she is even more liberal and less competent than Joe, which is really saying something.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Barack Obama praised US President Joe Biden's decision to drop out of the White House race on Sunday, saying it was testament to the US leader's "love of country" -- but warned of "uncharted waters" ahead of the November 5 election.</p>

<p>Biden had "every right" to run for reelection, the former president said in a statement, lauding the 81-year-old's record and calling him a "patriot of the highest order."</p>

<p>"We will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead. But I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges," he continued.</p>

<p>"Internationally, he restored America's standing in the world, revitalised NATO, and mobilised the world to stand up against Russian aggression in Ukraine," he said.</p>

<p>While he had every right to run for reelection, Biden's decision to drop out of the race was testament to his "love of country", Obama added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If a week is a long time in politics, the last eight days of the US presidential campaign have proved a drama of epic proportions.</p>

<p>Joe Biden's shock decision Sunday to drop out of the 2024 presidential race capped a head-spinning week that began with the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, and has left Americans reeling.</p>

<p>Here is how the week unfolded:</p>

<h3><strong>Saturday: Trump assassination bid</strong></h3>

<p>Republican candidate Donald Trump survives an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, when a 20-year-old on a nearby rooftop opened fire.</p>

<p>Pictures of the bloodied candidate defiantly shaking his fist as Secret Service agents rush him from the stage become iconic, galvanizing his supporters.</p>

<h3><strong>Monday: Republican National Convention begins</strong></h3>

<p>Trump appears before a roaring crowd at the Republican National Convention, his ear -- wounded in the assassination attempt -- covered by a white bandage. He names Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his running mate.</p>

<h3><strong>Wednesday: Pressure on Biden increases</strong></h3>

<p>Biden's support continues to ebb following his disastrous June 27 debate with Trump, as Democratic fears grow over the 81-year-old's age and ability to beat Trump at the polls -- then serve another four years.</p>

<p>A top Democratic lawmaker, Adam Schiff, joins a fast-growing list of party officials urging the president to step aside, praising him but saying "our nation is at a crossroads."</p>

<p>Biden is also diagnosed with Covid, forced to step off the campaign trail and retreat to his Delaware home to recover.</p>

<p>In an interview released the same day, he says he could reconsider his election bid if a "medical condition" emerged.</p>

<h3><strong>Thursday: Pelosi, Obama, Trump</strong></h3>

<p>New signs of waning Democrat support emerge: Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, who had worked to resolve the growing crisis, is said to tell House Democrats the president might be persuaded soon to exit the race.</p>

<p>And Barack Obama, the former president who was once Biden's boss, reportedly tells allies the president should "seriously consider the viability of his candidacy."</p>

<p>In Milwaukee, Trump accepts his nomination at the Republican National Convention, promising an enraptured crowd they can expect an "incredible victory" in November.</p>

<h3><strong>Friday: 'Stakes are high'</strong></h3>

<p>With the list of lawmakers urging Biden to drop out reaching 25, he again insists he will stay in the race, saying, "The stakes are high, and the choice is clear. Together, we will win."</p>

<h3><strong>Saturday: 'Bullet for democracy'</strong></h3>

<p>In his first rally since the attempted assassination, Trump tells a rapt crowd in swing state Michigan "I took a bullet for democracy."</p>

<p>He mocks Democrats' leadership crisis, saying, "They have no idea who their candidate is."</p>

<h3><strong>Sunday: Biden's big decision</strong></h3>

<p>Sunday begins with key Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat-aligned independent, joining the chorus urging Biden to step aside.</p>

<p>Two polls bring grim news for the president, one showing sharply dropping support in battleground state Michigan, the other showing Trump enjoying his highest favorability ratings in years.</p>

<p>At 1.46 pm Washington time (1746 GMT) Biden posts a stunning statement on social media announcing he is ending his candidacy, saying it is "in the best interest of my party and the country."</p>

<p>He endorses Vice President Kamala Harris as the party's new nominee, as top Democrats such as Bill and Hillary Clinton echo their support.</p>

<p>Trump declares on social media that Biden was "not fit to run" and "is certainly not fit to serve." Republicans including House Speaker Mike Johnson insists that Biden "must resign" as president "immediately."</p>

<p>The Democratic Party chairman announces there will be a "transparent and orderly" to pick someone to run in Biden's place.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after President Joe Biden pulled out of the Presidential race, his deputy Kamala Harris became the front-runner to replace him as the Democratic nominee for the November 5 polls. Apart from President Biden himself, leading party figures are rallying behind her. If Harris wins the nomination, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro is favoured to join her on the ticket.</p>

<p>Betting markets put Shapiro at 7/4 odds, followed by North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper at 3/1 and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear at 5/1.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Who is Josh Shapiro?</strong></p>

<p>1. Josh Shapiro was born on June 20, 1973, and grew up in Pennsylvania. His mother was an educator, and his father was a paediatrician. He studied political science at the University of Rochester and later earned a law degree from Georgetown University in Washington, DC. He now lives in Montgomery County with his wife, Lori, and their four children - three school-age sons and a daughter who attends the University of Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>2. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 2004, serving the 153rd District for eight years. He then served as Chairman of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners from 2011 to 2017. In 2016, Shapiro was elected Pennsylvania Attorney General and reelected in 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. During his tenure as Attorney General, Josh Shapiro exposed the Catholic Church's decades-long cover-up of child sexual abuse, identifying 301 predator priests and thousands of victims. He protected healthcare access for nearly 2 million Pennsylvanians and defended reproductive rights and a woman's right to choose. He also held over 100 corrupt officials accountable for breaking the law, regardless of party affiliation. He worked with law enforcement to arrest thousands of drug dealers and remove thousands of illegal guns from the streets. He also supported LGBTQ+ marriage rights. During the 2020 presidential election, Shapiro safeguarded the right to vote and defended Pennsylvania's election results, winning dozens of court cases before and after Election Day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. In January 2021, Josh Shapiro began his second term as Attorney General. During this time, he continued to combat the opioid crisis, arresting over 8,000 drug dealers and holding pharmaceutical companies and their CEOs accountable for their role in the COVID-19 epidemic. He secured over $328 million in relief for Pennsylvanians, including seniors, students, and workers, who had been exploited by private lenders and employers.</p>

<p>5. Josh Shapiro also worked on criminal justice reform, creating a database to track police misconduct. He brought together activists and law enforcement to make this happen. In 2022, he made history, receiving the most votes ever in a Pennsylvania governor's race.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 US Presidential elections, social media has been abuzz with rumours that his health is deteriorating which is why he's been avoiding the public eye.</p>

<p>"Where's Joe" is among the top trends on X (formerly Twitter) globally with people wondering why the US President hasn't made a public appearance in the last five days. The truth: Biden has tested positive for Covid and is isolating, the White House said in a statement last week.</p>

<p>But that hasn't stopped social media users from coming up with theories about the 81-year-old. Several posts claiming that "Joe Biden is in hospice care and unlikely to survive the night" have gone viral on the social platform.</p>

<p>Another theory was floated by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance. The two leaders hit out at the Democratic party for a "coup" against President Biden to push him out of the race.</p>

<p>When asked if Biden's dropping out of the election was a "coup against Joe Biden," Donald Trump said "Sort of," before Vance jumped in.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I think it is. I mean, look, there's a constitutional process, the 25th Amendment. If Joe Biden can't run for president, he can't serve as president," Vance said in an interview with Fox News.</p>

<p>Biden's decision came after internal pressure by the Democratic Party mounted following a widely criticised debate against Trump on June 27. Vice-President Kamala Harris has won the support of the party's lawmakers to take Biden's place in the Presidential elections.</p>

<p>Joe Biden, after his shock announcement Sunday that he was dropping out of the race to the White House, urged his fellow Democrats on Monday to rally around Harris' candidacy.</p>

<p>"She's the best," he said, his voice still hoarse from Covid.</p>

<p>Harris has less than four months to convince the American public she has what it takes for highest office.</p>

<p>Donald Trump was in the lead in polls in the state against Joe Biden, but it is still too early to know whether he will maintain that lead against Kamala Harris.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Former US President Donald Trump on Monday said he refused to use the stretcher after being injured in the shooting at his rally in Pennsylvania.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/trump-says-nobody-warned-him-of-a-problem-before-assassination-attempt-6164525" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a> on Monday said he refused to use the stretcher after being injured in the shooting at his rally in Pennsylvania. He was shot in the ear during an assassination attempt by 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13.</p>

<p>"Well, they wanted to put me on a stretcher. They had a stretcher and they wanted to put me on a stretcher, and I said I'm not going on a stretcher because I just felt it was the ear," Trump told Fox News.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There was a lot of blood. But I understood. They thought I was hit elsewhere...I said, 'I'm telling you I'm OK, I'm fine. I'm going to get up. I want to get up. I'm not going to be taken out on a stretcher,'" he added.</p>

<p>Crooks opened fire on Trump with an AR-style assault rifle just minutes after the Republican US presidential candidate began speaking at the campaign event in Butler.</p>

<p>Crooks was perched on the roof of a nearby building with a clear sightline of the stage and was shot dead by a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/secret-service-chiefs-most-serious-lapse-admission-over-trump-shooting-6164861" target="_blank">Secret Service</a> sniper about 26 seconds after firing the first of eight shots.</p>

<p>A 50-year-old firefighter, Corey Comperatore, was shot dead in the shooting, while two other rally attendees were seriously injured.</p>

<p>Investigators have concluded that the 20-year-old, who lived in a town about 80 kilometers from Butler, acted alone.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump-Biden's Conversation</strong></h3>

<p>In his interview with Fox News, Donald Trump also spoke about his conversation with US President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-what-led-to-joe-bidens-sudden-exit-from-us-presidential-race-6168072" target="_blank">Joe Biden</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You're lucky you turned to the right," Trump said Biden told him, referring to the head tilt half a second before the bullet, which was aimed at his head, grazed his right ear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I said, 'I think so'," he added, calling his chat with Biden a "nice conversation".</p>

<p>He also said the embattled Secret Service chief, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/what-trump-said-on-secret-services-plan-ahead-of-assassination-attempt-6169428" target="_blank">Kimberly Cheatle</a>, came to see him after the shooting. She is under fire after the Secret Service failed in its mission to prevent the assassination attempt on Trump.</p>

<p>"She came to see me. And, well, I mean, it went very nicely. She was very nice, I thought. But, you know, somebody should have made sure there was nobody on that roof," Trump told Fox News.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cheatle served as a Secret Service agent for 27 years before leaving in 2021 to become the head of security in North America for PepsiCo. She was then named to head the agency by Biden in 2022.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Hamas announced Tuesday it had signed an agreement in Beijing with other Palestinian organisations including rivals Fatah to work together for "national unity", with China describing it as a deal to rule Gaza together once the war ends.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas announced Tuesday it had signed an agreement in Beijing with other Palestinian organisations including rivals Fatah to work together for "national unity", with China describing it as a deal to rule Gaza together once the war ends.</p>

<p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who hosted senior Hamas official Musa Abu Marzuk, Fatah envoy Mahmud al-Aloul and emissaries from 12 other Palestinian groups, said they had agreed to set up an "interim national reconciliation government" to govern post-war Gaza.</p>

<p>"Today we sign an agreement for national unity and we say that the path to completing this journey is national unity. We are committed to national unity and we call for it," Abu Marzuk said after meeting Wang and the other envoys.</p>

<p>The announcement comes more than nine months into a war sparked by Hamas's October attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The operatives also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 44 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.</p>

<p>The relentless fighting has plunged Gaza into a severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p>China has sought to play a mediator role in the conflict, which has been rendered even more complex due to the intense rivalry between Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, and Fatah, which partially governs the occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>Israel has vowed to keep fighting until it destroys Hamas, and world powers including key Israeli backer the United States have scrambled to imagine scenarios for the governance of Gaza once the war ends.</p>

<p>Neither Israel nor the United States would sanction any post-war plan that includes Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Washington.</p>

<p>While it is unclear whether the deal announced in Beijing on Tuesday can hold, it does indicate that the only world power that can engineer a rapprochement between the Palestinian rivals is China.</p>

<p>As Tuesday's meeting wrapped up in Beijing, Wang said the groups had committed to "reconciliation".</p>

<p>"The most prominent highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government around the governance of post-war Gaza," Wang said after the factions signed the "Beijing Declaration" in the Chinese capital.</p>

<p>"Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community," Wang said.</p>

<p>Fatah official Mahmoud al-Aloul thanked China for its "unending support" for the Palestinian cause.</p>

<p>"To China, you have our love, you have all our friendship, from all the Palestinian people," he said.</p>

<p>Notably, he did not mention whether any agreement had been reached with Hamas and the other factions.</p>

<p>Also present at Tuesday's meeting were envoys from Egypt, Algeria and Russia, according to Wang.</p>

<p>Egypt, which neighbours Israel and Gaza, is a key mediator in the conflict.</p>

<p>Algeria is a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council and has drafted resolutions on the war.</p>

<p>And while Western powers have sought to isolate Russia over its Ukraine invasion, China has maintained its strategic partnership with Moscow.</p>

<h3><strong>'Peace and stability'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>China, Wang said, was keen to "play a constructive role in safeguarding peace and stability in the Middle East".</p>

<p>He also called for a "comprehensive, lasting and sustainable ceasefire", as well as efforts to promote Palestinian self-governance and full recognition of a Palestinian state at the UN.</p>

<p>Hamas and Fatah have been bitter rivals since Hamas fighters ejected Fatah from the Gaza Strip after deadly clashes that followed Hamas's resounding victory in a 2006 election.</p>

<p>Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which has partial administrative control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>Several reconciliation bids have failed, but calls have grown since the Hamas October attack and nine-month war in Gaza, with violence also soaring in the West Bank where Fatah is based.</p>

<p>China hosted Fatah and Hamas in April but a meeting scheduled for June was postponed.</p>

<p>China has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and supportive of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

<p>China has positioned itself as a more neutral actor on the Israel-Palestinian conflict than its rival the United States, advocating for a two-state solution while also maintaining good ties with Israel.</p>

<p>It has sought to play a greater role in the Middle East in recent years, facilitating last year's historic rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Violence against women and girls in England and Wales is a "national emergency" with almost 3,000 offences recorded daily, police warned in a new report published on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The study, commissioned by two law enforcement bodies, estimates that at least one in every 12 women will be a victim every year, with the exact number expected to be much higher.</p>

<p>"Violence against women and girls is a national emergency," senior police chief Maggie Blyth said in comments accompanying the report.</p>

<p>The study found that more than one million violent crimes against women and girls were recorded by police in 2022-2023.</p>

<p>They accounted for just under a fifth of all police-recorded crime excluding fraud in England and Wales between April 2022 and March 2023.</p>

<p>The report said violence against women and girls had increased 37 per cent between 2018-2019 and last year, with domestic abuse being one of the biggest demands on policing.</p>

<p>One in 20 adults in England and Wales, or 2.3 million people, will be perpetrators of crimes against women and girls annually, the study added.</p>

<p>"These are cautious estimates as we know much crime goes unreported and in policing, we often only see the tip of the iceberg," Blyth said.</p>

<p>She warned that violence against females in the two countries had "reached epidemic levels" and called for government intervention in the "overwhelmed" criminal justice system.</p>

<p>Child sexual abuse and exploitation offences meanwhile jumped by 435 per cent between 2013 and 2022, the report estimated -- from just over 20,000 to nearly 107,000.</p>

<p>Offenders are getting younger, with the average age of a suspect now 15, it said.</p>

<p>The report said stalking and harassment accounted for 85 per cent of online-related offences.</p>

<p>Britain's interior ministry declared violence against women and girls a national threat to public safety in February last year.</p>

<p>More than 4,500 new officers have been trained to investigate rape and serious sexual offences over the last year, with the report detailing a 38-percent increase in charges for adult rape from the year ending December 2022 to the year ending December 2023.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump narrowly escaped death when a 20-year-old shot a 5.56 mm bullet from an AR-15 rifle at a rally in Pennsylvania's Butler on July 13. Mr Trump was shot in the ear, with blood spattered on his face, followed by a first pump. The picture is one of the most iconic frames in modern American political history.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking to Fox News, the former President mentioned his conversation with Secret Service Chief, Kimberly Cheatle, after the shooting, but he said that there should have been a guard on the roof from where Thomas Matthews Crooks, the 20-year-old shooter, fired.</p>

<p>"She came to see me. And, well, I mean, it went very nicely. She was very nice, I thought. But, you know, somebody should have made sure there was nobody on that roof," Mr Trump told<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/trump-rally-shooting-fbi-investigation-attempted-assassination-july-22"> Fox News</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Cheatle acknowledged that the US Secret Service, the premier agency that protects serving and former Presidents, failed in its mission to prevent the assassination attempt. The testimony came during a hearing of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The Secret Service chief said that the roof from the shooter fire was identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.</p>

<p><strong>'130 Yards Is Like A One-Foot Putt'</strong></p>

<p>Talking about the shooter's position, which came up during Trump's conversation with the Secret Service chief, the former President said, "That roof was a dead aim right onto the stage. And they said they didn't have the manpower for it, which is crazy. They said, 130 yards (130 metres) is like sinking a one-foot putt. It's considered close.</p>

<p>The Secret Service chief's admission to the "most significant operational failure in decades" comes after questions were raised on the agency's response to the threat. Ms Cheatle in her testimony admitted that the people in the rally alerted the Secret Service "two to five times" about a man on the roof but he was "not immediately classified as a threat".</p>

<p><strong>'Biden Called Me'</strong></p>

<p>In his interview with Fox News, Mr Trump talked about his conversation with US President Joe Biden, who said, "You're lucky you turned to the right", referring to the head tilt half a second before the bullet, which was aimed at his head, grazed his right ear, saving the former President.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump called his chat with Joe Biden a "nice conversation". He added that the Secret Service agents wanted to carry him off the stage on a stretcher, to which he refused. "They wanted to put me on a stretcher," Trump said. "They had a stretcher, and they wanted to put me on a stretcher. And I said, 'I'm not going on a stretcher."</p>

<p>Ronny Jackson, former White House physician, now a lawmaker in Texas, gave the first detailed account of Trump's injury. Mr Jackson said, "The bullet passed, coming less than a quarter of an inch from entering his head, and struck the top of his right ear."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump, in a recent interview with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/trump-rally-shooting-fbi-investigation-attempted-assassination-july-22">Fox News</a>, shared details of a phone call he had with President Joe Biden following the assassination attempt on him at an election campaign rally in Pennsylvania. Trump, who survived the attempt unscathed, recounted how Biden told him he was "lucky" to have turned his head at the critical moment.</p>

<p>The incident occurred on July 13 during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when a 20-year-old gunman, identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks, shot at Trump. The 78-year-old narrowly escaped injury by turning to look at a chart displayed on a screen just as the shots were fired. Secret Service agents quickly subdued the attacker and shielded Trump.</p>

<p>Reflecting on his chat with Biden, Trump described it as "a nice conversation." He revealed, "He [Biden] said, 'You're lucky you turned to the right.' So... obviously, somebody briefed him. But, he did say that to me. He said, 'You're lucky you turned to the right.' I said, 'I think so.'"</p>

<p>In the interview, Trump mentioned that Secret Service agents were ready to place him on a stretcher due to the initial fear that he had been shot in the abdomen. However, Trump insisted that he was only grazed on the ear, despite the considerable amount of blood that alarmed the agents.</p>

<p>"I just felt it was the ear," Trump said, explaining his refusal to be carried out on a stretcher. "There was a lot of blood," he said, which led to a brief argument with the agents. "I said, 'I'm telling you, I'm OK. I'm fine. I'm going to get up. I want to get up. I'm not going to be taken out on a stretcher.'"</p>

<p>Trump also suggested the need for an investigation into Biden's physical and mental fitness for office. He questioned whether the White House was being fully transparent about Biden's health, hinting at a possible cover-up. "I think somebody has to look at it," Trump said. "Look, you had people that lied to the American public. And I tell you what, you ought to take a look at his doctors because his doctors keep giving him this wonderful report."</p>

<p>The former president also disclosed that he had met with Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle following the assassination attempt. "She came to see me, actually," Trump said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new "vaccine-like" HIV drug that currently costs over $40,000 per person a year could be made for as little as $40, researchers estimated on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The antiretroviral drug Lenacapavir, developed by US pharmaceutical giant Gilead, has been hailed as a potential game-changer in the fight against HIV.</p>

<p>Early trials have found the treatment is 100 per cent effective in preventing HIV infection. And it only needs to be injected twice a year, making the drug far easier to administer than current regimens requiring daily pills.</p>

<p>"It's like having a vaccine basically," Andrew Hill, a researcher at the UK's Liverpool University, told AFP.</p>

<p>The treatment currently costs patients over $40,000 a year in a range of countries including the United States, France, Norway and Australia.</p>

<p>New research, which Hill presented at the International AIDS Conference in Munich on Tuesday, looked into how much the cost of making the drug could come down if Gilead allowed for cheaper generic versions to be manufactured.</p>

<p>A year's worth of the drug could be made for as little as $40 -- 1,000 times less than the current price -- according to the research, which has not been peer-reviewed.</p>

<p>This price was based on production volumes equal to treating 10 million people.</p>

<p>If the drug was given to people at high risk of contracting HIV -- such as gay or bisexual men, sex workers, prisoners or notably young women in Africa -- it could "basically shut down HIV transmission," Hill emphasised.</p>

<p>"We could actually control the epidemic."</p>

<p>There were 1.3 million new HIV infections last year, while 39 million people are living with the virus, according to the World Health Organization.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Opportunity to save the world'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>To estimate the cost, the researchers studied shipments of raw materials of the drug, and spoke to large generic manufacturers in China and India that already make its "building blocks," Hill said.</p>

<p>The international team of researchers has been proven right about similar estimates in the past, he added.</p>

<p>A decade ago, the team said that the cost of making Gilead's hepatitis C drug -- then priced at $84,000 a patient -- could plummet to $100 if generics were allowed.</p>

<p>"Now it costs just under $40 to cure Hepatitis C," Hill said.</p>

<p>The new research was announced a day after UNAIDS chief Winnie Byanyima called on Gilead to "make history" by opening up Lenacapavir to the UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool, which would allow generics to be sold under licence in low- and middle-income nations.</p>

<p>"Gilead has an opportunity to save the world," she told AFP.</p>

<p>The firm has previously said it is in talks with governments and organisations "as we work to reach our access goals".</p>

<p>The firm has not revealed how much it will charge in developing countries -- or which nations could eventually get access to generic versions of the drug</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The number of arrests in days of violence in Bangladesh passed the 2,500 mark in an AFP tally on Tuesday, after protests over employment quotas sparked widespread unrest.</p>

<p>At least 174 people have died, including several police officers, according to a separate AFP count of victims reported by police and hospitals.</p>

<p>What began as demonstrations against politicised admission quotas for sought-after government jobs snowballed last week into some of the worst unrest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's tenure.</p>

<p>A curfew was imposed and soldiers deployed across the South Asian country, and a nationwide internet blackout drastically restricted the flow of information, upending daily life for many.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the Supreme Court pared back the number of reserved jobs for specific groups, including the descendants of "freedom fighters" from Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.</p>

<p>The student group leading the demonstrations suspended its protests Monday for 48 hours, with its leader saying they had not wanted reform "at the expense of so much blood".</p>

<p>The restrictions remained in place Tuesday after the army chief said the situation had been brought "under control".</p>

<p>There was a heavy military presence in Dhaka, with bunkers set up at some intersections and key roads blocked with barbed wire.</p>

<p>But more people were on the streets, as were hundreds of rickshaws.</p>

<p>"I did not drive rickshaws the first few days of curfew, But today I didn't have any choice," rickshaw driver Hanif told AFP.</p>

<p>"If I don't do it, my family will go hungry."</p>

<p>The head of Students Against Discrimination, the main group organising the protests, told AFP in his hospital room Monday that he feared for his life after being abducted and beaten, and the group said Tuesday at least four of its leaders were missing, asking authorities to "return" them by the evening.</p>

<h3><strong>'Killed at random'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The authorities' response to the protests has been widely criticised, with Bangladeshi Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus urging "world leaders and the United Nations to do everything within their powers to end the violence" in a statement.</p>

<p>The respected 83-year-old economist is credited with lifting millions out of poverty with his pioneering microfinance bank but earned the enmity of Hasina, who has accused him of "sucking blood" from the poor.</p>

<p>"Young people are being killed at random every day," Yunus told AFP. "Hospitals do not reveal the number of wounded and dead."</p>

<p>Diplomats in Dhaka also questioned the government's actions, with US Ambassador Peter Haas telling the foreign minister he had shown a one-sided video at a briefing to diplomats.</p>

<p>Government officials have repeatedly blamed the protesters and opposition for the unrest.</p>

<p>More than 1,200 people detained over the course of the violence -- nearly half the 2,580 total -- were held in Dhaka and its rural and industrial areas, according to police officials who spoke to AFP.</p>

<p>Almost 600 were arrested in Chittagong and its rural areas, with hundreds more detentions, tallied in multiple districts across the country.</p>

<h3><strong>'Sheikh Hasina never flees'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>With around 18 million young people in Bangladesh out of work, according to government figures, the June reintroduction of the quota scheme -- halted since 2018 -- deeply upset graduates facing an acute jobs crisis.</p>

<p>With protests mounting across the country, the Supreme Court on Sunday curtailed the number of reserved jobs from 56 per cent of all positions to seven per cent, mostly for the children and grandchildren of "freedom fighters" from the 1971 war.</p>

<p>While 93 per cent of jobs will be awarded on merit, the decision fell short of protesters' demands to scrap the "freedom fighter" category altogether.</p>

<p>Late Monday, Hasina's spokesman told AFP the prime minister had approved a government order putting the Supreme Court's judgement into effect.</p>

<p>Critics say the quota is used to stack public jobs with loyalists to Hasina's ruling Awami League.</p>

<p>Hasina, 76, has ruled the country since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.</p>

<p>Her government is also accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including by the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Joe Biden publicly announced his exit from the presidential race on Sunday and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor. ]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After weeks of criticism and scrutiny, US President Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential race. On Sunday, the president shared his decision to end his reelection campaign in a social media post from his beach house in Delaware while recovering from COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Never before has an incumbent president dropped out of a reelection bid so close to Election Day. The decision came after almost a month of questions surrounding his health and pressure following a lacklustre performance in the June 27 debate against former President Donald Trump. Despite initially standing firm, calls for his exit began to gain traction.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pressure within the Party</strong></p>

<p>Democratic leaders, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, questioned whether Biden's performance was a temporary setback or a sign of deeper issues. The situation worsened when Rep Lloyd Doggett publicly urged Biden to withdraw.</p>

<p>Biden's team attempted to address these concerns through public appearances and statements. However, their efforts were largely unsuccessful. The president's July 5 interview with ABC News, where he stated only the "Lord Almighty" could convince him to leave the race, did little to ease concerns and even angered some Democrats.</p>

<p>Up until his departure, Biden and his team consistently maintained he would remain in the race. He appeared in a high-profile interview with NBC News' Lester Holt, acknowledging his debate shortcomings but criticised media focus on his gaffes instead of Trump's falsehoods. Biden said that only a "medical condition" could force him to reconsider his bid.</p>

<p><strong>Party division</strong></p>

<p>On July 10, actor George Clooney, in an opinion piece published in the New York Times, criticised Biden's performance and urged him to consider withdrawing. Former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's reluctance to endorse Biden only deepened the divisions within the party.</p>

<p>By July 11, the situation reached a tipping point. Biden's public comments and verbal slip-ups, including confusing Vice President Kamala Harris with Trump and referring to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as Russian President Vladimir Putin, raised further doubts about his readiness for another term. This only solidified the view that it was in the best interest of both Democrats and America to have an alternative to Biden.</p>

<p><strong>Joe Biden's exit</strong></p>

<p>Ultimately, the combination of internal pressure, poor polling numbers, and the president's declining public performance led to Biden's decision to withdraw.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Sunday, he publicly announced his exit and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, with just 107 days before the election, this sudden shift presents both risks and opportunities for the party.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tanzania President Samia Suluhu Hassan has fired two senior ministers, including the head of the foreign ministry, in a mini-cabinet reshuffle.</p>

<p>The move comes ahead of expected national elections next year, with the sacked information minister caught in a viral video last week saying "winning in elections is not always determined by the number of votes in the ballot box".</p>

<p>"Mahmoud Thabit Kombo has been appointed a member of parliament and the new minister for foreign affairs and East African cooperation to replace January Makamba whose appointment is revoked," according to a presidency statement issued late Sunday, which did not detail the reasons for the dismissals.</p>

<p>Jerry Silaa -- previously Lands, Housing and Settlement Development -- was appointed to replace Nape Nnauye, Minister for Information, Communications and IT, the statement said.</p>

<p>A viral clip of Nnauye emerged last week in which he said: "Winning in elections is not always determined by the number of votes in the ballot box but depends on who counts and announces the results."</p>

<p>The video attracted widespread criticism from both the opposition and the ruling party, which said the remarks did not reflect its stance.</p>

<p>Nnauye apologised for the clip, saying his comments were meant as a joke and he had been quoted out of context.</p>

<p>But local media reported opposition politician John Mnyika saying the statement "indicates what has been planned within the government and the ruling party".</p>

<p>The reshuffle has also left analysts speculating about the 2025 election, which Hassan is expected to contest.</p>

<p>"I think it's a power play towards the general election next year," said University of Dar es Salaam lecturer Abel Kinyondo.</p>

<p>The move follows her decision in early July to appoint a new intelligence chief.</p>

<p>"Suleiman Abubakar Mombo was sworn to replace Ali Idi Siwa who retired," the presidency said.</p>

<p>Hassan, then deputy president, took office in 2021 after the death of John Magafuli.</p>

<p>Since taking the helm, Hassan has moved away from Magafuli's authoritarian policies and embarked on political reforms, including relaxing some restrictions on the media and the opposition.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 44,000 people, led by black women, logged onto a Zoom call to support US Vice President Kamala Harris and raised more than $1.5 million for her campaign in three hours as she aims for the Oval Office in the west wing of the White House, the Washington Post <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/22/kamala-harris-black-women-zoom/">reported</a>. The presidential bid could make Ms Harris the first woman president of the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Harris today expressed her gratitude for the "overwhelming support" and reaffirmed her commitment to the Democratic presidential nomination, just two days after President Joe Biden, who was seeking re-election, announced his decision to step aside. "When I announced my campaign for President, I said I intended to go out and earn this nomination. Tonight, I am proud to have secured the broad support needed to become our party's nominee, and as a daughter of California, I am proud that my home state's delegation helped put our campaign over the top. I look forward to formally accepting the nomination soon," she said in a statement.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Tonight, I am proud to have earned the support needed to become our party's nominee.<br />
<br />
Over the next few months, I'll be traveling across the country talking to Americans about everything on the line. I fully intend to unite our party and our nation, and defeat Donald Trump. <a href="https://t.co/Bsq3N6pMAi">pic.twitter.com/Bsq3N6pMAi</a></p>
— Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) <a href="https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1815602762870116359?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 23, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Jotaka Eaddy, founder of 'Win With Black Women', which describes itself as a collective of intergenerational, intersectional Black women leaders, said, "Anybody that does not think that Black and Brown women are the backbone of this party (Democratic), they don't know us."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Black women are a key Democratic voting bloc. The call, which attracted several celebrities and political figures, was conducted off the record, with participants speaking in their personal capacities. Attendees described it as feeling like church or a family reunion.</p>

<p>Ms Eaddy has been organising such calls since August 2020. Her organisation aims to elect Black women nationwide and speaks out against racism and sexism. During the 2020 election, the most attendees she had on one Zoom call was 1,500 people but Sunday's call saw more than 40,000 attending.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the large volume of people posed its own challenges for Zoom. The video communications platform has a 1,000-person capacity. When that limit was reached, members of Ms Eaddy's organisation contacted Zoom which upgraded the group to a webinar format, allowing unlimited attendees. "I am forever grateful to the leadership of Zoom for what they did," Ms Eaddy said.</p>

<p>"What happened last night was historic," Ms Eaddy added. "It really is the culmination of so many Black women for years and years and years that have been working, cultivating and creating for this moment. And last night was also a homage, a work to them and their sacrifice."</p>

<p>Notable speakers included Bernice King, the youngest child of Martin Luther King Jr and 85-year-old Democratic Senator Maxine Waters, the most senior Black woman in the US House.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy, who had predicted President Joe Biden would not be the Democratic presidential nominee for the November election, has said the country is not running against a candidate but an unelected managerial class machine.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy, who had predicted President Joe Biden would not be the Democratic presidential nominee for the November election, has said the country is not running against a candidate but an unelected managerial class machine.</p>

<p>The Indian-American businessman-turned-politician said on Monday that the speed at which the ruling Democratic Party moved to replace incumbent President Joe Biden with Vice President Kamala Harris as a possible candidate for the November 5 polls raises lots of questions.</p>

<p>“We're not actually running against a candidate here. We're running against a machine. That's a deep understanding of what's going on that requires rejecting some of the things you might otherwise think,” Ramaswamy said in a 15-minute long video posted on various social media platforms.</p>

<p>During the Republican presidential debate last November, Ramaswamy, 38, had predicted that Biden would not be the Democratic presidential nominee, a claim dismissed as a ‘conspiracy theory' by much of the mainstream media at that time.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Biden shocked the nation by announcing that he is backing out of the presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, who, as of now, is the only Democratic Party leader in the race.</p>

<p>“It's not Biden that we were up against at all. His cognitive deficits, and I would argue Kamala Harris's cognitive deficits, they're not a bug to the people who control them. Those cognitive deficits are a feature. It is a wheel of the managerial class crushing the will of everyday citizens, not just in the Republican Party, but even in the Democratic Party,” he said.</p>

<p>He said that the Democrats may not agree with everything that Donald Trump or the Republican Party says today, and that's fine. No two Americans agree on 100 per cent of policies. That's a rarity, Ramaswamy, who in January suspended his Republican presidential campaign and endorsed former president Donald Trump, said.</p>

<p>But you do deserve a president and a party that at least tells you the truth, not just when it's easy, but when it's hard and when it's uncomfortable, he said.</p>

<p>“Beyond just this individual game, whether it's Joe or whether it's Kamala, we got to realise the thing that we're actually solving for is defeating that machine, the rise of that managerial class, bigger than any other individual, it embodies the philosophy of what the modern left is really about,” he said in the video that went viral on social media.</p>

<p>“It's not about individual agency. It's that collective will. That's what this machine really is about.... That's really what we're running against. That's what we're running to defeat. That's the system we're running to break. That's what the deep state is really about,” Ramaswamy said.</p>

<p>“This is about the unelected managerial, you could call them elites, you could call them bureaucrats, you could call them monarchs, who have no accountability to the people, but whose decisions are actually most impactful on how citizens live their lives,” he said and urged the Democrats to put their best possible nominee for the elections.</p>

<p>Ramaswamy alleged that this is a party and a movement on the Democrat side that has made it its core reason for existence to keep former president Trump out of office. “They've tried every way to stop him within the legal system and extra-legally as well.” But all their efforts to keep him from the ballot have not just failed but backfired making Trump and the Republican Party more popular, he added.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While the Paris Olympics is set to be a festival of socialising and intermingling, city authorities are keen for visitors not to encounter any of the capital's notorious furry inhabitants.</p>

<p>Humorously portrayed in the hit animated film "Ratatouille", the French capital's abundant rat population is no joke for the city's residents -- and could be an embarrassment as the Olympics spotlight falls on Paris.</p>

<p>"All of the Olympic sites and celebration areas were analysed (for rats) before the Games," Deputy Mayor Anne-Claire Boux, who has responsibility for public health, told AFP in an interview.</p>

<p>As well as ordering a deep clean to remove any food residues that might tempt the scurriers from their underground lairs, the mayor's rodent specialists also worked to close up exit points from the sewers around the sites.</p>

<p>"Where there were areas with lots of rats we put traps in place ahead of the Games," Boux continued, adding that both mechanical rat traps and chemical solutions were used to reduce troublesome populations.</p>

<p>The park behind the Eiffel Tower, where the beach volleyball is set to take place, and the Louvre gardens, where the Olympic cauldron is set to burn, are popular picnic spots -- and previously rat infested.</p>

<p>"Ultimately, no one should aim to exterminate Paris's rats, and they're useful in maintaining the sewers," she added. "The point is that they should stay in the sewers."</p>

<h3><strong>Spruced up&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Paris vermin, a feature in French literature from "Les Miserables" to "The Phantom of the Opera", are frequently drawn into a contemporary debate about cleanliness in the French capital.</p>

<p>Current mayor Anne Hidalgo, a Socialist who relies on support from the Greens, is regularly accused by her conservative critics of failing to keep the capital free from the scourges of rubbish, rodents and dog excrement.</p>

<p>A viral social media campaign in 2021 called #SaccageParis (#TrashedParis) led to residents posting pictures of overflowing bins, badly maintained street furniture or overgrown green spaces that hurt the city's cultivated reputation for elegance.</p>

<p>The city unveiled a "manifesto for beauty" afterwards in response to the criticism.</p>

<p>Ahead of the Olympics, its boulevards and squares have been thoroughly spruced up, with many historic buildings given a makeover.</p>

<p>Boux stressed that rat problems were first and foremost caused by food being left out on the ground, or from overflowing waste bins, many of which are being changed around Paris to new rat-proof versions.</p>

<p>"The most important thing is that the bins are sealed and closed," she said.</p>

<h3><strong>Caricature?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The city's rodent exterminators -- known as the "Smash" team -- have also had an advisory role to the Paris organising committee, suggesting ways to design their sites to keep them clean and orderly.</p>

<p>Responsibility for waste removal and street cleaning will fall to the city's 7,500-strong cleaning and collection teams, whose three-week strike last year led to an estimated 10,000 tonnes of garbage pile up in the streets.</p>

<p>They are set to earn bonuses of up to 1,900 euros for working through the Olympic period, while private contractors are also set to reinforce efforts to keep the city clean.</p>

<p>"I'm not at all worried (about rats)," deputy mayor in charge of waste, Antoine Guillou, told AFP. "On the contrary, the Games will help us show definitively that this idea that you run into lots of rats in Paris is false.</p>

<p>"There are some, we deal with them, but they're not an issue specific to Paris nor on the scale that is sometimes suggested in a caricatural way," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-2024-kamala-harris-draws-on-prosecutorial-skills-against-donald-trump-in-election-bid-6166170" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a> on Tuesday said she has earned the support needed to become the Democrat presidential nominee, two days after Joe Biden, who was seeking re-election, announced to bow down.</p>

<p>"When I announced my campaign for President, I said I intended to go out and earn this nomination. Tonight, I am proud to have secured the broad support needed to become our party's nominee, and as a daughter of California, I am proud that my home state's delegation helped put our campaign over the top. I look forward to formally accepting the nomination soon," she said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/vivek-ramaswamys-prediction-on-joe-bidens-re-election-bid-comes-true-6159220" target="_blank">Joe Biden</a>, who was seeking a rematch against Republican candidate Donald Trump in the November 5 US elections, announced to step aside on Sunday.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old ended the re-election bid amid mounting pressure over his health concerns and pledged to remain in office until his term ends in January 2025. He has now thrown his support behind 59-year-old Harris.</p>

<p>"I am grateful to President Biden and everyone in the Democratic Party who has already put their faith in me, and I look forward to taking our case directly to the American people," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-presidential-campaign-raises-81-million-since-joe-biden-steps-aside-6166065" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a>, the first Black American and first Indian-American to be elected vice president, said.</p>

<p>"This election will present a clear choice between two different visions. Donald Trump wants to take our country back to a time before many of us had full freedoms and equal rights. I believe in a future that strengthens our democracy, protects reproductive freedom, and ensures every person has the opportunity to not just get by, but to get ahead," Harris&nbsp;said.</p>

<p>"I fully intend to unite our party, unite our nation, and defeat Donald Trump in November," she added.</p>

<p>An unofficial survey of delegates by the news agency Associated Press showed Kamala Harris with more than 2,500 delegates, well over the 1,976 needed to win a vote in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Democratic party is scheduled to announce the presidential nominee by August 7.</p>

<p>Replacing Biden atop the ticket has also revved up speculation about who might join Harris as a vice presidential candidate.</p>

<p>According to reports, the people being discussed are Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, US Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla and SpaceX chief Elon Musk, in an interview with American conservative commentator Jordan Peterson, alleged that his estranged transgender daughter, Vivian Jenna Wilson, was "killed" by what he termed the "woke mind virus" after being persuaded into agreeing to gender-affirming care procedures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the interview, Mr Musk referred to gender-reassignment surgery as "child mutilation and sterilisation". The world's richest man claimed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, he was convinced to sign documents for one of his children.</p>

<p>"I was essentially tricked into signing documents for one of my older boys," Mr Musk stated. "This was really before I had any understanding of what was going on, and we had Covid going on, so there was a lot of confusion and I was told [my child] might commit suicide."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">

<p>Mr Musk, who is also the owner of X (formerly Twitter), accused those involved in promoting gender-affirming care of targeting children "who are far below the age of consent."</p>

<p>"I was tricked into doing this," Mr Musk claimed. "I lost my son, essentially. They call it 'deadnaming' for a reason. The reason they call it 'deadnaming' is because your son is dead."</p>

<p>The experience, Mr Musk claims, has set him on a mission to combat what he describes as the "woke mind virus." He said, "I vowed to destroy the woke mind virus after that. And we're making some progress."</p>

<p>Vivian Jenna Wilson, Mr Musk's 20-year-old daughter, legally changed her name and gender at the age of 18. This legal transition occurred on June 22 in 2022 at a court in California.</p>

<p>"I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape, or form," Ms Wilson had said back then. Ms Wilson's mother, Justine Wilson, a Canadian author, divorced Mr Musk in 2008.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At a kids' role-playing theme park in Seoul, 23-year-old Park Woo-joo is on a very adult mission: the university-educated but unemployed South Korean is searching for his future career.</p>

<p>Part of a Mexican-owned global chain, KidZania typically offers young children the chance to play at dozens of different jobs, from firefighter to dentist, in giant indoor centres, including one in Seoul that receives hundreds of thousands of visitors a year.</p>

<p>But KidZania South Korea has been pioneering a new use for its Seoul venue: helping unemployed young people find their real-life calling, at nostalgia-laced, wildly popular, adults-only events.</p>

<p>Despite labour shortages linked to its super-low birthrate, youth unemployment in South Korea is stubbornly high -- the result, experts say, of a mismatch between the highly educated youth and the realities of the country's labour market.</p>

<p>Park has a degree in business administration but has not been able to find a job he wants, so last month he was one of 500 people who bought a ticket for the sold-out "Kids-ania" event for adults -- the name is a pun in Korean, effectively meaning "Not Kids".&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the sprawling indoor theme park, while people dressed as police officers and Supreme Court judges role-played in purpose-built areas, Park told AFP he was eager to "experience as much as possible".&nbsp;</p>

<p>He's hoping that, by testing out a bunch of potential careers, he might have a "lightbulb" moment and discover what he should be doing with his life.</p>

<p>"I think it's a great way for people who are unemployed to have fun and learn at the same time," he told AFP.</p>

<h2><strong>Nostalgia tour&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>The adult events were the brainchild of Kang Jae-hyung, president of KidZania South Korea, who told AFP he wanted to help the young people who might have come to the park when it first opened in 2010.</p>

<p>"The kids who were seven years old when they first came here are now 21," Kang said.</p>

<p>His colleagues were skeptical about the idea and he initially faced internal opposition, he said, but tickets for the first event sold out immediately.</p>

<p>Kang said that many young South Korean adults need to tap into their innate sense of fun, and not take working life too seriously.</p>

<p>"I just want them to remember what they wanted to do when they were young," said Kang, adding that it was important "not to crush children's dreams".</p>

<p>Lee Soo-min, 20, has memories of going to KidZania -- and said the place seemed the same when she returned over a decade later.</p>

<p>"But it seems I've changed," she said.</p>

<p>Standing in line at a radio studio to try her hand at being a DJ, Lee, a university student who said she was trying to figure out what to do with her life, told AFP: "Now, I begin to take these experiences seriously."</p>

<h2><strong>Aspirations vs reality&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>With the world's lowest birthrate, South Korea's population has long been shrinking.</p>

<p>The country's working-age population will begin falling off from 2028, official projections show, and many sectors of the economy, from agriculture to restaurants and care homes, already suffer from widespread labour shortages, with immigration tightly limited.</p>

<p>Even so, the country has persistently high youth unemployment, currently at 6.2 percent, more than double the overall rate of 2.9 percent, official figures show.</p>

<p>The number of young people classified as "resting" -- neither employed nor actively seeking work -- hit 426,000 last month, the second-highest rate since records began in 2003. The highest was during the pandemic.</p>

<p>The problem, experts say, is that young South Koreans would rather not work than work in a job perceived as unpopular or beneath them.</p>

<p>For example, nearly half of young South Koreans are reluctant to join small or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), official figures show -- even though such businesses make up some 98 percent of the economy, with high-profile corporations such as Samsung just 2 percent.</p>

<p>This mismatch between the aspirations of highly educated young people and the realities of the labour market "gradually deepens unemployment among highly educated youth," said Hwang Gwang-hoon, an associate research fellow at the Korea Employment Information Service.</p>

<p>South Korea has turned to automation of production lines and even CCTV to ease labour crunches -- with, for example, many convenience stores now unmanned -- but the country also needs to create more "quality jobs", Hwang said, especially in SMEs.</p>

<p>For KidZania's Kang, unemployed young people need to let go of the fears and embarrassments that may be holding them back in the job market.</p>

<p>"Do what you want to do. Don't be self-conscious," he said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A day after US President Joe Biden opted out of the presidential race, Donald Trump's campaign said it was a "once-in-a-lifetime" opportunity to "defeat not just one Democrat nominee for president, but two in the same year.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A day after US President Joe Biden opted out of the presidential race and endorsed his deputy Kamala Harris, their Republican rival Donald Trump's campaign said it was a "once-in-a-lifetime" opportunity to "defeat not just one Democrat nominee for president, but two in the same year."</p>

<p>In a memorandum issued on Monday as Vice President Kamala Harris kicked off her presidential campaign, the Trump Campaign took credit for Biden's decision to drop out of the race and asserted the "'War on Democracy' will be stopped by the man who took a bullet for democracy".</p>

<p>Donald Trump survived an attempt on his life on July 13 when a young gunman fired multiple shots at the former US president at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, injuring his right ear.</p>

<p>"After being thoroughly decimated by President Trump three weeks ago at the debate in Atlanta, Joe Biden was fired. He was fired by Donald Trump. He has now been turned out to pasture, yet the Biden record of weakness and failure still stands," stated the memorandum titled "State of the Play Day 1".</p>

<p>It has been authored by Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles from the Trump Campaign.</p>

<p>"Just as Donald Trump fired Joe Biden, he will demonstrate to the world he can fire dangerously liberal Kamala as well. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to defeat not just one Democrat nominee for president, but two in the same year!" Kamala Harris is as bad, if not worse, than Joe Biden, the memorandum alleged.</p>

<p>Claiming that Trump was leading against Harris in various polls, it said, "And where does the race stand? In every public poll conducted, battleground and national, Donald Trump leads Kamala Harris by the same -- if not more -- than Joe Biden." "The latest HarrisX / Forbes poll shows President Trump with a nine-point lead over Kamala. Democrat polling released just today has President Trump over 50 and leading by six in Pennsylvania, over 50 and leading by eight in Arizona, up two in Michigan and up one in Wisconsin," the memorandum stated.</p>

<p>"Let's also not forget, the Biden campaign has spent in excess of USD 150 million, money they can't get back. Same year, same people, same record of failure, same result," it said.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign alleged that the same people weaponize the judicial system to falsely accuse and indict the former president on 40 "manufactured" charges relating to the presidential records - a case that has since been thrown out of court.</p>

<p>It also claimed that Trump's political rivals utilised the FBI to stage a raid on the former president's home and "use the courts as a vehicle to go after the (former) president's lifetime of assets.</p>

<p>"State Courts led by Democrats in Washington put together attempts to deny ballot access in key states -- an attempt defeated and ultimately thrown out by the United States Supreme Court," the memorandum said.</p>

<p>"And if that wasn't bad enough, President Trump survived an assassination attempt," the memorandum alleged. "The liberal elite and deep state, sensing the American public's disgust with their lawfare and now in a desperate Hail Mary, have swapped out an incumbent President for the incumbent Vice President in a ploy to try and shake up the race."</p>

<p>The memorandum claimed that "border Czar Kamala Harris owns the border invasion, which has resulted in nearly 100 terrorists roaming the United States, hundreds of thousands of American dead due to Fentanyl, a child trafficking epidemic resulting in killings and kidnappings, a crime directly linked to Harris' own beliefs and backed by her actions, released migrants who prey and kill innocent Americans." "How do you deal with such heinous beliefs? Aggressively, in detail, and without quarters. The left and deep state have pulled out all the stops in their maniacal attempts to retain power," it said.</p>

<p>"This is a fight for American Independence -- independence from the oppressive weight of the Harris inflation tax, independence from the war against American energy and edicts for all-electric cars, the independence that will once again make the US respected on a world stage, independence from an oppressive government hellbent on taking away parental rights, independence from a border invasion that risks social security, public safety and the rule of law," the memorandum said.</p>

<p>"The restoration of American Independence... starts today. This 'War on Democracy' will be stopped by the man who took a bullet for Democracy," said the Trump Campaign.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The failed assassination bid on former US President Donald Trump is the "most serious" security lapse since the then President Ronald Regan was shot in 1981, the head of the US Secret Service conceded to lawmakers on Monday.</p>

<p>US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle conceded this during her testimony before the House Oversight and Accountability Committee about the attempted assassination of Trump, wherein she was grilled by lawmakers, including two Indian American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi and Ro Khanna.</p>

<p>Mr Khanna asked Cheatle to resign as the Director of the US Secret Service.</p>

<p>"If you have an assassination attempt on a president, a former president or a candidate, you need to resign," Mr Khanna said, noting that Stewart Knight, the then secret service head in 1981 had resigned.</p>

<p>"You cannot go leading a Secret Service agency when there is an assassination attempt on a presidential candidate. I would say that about anyone who is running," he said.</p>

<p>Responding to another question from Mr Khanna, Cheatle said: "Yes, sir, I would," when asked: "Now, Director Cheatle, would you agree that this is the most serious security lapse since President Reagan was shot in 1981, of the Secret Service?"</p>

<p>At the same time, she said in response to a question from Congresswoman Virginia Fox: "I have taken accountability, and I will continue to take accountability. I am responsible for leading the agency and I am responsible for finding the answers to how this event occurred and making sure that it doesn't happen again."</p>

<p>Cheatle told Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi that the incident was under investigation.</p>

<p>"According to NBC, just two minutes later, at 5:53 pm, the Secret Service notified its snipers about the gunman. The rally wasn't paused at that point either, correct?" he asked. "No," she said.</p>

<p>She had no answer when Mr Krishnamoorthi asked if the assassin was on the roof and everybody was yelling at him, but the Secret Service took no action.</p>

<p>"We are currently still combing through communications and when communications were passed," she said.</p>

<p>"I can point you to this communication as two minutes before the shots started ringing out. Director Cheatle, yes or no, was there ever a moment where the Secret Service actually considered pausing the rally?" an angry Krishnamoorthi asked.</p>

<p>"The Secret Service would have paused the rally had they known or been told there was an actual threat," she said.</p>

<p>"The people that are in charge of protecting the president on that day would never bring the former president out if there was a threat that had been identified," Cheatle said.</p>

<p>In response to a question from Congressman James Cooper about why the Secret Service didn't place a single agent on the roof, she said: "We are still looking into the advanced process and the decisions that were made."</p>

<p>The building was outside of the perimeter on the day of the visit, she said. "That is one of the things that during the investigation we want to take a look at and determine whether or not other decisions should have been made," she added.</p>

<p>The Secret Service has acknowledged it denied some requests by Trump's campaign for increased security at his events in the years before the assassination attempt.</p>

<p>The attack on Trump was the latest in a series of security lapses by the agency that has drawn investigations and public scrutiny over the years.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Hindu temple in Canada's Edmonton was defaced with anti-India graffiti on Monday. The BAPS Swaminarayan Temple was targeted early this morning, the Hindu American Foundation said, adding that the slurs used in the grafitti attacked Indian-origin Canadian MP Chandra Arya.</p>

<p>The organisation shared a photo of the defacement in a post on X.</p>

<p>"The @chcconline is confirming that the @BAPS temple in Edmonton, Canada became the latest Hindu temple targeted for an attack early this morning. The temple was defaced with slurs threatening @AryaCanada, one of a few Hindu Members of the Canadian House of Commons. We are outraged by this latest incident that mirrors several previous attacks—many blamed on pro-Khalistan activists," the post read</p>

<p>MP Chandra Arya said that Hindu temples in Canada have increasingly being "vandalised".</p>

<p>"The Hindu temple BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Edmonton is vandalised again. During the last few years, Hindu temples in the Greater Toronto Area, British Columbia, and other places in Canada are being vandalised with hateful graffiti," Arya said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Arya, a Liberal member of Parliament known for his advocacy on multicultural issues, pointed to the impunity enjoyed by "Khalistani extremists" in Canada.</p>

<p>"As I have always been saying, Khalistani extremists seem to get away with ease with their public rhetoric of hate and violence. Again, let me put it on record. Hindu Canadians are legitimately concerned. Like a broken record, I again call on Canadian law enforcement agencies to take this issue seriously before these rhetorics get translated into physical action against Hindu Canadians," he said.</p>

<p>Canadian law enforcement agencies have been urged to take proactive measures to address these threats and ensure the safety and security of all religious communities in Canada.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck off the coast of Russia's far-eastern Kamchatka Peninsula early Sunday morning local time, according to the regional earthquake monitoring service.</p>

<p>The local emergencies ministry said tremors were felt along the coast including in the region's capital Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.</p>

<p>"Operational teams of rescuers and firefighters are inspecting buildings," the regional branch of Russia's emergencies ministry in the Kamchatka region said on Telegram.</p>

<p>The earthquake struck at a depth of nearly 50 kilometres (30 miles) just after 7:00 am local time, some 90 kilometres east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, the United States Geological Survey reported.</p>

<p>The US National Tsunami Warning Center had initially issued a tsunami threat, but later said the threat had passed. Local authorities never issued a tsunami alert.</p>

<p>Several aftershocks were recorded after the initial quake, but of lower intensity, the Kamchatka branch of Russia's Unified Geophysical Service reported on its website.</p>

<p>The peninsula lies on a seismically active belt surrounding most of the Pacific Ocean known as the "Ring of Fire", and is home to more than two dozen active volcanoes.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaza has recorded its first polio case in 25 years, the Palestinian health ministry said on Friday, after UN chief Antonio Guterres called for pauses in the Israel-Hamas war to vaccinate hundreds of thousands of children.</p>

<p>Tests in Jordan confirmed the disease in an unvaccinated 10-month-old from the central Gaza Strip, the health ministry in Ramallah said.</p>

<p>According to the United Nations, Gaza, now in its 11th month of war, has not registered a polio case for 25 years, although type 2 poliovirus was detected in samples collected from the territory's wastewater in June.</p>

<p>"Doctors suspected the presence of symptoms consistent with polio," the health ministry said. "After conducting the necessary tests in the Jordanian capital, Amman, the infection was confirmed."</p>

<p>The case emerged shortly after Guterres called for two seven-day breaks in the Gaza war to vaccinate more than 640,000 children.</p>

<p>Poliovirus, most often spread through sewage and contaminated water, is highly infectious. It can cause deformities and paralysis and is potentially fatal. It mainly affects children under the age of five.</p>

<p>The UN health and children's agencies said they had made detailed plans to reach children across the besieged Palestinian territory and could start this month.</p>

<p>But that would require pauses in the 10-month old war between Israel and Hamas, they said.</p>

<p>"Preventing and containing the spread of polio will take a massive, coordinated and urgent effort," Guterres told reporters at UN headquarters in New York.</p>

<p>"I am appealing to all parties to provide concrete assurances right away guaranteeing humanitarian pauses for the campaign."</p>

<p>The World Health Organization and UN children's fund UNICEF said they were planning two seven-day vaccination drives across the Gaza Strip, starting in late August, against type 2 poliovirus (cVDPV2).</p>

<p>Last month, it was announced that type 2 poliovirus had been detected in samples collected in Gaza on June 23.</p>

<p>"These pauses in fighting would allow children and families to safely reach health facilities and community outreach workers to get to children who cannot access health facilities for polio vaccination," the agencies said in a statement said.</p>

<h3><strong>Regional public health issue</strong></h3>

<p>After 25 years without polio, its re-emergence in the Gaza Strip would threaten neighbouring countries, it added.</p>

<p>"A ceasefire is the only way to ensure public health security in the Gaza Strip and the region."</p>

<p>During each round of the campaign, the health ministry in Gaza, alongside UN agencies, would provide "two drops of novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) to more than 640,000 children under 10 years of age".</p>

<p>More than 1.6 million doses of nOPV2 were expected to transit through Israel's Ben Gurion Airport "by the end of August", the statement added.</p>

<p>The war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the toll from Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza passed 40,000, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which does not provide a breakdown of civilian and Hamas casualties.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The UN's nuclear watchdog warned on Saturday that the safety situation at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was "deteriorating" following a nearby drone strike.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN's nuclear watchdog warned on Saturday that the safety situation at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was "deteriorating" following a nearby drone strike.</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, Russia accused Ukraine of dropping an explosive charge on a road near the occupied plant in southern Ukraine.</p>

<p>The plant, which was seized by Russia's forces early in the war, has come under repeated attacks that both sides have accused each other of carrying out.</p>

<p>International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) experts on site were informed of the detonation near essential plant facilities on Saturday and immediately visited the area, the agency said in a statement.</p>

<p>They reported that the damage "seemed to have been caused by a drone equipped with an explosive payload," impacting the road between the plant's two main gates.</p>

<p>"Yet again we see an escalation of the nuclear safety and security dangers facing the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant," IAEA head Rafael Grossi said in the statement.</p>

<p>"I remain extremely concerned and reiterate my call for maximum restraint from all sides," he said.</p>

<p>The "nuclear safety situation" at the plant was "deteriorating," the statement added.</p>

<p>The IAEA team on site reported "intense" military activity over the past week in the area, including very close to the plant, it added.</p>

<p>"The team has heard frequent explosions, repetitive heavy machine gun and rifle fire and artillery at various distances from the plant," it said.</p>

<p>Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the IAEA has repeatedly urged restraint, saying it fears reckless military action could trigger a major nuclear accident at the plant.</p>

<p>Kyiv and Moscow traded blame last weekend after a fire broke out at a cooling tower at the plant.</p>

<p>IAEA experts were able to visit the base of the cooling tower but have requested further access to assess the situation, according to the Vienna-based IAEA.</p>

<p>The fire resulted in "considerable damage", but there was no immediate threat to nuclear safety, the agency said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris will hold dueling campaign events this weekend in Pennsylvania, the political battleground that could be the most critical state in the Nov. 5 presidential election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris will hold dueling campaign events this weekend in Pennsylvania, the political battleground that could be the most critical state in the Nov. 5 presidential election.</p>

<p>Trump, the former president, will hold a rally on Saturday in Wilkes-Barre in the northeastern part of the state. Vice President Harris will conduct a bus tour of western Pennsylvania starting in Pittsburgh on Sunday, ahead of the kickoff of the Democratic National Convention on Monday in Chicago.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania was one of three Rust Belt states, along with Wisconsin and Michigan, that helped power Trump's upset victory in the 2016 election. President Joe Biden, who grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, flipped the trio back to the Democrats in 2020.</p>

<p>The three states are true bellwethers - the only U.S. states to have voted for the eventual winner of the presidential race in every cycle since 2008.</p>

<p>With 19 electoral votes out of the 270 needed to secure the White House, compared with 15 in Michigan and 10 in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania may be the biggest prize in this year's election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A statistical model created by Nate Silver, an election forecaster, estimates that Pennsylvania is more than twice as likely as any other to be the "tipping point" state - the one whose electoral votes push either Harris or Trump over the top.</p>

<p>Harris' entry into the race after Biden ended his reelection bid last month has upended the contest, erasing the lead Trump built during the final weeks of Biden's shaky campaign. Harris is leading Trump by more than two percentage points in Pennsylvania, according to the poll tracking website FiveThirtyEight.</p>

<p>Blanketing Airwaves With Ads</p>

<p>Trump won Pennsylvania in 2016 by about 44,000 votes, a margin of less than one percentage point, while Biden prevailed by just over 80,000 votes in 2020, a 1.2% margin.</p>

<p>Both campaigns have made the state a top priority, blanketing the airwaves with advertisements. Of the more than $110 million spent on advertising in seven battleground states since Biden dropped out in late July, roughly $42 million was spent in Pennsylvania, more than twice any other state, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing data from the tracking site AdImpact.</p>

<p>Democratic and Republican groups have already reserved $114 million in ad time in Pennsylvania from late August through the election, more than twice as much as the $55 million reserved in Arizona, the next highest total, according to AdImpact.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign said on Saturday it planned to spend at least $370 million on digital and television ads nationwide between the Labor Day holiday on Sept. 2 and Election Day.</p>

<p>The battleground states - seen as critical for winning the election - also include Arizona, North Carolina, Nevada and Georgia.</p>

<p>New polls published on Saturday by the New York Times found Harris leading Trump among likely voters in Arizona, 50% to 45%, and in North Carolina, 49% to 47%, and narrowing the former president's leads in Nevada, 47% to 49%, and in Georgia, 46% to 50%. A pollster from the Trump campaign said the poll results underestimated the Republican candidate's support.</p>

<p>Trump and Harris have visited Pennsylvania more than half a dozen times each this year. Trump was wounded during an assassination attempt at his rally near Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13.</p>

<p>He has said he will return to Butler in October, and also announced he will give remarks on the economy at a campaign event in York, Pennsylvania, on Monday. Trump's running mate, U.S. Senator JD Vance, will deliver remarks in Philadelphia that day as well.</p>

<p>Trump's trip on Saturday to Wilkes-Barre in Luzerne County is aimed at solidifying support among the white, non-college-educated voters who lifted him to victory in 2016. The blue-collar county voted Democratic for decades before swinging heavily toward Trump in 2016, mirroring other similar regions around the country.</p>

<p>Trump won Luzerne in 2020 by 14.4 percentage points, a smaller margin than his 19.4 point win in 2016. With Biden out of the picture, Trump likely sees room for gains in this area of the state, said Chris Borick, a political science professor at Muhlenberg College.</p>

<p>"This is the type of place where Trump has lots of strengths," Borick said, referring to the state's northeast region. "Marginal gains in a region like this certainly could have some impact on his ability to take back Pennsylvania."</p>

<p>Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, will make multiple stops across Allegheny and Beaver counties on Sunday, the campaign said. The tour is the first time Harris, Walz and their spouses have campaigned together since their first rally as a presidential ticket in Philadelphia earlier this month.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania was at the heart of Biden's victorious 2020 strategy across the Rust Belt states: limiting Trump's margins among working-class white voters while building majorities among suburban voters and driving higher turnout in urban areas with large Black populations.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign is pursuing a similar "win big, lose small" strategy, aiming for large margins in the cities and suburbs of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, while limiting losses in smaller counties like Beaver County, where Trump won 58% of the vote in 2020.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Germany, the second largest contributor of aid to Ukraine, plans to halve its military aid to Kyiv in 2025, a parliamentary source told AFP Saturday.</p>

<p>Instead, the government of Olaf Scholz will bank on money generated from frozen Russian assets to continue supporting Kyiv, and is not planning "additional aid" to the 4 billion euros ($4.4 billion) set aside in next year's budget.</p>

<p>This year, aid from Berlin amounted to 8 billion euros.</p>

<p>To compensate, Germany is counting on "the creation, within the framework of the G7 and the European Union, of a financial instrument using frozen Russian assets, said a separate source from inside the ministry of finance.</p>

<p>German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung said in its weekend edition that the move was part of an agreement between the chancellor, the Social Democratic party (SPD) and Finance Minister Christian Lindner.</p>

<p>Lindner is a member of junior coalition partner the Liberal party.</p>

<p>Ukraine's ambassador to Germany Oleksii Makeiev said in a posting on X, formerly Twitter, that "the security of Europe depends on Germany's political will to continue to play a frontline role in supporting Ukraine".</p>

<p>The 2025 budget has been the subject of fierce discussions between the government coalition of Liberals, the Greens and the Social Democrats.</p>

<p>Lindner has asked other ministries to make savings in order to respect a constitutional rule that aims to prevent the state from taking on too much debt.</p>

<p>However the budget is still subject to discussions before being adopted by the end of the year. The finance ministry said Saturday it was open to considering extra spending for Ukraine on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>Ukraine's allies have been working for several months on a mechanism to allow part of the $300 billion of Russian assets frozen worldwide to be used to support Kyiv in its war with Moscow.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Firefighters were battling a strong forest fire in Turkey's Aegean city of Izmir for a third day on Saturday, AFP reporters said, with hundreds more people evacuated overnight.</p>

<p>In the northern suburb of Ornekkoy, AFP journalists saw the charred remains of several buildings and vehicles in an industrial zone while grey smoke billowed into the sky.</p>

<p>"We don't know what to do. Our workplace is located in the middle of the fire. We have lost our livelihood," said 48-year-old Hanife Erbil, who earns a living collecting paper and plastic waste.</p>

<p>The pine trees that once crowned the surrounding hills were also burned.</p>

<p>"It was such a beautiful route, it smelled of pine trees everywhere. It makes me want to cry," said taxi driver Ayhan.</p>

<p>A witness who wished to remain anonymous told AFP by telephone that the smell of smoke was hanging over the city, the third most-populated in Turkey.</p>

<p>Firefighters from other Turkish cities have been sent as reinforcements and the army has been mobilised.</p>

<p>"Everyone is working hard. I'm on my 36th hour of service. We can say the fire is partially under control," said Izmir firefighter Arjin Erol.</p>

<p>The fire started on Thursday and was quickly spread to residential areas by winds blowing at 50 kilometres (30 miles) an hour.</p>

<p>Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said 900 residents in five affected districts were evacuated overnight in Izmir.</p>

<p>The fire damaged 16 buildings and affected 78 people, with 29 of them admitted to hospital, the Turkish health ministry said.</p>

<p>Wild animals, cats and dogs died in the fire but no human victim has yet been reported.</p>

<p>"Currently, two planes and eleven helicopters are continuing to intervene," said Agriculture and Forestry Ministry Ibrahim Yumakli, after the strong winds had earlier grounded the helicopters and water bombers.</p>

<p>Residents of the city should not be "worried", he added.</p>

<p>Around 1,600 hectares (3,900 acres) have been affected, the minister said, adding that the challenging geography was making it difficult to put out the fire at its origin.</p>

<p>Six other fires continue to rage in forest areas in other cities in Turkey, including northwestern Bolu and Aydin in the west.</p>

<p>In June, a fire that broke out in Mardin in southeastern Turkey claimed the lives of 15 people.</p>

<p>Scientists say climate change makes extreme weather events including heatwaves more likely, longer lasting and more intense, increasing the risk of wildfires.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Media platform X said on Saturday it would close its operations in Brazil "effective immediately" due to what it called "censorship orders" from Brazilian judge Alexandre de Moraes.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The decision to close the ? office in Brazil was difficult, but, if we had agreed to <a href="https://twitter.com/alexandre?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@alexandre</a>'s (illegal) secret censorship and private information handover demands, there was no way we could explain our actions without being ashamed.</p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1824854726657049023?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 17, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>X claims Alexandre Moraes secretly threatened one of its legal representatives in the South American country with arrest if it did not comply with legal orders to take down some content from its platform. Brazil's Supreme Court, where Alexandre Moraes has a seat, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>The X service remains available to the people of Brazil, billionaire Elon Musk's platform said on Saturday.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Alexandre Moraes ordered X to block certain accounts, as he investigates so-called "digital militias" that have been accused of spreading fake news and hate messages during the government of far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro.</p>

<p>Alexandre Moraes opened an inquiry earlier this year into the billionaire after Musk said he would reactivate accounts on X that the judge had ordered blocked. Musk has called the Alexandre Moraes' decisions regarding X "unconstitutional."</p>

<p>After Musk's challenges, X representatives reversed course and told Brazil's Supreme Court that the social media giant would comply with the legal rulings.</p>

<p>Lawyers representing X in Brazil in April told the Supreme Court that "operational faults" have allowed users who were ordered blocked to stay active on the social media platform, after Alexandre Moraes had asked X to explain why it allegedly had not fully complied with his decisions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday his forces were "strengthening" their positions in Russia's Kursk region, where Kyiv has been mounting a major ground offensive for more than 11 days.</p>

<p>His comments came a day after Moscow accused Ukraine of destroying a key bridge over a river in the border region, as Kyiv seeks to disrupt supply routes and the movement of Moscow's troops in the area.</p>

<p>Ukrainian army chief Oleksandr Syrsky "reported on the strengthening of the positions of our forces in the Kursk region and the expansion of stabilised territory", Zelensky said in a post on Telegram.</p>

<p>"As of this morning, we have replenished the exchange fund for our country," Zelensky said, referring to Russian soldiers Ukraine has captured to be used in future prisoner swaps.</p>

<p>"I thank all the soldiers and commanders who are taking Russian soldiers prisoner and thus bringing the release of our soldiers and civilians held by Russia closer," Zelensky said.</p>

<p>Kyiv claims to have taken control of more than 80 settlements in the lightning incursion, which caught the Kremlin off guard almost two and a half years into its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Russian defence ministry said on Saturday it had pushed back Ukrainian forces near three settlements in the Kursk region, and was searching for "mobile enemy groups" trying to pierce deeper into the country.</p>

<p><strong>Bridge 'completely destroyed'</strong></p>

<p>Russian officials on Friday accused Ukraine of striking a strategically important bridge just a couple dozen kilometres away from fighting in the Kursk region.</p>

<p>The region's governor, Alexei Smirnov, said on Friday evening the bridge was in the Glushkovsky district, some 11 kilometres (seven miles) away from the border.</p>

<p>An aerial video published by Ukrainian air force commander Mykola Oleshchuk appeared to show the bridge being hit by a projectile at high speed before collapsing in a cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>"Ukrainian pilots are conducting precision strikes on enemy strongholds, equipment concentrations, as well as on enemy logistics centres and supply routes," he said on Telegram.</p>

<p>Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the bridge was "completely destroyed" and that "volunteers providing assistance to the evacuated civilian population were killed".</p>

<p>"All those responsible for these inhumane acts will be severely punished," she said.</p>

<p>Russia separately accused Ukraine on Saturday of dropping an explosive charge on a road near the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine.</p>

<p>The plant, which was seized by Russia's forces early in the war, has come under repeated attacks that both sides have accused each other of carrying out.</p>

<p>Russia meanwhile attacked at least four Ukrainian regions on Saturday, according to officials, including the northeastern region of Kharkiv, where prosecutors said shelling killed a 49-year-old woman.</p>

<p><strong>'Under control'</strong></p>

<p>While the incursion has delivered a major morale boost to Kyiv, it appears to have had little impact on the larger battles raging in Russian-occupied parts of eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>Zelensky said on Saturday there had been "dozens of Russian assaults" on Ukrainian positions near the towns of Pokrovsk and Toretsk, where Moscow has made a string of advances in recent weeks.</p>

<p>"Our soldiers and units are doing everything to destroy the occupier and repel the attacks," Zelensky said, stressing the situation was "under control".</p>

<p>Russia said Friday its forces had captured another village near Pokrovsk, a Ukrainian-held logistics hub that lies on a road supplying troops and towns across the eastern front.</p>

<p>Russian forces have been inching towards the town for months, taking a string of tiny villages over the past weeks.</p>

<p>The head of Pokrovsk's military administration, Sergiy Dobryak, warned on Thursday that Russia was a little over 10 kilometres from the outskirts of the city and urged remaining residents to evacuate.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the past month, Israeli combat engineers have destroyed approximately 50 Hamas tunnel routes in the area of the Egypt-Gaza border, the Israel Defense Forces said on Thursday. The announcement came as Israeli and Arab leaders were due to resume ceasefire negotiations in Qatar.</p>

<p>The tunnels were all in the Philadelphi corridor, a buffer zone that runs the length of the 14-km Gaza-Egypt border. It was created in 2006 to prevent weapons smuggling after Israel disengaged from the Strip. Hamas violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority the following year.</p>

<p>The military did not specify if any of the tunnels crossed into the Egyptian Sinai. On August 4, soldiers from the IDF's elite Yahalom combat engineering unit destroyed a three-meter tall smuggling tunnel leading into Egypt that was large enough to drive vehicles through.</p>

<p>Securing the Philadelphi corridor and destroying smuggling tunnels there is a critical goal to prevent Hamas from rearming and to curtail its leaders from escaping into the Sinai with Israeli hostages.</p>

<p>At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas's attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 111 remaining hostages, 39 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About 68 million people in Southern Africa are suffering the effects of an El Nino-induced drought which has wiped out crops across the region, the regional bloc SADC said on Saturday.</p>

<p>The drought, which started in early 2024, has hit crop and livestock production, causing food shortages and damaging the wider economies.</p>

<p>Heads of state from the 16-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC) were meeting in Zimbabwe's capital Harare to discuss regional issues including food security.</p>

<p>Some 68 million people, or 17% of the region's population, are in need of aid, said Elias Magosi, SADC executive secretary.</p>

<p>"The 2024 rainy season has been a challenging one with most parts of the region experiencing negative effects of the El Nino phenomenon characterised by the late onset of rains," he said.</p>

<p>It is Southern Africa's worst drought in years, owing to a combination of naturally occurring El Nino - when an abnormal warming of the waters in the eastern Pacific changes world weather patterns - and higher average temperatures produced by greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>Countries including Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi have already declared the hunger crisis a state of disaster, while Lesotho and Namibia have called for humanitarian support.</p>

<p>The region launched an appeal in May for $5.5 billion in humanitarian assistance to support the drought response, but donations have not been forthcoming, said outgoing SADC chair Joao Lourenco, President of Angola.</p>

<p>"The amount mobilised so far is unfortunately below the estimated amounts and I would like to reiterate this appeal to regional and international partners to redouble their efforts... to help our people who have been affected by El Nino," he told the summit.</p>

<p>The drought is a major talking point at this year's summit, alongside issues such as the ongoing conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, which Lourenco said was a source of great concern.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Around 100 firefighters tackled a large blaze at London's historic Somerset House cultural centre on Saturday, with images posted on social media showing flames leaping out from underneath its roof.</p>

<p>"Fifteen fire engines and around 100 firefighters have now been sent in response to the fire at Somerset House. Crews are tackling a fire located in part of the building's roof," the London Fire Brigade posted on X, formerly Twitter.</p>

<p>Other footage taken from central London showed thick plumes of smoke rising above the building, which stretches for around 180 metres along the banks of the River Thames.</p>

<p>The official X account of the Renaissance building, which opened in 1796, said that "owing to a fire in one small part of Somerset House, the site is currently closed," but then appeared to delete the post.</p>

<p>The courtyard of the grand building hosts music gigs in the summer, and a popular ice rink in the winter, appearing in the 2003 film "Love Actually".</p>

<p>It has also appeared in two James Bond films, the 2008 movie "The Duchess", starring Keira Knightley and Ralph Fiennes, and Tim Burton's 1999 horror flick "Sleepy Hollow".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[At least 17 Palestinians were killed and dozens wounded in an Israeli strike in the Gaza town of Zawayda on Saturday, health officials said, as Israel issued new evacuation orders, citing Hamas rocket fire nearby.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 17 Palestinians were killed and dozens wounded in an Israeli strike in the Gaza town of Zawayda on Saturday, health officials said, as Israel issued new evacuation orders, citing Hamas rocket fire nearby.</p>

<p>Most of the people killed were from the same family and they included eight children and four women, according to health officials in the Hamas-administered enclave.</p>

<p>Israel's military said it was aware of the reports of the strike and was looking into them.</p>

<p>"They were asleep in their beds, kids and babies, then three missiles targeted their place," said Abu Ahmed Hassan, a neighbour. The owner of the house was a known merchant, he said. "There are no military activities here at all," he added.</p>

<p>Israel's military spokesperson in Arabic posted instructions on X on Saturday for people in parts of central Gaza, including in Maghazi district which is near Zawayda, to evacuate to a designated humanitarian zone.</p>

<p>He said operatives were firing rockets from those locations and that the military was preparing to act against them.</p>

<p>Reuters could not immediately verify whether any areas of Zawayda were among those ordered to evacuate and whether people there received the military's instructions. Residents said thousands were streaming out of Maghazi.</p>

<p>On Friday, two sections of the southern city of Khan Younis within what Israel has designated as a humanitarian zone were deemed dangerous by the military, which ordered people to evacuate them saying that operatives had been regularly firing rockets from there.</p>

<p>The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said Friday's orders, which also included other areas of the enclave outside the humanitarian zones, had affected around 170,000 displaced people.</p>

<p>"This is one of the largest evacuation orders affecting the zone to date and it shrinks the size of the so-called 'humanitarian area' to about 41 square kilometres, or 11 per cent of the total area of the Gaza Strip," an OCHA report said.</p>

<p>In the central part of the enclave, residents said that Israeli tanks advanced further on Saturday into the eastern area of Deir Al-Balah, an area they had not invaded before, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said that since Friday its forces had killed dozens of operatives, including some who had fired rockets from central and southern Gaza.</p>

<p>Most of Gaza's 2.3 million population has been displaced by the 10-month-old Israeli offensive, which has laid waste to much of the enclave.</p>

<p><strong>CEASEFIRE TALKS PAUSED</strong></p>

<p>Ceasefire talks in Doha, mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt, paused on Friday with negotiators to meet again next week seeking an agreement to end the fighting between Israel and Hamas and free remaining hostages.</p>

<p>U.S. President Joe Biden said on Friday that no party in the Middle East should undermine efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal that he said was now in sight, while at the same time warning that negotiations were "far from over."</p>

<p>Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said in response that reports of an agreement being close were "deceptive claims".</p>

<p>The war was triggered on Oct. 7 when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent military campaign has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to Gaza health authorities. Israel has lost 330 soldiers in Gaza and says at least a third of the Palestinian dead are fighters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A 15-year-old boy who created a soap that could "transform skin cancer treatment" has been chosen as the 2024 Kid of the Year by Time magazine and Time for Kids.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 15-year-old boy who created a soap that could "transform skin cancer treatment" has been chosen as the 2024 Kid of the Year by <em>Time </em>magazine and Time for Kids. Heman Bekele from Virginia, US, is a teen scientist "who could change how we treat skin cancer," the outlet stated in its announcement released Thursday. He was chosen after he created a soap that could be a "more accessible way to deliver medication to treat skin cancers, including melanoma," the magazine said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's absolutely incredible to think that one day my bar of soap will be able to make a direct impact on somebody else's life," the 15-year-old told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://time.com/6996507/heman-bekele/"><em>Time</em></a>. "That's the reason I started this all in the first place," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bekele has been seeing the effects of the sun on people's skin since he was a young boy growing up in Ethiopia. He noticed many people working in the sun without protecting their skin, the outlet reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Years later, after his family immigrated to the US, the 7-year-old Bekele got a chemistry set for Christmas that came with sodium hydroxide. It was then he began learning the power of chemical reactions. Around that time, he also started thinking more critically about the potential damage prolonged sun exposure can have on the human body. So, he became interested in the research surrounding skin cancer and its treatment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I'm really passionate about skin cancer research," he told the magazine. "Whether it's my own research or what's happening in the field."</p>

<p><strong>Also Read |<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/ever-wondered-what-happens-to-foam-in-space-heres-the-answer-6352402">&nbsp;Ever Wondered What Happens To Foam In Space? Here's The Answer</a></strong></p>

<p>Bekele eventually learned about imiquimod, a drug that was already approved to treat some forms of skin cancer. When used in a cream form, it can also help destroy tumours. So, the 15-year-old found a way to use imiquimod to treat earlier stages of skin cancer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Almost everyone uses soap and water for cleaning. So soap would probably be the best option," Bekele said about why he decided to develop a soap.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, there are still many stages to go before the soap is approved to be used as treatment. According to <em>Time</em>, Bekele potentially has about a decade to go before the soap is approved as a cancer treatment. In the meantime, he's promoting it in presentations; that is when he's not playing in the marching band and enjoying a game of chess.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will hold the next edition of the '2+2" dialogue with their Japanese counterparts next week with a focus on further boosting overall strategic ties and reviewing the situation in the Indo-Pacific.</p>

<p>External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on Friday that the third edition of India-Japan 2+2 foreign and defence ministerial dialogue will be held on August 20 in New Delhi.</p>

<p>The first edition of the dialogue was held in India in 2019 while the second one took place in Japan in 2022.</p>

<p>Japan's foreign minister Yoko Kamikawa and defence minister Minoru Kihara will be in New Delhi to attend the '2+2' dialogue.</p>

<p>The talks will give a major boost to overall India-Japan ties, Mr Jaiswal said.</p>

<p>The '2+2' dialogue with Japan was initiated to further deepen bilateral security and defence cooperation and bring greater depth to the special strategic and global partnership between the two countries.</p>

<p>India has the '2+2' ministerial format of dialogue with very few countries including the US, Australia and Russia.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 36-year-old Indian-origin man has been shot and killed after a teenage boy robbed a convenience store in the US state of North Carolina, authorities said.</p>

<p>Mainank Patel, the owner of the Tobacco House store at 2580 Airport Road, died after the shooting on Tuesday morning, the Salisbury Post reported.</p>

<p>A juvenile male is in custody for the crime, according to Rowan County Sheriff's Office. Because the young man is a juvenile, deputies are not able to release his name.</p>

<p>The juvenile was arrested Tuesday evening but no additional details have been released.</p>

<p>Deputies initially responded to the Tobacco House convenience store in response to a 911 hang-up call, said Captain Mark McDaniel, public information officer for the Rowan County Sheriff's Office.</p>

<p>While they were en route to the location, communications were received that there had been a shooting. When the deputies arrived on scene they found Patel suffering from multiple gunshot wounds, said McDaniel.</p>

<p>The victim was taken to Novant Health Rowan Medical Center and then transported to Presbyterian Hospital in Charlotte, where he died as a result of his injuries, the report added.</p>

<p>A security video showed a tall, slender white male running across the store parking lot away from the building. He was wearing black shorts, a black hoodie, a black ski mask and white Nike tennis shoes with burgundy logos, and appeared to have a black handgun in his hand, said McDaniel.</p>

<p>McDaniel said that the sheriff's office is not certain of the motive in the shooting, but that it currently appears to have been a robbery. No one else was injured.</p>

<p>Patel leaves behind his seven-and-a-half-month pregnant wife, Ami, and their 5-year-old daughter.</p>

<p>Customers and workers say Patel would do just about anything for anybody, and the community is in mourning over his death.</p>

<p>Everyone called him "Mike." And it's evident by all the flowers and cards outside his store, Tobacco House, Wednesday that he was loved.</p>

<p>"It hit everybody because this was a family, this was a community family store," said Ann Ellis, a customer.</p>

<p>Javier Lopez has been cutting the grass at the store for years, even before Patel took over from his cousin, Lopez said, and the Patel family "treated everyone like family.</p>

<p>I just saw him yesterday morning, and on my way home from work, I saw the police and stopped to see what had happened.</p>

<p>"There are just no words to describe how great a guy Mike was," he continued.</p>

<p>"He was a super good man, good to his customers, loved his family and would have helped anyone," said Patricia Howard, another regular customer at the store.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When my colleagues and I set to work on a century-old cosmic mystery, we found an unexpected celestial laboratory in Terzan 5, a dense star cluster currently plunging through our galaxy at breakneck speed.</p>

<p>This stellar oddity has allowed us to study the behaviour of cosmic rays – high-energy particles whose erratic paths through space have baffled astronomers since their discovery in 1912.</p>

<p>By observing radiation produced by Terzan 5's cosmic rays, we've achieved a scientific first: measuring how quickly these particles change direction due to fluctuations in interstellar magnetic fields. Our research is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41550-024-02337-1">published today in Nature Astronomy</a>.</p>

<h2>Fast-moving radiation from outer space</h2>

<p>Cosmic rays are something no one expected to be there. When radioactivity was first discovered in the 1890s, scientists thought all sources of radiation were on Earth.</p>

<p>But in 1912, Austrian-American physicist Victor Hess measured the ambient radiation level in a high-altitude balloon and discovered it was much higher than at ground level, even during an eclipse when the Sun was blocked. This meant the radiation had to be coming from space.</p>

<p>Today we know the mysterious radiation Hess discovered as cosmic rays: atomic nuclei and elementary particles such as protons and electrons that have somehow been accelerated to nearly the speed of light. These particles zip through interstellar space, and thanks to their high energies a small fraction of them can penetrate the upper atmosphere, as Hess discovered.</p>

<p>But we cannot easily tell where they come from. Cosmic rays are charged particles, which means their direction of travel changes when they encounter a magnetic field.</p>

<h2>The staticky picture of the cosmic ray cosmos</h2>

<p>The magnetic deflection effect provides the basic technology for old cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors and televisions, which use it to steer electrons toward the screen to create a picture. Interstellar space is full of magnetic fields, and those fields are constantly fluctuating, deflecting cosmic rays in random directions – sort of like a broken CRT in an old TV that only shows static.</p>

<p>So instead of cosmic rays coming straight to us from their source like light does, they wind up spreading out almost uniformly across the galaxy. Here on Earth we see them coming almost equally from all directions in the sky.</p>

<p>While we now understand this general picture, most of the details are missing. The uniformity of cosmic rays across the sky tells us that cosmic ray directions randomly change, but we have no good way of measuring how fast this process happens.</p>

<p>Nor do we understand the ultimate source of the magnetic fluctuations. Or we didn't, until now.</p>

<h2>Terzan 5 and the displaced gamma rays</h2>

<p>That's where Terzan 5 comes in. This star cluster is a copious producer of cosmic rays, because it contains a large population of rapidly rotating, incredibly dense and magnetised stars called millisecond pulsars – which accelerate cosmic rays up to extremely high speeds.</p>

<p>These cosmic rays don't make it all the way to Earth, thanks to those fluctuating magnetic fields. However, we can see a telltale sign of their presence: some of the cosmic rays collide with photons of starlight and convert them into high-energy <em>uncharged</em> particles called gamma rays.</p>

<figure><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kU84eSQXFho?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" width="650"></iframe>

<figcaption><span class="caption">Terzan 5 is a ‘globular cluster' of stars near the heart of our galaxy.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The gamma rays travel in the same direction as the cosmic ray that created them, but unlike the cosmic rays, the gamma rays are not deflected by magnetic fields. They can travel in a straight line and reach Earth.</p>

<p>Because of this effect, we often see gamma rays coming from powerful sources of cosmic rays. But in Terzan 5, for some reason the gamma rays don't exactly line up with the positions of the stars. Instead, they seem to be coming from a region about 30 light-years away, where there is no obvious source.</p>

<h2>A galactic-scale ‘comet'</h2>

<p>This displacement has been an unexplained curiosity since it was <a href="https://www.mpg.de/4352553/gamma-ray_emission_terzan_5">discovered in 2011</a>, until we came up with an explanation.</p>

<p>Terzan 5 is close to the centre of our galaxy today, but it isn't always. The star cluster is actually moving in a very wide orbit that keeps it far off the plane of the galaxy most of the time.</p>

<p>It just happens to be plunging through the galaxy right now. Because this plunge takes place at hundreds of kilometres per second, the cluster sweeps up a cloak of magnetic fields around itself, like the tail of a comet plunging through the solar wind.</p>

<figcaption><span class="caption">The globular cluster Terzan 5 (centre) is shown in visible light, overlaid with gamma ray intensity. The gamma ray source is centre below and to the right of Terzan 5. A zoomed-in version of the central region is shown in the upper left.</span> <span class="attribution"><a class="source" href="https://www.mpg.de/4352553/gamma-ray_emission_terzan_5">ESO / Digitized Sky Survey 2 / F. Ferraro</a></span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Cosmic rays launched by the cluster initially travel along the tail. We don't see any of the gamma rays these cosmic rays produce, because the tail isn't pointed directly at us – these gamma rays are beamed along the tail and away from us.</p>

<p>And here is where the magnetic fluctuations come in. If the cosmic rays stayed well-aligned with the tail, we would never see them, but thanks to magnetic fluctuations their directions start to change.</p>

<p>Eventually, some of them start to point toward us, producing gamma rays we can see. But this takes roughly 30 years, which is why the gamma rays don't seem to be coming from the cluster itself.</p>

<p>By the time enough of them are pointing at us for their gamma rays to be bright enough to be visible, they have travelled 30 light-years down the magnetic tail of the cluster.</p>

<h2>Cosmic rays and interstellar magnetic fields</h2>

<p>So thanks to Terzan 5, for the first time we have been able to measure how long it takes magnetic fluctuations to change cosmic ray directions. We can use this information to test theories for how interstellar magnetic fields work and where their fluctuations come from.</p>

<p>This brings us a big step closer to understanding the mysterious radiation from space discovered by Hess more than 100 years ago.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Cuban President Fidel Castro died at the age of 90 from natural causes. However, not many know that the revolutionary leader survived not 10 or 20 but over 600 assassination attempts. For almost half a century, the attempts at Cuba's most iconic leader involved spies, Mafia hitmen, James Bond-style death devices, and other methods that may seem like something out of an Ian Fleming novel.<br />
<br />
Now, a new docuseries, Mafia Spies, streaming on Paramount+, exposed the actual how the CIA cooperated with the mafia to organise Castro's assassination. It's based on a book, authored by Thomas Maier, of the same name.<br />
<br />
The intricate storylines and large ensemble of politicians, mobsters, spies, revolutionaries, and entertainers feature in the six episodes of Mafia Spies.<br />
<br />
Castro was the newly appointed prime minister of Cuba, and the CIA, then headed by Allen Dulles, intended to topple him.<br />
<br />
To assassinate Castro, the CIA recruited organised criminal figures, Sam Giancana and John Roselli of the Chicago Outfit, through a middleman named Robert Maheu, who was an attorney and businessman.<br />
<br />
Notably, the mafia had their own motivations for wanting Castro gone as Havana's casinos ceased to be a cash cow sanctuary for them when he took over in 1959.<br />
<br />
The series sheds light on the unsuccessful 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis and the 1963 assassination of US President John F. Kennedy.<br />
<br />
In an attempt to accomplish its aim, the CIA and its mafia allies used everything from poison tablets to a deadly "honey pot" that involved enlisting a woman to murder and seduce.<br />
<br />
Maier's book is based in large part on documents on Kennedy's assassination that the National Archives published in batches in 2017 and 2018.<br />
<br />
The JFK records demonstrate that despite their deadly reputation, Giancana and Roselli, the Mafia duo, were unable to assassinate Castro.<br />
<br />
A potential assassin in Havana was handed poison tablets by the CIA. However, he got cold feet before tampering with Castro's food.<br />
<br />
The Church Committee, a Senate committee that documented abuses by intelligence services in the mid-1970s, claims that the cigar plot, perhaps the most well-known attempt on Castro's life, began in 1960.<br />
<br />
According to the Committee's investigation, an official was handed a box of Castro's favourite cigars along with orders to inject them with deadly poison. The cigars were tainted with a botulinum toxin so strong that ingesting one would result in death. It is unclear from the record if there was an effort to give Castro the cigars.<br />
<br />
Castro loved scuba diving, so it should come as no surprise that the CIA investigated the potential of creating an explosive seashell to assassinate him during one of his outings.<br />
<br />
According to the Church Committee report, in 1963, Desmond Fitzgerald, the head of the [anti-Castro CIA] Task Force, ordered his assistant to find out whether it would be possible to place a seashell that could be set to detonate in a place where Castro frequently went diving.<br />
<br />
Other unsuccessful Florida-based commando operations were attributed to misfortune or inauspicious timing.<br />
<br />
Fighters with CIA training who were discovered invading Cuban coastlines during nighttime assaults were frequently imprisoned and occasionally put to death by firing squad.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The JFK documents also show how Castro's own network of double agents and supporters in Florida thwarted CIA operations and assisted in protecting the communist leader.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A few of the conspirators who were associated with the two gangsters betrayed them for personal gain.<br />
<br />

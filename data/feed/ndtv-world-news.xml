       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Actor George Clooney, one of the Democratic Party's leading fundraisers, on Wednesday made an emotional and heartfelt plea for President Joe Biden to end his faltering reelection campaign.</p>

<p>Clooney -- a member of the Hollywood elite that provides key support to the Democrats -- joined a growing list of public figures calling for Biden, 81, to step aside after his terrible debate performance against Donald Trump last month.</p>

<p>"I love Joe Biden," Clooney wrote in the New York Times. "I consider him a friend, and I believe in him... But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time."</p>

<p>A self-described "lifelong Democrat," Clooney co-hosted a star-studded fundraiser with Biden in Los Angeles only last month featuring former president Barack Obama.</p>

<p>The Biden campaign said that the event brought in a record $28 million.</p>

<p>"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010," Clooney wrote, referencing a famous hot-mic clip from Biden's vice presidency.</p>

<p>"He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate," Clooney said -- a direct challenge to Biden's claim that his poor debate showing was a one-off.</p>

<p>"The dam has broken" on Democratic lawmakers publicly calling for Biden to withdraw, Clooney said, asking more come forward.</p>

<p>"Top Democrats -- Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi -- and senators, representatives and other candidates who face losing in November need to ask this president to voluntarily step aside."</p>

<p>The Oscar-winner brushed aside worries that Biden's exit would create chaos four months before an election in which the Democrats hope to keep Trump from power, and did not endorse a replacement candidate.</p>

<p>The party should hear from contenders such as Vice President Kamala Harris, Maryland Governor Wes Moore and others, "then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out," he wrote.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's two-day visit to Moscow and the outcomes of his summit talks with President Vladimir Putin were "historic and game-changing" considering the prevailing turbulent geopolitical environment, Russia's Charge d'affaires Roman Babushkin said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The Russian diplomat said the focus of the talks between the two leaders was on expanding India-Russia trade and economic ties.</p>

<p>In his first trip since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, PM Modi paid a two-day visit to Moscow on July 8 and 9 during which he held summit talks with Putin.</p>

<p>"The leaders have decided to strengthen cooperation in all areas. It is a historic and game-changing move, especially given the turbulent environment around us," Mr Babushkin said at a media briefing.</p>

<p>"It has got unprecedented coverage and presumably overshadowed all other events. It seemed that the whole world was watching it," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Babushkin also criticised the US for making certain comments ahead of PM Modi's visit to Moscow and described the remarks as interference in ties between the two nations.</p>

<p>"It was the conduct of two independent global powers based on mutual trust and respect. The external factors don't play much role when it comes to Russia-India relations," he said.</p>

<p>India and Russia have established foundational convergences in key areas of our cooperation, he said.</p>

<p>The senior diplomat said both sides vowed to expand cooperation in a range of key areas including fossil fuel, nuclear energy and trade.</p>

<p>Highlighting key outcomes of the summit talks, Babushkin said India and Russia decided to go ahead with a bilateral payment system using national currencies.</p>

<p>If you noticed, one of the most important points of the joint statement was that we have decided to go ahead with the establishment of a payment system under the framework of national currency settlement, he said.</p>

<p>In the PM &nbsp;Modi-Putin talks, the two sides set a target of USD 100 billion in annual trade volume by 2030 and vowed to develop a robust bilateral payment settlement mechanism using national currencies.</p>

<p>On India's demand to Russia to ensure the return of Indians working in the Russian Army, he said, "We are on the same page with India on this issue." We hope it will be resolved soon, he said when the Indians return home.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the world grapples with climate change and soaring temperatures, a worrying statistic has come to light - last month was the hottest June ever recorded on earth, according to the European Union's climate agency. Not just that, June also became the 12th consecutive month to surpass the 1.5 degrees celsius threshold for global warming.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The last month was 0.14 degrees warmer than June 2023, said <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-june-2024-marks-12th-month-global-temperature-reaching-15degc-above-pre-industrial">EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service</a> (C3S) report. The figures from the EU's climate agency highlight that each month over the past year has consistently broken records for unprecedented heat, making it the hottest respective month ever recorded on the planet. While it is an unusual phenomenon, a similar streak of monthly global temperature records happened previously in 2015-2016.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 1.5 degrees global warming mark was internationally accepted in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/convention/application/pdf/english_paris_agreement.pdf">2015 Paris agreement</a>, where the world leaders of over 200 nations agreed to limit the increase in global average temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels to reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. &nbsp;</p>

<p>According to C3S Director Carlo Buontempo, the record-breaking temperatures in the last one year point to a "large and continuing shift in our climate." "Even if this specific streak of extremes ends at some point, we are bound to see new records being broken as the climate continues to warm. This is inevitable, unless we stop adding [greenhouse gases] into the atmosphere and the oceans," he said in a statement. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The new concerning figures also point out that 2024 could surpass 2023 as the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/2024-could-be-worlds-hottest-year-as-june-breaks-records-6063105">hottest year ever </a>recorded, said a report by news agency Reuters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist at US non-profit Berkeley Earth, there is an approximately 95% chance that 2024 beats 2023 to be the warmest year since global surface temperature records began in the mid-1800s.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Finally, with the first six months of data in for the year, I now estimate that there is an approximately 95% chance that 2024 beats 2023 to be the warmest year since global surface temperature records began in the mid-1800s: <a href="https://t.co/nWLfRJ7Yd8">pic.twitter.com/nWLfRJ7Yd8</a></p>

<p>The soaring temperatures across the globe brought with them devastating consequences. Over 1,300 people reportedly died during Hajj this year, said Saudi Arabia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>India reported over 40,000 cases of suspected heat stroke and over 100 heat-related deaths during the relentless and continuous heatwave. According to the Centre for Holistic Development, a non-governmental organization, as many as 192 homeless deaths were reported in Delhi during June 11-19.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The room behind Buckingham Palace's famous balcony opens to the public for the first time next week, giving a rare glimpse into one of the royal residence's inner sanctums.</p>

<p>For decades the royal family has been seen emerging from the room after coronations, weddings and other landmark occasions.</p>

<p>From the appearance of World War II leader Winston Churchill alongside the royal family in 1945 to the wedding of King Charles III and Princess Diana in 1981, the balcony and the room behind it has repeatedly played witness to history.</p>

<p>But despite endless images of the balcony, the room itself has always been kept under wraps.</p>

<p>Charles most recently appeared on it following his birthday parade last month along with his daughter-in-law Catherine, Princess of Wales.</p>

<p>The 42-year-old princess's presence drew huge interest as it was her first appearance at an official royal event since she announced she was undergoing cancer treatment earlier this year.</p>

<p><strong>'Connect' with the people</strong></p>

<p>Visitors will be able to see the room as part of a tour of the palace's east wing -- the first time it has been opened to the public since it was created around 175 years ago.</p>

<p>Almost 6,000 tickets for the new tour were snapped up within hours of going on sale in April.</p>

<p>The wing was added between 1847-49 to accommodate the growing family of Queen Victoria and her husband Prince Albert.</p>

<p>"It was Prince Albert's idea to have a balcony at Buckingham Palace, because he saw it as a way of enabling the royal family to connect with the people, and of course that's exactly how, in a sense, it continues to be used on important occasions," said Caroline de Guitaut, surveyor of the king's works of art.</p>

<p>Guitaut, responsible for 700,000 works of art at 13 royal residences including Buckingham Palace, said some of the earliest occasions on which the royal family used the balcony included waving off troops headed to the 1853-1856 Crimean War -- and welcoming them back.</p>

<p>Much of the wing reflects early 19th centry king George IV's love of Chinese-themed art.</p>

<p><strong>Pagodas and porcelain</strong></p>

<p>Tours of the east wing will also include the palace's state rooms, which have been open to the public during the summer since 1993.</p>

<p>The east wing part of the tour will take visitors along much of the 73-metre (240-feet) long principal corridor, and include the yellow drawing room and centre room behind the balcony.</p>

<p>The yellow drawing room features a Chinese-style fireplace from George IV's seaside pleasure palace in Brighton on the English south coast and even some of the pavilion's wallpaper that was discovered in storage by Queen Elizabeth II's grandmother and hung at her request.</p>

<p>The Brighton royal pavilion was sold to finance the Buckingham Palace extension with its contents moved to the east wing's principal rooms.</p>

<p>Victoria and Albert furnished the corridor with chairs, side tables, large pagodas and Chinese porcelain, including an incense burner in the shape of a Buddha.</p>

<p>Highlights in the room behind the balcony include a newly restored glass chandelier, shaped to resemble a lotus flower, and two Chinese 18th-century imperial silk wall hangings, presented to Victoria by the Chinese emperor Guangxu to mark her Diamond Jubilee in 1897.</p>

<p>Although visitors will have views down the Mall, the avenue leading to the palace, they will not be able to step out onto the balcony.</p>

<p>They will, however, be able to view Jonathan Yeo's new portrait of the king in which he is painted almost entirely in red.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Pakistani anti-terrorism court has dismissed pre-arrest bail petitions of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan in three cases of riots on May 9 last year, prompting his party to reject the ruling as a ploy to prolong his detention.</p>

<p>The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder was booked on the charges of abetment in attacks on Lahore Corps Commander House known as Jinnah House, Askari Tower, and Shadman police station on May 9, 2023.</p>

<p>Supporters of Mr Khan attacked several important government buildings and army installations following his arrest in an alleged corruption case in May last year.</p>

<p>ATC Lahore Judge Khalid Arshad refused pre-arrest bail to Mr Khan and dismissed his petitions in the three cases, after the prosecution equated the May 9 violence to the United States Capitol Hill attacks by supporters of former US president Donald Trump in 2021.</p>

<p>The prosecution said the police required custody of the former premier to complete the investigation in the three cases.</p>

<p>The 71-year-old cricketer-turned-politician is facing over 200 cases and has been in Rawalpindi's Adiala jail since August last year.</p>

<p>Judge Arshad announced the short order at 7 pm, which he reserved on July 6 after hearing the final arguments of the prosecution and the petitioner's counsel, the Dawn newspaper reported on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Due to the absence of Mr Khan's legal team, the judge decided that the court would announce a short order and come out with a detailed order later.</p>

<p>Reacting sharply to the court's ruling, Mr Khan's party on Wednesday said it was a ploy to keep the former prime minister in jail.</p>

<p>"Rejection of pre-arrest bail pleas is a ploy to keep Imran Khan in jail for a longer period," PTI spokesperson Raoof Hasan said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>

<p>He said the judiciary's surrender to the oppressive, anti-democratic and anti-constitutional forces' personal agenda is the biggest catalyst for the "painful death of law and justice and a major obstacle to justice in Pakistan".</p>

<p>"The state of Pakistan is under the grip of the worst personal dictatorship and the law of the jungle and the sole purpose to dismiss Imran Khan's bail pleas was to prolong his unlawful incarceration after his acquittal in all others false, fabricated and politically motivated cases," he said.</p>

<p>He said that despite propaganda for the past year, no evidence has been presented in any court regarding the allegations made against&nbsp;<br />
Mr Khan.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK police were searching Wednesday for a suspect who may have a crossbow after the wife and two daughters of a BBC radio racing commentator were killed in a suspected "targeted" attack.</p>

<p>Kyle Clifford, 26, from Enfield in north London, is wanted in connection with the deaths of the three women in the town of Bushey, north of London, on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>The victims were Carol Hunt, the 61-year-old wife of BBC radio and Sky Sports racing commentator John Hunt, and their two daughters, Louise, 25, and Hannah, 28, the broadcasters said.</p>

<p>Local police said officers were called to a house in the leafy commuter town where the three women were pronounced dead at the scene.</p>

<p>Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson said armed officers and specialist search teams were involved in the manhunt, with the suspect believed to be in north London or around Bushey.</p>

<p>Simpson also urged Clifford to contact police and warned the public not to approach the suspect.</p>

<p>He called it "a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used".</p>

<p>A primary school in nearby Enfield kept children indoors during the police search.</p>

<p>There is no licence required to own a crossbow in the UK, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.</p>

<p>Interior minister Yvette Cooper called the deaths "truly shocking" and said she was being kept updated about the inquiry.</p>

<p>A spokeswoman for her department said legislation was "under constant review and a call for evidence was launched earlier this year to look at whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced".</p>

<p>She said the minister would "swiftly consider the findings to see if laws need to be tightened further".</p>

<p><strong>'Shocking'</strong></p>

<p>BBC Radio Five Live sent a note to staff calling the incident "utterly devastating".</p>

<p>Sky Sports Racing said on X that the team was "deeply saddened by the tragic deaths" and "our thoughts are with our colleague John Hunt, his family and friends at this awful time".</p>

<p>One neighbour described hearing "shrill" screams from the home on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The 46-year-old who lives near the scene, said "absolute chaos" then broke out as armed police put the road into lockdown.</p>

<p>"We had armed police running down, screaming 'stay in your house'", she added.</p>

<p>Another neighbour told reporters the victims were a friendly family.</p>

<p>"We would see them every day passing by and they would say good morning," she said. "It's really sad what's happened, very shocking."</p>

<p>In March, a 47-year-old man was arrested after two people were injured in separate crossbow attacks in London's Shoreditch area.</p>

<p>Last October Jaswant Singh Chail, 21, was jailed after being found in the grounds of Windsor Castle, west of London, with a loaded crossbow.</p>

<p>He broke into the royal residence on Christmas Day 2021 and told police he was trying to kill Queen Elizabeth II.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Avian influenza, or bird flu, has public health officials on alert after an unprecedented spread in dairy cows in the United States this year. Four dairy workers have also tested positive in the country.</p>

<p>A particularly severe variant of the H5N1 strain has been spreading around the world in animals since 2020, causing lethal outbreaks in commercial poultry and sporadic infections in other species from alpacas to house cats. Until this year, it had never infected cows.</p>

<p>Different bird flu strains have been found in Australia and Mexico in humans, while different H5 subtypes are also present around the world in both animals and humans, in countries including China and Cambodia.</p>

<p>Most of the human cases reported exposure to poultry, live poultry markets, or dairy cattle prior to infection, but scientists are worried the virus could mutate in ways that make it more easily spread from person-to-person, which could spark a pandemic. The World Health Organization says the risk to people is low at this point.</p>

<p>Below are occurrences of varying types of the bird flu virus that have been found in humans this year.</p>

<p><strong>UNITED STATES:</strong></p>

<p>The first known cases of infected dairy cattle occurred in Texas in March, and is now in dairy herds in 12 states. The U.S. Agriculture Department said tests so far indicate that the virus detected in cows is the same H5N1 virus affecting wild birds and commercial poultry flocks. The four dairy workers who have tested positive for the virus this year had mild symptoms such as conjunctivitis, or pink eye.</p>

<p>The H5N1 virus in the United States belongs to the clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13, a genotype detected only in North America so far, the European Food Safety Agency said in a scientific report.</p>

<p><strong>MEXICO:</strong></p>

<p>A resident of Mexico died with the first known cases of H5N2 avian influenza in humans, the WHO said on June 5. Mexico's government said chronic illness, rather than bird flu, was the cause of death. The person had no known exposure to animals.</p>

<p><strong>AUSTRALIA:</strong></p>

<p>The WHO on June 7 said a child with H5N1 bird flu reported by Australia had traveled to Kolkata, India. Genetic sequencing showed the virus was a subtype of H5N1 and part of a strain that circulates in Southeast Asia and has been detected in previous human infections and in poultry.</p>

<p>Australia is separately dealing with three outbreaks of different strains of the virus on poultry farms - H7N3, H7N8 and H7N9 - that authorities say likely arrived on farms via wild birds.</p>

<p><strong>INDIA:</strong></p>

<p>The WHO on June 11 reported a case of human infection with bird flu caused by the H9N2 subtype in a four-year-old child in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal. It was the second human infection of H9N2 bird flu from India following a case in 2019, the agency said. While the H9N2 virus typically tends to cause mild illness, the United Nations agency said further sporadic human cases could occur as this is one of the most prevalent avian influenza viruses circulating in poultry in different regions.</p>

<p><strong>VIETNAM:</strong></p>

<p>Vietnam reported a 21-year-old student had died from the H5N1 bird flu in March. He had no underlying medical conditions, but had been exposed to wild birds from hunting a couple of weeks prior to onset of symptoms. No contact with dead or sick poultry was reported at the time.</p>

<p>Vietnam also reported an outbreak of H9N2 in a 37-year-old man, EFSA said.</p>

<p><strong>CAMBODIA:</strong></p>

<p>The Southeast Asia nation and Vietnam neighbor has reported five human cases of H5N1 as of June 20.</p>

<p><strong>CHINA:</strong></p>

<p>China this year detected human cases caused by the H5N6, H9N2 and H10N3 strains, with two fatal H5N6 cases in the Fujian province. Both of those cases had exposure to backyard poultry before the onset of symptoms, EFSA said.</p>

<p>The case of H10N3 avian influenza was the third one ever reported globally.</p>

<p><strong>GERMANY:</strong></p>

<p>Germany reported a rare outbreak of highly pathogenic H7N5 bird flu on a farm in the western part of the country, near the border with the Netherlands, the World Organisation for Animal Health said on July 4. It was the first outbreak anywhere of H7N5 on WOAH's public records.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Wednesday that 60 percent of Hamas fighters had been "eliminated or wounded" in the Gaza war since the group's October 7 attacks.</p>

<p>Gallant reaffirmed in a statement to parliament on the first nine months of the conflict that Israel was "determined" to meet its war goals of eradicating Hamas and bringing all hostages back from Gaza.</p>

<p>The minister praised Israeli soldiers for "performing their work with dedication, sacrifice and success" and said "the achievements are many".</p>

<p>Israel has launched major new offensives in Gaza City in the north and around Rafah and Khan Yunis in the south, even as it also embarks on contacts with international mediators on conditions for negotiating a truce with Hamas.</p>

<p>"We have eliminated or wounded 60 percent of the Hamas terrorists" and "dismantled" most the Palestinian group's 24 battalions, Gallant said.</p>

<p>The minister did not give figures for the casualties and the Israeli military said it did not immediately have statistics.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The operatives also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 42 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's military retaliation has killed at least 38,295 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.</p>

<p>While many countries expressed solidarity with Israel after the October 7 attacks, the government has also faced a wave of criticism for its military campaign that has devastated Gaza.</p>

<p>Gallant insisted Israel would stick to its aims.</p>

<p>"We have returned half of the hostages and we are determined to return the rest," he said.</p>

<p>"The security establishment, and myself heading it, are determined to achieve the goals of the war and complete them."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Palestinian health authorities say Israel's ground and air campaign in Gaza has killed more than 38,000 people, mostly civilians, and driven most of the enclave's 2.3 million people from their homes.</p>

<p>The war began on Oct. 7 when Hamas operatives rushed across the border into Israeli communities. Israel says the operatives killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and dragged 253 into captivity in Gaza.</p>

<p>This explainer examines how the Palestinian death count is calculated, how reliable it is, the breakdown of civilians and fighters killed and what each side says.</p>

<p><strong>HOW DO GAZA HEALTH AUTHORITIES CALCULATE THE DEATH COUNT?</strong></p>

<p>In the first months of the war, death counts were calculated entirely from counting bodies that arrived in hospitals and data included names and identity numbers for most of those killed.</p>

<p>As the conflict ground on, and fewer hospitals and morgues continued to operate, the authorities adopted other methods too.</p>

<p>From early May, the Health Ministry updated its breakdown of total fatalities to include unidentified bodies which account for nearly a third of the overall deaths. Omar Hussein Ali, head of the ministry's emergency operations centre in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said these were bodies that had arrived at hospitals or medical centres without personal data such as identity numbers or full names.</p>

<p>It also began including deaths reported online by family members who had to input information including identity numbers.</p>

<p><strong>IS THE GAZA DEATH COUNT COMPREHENSIVE?</strong></p>

<p>The numbers "do not necessarily reflect all victims due to the fact that many victims are still missing under the rubble", the Palestinian Health Ministry says. In May it estimated that some 10,000 bodies were uncounted in this way.</p>

<p>The Lancet medical journal published a letter from three academics on July 5 estimating that indirect deaths, caused by factors such as disease, might mean the death count is several times higher than official Palestinian estimates.</p>

<p>The letter said it was "not implausible to estimate that up to 186,000 or even more deaths could be attributable to the current conflict in Gaza".</p>

<p>The authors said the figure, which made global headlines, was based on what they said was the conservative estimate of four indirect deaths to one direct death based on trends from prior conflicts.</p>

<p>The U.N. human rights office and the Humanitarian Research Lab at the Yale School of Public Health have also said during the conflict that the true figures are likely higher than those published, without giving specifics.</p>

<p><strong>HOW CREDIBLE IS THE GAZA DEATH COUNT?</strong></p>

<p>Pre-war Gaza had robust population statistics and better health information systems than in most Middle East countries, public health experts told Reuters.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the World Health Organisation said the ministry has "good capacity in data collection/analysis and its previous reporting has been considered credible".</p>

<p>The United Nations regularly cites the ministry's death count figures, while naming the ministry as the source.</p>

<p>Early in the conflict, after U.S. President Joe Biden cast doubt on casualty figures, the health ministry published a detailed list of the 7,028 deaths that had been registered by that point.</p>

<p>Academics looking at details of listed casualties said in a peer-reviewed article in the Lancet medical journal in November that it was implausible that the patterns shown in the list could be the result of fabrication.</p>

<p>However, there are specific questions over the inclusion of 471 people said to have been killed in an Oct. 17 blast at al-Ahli al-Arab hospital in Gaza City. An unclassified U.S. intelligence report estimated that death count "at the low end of the 100 to 300 spectrum".</p>

<p><strong>DOES HAMAS CONTROL THE FIGURES?</strong></p>

<p>While Hamas has run Gaza since 2007, the enclave's Health Ministry also answers to the overall Palestinian Authority ministry in Ramallah in the West Bank.</p>

<p>Gaza's Hamas-run government has paid the salaries of all those hired in public departments since 2007, including in the Health Ministry. The Palestinian Authority still pays the salaries of those hired before then.</p>

<p>The extent of Hamas control in Gaza now is difficult to assess with Israeli forces occupying most of the territory, including around locations of major hospitals that provide casualty figures, and with fighting ongoing.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT DOES ISRAEL SAY?</strong></p>

<p>Israeli officials have said the figures are suspect because of Hamas' control over government in Gaza. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Oren Mamorstein said the numbers were manipulated and "do not reflect the reality on the ground".</p>

<p>However, Israel's military has also accepted in briefings that the overall Gaza casualty numbers are broadly reliable.</p>

<p>In May, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said 14,000 Hamas fighters and 16,000 Palestinian civilians had been killed in the war.</p>

<p><strong>HOW MANY CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN KILLED?</strong></p>

<p>The Health Ministry figures do not differentiate between civilians and Hamas combatants, who do not wear formal uniform or carry separate identification.</p>

<p>Israel periodically provides estimates of how many Hamas fighters it believes have been killed. The most recent was Netanyahu's estimate of 14,000.</p>

<p>Israeli security officials say such estimates are reached through a combination of counting bodies on the battlefield, intercepts of Hamas communications and intelligence assessments of personnel in targets that were destroyed.</p>

<p>Hamas has said Israeli estimates for its losses are exaggerated but has not said how many of its fighters have been killed.</p>

<p>The Palestinian Health Ministry says more than 70% of the dead are women and children. For most of the conflict its figures showed children as representing slightly over 40% of all those killed.</p>

<p>However, conditions in hospitals compiling figures have worsened amid the fighting and many of those killed may not be identifiable due to their injuries.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is on a state visit to Austria, called his trip to the country historic and special and asserted that he is happy that he got an opportunity to visit Austria at the beginning of his third term.</p>

<p>Addressing the media, PM Modi said, "I am happy that during the beginning of my third term itself, I got the opportunity to visit Austria. This trip of mine is historic and special. After 41 years, an Indian PM has visited Austria."</p>

<p>Notably, this is the first time an Indian Prime Minister has visited Austria in 41 years. Indira Gandhi was the last PM to visit Austria in 1983. PM Modi's visit to Austria comes after his two-day official visit to Russia, where he met Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister further expressed happiness over the fact that both nations have completed 75 years of their ties. "It is also a happy coincidence that this visit is taking place at a time when 75 years of our mutual relations have been completed," he said.</p>

<p>Elaborating further on the relationship between India and Austria, PM Modi added, "Democracy and rule of law are the foundation of our relations. Our relationships are strengthened by mutual trust and shared interests."</p>

<p>Speaking on his meeting with the Austrian Chancellor, PM Modi said that talks between them took place to boost their relations. "Today, between Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer and me, a very meaningful discussion took place. We discussed new possibilities to strengthen our ties further. We have decided to give these ties a strategic direction."</p>

<p>He added, "For the coming decade, an outline has been prepared for cooperation, which is not only limited to economic support and investment but will cover sectors like infrastructure development, renewable energy, hydrogen, water and waste management, artificial intelligence, quantum. We will work towards linking each other's capabilities."</p>

<p>The Prime Minister also talked about linking the youth power and said, "To connect the youth power and ideas of both the countries, the startup bridge will be given impetus. An agreement has already been reached on mobility and migration partnership, which will support legal migration and skilled workforce movement."</p>

<p>PM Modi held delegation-level talks with Karl Nehammer at the Federal Chancellery in Vienna on Wednesday.</p>

<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval, Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra and other officials were present in the meeting.</p>

<p>Earlier, PM Modi signed the Guestbook at the Federal Chancellery in Austria's Vienna. He also received a Ceremonial Reception at the Federal Chancellery in Vienna. Karl Nehammer accompanied PM Modi.</p>

<p>In a post on X, Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal stated, "Scripting a new chapter in bilateral relations. PM @narendramodi was warmly received by Austrian Chancellor @karlnehammer at the Federal Chancery and accorded a ceremonial welcome. This landmark visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Austria is taking place after 4 decades."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli army on Wednesday dropped thousand of leaflets on Gaza City urging all residents to leave amid an intensified military offensive on the Palestinian territory's main city, an AFP journalist said.</p>

<p>The leaflets, addressed to "everyone in Gaza City", set out routes out of the city to designated safe areas further south and warned the urban area would "remain a dangerous combat zone" as the army hits Hamas targets.</p>

<p>Israel issued a first formal evacuation order for part of the city on June 27, and two more in following days.</p>

<p>In the leaflet drop, the army said residents would be able to take two safe roads "quickly and without inspection from Gaza City to shelters in Deir Al-Balah and Al-Zawiya".</p>

<p>Following the October 7 Hamas attacks, Israel said in January that it had "dismantled" the group's "military structure" in the northern city.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands more residents have already fled Gaza City since troops launched the latest offensive in the city's eastern Shujaiya district and ground battles have since raged.</p>

<p>The two latest orders covered central and western districts where tanks and troops have move in this week.</p>

<p>The army also said its forces had attacked operatives inside Gaza City's vacated headquarters of the UN agency for Palestinians, UNRWA.</p>

<p>Strikes have also hit Deir Al-Balah, an area where Palestinians have been urged to move to for safety.</p>

<p>The United Nations on Tuesday expressed alarm at Israel's evacuation orders, saying they tell Palestinians to go to zones where there is fighting.</p>

<p>The October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The operatives also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 42 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's military offensive has killed at least 38,243 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to figures released Tuesday by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new report, Seoul City councillor Kim Ki-duck claimed that women's growing participation in the workforce has led to fewer job opportunities and marriage prospects for men, contributing to "an increase in male suicide attempts", as per the BBC.</p>

<p>South Korea has one of the highest suicide rates among wealthy nations and a poor record on gender equality. There's been a 140 per cent increase in suicide attempts from 430 in 2018 to 1,035 in 2023, with men accounting for 77 per cent of the cases in 2023, up from 67 per cent in 2018.</p>

<p>Councillor Kim's comments have sparked outrage as another example of male politicians being out of touch and oversimplifying the complex issues surrounding suicide and gender.</p>

<p>Professor Song In Han of Yonsei University said that mental health issues require scientific study, not gender-based speculation. Despite men being more likely to take their own lives globally, Mr Kim's report focuses on gender conflict rather than addressing the root causes of the issue. "It is dangerous and unwise to make claims like this without sufficient evidence," the Professor said.</p>

<p>South Korea faces a significant gender gap in employment and pay, with women more likely to hold temporary or part-time jobs and earning 29 per cent less than men on average.</p>

<p>Amid this, an anti-feminist movement, led by young men who feel disadvantaged by efforts to promote gender equality, has emerged. Mr Kim's report suggested the solution to "female domination" lies in promoting gender equality awareness so that "men and women can enjoy equal opportunities".</p>

<p>The Justice Party has demanded Kim retract his remarks and conduct a proper analysis of the issues. They have accused him of "shifting the blame to women in Korean society who are struggling to escape gender discrimination."</p>

<p>In response, Mr Kim claimed his comments were not intended to criticise the "female-dominated society" but were simply his personal views.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Praising the ties shared between Austria and India, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer on Wednesday emphasised that it is a relationship of trust that began in the 1950s. He stated that it is the "concern over the development of the geopolitical situation" that united both nations.</p>

<p>Delivering his remarks at the joint press conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Vienna, the Austrian Chancellor said, "There is a very good relationship between India and Austria. It's a relationship of trust which began in the 1950s...India helped Austria and in 1955, the negotiations came to a positive conclusion with the Austrian State Treaty."</p>

<p>"What unites India and Austria is concern over the development of the geopolitical situation," he underlined.</p>

<p>The Austrian Chancellor also highlighted his talks with PM Modi and stated that the two of them "had very intensive talks" about the aggression of Russia against Ukraine in the ongoing conflict.</p>

<p>"Last night and this morning, we had very intensive talks about the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine. For me, as the Federal Chancellor of Austria, it is particularly important to get to know India's assessment and to understand it and familiarise India with European concerns and worries," the Austrian Chancellor Karl said.</p>

<p>"Moreover, the conflict in the Middle East was a major topic and in addition to this challenging geopolitical situation, we also referred to the positive aspects of our cooperation..." he added.</p>

<p>Notably, this is the first time an Indian Prime Minister has visited Austria in 41 years. Indira Gandhi was the last PM to visit Austria in 1983.</p>

<p>PM Modi's visit to Austria comes after his two-day official visit to Russia, where he met Russian President Vladimir Putin. PM Modi arrived in Austria on Wednesday (local time).</p>

<p>Upon his arrival here, the Indian Prime Minister was welcomed by Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg. Indian Ambassador to Austria, Shambhu Kumaran was also present at the airport.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, PM Modi joined a dinner hosted by Austria Chancellor Karl Nehammer.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India will continue to be a strategic partner for the US despite concerns over its ties with Russia, the Biden Administration has said.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in Russia for two days for the 22nd India-Russia annual summit that has been watched closely by the West amidst the Ukraine conflict.</p>

<p>During his talks with President Putin on Tuesday, Prime Minister Modi told President Putin that a solution to the Ukraine conflict is not possible on the battlefield and peace efforts do not succeed amid bombs and bullets.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, spokespersons of the Pentagon and the State Department reacted separately to questions on India's relationship with Russia and PM Modi's visit to Moscow.</p>

<p>"India and Russia have had a relationship for a very long time. From a US perspective, India is a strategic partner with whom we continue to engage in full and frank dialogue to include their relationship with Russia. As it relates to the NATO summit being this week, of course, like you, the world is focused on that," Pentagon Press Secretary Major General Pat Ryder told reporters at a news conference.</p>

<p>On the other hand, US State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters at his daily news conference that the US has been quite clear about its "concerns about India's relationship with Russia."</p>

<p>"We have expressed those privately directly to the Indian government, and continue to do so. And that has not changed," Mr Miller told reporters at his daily news conference.</p>

<p>India has been open its "special and privileged strategic partnership" with Russia and maintained the momentum in the ties.</p>

<p>India has not condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 but has consistently pitched for a resolution of the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy.</p>

<p>Maj Gen Ryder said: "I do not think anybody will be surprised if (Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin tries to represent this visit in a way that seeks to somehow show that he is not isolated from the rest of the world. And the fact of the matter is President Putin's war of choice has isolated Russia from the rest of the world, and it has come at great cost. Their war of aggression has come at great cost, and the facts bear that out," he said.</p>

<p>"So we will continue to view India as a strategic partner. We will continue to have a robust dialogue with them," Maj Gen Ryder said.</p>

<p>"He (Putin) is not looking so isolated with the head of the world's largest democracy being in Moscow, embracing him right now," a reporter asked.</p>

<p>Maj Gen Ryder responded by saying that Prime Minister Modi also met recently with the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and offered his assurances that India will continue to do everything within its means to support a peaceful solution to the war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>"I think that we trust that India will support efforts to realise an enduring and just peace for Ukraine and will convey to Mr Putin the importance of adhering to the UN charter and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity," he added.</p>

<p>Mr Miller said the US continues to "urge India to support efforts to realise an enduring and just peace in Ukraine, based on the principles of the UN charter based on upholding Ukraine's territorial integrity and its sovereignty. And that will continue to be what we will engage with India about."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two school employees in a Georgia school district have been accused of engaging in sexual relationships with students during 2021 and 2022.</p>

<p>Railey Greeson and Brooklyn Shuler were indicted in Gordon County, Georgia, on Thursday, June 28, on charges of sexual contact by an employee or agent in the first degree, as reported by<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/crime/two-calhoun-teachers-indicted-inappropriate-relations-with-students/85-65a6c42f-a17c-44fc-8bfc-6418fed0d8c6"><em> 11 Alive,</em></a> WSB TV, and FOX 5 Atlanta citing the indictment.</p>

<p>According to the indictment, Greeson is accused of having sexual relations with two male students, while Shuler is accused of having sexual relations with one male student between October 2021 and January 2022.</p>

<p>"I'm not trying to stereotype, but you could look at them and tell they were trouble," said Audrey Decker, whose stepdaughter attends the school.</p>

<p>"They just seemed boy-crazy. And everyone in the school knew it and joked about it."</p>

<p>Another parent agreed. "Ugh, they were flirts," said the mom of a sophomore.</p>

<p>"You should have seen them with any attractive parents who came to the school. They would flirt with any of the dads."</p>

<p>"You know: laughing too loud, getting too close, that type of thing," continued the mom.</p>

<p>"Flirting. Trying to be cute. They were shameless."</p>

<p>Greeson faces two counts of the offence, while Shuler has been indicted on one count, according to the indictment.</p>

<p>Although the indictment did not specify the school district involved, WSB TV identified it as the City of Calhoun School District.</p>

<p>According to reports from 11 Alive, FOX 5 Atlanta, and WSB TV, the ages of the students involved have not been disclosed. However, the indictment stated that the women "reasonably should have known" that the alleged victims were enrolled as students.</p>

<p>It remains unclear whether either of the suspects has entered pleas or retained attorneys to represent them.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The fossil remains of a plant-eating dinosaur estimated to have roamed the earth some 125 million years ago have been discovered on England's Isle of Wight, with scientists believing it to be the most complete new specimen found in Britain in a century.</p>

<p>Weighing roughly the same as a large male American bison at about 900 kilogrammes (1990 lbs), the herbivorous species was likely a herding animal, Jeremy Lockwood, a PhD student at the University of Portsmouth who helped with the excavation, said in a statement.</p>

<p>The dinosaur, made up of 149 bones, was found in the cliffs of Compton Bay on the Isle of Wight, off the southern coast of England, in 2013 by late fossil collector Nick Chase.</p>

<p>It was named "Comptonatus chasei" as a tribute to Chase.</p>

<p>"Nick had a phenomenal nose for finding dinosaur bones ... This really is a remarkable find," Lockwood said.</p>

<p>"It helps us understand more about the different types of dinosaurs that lived in England in the Early Cretaceous," said Lockwood, also the lead author of a new paper describing the species published in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology.</p>

<p>The remains of a meat-eating dinosaur belonging to an ancient predator bigger than anything known from the whole of Europe were discovered on the island in 2022. It was also from the Cretaceous Period.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Muchu Chhish, a 7,453-meter mountain in the Karakoram Range that was never climbed before, has finally been summited by three men, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://explorersweb.com/muchu-chhish-finally-summited/" target="_blank">ExplorersWeb</a> reported on Tuesday.</p>

<p>A Czech team of Zdenek Hak, Radoslav Groh, and Jaroslav Bansky took six days to climb the highest unclimbed peak in the world.</p>

<p>Climbers from the Czech Republic have reportedly tried to reach the summit thrice in the past four years and Groh was one of last year's members.</p>

<p>"We started on July 1 after the acclimatization. We climbed via the south ridge to the main ridge, and then we continued westward to the summit. We stood on top on July 5 at 10:20 am and took one more day for the descent. [We] finally re-entered Base Camp on July 6 at 6 pm," Zdenek Hak told ExplorersWeb, which covers environment adventure news online.</p>

<p>He said they climbed some 8-10 hours a day and made four bivouacs, a temporary camp without tents or cover used especially by mountaineers.</p>

<p>"The total length of the route from Base Camp was 20 km and 3,687 vertical meters. The length from Camp 1 to the top was 14.29 km, and the altitude gain was 2,300 m," Haq said.</p>

<p>The Czech climbers have previously tried to climb Muchu Chhish, which hides in Asia's Western Karakoram range, in 2020, 2022, 2023.</p>

<p>Last year, a team of Pavel Korinek, Pavel Bem, Radoslav Groh, and Tomas Petrecek nearly reached the summit before bad weather trapped them at 7,200 m at the bottom of a final rock pyramid.</p>

<p>They, however, retreated after running out of supplies and fuel.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a move reflecting shifting dynamics in the tech industry, both Microsoft and Apple have decided to relinquish their observer seats on the board of OpenAI, reported UK-based 'The Financial Times'. The move comes amidst reports of increased regulatory scrutiny over the involvement of tech giants in AI startups.</p>

<p>Microsoft, which had invested significantly in OpenAI, including a substantial USD 13 billion investment in its generative AI technology, ChatGPT, has announced its immediate withdrawal from its observer role on OpenAI's board.</p>

<p>The decision was communicated via a letter to OpenAI, citing the company's satisfaction with the progress made by the newly formed board.</p>

<p>Similarly, Apple, which was expected to take up a similar observer role as part of an agreement to integrate ChatGPT into its devices, has opted not to do so.</p>

<p>Although Apple declined to comment on the matter, sources familiar with the situation indicate that the tech giant will not be taking an observer position on OpenAI's board.</p>

<p>In response to these developments, OpenAI has announced a revised strategy for engaging with its strategic partners and investors.</p>

<p>According to the FT report, the organization plans to hold regular meetings with partners like Microsoft and Apple, along with investors such as Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures.</p>

<p>This shift, as explained by an OpenAI spokesperson, aims to foster a more inclusive and collaborative approach to governance and strategic decision-making.</p>

<p>The board of OpenAI recently saw the addition of Phil Schiller, Apple's former marketing chief, as an observer, which was reported just days before these withdrawals.</p>

<p>However, Schiller will no longer be observing OpenAI's operations, highlighting the fluidity and perhaps underlying tensions within the organization's boardroom dynamics.</p>

<p>Analysts speculate that the decision by Microsoft and Apple to step back from their observer roles could be linked to strategic considerations or internal dynamics within OpenAI.</p>

<p>While some suggest possible concerns over antitrust scrutiny or strategic disagreements, the exact motivations behind these decisions remain unclear.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man has been caught trying to smuggle over 100 live snakes into mainland China by cramming them into his trousers, according to the country's customs authority.</p>

<p>The unnamed traveller was stopped by customs officers as he sought to slip out of semi-autonomous Hong Kong and into the border city of Shenzhen, China Customs said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"Upon inspection, customs officers discovered that the pockets of the trousers the passenger was wearing were packed with six canvas drawstring bags and sealed with tape," the statement said.</p>

<p>"Once opened, each bag was found to contain living snakes in all kinds of shapes, sizes and colours," it added.</p>

<p>The statement said officers seized 104 of the scaly reptiles, including milk snakes and corn snakes, many of which were non-native species.</p>

<p>An accompanying video showed two border agents peering into transparent plastic bags filled with squirming red, pink and white snakes.</p>

<p>China is one of the world's biggest animal trafficking hubs, but authorities have cracked down on the illicit trade in recent years.</p>

<p>The country's biosecurity and disease control laws forbid people from bringing in non-native species without permission.</p>

<p>"Those who break the rules will be... held liable in accordance with the law," the customs authority said, without specifying the man's punishment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid heightened diplomatic tension with India, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called his own intelligence officials "criminals" for linking Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar to violence on Canadian soil.</p>

<p>Addressing media in Brampton on Friday, Trudeau said, "We have seen, unfortunately, that criminals leaking top-secret information to the media have consistently gotten those stories wrong."</p>

<p>"That's why we had a national enquiry into foreign interference, which has highlighted that criminals leaking information to media outlets are unreliable on top of being criminals," he added.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The development came after Canada, on Thursday, fact-checked and denied a report linking top Indian leaders to criminal activities on Canadian soil.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a statement posted on a government website, Nathalie Drouin, Mr Trudeau's intelligence adviser, said: "The Government of Canada has not stated, nor is it aware of the evidence, linking Prime Minister Modi, Minister Jaishankar, or NSA Doval to the serious criminal activity within Canada. Any suggestion to the contrary is both speculative and inaccurate."</p>

<p>Canada's statement came after Globe and Mail newspaper published a report this week, alleging that Canadian security agencies believed PM Modi knew about the violent plots and said Mr Jaishankar and National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval were also in the loop.</p>

<p>Last month, The Canadian foreign ministry alleged Union Home Minister Amit Shah was behind a campaign of intimidation in Canada. Ottawa says it has evidence linking Indian government agents to the 2023 murder of Khalistan terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who held a Canadian passport.</p>

<p>The ties between the two countries have come under severe strain following Trudeau's allegations in September last year of a "potential involvement" of Indian agents in the killing of Khalistan terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who held a Canadian passport.</p>

<p>New Delhi rejected Trudeau's charges as "absurd". India has maintained that the main issue between the two countries is that of Canada giving space to pro-Khalistan elements operating from Canadian soil with impunity.</p>

<p>The row has escalated to a point where both countries have expelled each other's top diplomats.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[After the United Kingdom, Canada said it would "abide" by the arrest warrant issued against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by the International Criminal Court (ICC).]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After the United Kingdom, Canada said it would "abide" by the arrest warrant issued against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by the International Criminal Court (ICC).&nbsp;"We stand up for international law, and we will abide by all the regulations and rulings of the international courts," Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is just who we are as Canadians," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ICC issued arrest warrants for Israeli premier and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant on Thursday for "crimes against humanity" committed since the Israel-Hamas war began more than a year ago, triggered by the militant Palestinian group's October 7, 2023 attack.</p>

<p>A warrant was also issued for Hamas's military chief Mohammed Deif.</p>

<p>Earlier on Friday, the British government indicated that Netanyahu could be arrested on the ICC arrest warrant if he travelled to the UK.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesman said: "The UK will always comply with its legal obligations as set out by domestic law and indeed international law."</p>

<p>However, he refused to be drawn specifically on whether UK police would detain Netanyahu, telling reporters he would not "get into hypotheticals in relation to individual cases".</p>

<p>Both the UK and Canada are part of the Five Eyes, an intelligence alliance also composed of Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Other countries that agreed to follow through with the ICC's decision include-- Belgium, the European Union, France, Iran, Ireland, Jordan, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, South Africa, Switzerland, and Turkey among others.</p>

<p>Other key Five Eyes member US has, however, called the move 'outrageous'. "The ICC issuance of arrest warrants against Israeli leaders is outrageous," President Joe Biden said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Let me be clear once again: whatever the ICC might imply, there is no equivalence - none - between Israel and Hamas. We will always stand with Israel against threats to its security," the statement added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the warrant was supported by&nbsp;US Senator Bernie Sanders, who took to X and said: “All launched indiscriminate attacks against civilians and caused unimaginable human suffering”.</p>

<p>“If the world does not uphold international law, we will descend into further barbarism,” he added.</p>

<p>Other countries to declare 'disagreement' with ICC decisions include-- Argentina, Austria, and Hungary, among others.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NATO chief Mark Rutte held talks with US President-elect Donald Trump in Florida on the "global security issues facing the alliance", a spokeswoman said Saturday.</p>

<p>The meeting took place on Friday in Palm Beach, NATO's Farah Dakhlallah said in a statement.</p>

<p>In his first term Trump aggressively pushed Europe to step up defence spending and questioned the fairness of the NATO transatlantic alliance.</p>

<p>The former Dutch prime minister had said he wanted to meet Trump two days after Trump was elected on November 5, and discuss the threat of increasingly warming ties between North Korea and Russia.</p>

<p>Trump's thumping victory to return to the US presidency has set nerves jangling in Europe that he could pull the plug on vital Washington military aid for Ukraine.</p>

<p>NATO allies say keeping Kyiv in the fight against Moscow is key to both European and American security.</p>

<p>"What we see more and more is that North Korea, Iran, China and of course Russia are working together, working together against Ukraine," Rutte said recently at a European leaders' meeting in Budapest.</p>

<p>"At the same time, Russia has to pay for this, and one of the things they are doing is delivering technology to North Korea", which he warned was threatening to the "mainland of the US (and) continental Europe".</p>

<p>"I look forward to sitting down with Donald Trump to discuss how we can face these threats collectively," Rutte said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian researchers have discovered the oldest direct evidence of hot water activity on Mars, revealing that the planet may have once been habitable.</p>

<p>In a study published on Saturday, a team led by researchers from Curtin University in Western Australia analyzed a 4.45 billion-year-old zircon grain from the famous Martian meteorite NWA7034, also known as Black Beauty, that was found in the Sahara Desert in 2011.</p>

<p>The researchers found that the grain of zircon, a type of mineral, contained geochemical fingerprints of water-rich fluids, suggesting that water was present during early Martian magmatic activity.</p>

<p>Aaron Cavosie, a co-author of the study from Curtin's School of Earth and Planetary Sciences, said that the discovery would open up new avenues for understanding ancient Martian hydrothermal systems, as well as the planet's past capacity to support life.</p>

<p>"We used nano-scale geochemistry to detect elemental evidence of hot water on Mars 4.45 billion years ago," he said, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>"Hydrothermal systems were essential for the development of life on Earth and our findings suggest Mars also had water, a key ingredient for habitable environments, during the earliest history of crust formation."</p>

<p>He said that even though Mars' crust endured major meteorite impacts that caused surface upheaval, the research shows that water was present on the planet during the early Pre-Noachian period prior to about 4.1 billion years ago.</p>

<p>The study also involved researchers from the University of Adelaide and was led by Jack Gillespie, a former research associate at Curtin's School of Earth and Planetary Sciences now at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Laos government said Saturday it was "profoundly saddened" by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/four-tourists-die-after-suspected-laos-methanol-poisoning-7070694">deaths of foreign tourists in Vang Vieng</a>, with the toll from a suspected methanol poisoning incident now at six.</p>

<p>Two Danish citizens, an American, a Briton and two Australians have now died after being rushed to hospital following a night out in backpacker hot spot Vang Vieng.</p>

<p>They were among a group of about a dozen foreigners who fell ill and were rushed to hospital shortly after November 12.</p>

<p>In a statement on its website, Laos' Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Saturday it expressed "sincere sympathy and deepest condolences to the families of the deceased", adding an investigation was underway.</p>

<p>Australian Holly Bowles, 19, became the incident's latest fatality on Friday when she died in a Bangkok hospital surrounded by family.</p>

<p>Canberra is pressing Laotian authorities for a full and transparent investigation into what happened.</p>

<p>Vang Vieng has been a fixture on the Southeast Asia backpacker trail since Laos' secretive communist rulers opened the country to tourism decades ago.</p>

<p>The town was once synonymous with backpackers behaving badly at jungle parties but has since re-branded as an eco-tourism destination.</p>

<p>The Vietnamese manager of the Nana Backpackers Hostel where the tourists were staying has been detained for questioning, the Laos tourist police told AFP.</p>

<p>No charges have been filed thus far.</p>

<p>Police in Laos could not be reached for comment on Saturday.</p>

<p>Alcohol tainted with methanol, a toxic alcohol usually used in industrial and household products like antifreeze, is suspected to be the cause of the deaths.</p>

<p>It can be added to liquor to increase its potency but can cause blindness, liver damage and death.</p>

<p>Danish, Australian and British officials released statements confirming the deaths of their nationals in the week following the incident.</p>

<p>On their travel advice websites, UK and Australian authorities have warned their citizens to beware of methanol poisoning while consuming alcohol in Laos.</p>

<p>But in Vang Vieng, business seemed to be going on as usual.</p>

<p>"I heard the news but everything is normal here," Michael, a manager at Vangvieng Rock Backpacker Rooftop Hostel told AFP on Friday, asking to use only one name.</p>

<p>"The high season is about to start, so we are welcoming more tourists every day."</p>

<p>"There are still many tourists in town, and they go partying," a receptionist at Vang Vieng Chill House Hostel told AFP.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after 24-year-old Harshita Brella - an Indian woman from Delhi living with her husband in the UK - was found dead with her body stashed away in the boot of a car, his family has pointed to a dowry angle in the case.</p>

<p>Harshita Brella married Pankaj Lamba - who has been missing since her murder - on March 22 this year. Now, Sonia Brella, the elder sister of Harshita, suspects that she was murdered for dowry even though they had given the Lamba family gold and money during the wedding.</p>

<p>"The family had given a lot of dowry to Pankaj but still he was not happy, he kept demanding dowry from us," she told ANI.</p>

<p>An investigation by the Northamptonshire Police suggests that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/harshita-brella-murder-family-claims-accused-husband-preplanned-killing-7082982">Harshita Brella</a> was murdered on November 10. On the same night, she was seen walking with her husband by a boating lake in Corby where she lived.</p>

<p>As per the police, Harshita Brella's body had been transported from Corby to east London - some 145 kilometers away - by car, which was found parked with her body on Brisbane Road, Ilford on November 14. The car allegedly belonged to her husband.</p>

<p>Earlier, her father, Sabir Brella, also alleged that Lamba and his family used to harass her for dowry. "Pankaj used to beat her and force her to get money. Due to the regular fights, she started living separately and working in a warehouse. Despite living separately, he would handle her bank accounts," he said.</p>

<p>However, she kept giving money to him "with a hope that some day things will become normal", her father said, adding, " She didn't know that this would be the end.</p>

<p>"On August 29, when Pankaj had beaten her she lodged a complaint against him. Subsequently, his family members had come at our house here and again started demanding dowry, due to which my father sold some property to fulfill their demand and by February we were able to fulfill the demand. We were about to fulfil their demands after we got the money in hand," Sonia Brella said.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/family-of-indian-origin-woman-found-dead-in-car-boot-in-uk-call-for-justice-7059224">Harshita Brella</a> was the subject of a 28-day domestic violence order against Lamba, which had not been renewed at the time of her killing.</p>

<p>"She used to give us every moment's information. This case was closed on October 30 when Pankaj paid the fine, but Harshita was not informed about it," her sister claimed.</p>

<p>Recalling her last video call with Harshita, her sister said, "We had the last video call with Harshita on November 10 when she told us that she was preparing food for Pankaj who was coming over for dinner."</p>

<p>"From the next day her phone was not reachable. We had a feeling that Pankaj had killed her by then," she added.</p>

<p>Even as the police are looking for Pankaj Lamba and released a series of CCTV images of him, her family claimed that he fled to India a day after the brutal murder.</p>

<p>"We have proof of him coming back to India, which we have told to London police. Here no one is helping us. We have also approached our local police and filed a complaint of dowry harassment against Pankaj and her parents," Sonia Brella said.</p>

<p>Harshita Brella's body might reach India in a week or two, she added.</p>

<p>Her sister also alleged that Lamba's family knows his whereabouts and is aware of the murder: "When I called Pankaj's mother about the news, she coolly replied that at least my sister was returning back. She said her son's whereabouts are not known. But, on the other hand, they are not even trying to find his whereabouts and are calm. This behaviour raises suspicions."</p>

<p>Earlier this week, an inquest into Harshita Brella's killing was opened in Northampton and adjourned until May 21, 2025, while the murder investigation remains ongoing. The provisional cause of her death was noted as "manual strangulation pending toxicology and histology" at the inquest hearing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Saturday that his company will balance legal compliance and technological advances under the incoming administration of Donald Trump, and nothing will stop the global advancement of artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>The US chipmaking giant this week reported record high quarterly revenue on the back of strong AI chip demand, though investors are wary of US-China tensions reheating during a new Trump term.</p>

<p>The Taiwan-born entrepreneur was in Hong Kong to receive an honorary doctorate in engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.</p>

<p>"Whatever happens, we'll balance simultaneously compliance with laws and policies, continue to advance our technology, and support and serve customers all over the world," Huang told reporters on Saturday.</p>

<p>"We'll continue to do that and we'll be able to do that just fine."</p>

<p>The Biden administration has restricted Nvidia from selling some of its top AI chips to China, which it sees as a strategic competitor in the field of advanced semiconductors.</p>

<p>Huang said Saturday that "open science and open research in AI is absolutely global... nothing that I see in the future is going to stop that."</p>

<p>Huang said in a speech that the "age of AI has started" and lauded China's "significant contributions" to the scientific research that push forward AI technology.</p>

<p>"AI is certainly the most important technology of our time, and potentially at all times," he said.</p>

<p>Tech giants around the world have invested tens of billions of dollars into Nvidia's technology to train their generative AI models and support their heavy computing needs.</p>

<p>Nvidia surpassed Apple early this month to become the highest valued company in the world as the artificial intelligence boom continues to excite Wall Street.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

A Minnesota jury found that Harshkumar Ramanlal Patel, an Indian national known by the alias “Dirty Harry,” and Florida resident Steve Shand, were part of a sophisticated illegal operation that has brought increasing numbers of Indians into the US, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>Patel (29) and Shand (50) were each convicted on four counts related to human smuggling, including conspiracy to bring migrants into the country illegally. The most serious counts carry maximum sentences of up to 20 years in prison, The Associated Press reported quoting the US Attorney's Office.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the guidelines for federal sentencing in the US rely on complicated formulas. according to Minnesota US Attorney Andy Luger, various factors will be considered to determine what sentences prosecutors will recommend for the convicted.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Case</strong></h2>

<p>The victims—39-year-old Jagdish Patel, his wife Vaishaliben, who was in her mid-30s, their 11-year-old daughter Vihangi, and three-year-old son Dharmik—were found frozen to death near Emerson town of Manitoba province by Canadian authorities on January 19, 2022, while trying to cross the border into Minnesota in a scheme Patel and Shand organized.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The family was originally from Dingucha village in Gujarat's Gandhinagar district. Patel and his wife were reportedly schoolteachers and their family was fairly well off by local standards. Patels were part of an 11-member group of undocumented Indian migrants who had paid smugglers to navigate their illegal entry into the US.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Verdict</strong></h3>

<p>The verdict in the case came on Friday at the end of the five-day federal trial in Minnesota's Fergus Falls.</p>

<p>Condemning the operation, US Attorney Luger said, "This trial exposed the unthinkable cruelty of human smuggling and of those criminal organizations that value profit and greed over humanity."</p>

<p>“To earn a few thousand dollars, these traffickers put men, women and children in extraordinary peril leading to the horrific and tragic deaths of an entire family. Because of this unimaginable greed, a father, a mother and two children froze to death in sub-zero temperatures on the Minnesota-Canadian border,” he added.</p>

<p>During the trial, Defence attorneys from both accused were pitted against each other. Shand's team said that their client was unwittingly roped into Patel's smuggling scheme, while Patel's lawyers argued that he had been misidentified.</p>

<p>Patel's team said that “Dirty Hary,” the alleged nickname for their client found in Shand's phone, is a different person, according to The Canadian Press.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the prosecutors argued that Patel was the coordinator of the smuggling operation while Shand was a driver. They said that Shand was to pick up 11 Indian migrants on the Minnesota side of the border, however, only seven survived the foot crossing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Patel family was found by Canadian authorities later that morning, dead from the cold.</p>

<p>During the trial, Yash Patel, a 29-year-old survivor who managed to cross over and reach the van driven by Shand on the fateful day, also testified. He told the court that the group had separated after stepping into the blizzard. The van was later caught by the Border Patrol Police.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The trial also included an inside account of an alleged participant in the smuggling ring. Rajinder Singh, 51, a survivor of the treacherous journey across the northern border, testified that he made over USD 400,000 smuggling over 500 people through the same network that included Patel and Shand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per the AP report, Singh said most of the people he smuggled came from Gujarat state. He said the migrants would often pay smugglers about USD 100,000 to get them from India to the US, where they would work to pay off their debts at low-wage jobs in cities around the country. According to Singh, smugglers ran their finances through “hawala,” an informal money transfer system that relies on trust.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's massive sinkholes, particularly those in Guangxi province, have gained massive popularity among tourists, drawing visitors eager to explore their ancient ecosystems. But while these natural wonders offer a unique glimpse into Earth's past, experts warn the influx of tourists may threaten the fragile habitats hidden within these sinkholes.</p>

<p>Ranging from 100 to 300 metres in depth, these sinkholes — locally known as “tiankeng” or “heavenly pits” — have long been shrouded in myth. Ancient local beliefs held that the mist rising from the depths was caused by demons and ghosts, adding an air of mystery to the already dangerous terrain. But now, these sites have become increasingly accessible, with guided tours and even extreme sports activities like abseiling attracting tourists from across the country.</p>

<p>Rui, a tourist from Shanghai, expressed her excitement at exploring one such sinkhole. She told <a href="http://https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8697gqwyx6o" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">BBC</a>, “I've never done this kind of thing before. It's very cool. It will be the first time but not the last time.”</p>

<p>Fei Ge, a tour guide in his 50s, who, according to the BBC report, was one of the first explorers of these sinkholes, recalls the legends surrounding the pits. “We thought that if humans went into the sinkholes, demons would bring strong winds and heavy rain. We thought ghosts brought the mist and fog,” he said.</p>

<p>His curiosity led him to become one of the earliest explorers of these sites, eventually introducing scientists to the area. Their discoveries were groundbreaking, having identified rare and previously unknown species of plants and animals, including orchids, white cave fish and several types of spiders and snails.</p>

<p>China is home to around two-thirds of the world's more than 300 sinkholes, and Guangxi alone has over 30. These sinkholes are formed in limestone-rich regions where underground rivers gradually erode the rock, creating vast caverns that eventually collapse, leaving deep holes behind. These pits are isolated from the outside world, allowing ecosystems to thrive, largely untouched by human activity.</p>

<p>Dr Lina Shen, a sinkhole researcher, highlighted the importance of preserving these unique habitats. “We should better protect such habitats. Sinkholes are paradises for many rare and endangered plant species.” Dr Shen suggested that measures such as “hot air balloons, drones for aerial photography, and appropriate pathways for observation from a distance” could help minimise human impact on these delicate sites while allowing people to “closely yet remotely view sinkholes.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The trend has drawn criticism from netizens with many worried that some impressionable teenagers might harm themselves while using the hot glue.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new Japanese make-up trend, involving the use of hot melted glue to create tear-like droplet shapes that are then placed on the face, is going viral among teenage schoolgirls, according to a report in <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3287505/japan-new-make-trend-teen-girls-uses-hot-melted-glue-create-tear-droplets?module=hp_section_people-culture&amp;pgtype=homepage" rel="noindex, nofollow">South China Morning Post </a>(SCMP).&nbsp;</em>The trendy style, known as "3D teardrop make-up" gives the girls a delicate appearance that is intended to evoke sympathy -- making them look as if they are crying. The trend has spread rapidly across Japanese schools with a shortage of hot melt glue guns also reported in some areas.</p>

<p>As per experts, such bizarre trends routinely come up on social media in the country and last a few weeks. The make-up process involves squeezing super hot glue onto a smooth surface, such as a plastic sheet. Once the glue cools and solidifies, it can be removed and attached to the face using fake eyelash glue.</p>

<p>However, the trend has drawn criticism from netizens with many worried that some impressionable teenagers might harm themselves while using the hot glue. Many have labelled the entire trend as "ridiculous" and "bizarre" and called out those participating in it.</p>

<p>“Seriously? Are secondary school girls really into this kind of inappropriate trend now?” a user was quoted as saying by the outlet, while another commented: “Wait, doesn't this hot glue tear make-up look suspiciously like sperm?”</p>

<p>This is not the first time that the hot melted glue trend has taken off. Last year, TikTok beauty creator, Vanessa Funes, better known as @cutcreaser, posted a video where she used hot glue gun to create a space-age eyeliner look.</p>

<p>“The first design I made was inspired by the Mandalorian's Beskar armour but melted. So, I thought of melted metal and how that would look as an eyeliner design," said Ms Funes, whose video with the hashtag #hotgluemakeup, managed to garner 14.9 million views.</p>

<p>Experts suggest that the hot glue should not be directly placed on the face in any condition. It is recommended to use a stainless-steel surface or parchment paper as a base to draw the desired designs if one intends to go through with the trend.</p>

<h3><strong>Unconventional beauty trends</strong></h3>

<p>In September this year, a viral beauty trend in the US urged the netizens to eat dirt as a remedy for health issues. The peculiar practice, touted to improve gut health, skin problems, and even obesity, gained significant traction on TikTok.</p>

<p>Edible clay and soil products were being sold on e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Etsy, ranging from powders to clay chunks, priced between Rs 900 to Rs 2,200.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US antitrust lawyers are calling on a judge to force the sale of Google's Chrome browser to limit the company's market clout in a move that would shake up the internet giant.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the US Department of Justice submitted its recommendation for the breakup to US District Court Judge Amit Mehta, who is set to impose steps next year to address Google's monopoly power in online search.</p>

<p><strong>Blow to Google?</strong></p>

<p>"This would be a huge gut punch to Google," said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.</p>

<p>Google provides free search, making money off targeting ads and features that promote online commerce.</p>

<p>"It would greatly alter (Google's) business model," said Syracuse University professor of advertising Beth Egan.</p>

<p>Selling Chrome would also deprive Google of a rich source of information used to train its algorithms and promote its other services like Maps.</p>

<p>Launched in 2008, Chrome dominates the browser market, dwarfing rivals Edge and Safari, developed by Microsoft and Apple, respectively.</p>

<p>Egan believed Google would find a way to recover if forced to sell Chrome.</p>

<p>"I don't think divesting the browser is going to kill Google as a company," Egan said.</p>

<p>She noted that it could be its users who wind up suffering, given the case Google is making in blog posts on the matter.</p>

<p><strong>What is Chrome worth?</strong></p>

<p>A Bloomberg analyst estimates that Chrome, which is used by more than three billion people around the world, would sell for at least $15 billion.</p>

<p>But given the lack of precedent, predicting how much Chrome would fetch on the market is tricky.</p>

<p>A Chinese investment group bought an internet browser from Opera Software ASA in Norway for $600 million in 2016, but it only claimed 350 million users at the time.</p>

<p><strong>Who might buy it?</strong></p>

<p>There are very few potential buyers for Chrome, according to Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf.</p>

<p>"It's likely that any company with deep enough pockets to afford Chrome is already under antitrust scrutiny," Mitchell-Wolf said.</p>

<p>"If I had to speculate, my inclination is to look at US-based artificial intelligence players."</p>

<p>While Chrome being bought by the likes of OpenAI would certainly raise antitrust concerns, the US government could see it as a way for the nation to prioritize innovation on the global stage.</p>

<p>Elon Musk's AI startup could conceivably be a Chrome contender, bankrolled by his riches and having the deal cleared thanks to his close working relationship with incoming president Donald Trump.</p>

<p><strong>Win for rivals?</strong></p>

<p>Analysts agreed that people will keep using Chrome regardless of who owns it, provided the quality doesn't plummet.</p>

<p>"This assumes Chrome retains its most popular features and continues innovating," said analyst Mitchell-Wolf.</p>

<p>"Search behaviors are a function of convenience first, trust and experience second."</p>

<p>The justice department's argument that people use Chrome because it is a default search engine in devices is off the mark, the analyst added.</p>

<p><strong>Trump factor</strong></p>

<p>Many doubt that Judge Mehta will embrace all of the justice department's proposed remedies in the case.</p>

<p>CFRA analyst Angelo Zino considered the measures "extreme and unlikely to be imposed by the court."</p>

<p>The incoming Trump administration also "remains a wild card" regarding whether justice officials will back off the idea of breaking up Google.</p>

<p>Trump in October indicated he opposes dismantling Google, believing such a move would be against the interests of the US internationally.</p>

<p>"China is afraid of Google" and a breakup would hurt the company, Trump reasoned at the time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Trump has also accused Google of being unfair to conservatives.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jeff Bezos has reacted to Elon Musk's claim that the Amazon founder had advised people to sell their Tesla and SpaceX stocks because he expected Donald Trump to lose the US election. Musk, who is the CEO of both Tesla and SpaceX, posted on Thursday that he "just learned that at Mar-a-Lago Jeff Bezos was telling everyone Donald Trump would lose for sure, so they should sell their Tesla and SpaceX stock". Hours later, Mr Bezos responded to the tweet, refuting the claim.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Nope. 100% not true," the billionaire, who also owns The Washington Post and aerospace giant Blue Origin, wrote. "Well, then, I stand corrected," Elon Musk replied with a laughing face emoji.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Well, then, I stand corrected ?</p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1859644231394218321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Notably, Jeff Bezos' tweet is his first since November 6 when he broke his four-month silence on the microblogging platform to congratulate Donald Trump. "Big congratulations to our 45th and now 47th President on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory. No nation has bigger opportunities. Wishing @realDonaldTrump all success in leading and uniting the America we all love," he tweeted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, before this, Mr Bezos made headlines after<em> The Washington Post</em> decided to stop making presidential endorsements. According to <em>Deadline</em>, the publication had planned to endorse Kamala Harris. Mr Bezos said that the action was necessary to help restore trust in the media.</p>

<p>However, after facing criticism over non-endorsement, the Amazon boss explained in an op-ed article that presidential endorsements created the "perception of bias" and did not "tip the scales" of an election.</p>

<p>"No undecided voters in Pennsylvania are going to say, 'I'm going with Newspaper A's endorsement'. None," Mr Bezos wrote. "What presidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a principled decision, and it's the right one," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elon Musk, on the other hand, reportedly spent more than $100 million to boost Donald Trump's election bid. Now, Mr Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have been appointed by the president-elect to lead an effort called the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to remake the federal government and provide guidance for massive cuts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A notorious Venezuelan prison gang has established a presence in at least 16 US states, covering nearly half the nation's population, according to a recent internal intelligence memo from Homeland Security.</p>

<p>The memo highlights the Tren de Aragua (TdA)'s growing foothold in various parts of the country, most recently in Washington, DC, Virginia, Montana, and Wyoming, The <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/19/us-news/tren-de-aragua-has-already-set-up-shop-in-these-16-states-homeland-security-warns/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">New York Post</a> reported. The group is also reportedly active in California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>As the gang spreads, its “violent tendencies” have reportedly escalated, causing growing concern among law enforcement agencies. Homeland Security's memo pointed to a correlation between the arrival of TdA members in new regions and the increase in local migrant populations, warning that “the potential for violent TdA migrants is highly probable.”</p>

<p>In August 2023, three people were detained for shoplifting in Fairfax County, Virginia, following a run-in with suspected TdA members. All three suspects had gang-related tattoos, and one had a fake Venezuelan ID.</p>

<p>The DC area is seen as a strategic base for the gang, which reportedly uses its proximity to Virginia's suburbs to engage in theft, robbery, and assault. Homeland Security also flagged an uptick in “lower-level fraud and theft schemes,” with stolen funds being wired back to South America to finance further criminal activities.</p>

<p>In one case, a suspected TdA member in Florida withdrew $1,18,000 from a bank account using fraudulent cheque deposits, transferring the funds to Venezuela before the fraud could be detected.</p>

<p>In Wyoming, where the gang's presence has been relatively limited, Laramie County Sheriff Brian Kozak revealed the arrest of a suspected TdA member.</p>

<p>Tren de Aragua members are believed to have infiltrated the US amid a massive wave of migrants crossing the southern border during the Joe Biden administration. A lack of information-sharing between the US and Venezuela has hindered the detection of gang members, enabling their release into the country, according to US Border Patrol sources, reported New York Post.</p>

<p>Efforts to deport Venezuelan nationals face significant roadblocks due to strained relations between Washington and the Venezuelan government, which has refused to accept deportation flights.</p>

<p>Reports of TdA's activities range from violent crimes to sophisticated trafficking networks. In New York, the gang has been linked to shootings, robberies, and gun smuggling in migrant shelters. Members are also reportedly involved in sex trafficking, particularly on Roosevelt Avenue in Queens.</p>

<p>Tennessee has also emerged as a hotspot for the gang's operations, with human trafficking rings and retail crime thefts reported in cities such as Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville, and Chattanooga.</p>

<p>The expanding influence of Tren de Aragua has drawn attention from political leaders. US President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to prioritise cracking down on the gang, promising a historic mass deportation effort involving both Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the US military.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian rocket attacks on Russian trainees in the occupied territory have left hundreds dead or wounded in the last nine months. Despite repeated losses, Russian commanders continue to gather troops in exposed, vulnerable locations within the range of Ukraine's precision weapons.</p>

<p>On Thursday, around a dozen Russian troops disembarked from civilian vans in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, southern Ukraine, unaware they were under surveillance. Moments later, a High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), stationed up to 92 km away, launched a single M30/31 rocket, a Forbes report said.</p>

<p>The rocket landed near the group, scattering deadly fragments and leaving at least five soldiers dead or critically injured. Ukrainian forces refrained from executing a follow-up "double-tap" strike - a tactic used earlier in Zaporizhzhia that reportedly killed dozens of survivors and first responders. Even so, the toll on Russian trainees continues to mount.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Since February, eight similar strikes across Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk Oblasts have killed hundreds of Russians. Analysts say the decision to conduct training in exposed areas close to the frontlines is a reflection of constant failings in Russian military leadership.</p>

<p>This vulnerability brings to light the infamous bombardments in Chornobaivka, near Kherson, where Ukrainian forces targeted Russian command posts 22 times over eight months.</p>

<p>"Some suggest the Russian experience at Chornobaivka and elsewhere can be explained by the Russians' inability to overcome challenges in professionalism, training, and communications," observed US Army officers in a 2023 Military Review article.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The continued exposure of trainees to deadly attacks indicates these systemic challenges remain unresolved.</p>

<p>Ukraine has intensified its focus on disrupting Russian command systems. Following the authorisation from the US, the UK and France to strike within Russia using Western munitions, Ukrainian forces launched a significant raid on a command post in Russia's Kursk Oblast using ten ex-British Storm Shadow cruise missiles. Reports suggest the strike may have killed a Russian general and injured a North Korean counterpart.</p>

<p>Such attacks, which eliminate experienced battlefield leaders, further weaken an already strained Russian command structure.</p>

<p>The situation could shift dramatically with the January inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump. Trump has hinted at withdrawing US aid to Ukraine, potentially including the HIMARS systems significant to these strikes. He has also signalled a willingness to let Russia operate unchecked in Europe. If this policy change materialises, it could provide a lifeline to the struggling Russian forces.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk might be the richest person in history, but he was way behind Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on the 2024 list of top earners. Mr Huang's annual earnings skyrocketed from $21.1 billion in 2023 to $77 billion in 2024, according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/jensen-huang/?listuri=rtb " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">Forbes</a>. This was nearly four-fold of Mr Musk's <a href="http://https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/?list=rtb/ " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">$15 billion increase</a> in annual earnings from $180 billion in 2023 to $195 billion in 2024.</p>

<p>The massive boost took Mr Huang's net worth to $123.8 billion, placing him ninth on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaire List.</p>

<p>Tesla's soaring shares pushed Mr Musk's net worth to $334.3 billion this year.</p>

<h3><strong>Who is&nbsp;Jensen Huang</strong></h3>

<p>Born in Taiwan and raised in the US from the age of nine, Mr Huang's academic journey led him from Oregon State University to Stanford University, where he specialised in electrical engineering. As co-founder and CEO of Nvidia since 1993, Mr Huang has been the visionary behind the company's rise as a leader in AI technology.</p>

<p>Nvidia's shares hit a record high this year, contributing significantly to Huang's fortune. His 3.5 per cent equity stake in the $3.5 trillion company now accounts for nearly all of his wealth, valued at $122.2 billion. Even after selling $713 million worth of Nvidia stock earlier this year, Mr Huang remains the company's largest shareholder.</p>

<p>Nvidia holds an 80 per cent market share in AI accelerators, crucial for cutting-edge AI applications used by tech giants like Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and even Tesla. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs), initially popular in gaming, have become essential for AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Demand for Nvidia's products is so intense that Mr Huang described it as “insane,” with customers reportedly becoming “really emotional” over availability, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/21/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-vaults-into-worlds-10-richest-for-first-time-ever/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">Forbes</a> reported.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Long before alphabets came into existence, human civilisations used different means to communicate such as images and hieroglyphics.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US researchers have discovered what appears to be the oldest known alphabetic writing in the world, after finding finger-length clay cylinders from a tomb in Syria with the etched details. Using carbon-14 dating techniques, the researchers at John Hopkins University determined that the cylinders were made around 2400 B.C.E., which makes them around 500 years older than any other known alphabetic scripts. Alongside the writings, the researchers discovered Early Bronze Age tombs, including a well-preserved grave with six burials inside.</p>

<p>The bodies were accompanied by gold and silver jewellery, cookware, a spearhead, and pottery vessels. Four “lightly baked clay cylinders” were next to the pottery and were etched with alphabetic writing. Notably, they were found in 2004 and described in an academic paper in 2021 but only gained prominence this week as one of the researchers presented the findings at the annual meeting of the American Society of Overseas Research.</p>

<p>"This new discovery shows that people were experimenting with new communication technologies much earlier and in a different location than we had imagined before now," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/archaeologists-say-these-mysterious-markings-could-be-the-worlds-oldest-known-alphabetic-writing-180985525/" rel="noindex, nofollow">said </a>Glenn Schwartz, a professor of archaeology at Johns Hopkins University, associated with the research.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/archaeologists-discover-a-hidden-ancient-language-dating-back-3-000-years-4577569" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Also Read | Archaeologists Discover a Hidden Ancient Language Dating Back 3,000 Years</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>'Different origin'</strong></h3>

<p>Long before alphabet came into existence, human civilisations used different means to communicate. While the Sumerians of Mesopotamia used cuneiforms or small images, the ancient Egyptians developed hieroglyphics, and Chinese characters built the written language piece by piece.</p>

<p>"Previously, scholars thought the alphabet was invented in or around Egypt sometime after 1900 BCE. Our artefacts are older and from a different area on the map, suggesting the alphabet may have an entirely different origin story than we thought," Mr Schwartz added.</p>

<p>The form of writing, discovered on the clay cylinder may have revolutionised language by making it accessible to people not belonging to the royalty and social elite. However, the scientists have been unable to translate what the writing on the cylinder means.</p>

<p>“The cylinders were perforated, so I'm imagining a string tethering them to another object to act as a label. Maybe they detail the contents of a vessel, or maybe where the vessel came from, or who it belonged to. Without a means to translate the writing, we can only speculate.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learning CPR compression techniques on manikins without breasts contributes towards women being less likely to receive life-saving first aid from bystanders, a study conducted by Australian researchers found. For the study, researchers at the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne analysed 20 different manikin models in the global market designed for adult cardiopulmonary resuscitation training. They found that all the manikins had flat torsos, with only one model having a breast overlay. Eight were identified as male, while seven had no gender specified.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The study highlights the findings as an equity issue with implications for the human right to health, the study authors said, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/21/learning-cpr-on-manikins-without-breasts-puts-womens-lives-at-risk-study-finds" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>The Guardian</em></a>. They urged CPR training providers and manufacturers to commit to improving the diversity of CPR training manikins.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Governments, manufacturing companies, training bodies and those of us procuring and using these important training products all play an important role to address this important issue that may improve outcomes for women," said study lead Dr Rebecca Szabo. This aligned with the aims of the National Women's Health Advisory Council, chaired by Australia's assistant minister for health, Ged Kearney, "to tackle 'medical misogyny'," on a range of key concerns including cardiovascular disease, she added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the outlet, Ms Szabo is the lead of the Gandel Simulation Service at the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne and an obstetrician and gynaecologist. She revealed that she embarked on her research after she could not find any CPR manikins with breasts to train healthcare workers in life support for maternal cardiac arrest in pregnancy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In the end we purchased a chest plate with breasts online," she said, explaining, "It's similar to what a drag queen would wear and goes on like a singlet. We put that on our manikin for training."</p>

<p>According to Ms Szabo, the CPR compression technique is no different for women and training on manikins representing both sexes "may help people feel more comfortable ... being confronted with a bra, breasts and something different" in a real-life emergency. Breasts may also influence how defibrillator pads are applied, especially if there are breast implants or larger breasts, she said.</p>

<p>"Our study is the first of its kind to name this as a gender and human rights issue linking this to business human rights and the commercial determinants of health," Ms Szabo continued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The study "highlights the critical need for regulatory bodies at all stages of the health and medical pipeline - from fundamental research through to the tools used to educate healthcare providers - to have policies that mandate consideration of sex and gender," said Professor Bronwyn Graham, the national director of the Centre for Sex and Gender Equity in Health and Medicine opened in March by The George Institute for Global Health.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Without such policies, these often insidious biases remain, and we will continue to put the lives of women and girls, and other marginalised sex and gender groups (including those with variations in sex characteristics, trans, and gender-diverse people) at risk of harm on a daily basis," she added.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 23-year-old girl has claimed that her decision to take an ancestry DNA test may have helped police solve the 27-year-old Baby Garnet case, sending her grandmother to jail. In a video on TikTok, Jenna Rose Gerwatowski talked about the murder mystery, saying she took the DNA test a few years ago because it seemed "dope," <a href="http://https://nypost.com/2024/11/22/us-news/tiktokkers-ancestry-dna-test-may-have-solved-notorious-baby-garnet-case/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">The New York Post</a> reported.<br />
<br />
Ms&nbsp;Gerwatowski said she didn't know her decision would end up sending her grandmother to jail.<br />
<br />
“Little did I know,” Jenna said with a chuckle and later cut the video to how a year after she was called by a detective from the Michigan State Police at work.<br />
<br />
“I was like, ‘Excuse me? What the f*** did I do?' So I start freaking out,” she recalled.<br />
<br />
However, once she met the cop she was informed that he had re-opened a 1997 cold case, adding her DNA was a "direct match to the victim of this case".<br />
<br />
Ms&nbsp;Gerwatowski was shocked to find the police officer was talking about Baby Garnet, a “term or near-term” newborn found dead in an outhouse at Garnet Lake Campground in Michigan's Naubinway.<br />
<br />
Later, DNA testing was carried out, and it confirmed that Ms Gerwatowski's mother was linked directly to the child. This means it had to be related to "my mom's mother," she said about Nancy Gerwatoswki, 61, whom she claimed to have never met.<br />
<br />
“I was mind blown,” she said, adding her grandmother was the person police was looking for the past 25 years. "It's all because of an Ancestry DNA kit,” she said.<br />
<br />
Nancy Gerwatoswki was arrested in 2022 and charged with murder, involuntary manslaughter and concealing the death of an individual. She even admitted to being Baby Garnet's mother.<br />
<br />
She may have given birth to the child at home, while the newborn died of asphyxiation. Later, she left the body in the outhouse. The prosecutors in the case argued the newborn child might have been saved if medical help had been sought.<br />
<br />
Nancy Gerwatowski was released in October last year on a personal recognizance bond, while she was ordered to comply with GPS monitoring and home confinement. If convicted, she might get a life sentence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Due to Storm Bert effect, temperatures have dipped below freezing all week, with snow and ice settling across the north of Scotland.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Storm Bert will bring "multi-hazard event" event of snow, rain and wind to much of the UK, according to weather officials, who have advised motorists to drive carefully. According to a report in <em>The Guardian</em>, the Met Office has issued yellow warning for parts of the UK and more severe amber for Scotland for Saturday and Sunday. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/storm-bert-warning-issued-for-heavy-snow-rain-and-travel-chaos-in-uk-7078171">Bret is the second named storm</a> of the season to bring extreme weather events to parts of the UK. Wind gusts of up to 70 mph (113 kmph) and heavy rain are expected in some areas.</p>

<p>"We're looking at strong winds, some high snowfall accumulation, heavy rain, all in various different parts of the UK. So it's quite a complex weather set-up for the weekend. Generally speaking, it's a very unsettled weekend of weather ahead," Oli Claydon, a spokesperson for the Met Office, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/22/uk-weather-met-office-warns-of-wintry-conditions-as-multi-hazard-storm-bert-approaches" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>The Guardian</em></a>.</p>

<p>"Further south, it's wind and rain, further north it's snow then rain and wind. So it really depends on where you are in the UK. Keep on top of the forecast for your area and prepare as necessary," he added.</p>

<p>Storm Bert is expected to reach the UK on Saturday.</p>

<p>The amber warning for Scotland covers parts of Angus, Perth and Kinross, Stirlingshire, Aberdeenshire and some of the Highlands and Argyll and Bute. The warning will be in place from 7am to 5pm (local time) in Saturday.</p>

<p>Temperatures have dipped below freezing all week, with snow and ice settling across the north of Scotland, reported the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvged5y8qn2o" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>BBC</em></a>.</p>

<p>The extreme weather warning has already led to closure of dozens of schools across the UK and Scotland, and deferred timings for several others.</p>

<p>Scottish government agency Transport Scotland said roads may be affected by deep snow, particularly over higher routes, and some rural communities might be cut off.</p>

<p>Forecasters say Storm Bert is moving very slow and will start to clear from Monday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his first television interview since the CNN debate with Donald Trump, President Joe Biden candidly addressed his performance, describing it as a "bad episode" and taking full responsibility for what transpired.</p>

<p>ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos interviewed Biden in Madison, Wisconsin, following a rally with Democratic supporters where Biden reiterated his commitment to staying in the race.</p>

<p>Stephanopoulos didn't waste time delving into the debate, acknowledging Biden's team's characterisation of it as a "bad night." Biden concurred, straightforwardly admitting, "Sure did."</p>

<p>The conversation then turned to remarks made by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who queried whether the debate was indicative of a more serious underlying issue. "It was a bad episode," Biden clarified. "No indication of any serious condition. I was exhausted. I didn't listen to my instincts in terms of preparing and -- and a bad night."</p>

<p>Regarding his preparation leading up to the debate, which followed his international trip to France for the D-Day anniversary and subsequent rest at Camp David, the anchor asked why the recovery time wasn't sufficient. Biden explained, "Because I was sick. I was feeling terrible." He disclosed that medical tests ruled out COVID-19 but confirmed he had been battling a severe cold.</p>

<p>The anchor inquired if Biden had watched the debate footage afterward. Biden admitted, "I don't think I did, no."</p>

<p>Pressed on whether he realised how poorly it was going while on stage, Biden acknowledged, "Yeah, look. The whole way I prepared, nobody's fault, mine. Nobody's fault but mine."</p>

<p>He reflected on his preparation style and how he adapted it inappropriately for the debate setting, saying, "I prepared what I usually would do sitting down as I did come back with foreign leaders or the National Security Council for explicit detail. And I realised-- partway through that, you know, all-- I get quoted the New York Times had me down, ten points before the debate, nine now, or whatever the hell it is. The fact of the matter is that what I looked at is that he also lied 28 times. I couldn't-- I mean, the way the debate ran, not-- my fault, nobody else's fault, no one else's fault."</p>

<p>"But it seemed like you were having trouble from the first question in, even before he spoke?" Stephanopoulos asked.</p>

<p>"Well, I just had a bad night," Biden said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden on Friday said he was exhausted due to a heavy cold and lingering jetlag as he sought to explain his dismal debate performance against Donald Trump.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden vowed Friday to stay in the White House race and blamed his dismal debate performance on "feeling terrible" due to a cold, as he sought to save his reelection campaign with a make-or-break TV interview.</p>

<p>As rebellion brews among some nervous Democratic voters, lawmakers and donors, the one-to-one with the ABC network was hyped as the most consequential of the 81-year-old's long career.</p>

<p>"I was sick, I was feeling terrible... We were trying to figure out what's wrong," the president said in an excerpt of his first TV interview since the debate with Donald Trump.</p>

<p>"They did a test to see whether or not I had some infection, you know, a virus. I didn't. I just had a really bad cold."</p>

<p>Biden sounded raspy and gave meandering answers in the clip, which appeared unlikely to reassure Democrats.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign offered a lightning-quick mocking reaction, posting on X that "Biden sounds great!"</p>

<p>The sit-down -- which was due to be aired in full later Friday, came after Biden's debate in Atlanta triggered panic within his party and calls for him to pull out of the race.</p>

<p>The Biden campaign has pushed back hard on any suggestion he may withdraw and, just hours before the ABC interview, released an aggressive campaign travel schedule for the rest of July.</p>

<p>Appearing at a campaign rally in Madison, Wisconsin, the president delivered an energetic stump speech, unequivocally declaring, "I'm staying in the race. I'll beat Donald Trump."</p>

<p>As supporters cheered, he went on the attack against his rival.</p>

<p><strong>- Polls tip toward Trump -</strong></p>

<p>"Let's focus on what really matters," Biden said, reading from teleprompters. "We're running against the biggest liar and the biggest threat... to our democracy in American history -- that's not hyperbole."</p>

<p>Post-debate polls have shown a widening deficit in Trump's favor, and at least three Democrats in Congress have called on Biden to step aside, as have several major newspapers and a raft of Democratic-supporting political commentators.</p>

<p>Wealthy Disney heiress and Democratic supporter Abigail Disney, told CNBC she plans to withhold donations to the party until Biden drops out, saying bluntly that "if Biden does not step down the Democrats will lose" in November.</p>

<p>"This is realism, not disrespect," she said.</p>

<p>Senate Intelligence Committee chariman Mark Warner has approached fellow Democrats to organize talks on Monday on Biden's path forward, multiple US media outlets reported.</p>

<p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries was convening his own meeting -- a video call with senior Democrats -- on Sunday, according to NBC News.</p>

<p>Former US House speaker Nancy Pelosi, one of the most influential Democratic voices, has deemed it "essential" he do more major interviews to prove himself.</p>

<p>The White House has announced he will hold a press conference during the NATO summit in Washington next Thursday, but has not revealed any details on its format or length.</p>

<p>Biden's travel plans include Pennsylvania this weekend, then the NATO meeting, and back on the campaign trail with a swing through the American Southwest.</p>

<p>The president will "engage in frequent off-the-cuff moments over the course of the month, as he has consistently throughout this campaign," his team said, seeking to emphasize his folksy charm.</p>

<p>Trump has meanwhile dared Biden to another debate, or an "all-on discussion," saying he was ready "anytime, anywhere, any place."</p>

<p>With speculation swirling over a potential switch in the Democratic ticket, Kamala Harris, the nation's first female vice president, has suddenly been in the spotlight.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old former prosecutor has offered unwavering support for Biden in public but is standing by as a leading alternative if he steps aside.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A defiant President Joe Biden told supporters Friday he was staying in the White House race and would defeat Donald Trump again, despite fellow Democrats' concerns he lacks the capacity to go head to head against his rival.</p>

<p>"Let me say this as clearly as I can: I'm staying in the race. I'll beat Donald Trump," the president told a rally in Madison, Wisconsin, more than a week after his faltering debate performance raised doubts about his physical and mental fitness.</p>

<p>The US President insisted Friday that no one is more qualified to lead the nation or defeat Trump than he is, swatting away concerns over whether he can beat his Republican challenger in November.</p>

<p>Asked if staying in the race against Trump might jeopardize Democrats holding on to the White House, Biden said: "I don't think anybody's more qualified to be president or win this race than me."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden on Friday spoke to new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, congratulating him on the center-left Labour party's landslide general election victory.</p>

<p>Biden and Starmer "reiterated their continued support for Ukraine as it fights Russia's unrelenting aggression," the White House said in a statement.</p>

<p>"They affirmed their shared commitment to protecting the gains of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement and working with the leaders of Northern Ireland to create and sustain economic growth and opportunities," it added.</p>

<p>Starmer will meet Biden and other world leaders in Washington next week at a NATO summit.</p>

<p>The British vote results contrast with Britain's closest Western allies, with the far-right in France eyeing power and Donald Trump ahead in polls against Biden before the November US presidential election.</p>

<p>Biden and Starmer "reaffirmed the special relationship between our nations and the importance of working together in support of freedom and democracy around the world," the statement said.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer told US President Joe Biden on Friday that British support for Ukraine's war with Russia was "unwavering", in a first call hours after Britain's new leader took charge.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer told US President Joe Biden on Friday that British support for Ukraine's war with Russia was "unwavering", in a first call hours after Britain's new leader took charge.</p>

<p>"The leaders reiterated their steadfast commitment to Ukraine and the prime minister underscored that the UK's support for Ukraine was unwavering," Starmer's Downing Street office said in a readout.</p>

<p>"The leaders discussed their shared commitment to the special relationship between the UK and US, and their aligned ambitions for greater economic growth," the statement added.</p>

<p>It said Starmer "looked forward to working side by side across the breadth of the relationship, including the AUKUS partnership and ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific".</p>

<p>The UK, US and Australia have forged a new defence alliance in recent years dubbed AUKUS, which is seen as primarily aimed at countering China's growing military strength in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

<p>The call between the British and American leaders comes just days before they will rub shoulders next week in Washington at a NATO summit.</p>

<p>Biden had earlier congratulated Starmer on leading his centre-left Labour party to a landslide general election victory.</p>

<p>"I look forward to our shared work in support of freedom and democracy around the world, and to further strengthening the special relationship between our two countries," Biden said on X.</p>

<p>The UK readout said the two leaders also "reflected on their shared commitment to protecting the gains of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement," referring to Northern Ireland's decades-old peace deal that Washington helped secure.</p>

<p>The accord has become strained in recent years by Britain's exit from the European Union.</p>

<p>That has left Northern Ireland with the UK's only land border with the EU, along the sensitive Irish border.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With his reelection bid on the line, US President Joe Biden sits down Friday for a crucial TV interview to persuade doubters of his physical and mental fitness for a second White House term.</p>

<p>The one-to-one with the ABC network has been hyped as the most consequential of the 81-year old's long career, after a disastrous campaign debate with Donald Trump triggered panic within his Democratic Party and calls for him to pull out of the race.</p>

<p>The Biden campaign has pushed back hard on any suggestion he may withdraw, and just hours before the ABC interview it released an aggressive campaign travel schedule for the rest of July.</p>

<p>At least three of his party members in Congress have called on him to step aside, as have several major newspaper editorial boards and a raft of Democratic-supporting political commentators.</p>

<p>The president has said that he is "not leaving" and is "in this race to the end," but post-debate polls have shown Trump's lead widening.</p>

<p>Biden has also not yet spoken publicly without a teleprompter since the debate, other than some brief remarks.</p>

<p>Friday's interview with ABC presenter George Stephanopoulos, set to be recorded during a campaign trip to Wisconsin, will be a key moment for Biden to try to dispel the worries and reset expectations.</p>

<p>With soaring anticipation for the interview, ABC has switched up its original plan of airing excerpts through the weekend, and will instead broadcast it in full Friday at 8:00 pm (0000 GMT Saturday).</p>

<p>Biden will face an experienced interviewer known for his firm, effective style.</p>

<p>Stephanopoulos worked for former Democratic president Bill Clinton during his first campaign and was one of his closest advisors during his first term in the White House.</p>

<p>- Campaign schedule -</p>

<p>Biden will have to win back confidence with a clear and cohesive performance after he was often incoherent in the debate.</p>

<p>A growing number of Americans have called for him to prove he has the energy to defeat Trump in November, and handle another four years in the White House.</p>

<p>Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, one of the most influential Democratic voices, has deemed it "essential" that the president do more major interviews.</p>

<p>Other supporters have called for a long-form news conference to judge his stamina.</p>

<p>The White House has announced that he will hold a press event during the NATO summit in Washington next week, but has not revealed any details on its format or length.</p>

<p>Biden's travel plans include Pennsylvania this weekend, then the NATO meeting, and back on the campaign trail with a swing through the southwest United States.</p>

<p>The president will "engage in frequent off-the-cuff moments over the course of the month, as he has consistently throughout this campaign," his team said, seeking to emphasize his folksy charm.</p>

<p>The election is "a choice between Joe Biden -- a fighter for American families -- and Donald Trump -- a convicted criminal," it added.</p>

<p>Trump has meanwhile dared Biden to another debate, or an "all-on discussion," saying that he was ready "anytime, anywhere, any place."</p>

<p>With speculation still swirling over a potential switch-up at the top of the Democratic ticket, Kamala Harris, the nation's first female vice president, has suddenly been in the spotlight.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old former California prosecutor -- who joined Biden at Thursday's July 4 celebrations -- has been performing a delicate balancing act since the debate.</p>

<p>She has offered unwavering support for Biden in public but is standing by as a leading contender to replace him if he steps aside.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Milan's main airport will be renamed after former Italian prime minister and business tycoon Silvio Berlusconi, Transport Minister Matteo Salvini said on Friday.</p>

<p>Berlusconi, who died last year aged 86, led four governments at the helm of his centre-right Forza Italia party, and was one of Italy's most divisive figures of modern times.</p>

<p>Speaking at a conference in southern Italy, Salvini said the civil aviation authority had approved a request by the Lombardy region around Milan to rename Malpensa airport in honour of Berlusconi, who hailed from the country's financial capital.</p>

<p>"Seeing as the final decision rests with the transport minister, I really think it will go ahead," said Salvini, leader of the rightist League party and a long-time Berlusconi ally.</p>

<p>"In memory of my friend Silvio, a great businessman, a great Milanese citizen and a great Italian," Salvini later posted on social media platform X above a photo of Berlusconi and Malpensa airport.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Keir Starmer got down to work as Britain's new leader Friday, appointing his ministerial team after his centre-left Labour party's landslide general election victory ended 14 years of Conservative rule.</p>

<p>Starmer named Rachel Reeves the UK's first woman finance minister and appointed David Lammy as foreign secretary following his election win to become Labour's first prime minister since Gordon Brown in 2010.</p>

<p>Flag-waving crowds of cheering Labour activists lined Downing Street as Starmer pledged to "rebuild" the UK after head of state King Charles III invited him to form a government during a meeting at Buckingham Palace.</p>

<p>"Now, our country has voted decisively for change, for national renewal and a return of politics to public service," the 61-year-old said in his first speech as PM.</p>

<p>"The work of change begins immediately, but have no doubt, we will rebuild Britain."</p>

<p><strong>'Sorry'</strong></p>

<p>A sombre Rishi Sunak conceded defeat during a torrid night for his Conservatives that claimed the scalps of at least 12 of his senior cabinet colleagues -- and his predecessor Liz Truss.</p>

<p>Her disastrous 49-day tenure effectively sealed the Tories' fate with the public two years ago, when her unfunded tax cuts spooked markets and crashed the pound.</p>

<p>Before leaving Downing Street for the final time as prime minister, Sunak said "sorry" to the public and revealed that he would step down as Tory leader once formal arrangements for a successor are in place.</p>

<p>Labour raced past the 326 seats needed to secure an overall majority in the 650-seat House of Commons at 0400 GMT, with the final result expected on Saturday.</p>

<p>As of 1700 GMT on Friday, the party had won 412 seats in the House of Commons with only one result left to declare, giving it a majority of 174.</p>

<p>The Tories won just 121 seats -- a record low -- with the right-wing vote apparently spliced by Nigel Farage's anti-immigration Reform UK party, which picked up five seats.</p>

<p>In another boost for the centrists, the smaller opposition Liberal Democrats ousted the Scottish National Party as the third-biggest party.</p>

<p><strong>World reaction</strong></p>

<p>The results buck a trend among Britain's closest Western allies, with the far-right in France eyeing power and Donald Trump looking set for a return in the United States.</p>

<p>Congratulations came in from European leaders, including Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who said Starmer would be a "very good, very successful" prime minister.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the two countries would "continue to be reliable allies through thick and thin".</p>

<p>Ex-US president Donald Trump congratulated his admirer Farage on winning election to the UK parliament at his eighth attempt, but noticeably neglected to mention Starmer.</p>

<p>Outside London's busy Waterloo station, 49-year-old engagement officer Ramsey Sargent called it a "momentous election".</p>

<p>"It has been very rocky over the last few months and years. I'm really excited to see what happens next," he told AFP.</p>

<p><strong>'Catastrophic'</strong></p>

<p>Sunak tendered his resignation to the king shortly after returning to London from his rural constituency in northern England, where the depth of his party's defeat quickly became apparent.</p>

<p>The Tories' worst previous election result was 156 seats in 1906. Former leader William Hague told Times Radio this was "a catastrophic result in historic terms".</p>

<p>But Tim Bale, politics professor at Queen Mary, University of London, said it was "not as catastrophic as some were predicting" and the Tories would now need to decide how best to fight back.</p>

<p>Brexit champion Farage has made no secret of his aim to take over the party.</p>

<p>"There is a massive gap on the centre-right of British politics and my job is to fill it," he said after a comfortable win in Clacton, eastern England.</p>

<p><strong>To-do list</strong></p>

<p>Labour's resurgence is a stunning turnaround from five years ago, when hard-left former leader Jeremy Corbyn took the party to its worst defeat since 1935 in an election dominated by Brexit.</p>

<p>Starmer took over in early 2020 and set about moving the party back to the centre, purging the infighting and anti-Semitism that cost it support.</p>

<p>Opinion polls consistently put Labour 20 points ahead of the Tories since Truss's resignation, giving an air of inevitability about a Labour win -- the first since Tony Blair in 2005.</p>

<p>But as the count neared the end, the gap was around 11 percent, with Labour looking set to win fewer votes than it did in 2019, partly reflecting a lower turnout.</p>

<p>Starmer faces a daunting in-tray, from anaemic economic growth to overstretched and underfunded public services and households squeezed financially.</p>

<p>He has promised a return of political integrity, after a chaotic period of five Tory prime ministers in 14 years, scandal and sleaze.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk wants to dismiss a lawsuit by former Twitter shareholders who said he waited too long in early 2022 to reveal his large ownership stake in the social media company, saying "all indications" show his delay was a mistake.</p>

<p>In a late Wednesday night filing in Manhattan federal court, Musk called it implausible to believe he wanted to defraud shareholders who didn't know he had taken a 9.2% Twitter stake, and missed out on big gains because they sold their own stock.</p>

<p>Investors in the proposed class action said Musk and his wealth manager Jared Birchall knew a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rule required Musk to disclose by March 24, 2022 he had bought 5% of Twitter, yet waited another 11 days.</p>

<p>The investors said this let Musk buy more shares at cheap prices, saving more than $200 million. Twitter, now known as X, rose 27% on April 4, 2022 after Musk revealed his 9.2% stake.</p>

<p>Musk is the world's richest person according to Forbes magazine, and runs other companies including electric car maker Tesla</p>

<p>In his filing, Musk said he had intended to reveal his Twitter stake at the end of 2022, but disclosed it promptly after realizing he misunderstood the SEC disclosure rule.</p>

<p>"This is not a scheme to defraud," Musk said. "All indications--including those in the pleadings--point to mistake."</p>

<p>Musk also denied the investors' claim that an unnamed Morgan Stanley banker helped devise a trading strategy to amass Twitter shares without alerting the broader market.</p>

<p>Lawyers for the investors, who are led by an Oklahoma public pension fund, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday.</p>

<p>Musk eventually bought San Francisco-based Twitter for $44 billion in October 2022. The SEC has also probed his Twitter stock purchases.</p>

<p>Last September, U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter refused to dismiss an earlier version of the lawsuit, finding evidence that Musk understood the SEC disclosure and testified about it under oath.</p>

<p>The case is Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System v Musk et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 22-03026.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A team of archeologists have discovered the ruins of what appears to be a 4,000-year-old ceremonial temple buried in a sand dune of northern Peru, alongside skeletal human remains which may have been offerings for religious rituals.</p>

<p>The ruins were discovered in the sandy desert district of Zana, in the South American country's Lambayeque region, a short stretch from the Pacific Ocean and some 780 km (484 miles) north of the capital Lima.</p>

<p>"We are still waiting for radio-carbon dating to confirm the date, but the evidence suggests this religious construction could be part of a religious tradition of temples built on Peru's northern coast during that period," said Luis Muro, an archeologist from Peru's Pontifical Catholic University who led the research.</p>

<p>Muro's team found the skeletal remains of three adults between the walls and bases of what was once a multi-story structure, one of which was accompanied by offerings and possibly wrapped in a kind of linen or clothing, he said.</p>

<p>One of the temple walls sports a high-relief drawing of a mythological figure with a human body and a bird's head, a design which Muro said predates the pre-Hispanic Chavin culture which populated the central Peruvian coast for over half a millennia from around 900 BC.</p>

<p>Muro said remains of what might have been another temple were found in another excavation nearby, this one belonging to the late Moche culture, which arose about 1,400 years ago across the country's northern coast.</p>

<p>Northern Peru is home to the ruins of ceremonial complexes such as the Sacred City of Caral, about 5,000 years old, while southern Peru's Ica region hosts the Nazca lines, mysterious geoglyphs carved into the desert more than 1,500 years ago.</p>

<p>Peru's most prominent archaeological site is the Incan citadel Machu Picchu, nestled in the mountainous Cusco province, a World Heritage site which was built in the mid-15th century.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US president Donald Trump celebrated the election of fellow populist Nigel Farage to Britain's parliament on Friday, neglecting to mention the new prime minister, Keir Starmer.</p>

<p>Farage's anti-immigration Reform UK party won the third largest vote haul, but under Britain's electoral system it took just five seats while Starmer's Labour party swept into office with a landslide.</p>

<p>"Congratulations to Nigel Farage on his big WIN of a Parliament Seat Amid Reform UK Election Success. Nigel is a man who truly loves his Country!" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>Farage is a long-standing ally of Trump, who has dubbed the divorced father-of-four "Mr Brexit" and previously said the British populist would have done a "great job" as the UK's ambassador to Washington.</p>

<p>Farage is a champion of Brexit who was elected to parliament on his eighth attempt and has made no secret of his desire to take over the now-main opposition Conservative party, which was trounced at the polls by Labour.</p>

<p>"There is a massive gap on the centre-right of British politics and my job is to fill it," he said after a comfortable win in Clacton, eastern England.</p>

<p>The result bucks a rightward trend among Britain's closest allies, with the far-right National Rally in France eyeing power and Trump looking set for a return in the United States.</p>

<p>Farage's win will likely embolden the attention-grabbing populist figurehead in his long-term aim of staging a "takeover" of the Conservatives.</p>

<p>Millions of their voters appeared to have already switched their support to Reform, handing the Tories one of their worst-ever results.</p>

<p>An initial exit poll caused a stir Thursday night after predicting Reform would secure 13 seats -- far exceeding forecasts in the latter stages of the campaign that it would win just a handful.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping promised on Friday to defend the "territorial integrity" of Tajikistan as he announced a boost to diplomatic relations with the neighbouring country on a rare visit.</p>

<p>Xi arrived in the Tajik capital Dushanbe, Thursday night from Kazakhstan following a gathering of leaders of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), during which he held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin and urged the bloc to "resist external interference".</p>

<p>Central Asia is a vital link in China's flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a massive infrastructure project that Beijing has used to expand its clout overseas, but which critics say has left developing countries saddled with onerous loans.</p>

<p>Beijing has sought to fill a void in the region created by Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, as former Soviet states worry about an increasingly bellicose Russia.</p>

<p>"China will continue to unswervingly promote friendly and mutually beneficial cooperation with Tajikistan... firmly support Tajikistan's efforts to safeguard national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity," Xi told his Tajik counterpart Emomali Rahmon, according to state broadcaster CCTV.</p>

<p>Xi also pledged to "firmly oppose any external interference in Tajikistan's internal affairs under any pretext", without mentioning any foreign player by name.</p>

<p>Beijing has recently stepped up its diplomatic efforts in Central Asia, a region rich in hydrocarbons and crucial for the transport of goods between Europe and Asia, but also traditionally a region of Russian influence.</p>

<p>Xi, who was welcomed by Rahmon at Dushanbe's airport where more than 1,500 young Tajiks dressed in traditional costumes performed Chinese and Tajik songs and dances, praised his counterpart.</p>

<p>"Thanks to the joint efforts of the two sides, the political mutual trust between the two countries has been continuously deepened," said Xi, praising Rahmon.</p>

<p>"No matter how the international situation changes, China will always be Tajikistan's trustworthy friend, reliable partner and close brother," said Xi.</p>

<p>The two leaders announced the upgrading of diplomatic relations, as Xi awarded Rahmon a order of friendship offered to personalities who have promoted relations with China.</p>

<p>Xi has previously visited Tajikistan in 2014 and 2019.</p>

<p>The SCO was founded in 2001 but has come to prominence in recent years. Alongside China, Russia and Belarus, its full members are: India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan and Tajikistan.</p>

<p>On Thursday in the Kazakh capital Astana, Xi told SCO leaders: "We should join hands to resist external interference, firmly support each other, take care of each other's concerns... and firmly control the future and destiny of our countries and regional peace and development in our own hands."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's newly appointed Foreign Secretary David Lammy reiterated his support Friday for international efforts to secure an "immediate ceasefire" in the Israel-Hamas war and for the release of remaining hostages.</p>

<p>Lammy, 51, said he would "get to work with tireless diplomacy" towards those twin aims, in his first comments after becoming the country's top diplomat.</p>

<p>New Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer had confirmed Lammy -- the party's spokesperson on foreign affairs since 2021 -- in the post hours earlier, following Labour's landslide victory in the UK general election held Thursday.</p>

<p>"All of us recognise the agony of communities who have seen the scenes coming out of Israel and Gaza," Lammy said from the Foreign Office.</p>

<p>"But the job now is to get to work with tireless diplomacy to support an immediate ceasefire and move towards getting those hostages out."</p>

<p>Lammy, who replaced Conservative David Cameron as foreign secretary, added that he will "do all I can diplomatically" to support US President Joe Biden's efforts to secure the ceasefire.</p>

<p>Biden announced a pathway to a truce deal in May that he said had been proposed by Israel. It included an initial six-week truce, Israeli withdrawal from Gaza population centres and the freeing of hostages by Palestinian militants.</p>

<p>Israel's spy chief was expected in Qatar on Friday for the latest effort to seal a deal and free hostages held by Palestinian militants in Gaza, almost nine months into the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

<p>The UK government under Starmer's predecessor Rishi Sunak has supported the US-led efforts, and Labour regaining power is not expected to represent a shift in London's policy towards the conflict.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Britain's new Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday appointed Rachel Reeves as finance minister, the first woman to hold the position in the country's history, following Labour's landslide election victory.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rachel Reeves, Britain's first woman finance minister, is a former child chess champion and Bank of England economist who has pledged to grow the nation's economy while showing strong fiscal discipline.</p>

<p>Reeves, 45, becomes chancellor of the exchequer after her centre-left Labour party won Thursday's UK general election by a landslide, ending 14 years of rule by the right-wing Conservatives.</p>

<p>"It is the honour of my life to have been appointed chancellor of the exchequer," Reeves wrote on social media platform X after her appointment by new Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p>

<p>"To every young girl and woman reading this, let today show that there should be no limits on your ambitions."</p>

<p>Labour had put the economy at the heart of its election manifesto, targeting growth and wealth creation as key priorities in government, while its emphasis on the latter is not normally associated with the party's traditionally leftist policies.</p>

<p>"Economic growth was the Labour Party's mission," Reeves added Friday.</p>

<p>"It is now a national mission. Let's get to work," said the married mother of two children.</p>

<p><strong>'Iron chancellor'</strong></p>

<p>Reeves recently told company bosses that Labour had become "the natural party of British business", adding that the party would show "iron discipline" over public finances.</p>

<p>The comments drew comparisons with 'Iron Lady' Margaret Thatcher, Britain's first woman prime minister.</p>

<p>Unlike Conservative leader Thatcher, who privatised key sectors after becoming prime minister in 1979, Reeves wants a form of renationalisation, notably for energy, as she takes inspiration from policy enacted by US President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Labour has pledged to create Great British Energy, a publicly owned company that would spearhead funding, alongside the private sector, for the "green" transition away from fossil fuels.</p>

<p>James Wood, senior teaching associate in political economy at the University of Cambridge, said Labour and Reeves were seeking a "responsible" approach to the public purse.</p>

<p>"When she talks about being an iron chancellor, I think what she means is: we're going to balance the books and we're going to be responsible -- and we're going to try and get Britain's economy running... in a responsible way," he told AFP.</p>

<p>London-born Reeves tapped into public anger over Sunak's predecessor Liz Truss, whose unfunded 2022 mini-budget crashed the pound and sent mortgage rates soaring, worsening a cost-of-living crisis.</p>

<p>"They want to distance themselves from fiscal irresponsibility, not making big promises about spending that they can't possibly keep," Wood added.</p>

<p><strong>Banking career</strong></p>

<p>Reeves, whose parents were teachers, is no stranger to outmanoeuvring opponents.</p>

<p>She became British girls' chess champion aged 14 before studying philosophy, politics and economics at the University of Oxford, which was followed by a Master's degree at the London School of Economics.</p>

<p>After graduating, she worked as an economist for a decade, first at the Bank of England before switching to the private sector.</p>

<p>While working for British retail bank HBOS, the global financial crisis struck in 2008, resulting in her employer receiving a huge bailout, along with other lenders, from Gordon Brown's Labour government.</p>

<p>In 2010, when the Conservatives entered power in a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, Reeves was elected Labour MP for Leeds West in northern England.</p>

<p>Eleven years later, Starmer appointed her as Labour's finance spokesperson. Her sister Ellie Reeves is also a Labour MP.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Newly-minted Prime Minister Dick Schoof faced a baptism of fire at the opening of the Dutch parliament over remarks by two cabinet ministers about a conspiracy theory with neo-Nazi roots.</p>

<p>Schoof was inaugurated on Tuesday with pomp and fanfare to head a coalition government dominated by far-right leader Geert Wilders and his anti-immigration Freedom Party, the PVV.</p>

<p>Two days later, the new Dutch premier's first lower house debate spiralled into chaos when not only the opposition, but Wilders himself aimed his arrows at Schoof, his own choice for the top job.</p>

<p>No amount of preparation could ready Schoof, a veteran career civil servant, for his first appearance within the bear pit of Dutch parliamentary politics, marked by interruptions and sniping on X, formally known as Twitter.</p>

<p>At the centre of the controversy are two cabinet ministers from Wilders' PVV: new Asylum and Migration Minister Marjolein Faber and Foreign Trade and Development Aid Minister Reinette Klever.</p>

<p>Both have in the past spoken about the so-called "omvolking" -- the Dutch term for the "great replacement theory" that supposes that Europe's white population is being deliberately replaced by immigrants.</p>

<p>While both ministers have "distanced themselves" from the term, they maintained that there was a "worrying demographic development" in the Netherlands, where the ruling coalition now wants to implement the "strictest immigration policy ever."</p>

<p><strong>Isolated</strong></p>

<p>But Schoof reiterated during the debate: "I repeat, this government is against discrimination, racism and exclusion."</p>

<p>The Dutch left-wing opposition accused Schoof of tolerating those who have made "conspiratorial" and "racist" remarks -- which also included criticising the wearing of veils -- within his ministerial team.</p>

<p>Wilders himself then launched a virulent attack on Schoof for not defending his ministers for "being made out as racists", calling Schoof's response "weak."</p>

<p>"The prime minister should immediately distance himself from it. I will not accept anything less!" Wilders said on X.</p>

<p>Schoof, not aligned to any party and who has been appointed by a four-party coalition of the PVV, the Liberal VVD, the farmer-friendly BBB and the new centre-right NSC, appeared isolated on all sides.</p>

<p>Leiden politics professor Ruud Koole told AFP the first debate was a litmus test to see how far the PVV's junior coalition parties would go to normalise extreme views within Wilders' party.</p>

<p>"It turns out very far," he said.</p>

<p>"The statements made in the past by PVV ministers about the 'great replacement' have been swept under the carpet," Koole said.</p>

<p>"All three the other coalition parties have accepted to have the 'great replacement' rephrased as a "demographic phenomenon",' he said.</p>

<p><strong>'Disgusting'</strong></p>

<p>Wilders, who claimed a stunning victory in last year's parliamentary elections, continues to lead his party as an MP.</p>

<p>He gave up on ambitions to become Dutch prime minister after other coalition parties threatened to withdraw because of his anti-Islam and eurosceptic views.</p>

<p>Wilders said he wanted to limit immigration to the Netherlands "as much as possible", but he has indeed called the "great replacement" theory "disgusting".</p>

<p>But during the debate, he aimed his barbs at Schoof for not defending those ministers made out by the left, according to Wilders, as "racist."</p>

<p>Wilders's outburst was immediately criticised by the junior coalition partner leaders of the VVD and the NSC on X.</p>

<p>"I was particularly struck by how defensive Wilders was and how he tried in a frantic and authoritarian way to deny the racism that his party clearly propagates in various ways," said Sarah Bracke, sociology professor at the University of Amsterdam.</p>

<p>"It is intellectually and politically untenable to continue to deny that the ideas at the heart of the PVV, and also of this government, are not racist, or that it would be enough to no longer mention the term 'great replacement' to make extremist and racist ideas disappear," she told AFP.</p>

<p>"If Mr Wilders continues to criticise his prime minister, this could lead to Schoof's resignation," added Leiden University's Koole.</p>

<p>"But we are not there yet," he said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rishi Sunak lost big at the UK polls. The message was further underlined by a YouTube star who stood behind him holding up a piece of paper with a giant letter "L" on it, as the outgoing Prime Minister was delivering his speech of thanks to his constituents.</p>

<p>The prank, which referred to Mr Sunak as a "loser", was claimed by YouTuber Niko Omilana. "Farewell Rishi, Hold this L," wrote the YouTuber, who has a following of 7.49 million, on X.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Niko, who is known for his various pranks online, could be seen moving behind the ex-PM to ensure his sign would be caught in the camera shots, as the conservative leader conceded the election to Labour.</p>

<p>Niko was able to make it to stage and behind the Tory leader as he stood as an independent candidate in Sunak's Yorkshire seat, which the outgoing PM has retained.</p>

<p>Last month, the famous prankster had said in a video posted on X that he is planning to "completely remove" the UK's current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak from politics.</p>

<p>There was more misery in store for the 44-year-old leader.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A cartoon posted by X user @Cartoon4sale shows what appears to be Mr Sunak sliding out of the "0" in 10 Downing Street. It suggests a decline in the power and popularity of Mr Sunak and is trolling his misfortune.</p>

<p>Shortly before Mr Sunak had conceded defeat, Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair posted on its X account saying, "Don't worry @RishiSunak we've got a seat for you". The post has since received 3.9m views so far.</p>

<p>The Conservative Party led by Mr Sunak suffered a heavy defeat after 14 years in government, ending his premiership, 20 months after he was sworn in amidst political turmoil in the party.</p>

<p>Mr Sunak saw a record number of his top ministerial team lose their seats, including defence secretary Grant Shapps and House of Commons leader Penny Mordaunt.</p>

<p>Keir Starmer has promised to "rebuild Britain" as he took office as the UK's new prime minister following his centre-left Labour party's landslide general election victory.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[When you enter a prompt in an AI chatbot, it is consuming more resources than a traditional web search, driving higher carbon emissions. But can this uptick in resource consumption by the frontier technology of AI be quantified?]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A traditional Google search consumes 0.0003-kilowatt hour (KWh) energy on an average, according to a 2009 Google report. That energy can power your household (9 watt) light bulb for about 2 minutes. Google averages about 8.5 billion searches per day as of 2023, translating to 2,550,000 KWh worth of electricity per day, which is about 2000 times more electricity than an average Indian consumes (1255 KWh) for an entire year.</p>

<p>This May, Google announced that the company will integrate AI into its search engine, which will be powered by its most powerful AI model - Gemini. &nbsp;According to Alex de Vries, a Dutch Data Scientist who spoke to The New Yorker on the subject, a single Google search with AI integrated in it will consume 10 times more energy (3 KWh) than the traditional Google search. That is 20,000 times more than the average Indian's consumption for a year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alex de Vries, who is also the founder of Digiconomist-the organisation responsible for Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index- has said that Google's energy consumption will reach about 29 billion terawatt-hours (TWh) per year if they go ahead with the AI integration in its search. This figure is equivalent to the electricity consumption of Ireland, and more than that of Kenya.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;<br />
Why are AI systems so hungry for power?&nbsp;</h2>

<p><br />
AI systems require a lot of computational power for running complex algorithms to process large corpus of ever-increasing data. When you enter a prompt in ChatGPT, it is processed by the chatbot using its servers hosted in data centres. These centres alone account for 1-1.5 percent of the entire global electricity use, according to the International Energy Agency.</p>

<p>"I think we still don't appreciate the energy needs of this (AI) technology," Sam Altman, C.E.O of OpenAI, said at a public event in Davos this January. Altman expressed the immediate need for a "breakthrough" technology like nuclear fusion to power the AI operations given the growth projections of the frontier technology. This is a clear indication that the industry leader of the Large Language Model chatbots is seeking avenues to sustain current electricity consumption levels and safeguard its future demand. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>AI's Carbon Emissions -Setback for UN 2050 Net-Zero Emission Goal?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Data centres, powering cloud computing as well as AI systems produce 2.5 to 3.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to The Shift Project, a French nonprofit working to reduce energy reliance on fossil fuels. This amounts to the same levels of greenhouse gas emissions as the entire aviation industry.</p>

<p>The energy consumption and the subsequent carbon footprint of different AI models vary significantly. For example, BigScience project BLOOM, which is an AI model with 76 billion parameters (internal variables that a model learns during training) consumes 433 megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In contrast, OpenAI's GPT-3 from 2020, which had a comparable number of parameters at 175 billion, consumed 3 times more electricity at 1287 MWh, according to the Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 data, published by Stanford Institute of Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI).</p>

<p>The CO2 equivalent emissions (in tonnes), that is the total greenhouse gas emissions expressed in terms of carbon dioxide, for BLOOM was 25 tonnes and for GPT-3, it was a whopping 20 times more, at 502 tonnes.</p>

</div>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"></div>
</div>

<p>The report also states that there is a serious lack of transparency from the AI developers on the environmental impact of their models, with most not making their carbon footprints public.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The recently released Google's Sustainability Report 2024 also reflects the energy hunger of the nascent technology of AI. The company saw a near 50 percent surge in carbon emissions in the last 5 years on the back of powering its new AI technologies. Microsoft's Sustainability Report 2024 shows similar trends with a spike of 29 percent increase in CO2 emission in 2023, compared to the previous year. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to SemiAnalysis, a US-based independent AI research and analysis company, AI will drive the increase of electricity consumption of data centres to 4.5 percent of the global energy generation by 2030. Another estimate from the International Energy Agency suggests that data centres' total electricity consumption can double from 2022 levels to 1000 TWh (equaling the current electricity consumption of Japan). India has around 138 data centres, with reportedly 45 more set to be functional by the end of 2025. The United States has the highest number of data centres with 2701 of them. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Lawmakers are starting to take stock of the situation. The European Union has taken cognisance and adopted a new regulation in March this year. Under the scheme, all data centre operators are required to report their energy and water consumption (used for cooling systems). They are also mandated to provide information on efficiency measures being implemented to ensure reduction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In February, US Democrats introduced the Artificial Intelligence Environment Impact Act of 2024. The act proposes setting up an AI Environment Impact Consortium of experts, researchers and industry stakeholders to address the environmental impact of AI. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Victoria Starmer, whose husband Keir is the new UK prime minister, works in the public health service, is hardly photographed and has kept a low profile on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>But in the coming days, many Britons will begin to recognise the face of the elegant 50-year-old brunette who has been married to the head of the Labour government for more than 15 years.</p>

<p>Since Keir Starmer became Labour leader in 2020 and during the election campaign, Victoria Starmer has not given an interview and has only rarely partaken in politics.</p>

<p>Her public appearances are few and far between: at the polling station on election days, in the stands at the Wimbledon tennis tournament and Taylor Swift's London concert, or at Buckingham Palace for state dinners and receptions.</p>

<p>A rare exception was when she joined her husband on the stage at the party's annual conference in 2023, donning a red dress in Labour's colours.</p>

<p>Even with the move into Downing Street, the former lawyer intends to continue as an occupational health worker in the NHS.</p>

<p><strong>Former lawyer</strong></p>

<p>Victoria Alexander was raised in north London. Her father is a former accountant from a Polish-Jewish background and her mother was a community doctor.</p>

<p>She studied law at Cardiff University in Wales where she was head of the student union.</p>

<p>She also volunteered in Labour's campaign headquarters under Tony Blair before becoming a solicitor in a law firm.</p>

<p>After that, she joined the NHS.</p>

<p>The new prime minister has recounted their first encounter several times, meeting back when they were both working on a court case in the early 2000s.</p>

<p>He called her up to ask if all the documents she prepared were accurate.</p>

<p>Soon after, he asked her on a date to a pub in Camden in north London.</p>

<p>The couple married in 2007 and have two children -- a 16-year-old son and a 13-year-old daughter whom Starmer never mentions by name in public to protect their privacy.</p>

<p>They live in Kentish Town, in his north London constituency.</p>

<p><strong>'Down to earth'</strong></p>

<p>While the prime minister says he is not religious, his wife has passed on Jewish traditions to their children, including going to the synagogue and Friday night dinners.</p>

<p>Always ready with a compliment for "Vic", as he refers to her, Keir Starmer told Vogue magazine that his wife was "very sassy, very down to earth".</p>

<p>In another interview, he said her current job gave him a "direct line of sight on a daily basis into the challenges of the NHS and the morale of the staff".</p>

<p>A family friend once said Victoria complemented her husband and was "literally the yin to his yang".</p>

<p>Seen by many Labour advisors as an asset to her husband, she has nevertheless kept a safe distance from the media during the election campaign.</p>

<p>Keir Starmer insisted that she wished to focus on their son, who was taking his school-leaving exams this year.</p>

<p>But she could not stop the press mentioning her testimony in court last month in a case where three pro-Palestinian activists went on trial for protesting outside the family home against Labour's stance on Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>"I felt a bit sick, to be perfectly honest. I felt apprehensive and uncomfortable", she said.</p>

<p>In Downing Street, the Starmers intend to be "fiercely protective" of their children from the media spotlight to come, the Labour leader has said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A robot employed by the Gumi City Council in South Korea went defunct after falling down a flight of stairs. While some have sensationalised the event as ‘robot suicide', experts believe it is more likely a technical malfunction or glitch. The robot was a part of the city hall staff and had been working “diligently” since August 2023, said one of its coworkers. It helped with daily tasks such as document deliveries, providing information to residents and city promotion.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Before the fall, eyewitnesses reported unusual behaviour, with the robot circling in one spot seemingly confused “as if something was there.” The incident occurred on June 27 at approximately 4 pm, with the 'Robot supervisor' found damaged and lying in the stairwell between the first and second floors of the council building.<br />
<br />
The cause of the fall remains under investigation. Officials believe it may have been due to a navigational error, sensor failure or programming bug. A city council official mentioned that the robot's “pieces have been collected and will be analysed by the company.”<br />
<br />
The robot was the first of its kind to have such a role in the city. Developed by Bear Robotics, a California-based startup, it was designed to work autonomously, navigating between floors using the elevator. Unlike other robots, which are typically limited to a single floor, this robot had the ability to move freely, making it a unique asset to the Gumi City Council. The robot worked from 9 am to 6 pm and was even given its own civil service officer card, just like a human employee.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The manufacturer, Bear Robotics, is working with the council to investigate and prevent similar incidents in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
South Korea has consistently demonstrated a strong affinity for robotics, spearheading the global adoption of automation technology. With a remarkable ratio of one industrial robot for every 10 employees, the country boasts the highest robot density in the world, as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/22/15679 ">reports</a>.<br />
<br />
However, in the wake of the recent robot incident at the Gumi City Council, the municipality has decided to temporarily halt its plans to introduce a second robot officer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/qc80ev5g_rishi-sunak_625x300_05_July_24.jpg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>"To the country, I would like to say first and foremost, I am sorry". Those were <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/i-am-sorry-uk-pm-rishi-sunak-concedes-defeat-in-uk-polls-6037606">Rishi Sunak's words</a> as he left Downing Street for the last time. "I have heard your anger, your disappointment", he declared, "and I take responsibility for this loss."</p>

<p>Sunak was addressing the nation outside Ten Downing Street, with his wife, Akshata Murty, at his side, before heading to the palace to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-general-election-why-rishi-sunak-lost-from-crumbling-nhs-to-economic-crisis-why-rishi-sunak-lost-uk-election-6039983">resign as Britain's Prime Minister</a>. It was a brief and dignified address, tinged with humility and regret. The scale of the election defeat suffered by Rishi Sunak's Conservatives is truly remarkable. The party has lost two-thirds of its seats in Parliament; there will be just over 120 Conservative MPs among the 650 members of the newly elected House of Commons. It's the Conservatives' worst-ever general election result.</p>

<h2><strong>Verdict: Failure</strong></h2>

<p>The final verdict on Rishi Sunak's 20 months in office has to be: failure. He failed to achieve several of the political goals he had publicly set himself; he didn't cut waiting times for hospital treatment or stem illegal immigration. He failed to unite his own party which, after 14 unbroken years in power, was increasingly quarrelsome and faction-ridden. And he failed to persuade the voters that he had a vision for Britain's future.</p>

<p>There were some successes too. Rishi Sunak, a decent man, restored integrity to the post of Prime Minister after the damage inflicted by Boris Johnson's clowning and deceit; he presided over a gradual improvement in the country's economy; and he sorted out some of the lingering mess in the wake of Britain's departure from the European Union.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/can-uks-new-pm-keir-starmer-fix-labours-fragile-relations-with-india-6038590">Also Read | UK Elections: Mending India-Labour Relations Won't Be Easy For Starmer</a></strong></p>

<p>But he proved to have poor political instincts. He never gave the impression of being fully in charge, and was battered and buffeted by the rivalries within his own party. His election campaign was spectacularly inept. And his own reputation was tarnished by a bizarre decision to pull out early from global commemorations of the 80th anniversary of D-Day, a proud moment in Britain's history that marked the turning of the tide against Nazi Germany in the Second World War.</p>

<p>At times, Rishi Sunak has faced political vitriol that some would see as racist. The right-winger Nigel Farage - leader of an anti-immigration party, Reform UK, which took millions of votes from the Conservatives - said during the campaign that Sunak's D-Day misjudgement was because "he doesn't understand our history and culture". But Sunak's lasting place in history is that he has been the first person of colour to head Britain's government, and he has demonstrated beyond doubt that race is no longer a barrier to getting to the very top.</p>

<h2><strong>What Changes Under Starmer?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>The Labour Party has achieved a landslide victory with the slogan 'time for change'. Its leader, Keir Starmer - who has now succeeded Sunak as prime minister - will have a huge Parliamentary majority.</p>

<p>But in fact, there is likely to be little immediate change. Starmer has made clear that a Labour government will not increase taxes and there will be no alteration in foreign policy. The only immediate policy reversal is likely to be the abandoning of Sunak's controversial and ill-considered plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda in central Africa.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pm-modi-congratulates-keir-starmer-for-win-has-a-message-for-rishi-sunak-6039526">Also Read |&nbsp;PM Modi Congratulates Keir Starmer For Win, Has A Message For Rishi Sunak</a></strong></p>

<p>Rishi Sunak has made clear that he will stand down as leader of the Conservative party, but not straight away. He will remain in the post until a successor is chosen. And he emphasised that Conservatives needed to provide a 'professional and effective' opposition to the new Labour government - which will be seen as a warning against the Conservatives lurching to the right in the aftermath of their stinging defeat.</p>

<h2><strong>Sunak, The Ex-Politician?</strong></h2>

<p>Sunak has said he will remain an MP and he has denied suggestions that he's planning to move to California, where the family has a home. But his time at the highest echelons of British politics is almost over. There is rarely any way back for a vanquished prime minister, and Sunak has been so bruised by his time in office that it's unlikely he wants to return to top level politics. At 44, he's young for a former prime minister, he is formidably clever, and he will not find life as a backbench MP very satisfying. So sooner or later, he's likely to depart the political landscape altogether and carve out a new career.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Top US diplomat Antony Blinken was due to travel to Egypt on Tuesday for talks on a Gaza ceasefire after saying Israel had accepted a US "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/blinken-says-israel-accepts-gaza-truce-proposal-ball-now-in-hamas-court-6373320" target="_blank">bridging proposal</a>" for a deal and urging Hamas to do the same.</p>

<p>Blinken, on his ninth visit to the Middle East since the Palestinian operative group's October 7 attack triggered the war with Israel, was scheduled to fly from Tel Aviv to El Alamein, the Mediterranean city famous for a World War II battle in 1942, to speak to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi at his summer palace.</p>

<p>Afterwards, he will head to a meeting with Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, in Doha, the scene of ceasefire talks last week.</p>

<p>Both <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-qatar-egypt-invite-israel-and-hamas-to-resume-talks-on-august-15-6296188" target="_blank">Egypt and Qatar</a> are working alongside the United States to broker a truce in the 10-month Gaza conflict.</p>

<p>Washington put forward the latest proposal last week after the talks in Doha.</p>

<p>Blinken said Monday he had "a very constructive meeting" with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who "confirmed to me that Israel accepts the bridging proposal".</p>

<p>Ahead of those talks, Hamas called on the mediators to implement the framework set out by US President Joe Biden in late May, rather than hold more negotiations.</p>

<p>The movement said on Sunday that the current US proposal "responds to Netanyahu's conditions" and leaves him "fully responsible for thwarting the efforts of the mediators".</p>

<p>Earlier on Monday, the US secretary of state had said: "This is a decisive moment -- probably the best, maybe the last, opportunity to get the hostages home, to get a ceasefire and to put everyone on a better path to enduring peace and security".</p>

<p>Months of on-off negotiations with US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators have failed to produce an agreement.</p>

<p>Israel and Hamas have blamed each other for delays in reaching an accord that diplomats say would help avert a wider conflagration in the Middle East that could draw in Iran and Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

<p>"There is, I think, a real sense of urgency here, across the region, on the need to get this over the finish line and to do it as soon as possible," Blinken said.</p>

<p>The Biden administration is under domestic pressure over Gaza, with pro-Palestinian protests taking place outside the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Monday.</p>

<p>Biden said in his <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-democratic-convention-live-updates-us-democratic-national-convention-to-kick-start-in-chicago-6373201" target="_blank">farewell speech</a> to the convention that the protesters "have a point", adding that "a lot of innocent people are being killed, on both sides".</p>

<h3><strong>Permanent ceasefire</strong></h3>

<p>Israel and Hamas have traded blame for delays in reaching a truce deal.</p>

<p>Hamas insisted on "a permanent ceasefire and a comprehensive (Israeli) withdrawal from the Gaza Strip", saying Netanyahu wanted to keep Israeli forces at several strategic locations within the territory.</p>

<p>Western ally Jordan, hostage supporters who protested in Tel Aviv during Blinken's visit, and Hamas itself have called for pressure on Netanyahu in order for an agreement to be reached.</p>

<p>Far-right members crucial to the prime minister's governing coalition oppose any truce.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed at least 40,139 people, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and operative deaths.</p>

<p>Out of 251 hostages seized during Hamas's attack, 111 are still held in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>The Biden framework would freeze fighting for an initial six weeks while Israeli hostages are exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and humanitarian aid enters Gaza.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said on Monday that negotiators were aiming to "release a maximum number of living hostages" in the first phase of any ceasefire.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire Elon Musk today called the first supermoon of 2024, 'amazing' to see.</p>

<p>From Monday to Wednesday, stargazers can witness a "full moon that is both a supermoon and a blue moon", said NASA in a post on X.com.</p>

<p>"The Moon looks amazing," Elon Musk said in a post.</p>

<p>According to NASA, the moon will peak on Tuesday morning for those eastward from Nepal across Asia, including India and Australia.</p>

<p>NASA explained that "a supermoon is when the moon is within 90 per cent of its closest approach to Earth"</p>

<p>It added that "a blue moon doesn't necessarily mean the Moon will look blue".</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The Moon looks amazing <a href="https://t.co/FHXsC6TOgY">https://t.co/FHXsC6TOgY</a></p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1825738817275383950?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>"Although it will not look blue, as the third full moon in a season with four full Moons, this will be a Blue Moon. The first recorded use of "Blue Moon" in English dates from 1528," said Gordon Johnston, retired NASA Programme Executive, in an earlier blog post on NASA.</p>

<p>In 1979 astrologer Richard Nolle coined the term "supermoon" as either a new or full Moon that occurs when the Moon is within 90 per cent of its closest approach to Earth.</p>

<p>The term "Blue Moon" has since the 1940s, also been used for the second full Moon in a month that has two full Moons.</p>

<p>2024 will witness four consecutive supermoons.</p>

<p>The supermoon occurring next, on September 17, is also known as the Harvest Moon.</p>

<p>It will also be partially eclipsed by Earth during the night as a portion of it passes into Earth's shadow.</p>

<p>The third full moon of the year is expected to shine bright on October 17. Known as Hunter's Moon, it will also be the closest full moon of the year. The last supermoon of the year will occur on November 15.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tech giant Google is under fire after pressuring tech influencers to promote the new Pixel mobile devices over rival gadgets, as per a report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/19/business/google-under-fire-for-pressing-influencers-to-prefer-pixel-smartphone/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=nypost"><em>New York Post</em></a>. If they did not agree to it, they risked being excluded from the program which gave them early access to the gadgets.</p>

<p>The creators were invited to become members of the company's "Team Pixel" program, which gives them early access to the gadgets before the general public. Notably, Google debuted a new range of Pixel smartphones earlier this month with the goal of improving their integration with AI tools.</p>

<p>According to screenshots going viral online, the influencers who opt into the program, "acknowledge that you are expected to feature the Google Pixel device in place of any competitor mobile devices?" It added, "Please note that if it appears other brands are being preferred over the Pixel, we will need to cease the relationship between the brand and the creator."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">And here ... we ....go.<br />

<p>This new clause did not sit well with the digital creators who viewed it as an effort by the company to get positive reviews under the guise of sponsored content.</p>

<p>The provision was mentioned as a "new thing" this year by analyst Max Weinbach, a former member of Team Pixel.</p>

<p>In protest, tech reviewer Adam Matlock announced that he was "formally removing myself from team pixel." "It's been a good run but the program is no longer in line with my ethics or in the best interest of my channel and the content I provide to my views," he said on X.</p>

<p>Another tech reviewer Marques Brownlee, who is not a part of Team Pixel said, "It's kind of frustrating for people just trying to do reviews. My advice is, if you are a tech reviewer, do not ever sign up for anything that makes you team one thing over the other. That just isn't a good objective move if you're trying to present an objective review."</p>

<p>A Google spokesperson said in a statement to The Verge that the program is different and does not have the same requirement of the Pixel coverage. "#TeamPixel is a distinct program, separate from our press and creator reviews programs."</p>

<p>Notably, Google and 1000heads, a PR agency, collaborated on the Team Pixel campaign. To adhere to federal disclosure regulations, participants must tag their posts with "#teampixel" or "#giftfromgoogle." "The goal of #TeamPixel is to get Pixel devices into the hands of content creators, not press and tech reviewers. We missed the mark with this new language that appeared in the #TeamPixel form yesterday, and it has been removed," they said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/willing-to-serve-elon-musk-responds-to-donald-trumps-adviser-offer-6374980" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a> today put up a cryptic gun emoji post on his social media platform X, shortly after President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/democratic-national-convention-2024-joe-biden-calls-donald-trump-loser-in-fiery-convention-speech-6375202#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">Joe Biden</a> spoke on the rising gun violence in the US.</p>

<p>"More children are killed in America by a gunshot than anywhere else," Biden said in a rousing farewell speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.</p>

<p>"That's why Kamala (Harris) and I are proud to have passed major gun legislation... Now it's time to ban assault weapons," Biden told the gathering, less than a month after dropping out of the White House race against Donald Trump and passing the torch to his vice president.</p>

<p>As Biden spoke, Musk, who officially endorsed Trump last month, dropped an emoji-filled post on X, without elaborating. The emojis were of guns and a man dancing.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="art">??????????????</p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1825743803765895540?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"The gun emoji being nerfed in 2016 marked the ascendance of woke mind virus," he said in another post.</p>

<p>In the past, he has described the “<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-claims-transgender-daughter-is-dead-killed-by-woke-mind-virus-6166594" target="_blank">woke mind virus</a>"&nbsp;as a threat to “modern civilisation".</p>

<p>In 2016, Apple first changed its gun emoji from a realistic-looking revolver into a water pistol following a succession of US shootings. Samsung, WhatsApp, and Google also switched to a water pistol emoji later.</p>

<p>Twitter, now X, had switched to a water pistol in 2018. It, however, recently replaced the "water pistol" emoji - which was depicted as a colorful child's toy - with an emoji depicting an actual gun.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<h3><strong>Gun Violence In US</strong></h3>

<p>According to the Gun Violence Archive (GVA), a website that tracks shootings across the US, more than 10,000 people have so far died this year from "wilful malicious or accidental shootings".</p>

<p>At least 19 people have so far been killed this year in 352 mass shootings in the US. In 2023, 40 people were killed in 656 mass shootings, according to the GVA.</p>

<p>More than 900 children 17 years old and younger, including 154 under the age of 11, have been killed in shootings this year, according to the GVA.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a charged and emotional farewell speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, President Joe Biden delivered a scathing critique of former President Donald Trump, labelling him a "loser" and vigorously defending his own legacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Biden, who recently announced his decision to step aside from the 2024 presidential race, received a thunderous ovation from the crowd, which chanted "We love you, Joe," in a show of solidarity.&nbsp;The 81-year-old US President, visibly moved, wiped off tears as he entered the stage and was greeted with an embrace from his deputy Kamala Harris.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Donald Trump says we are losing, but he is the loser," Mr Biden declared, drawing a contrast between his administration's achievements and what he described as the failures of the Trump presidency. "He is dead wrong. Name a country in the world that does not think we are the leading nation in the world. Who could lead the world if not us?"</p>

<h3><strong>Donald Trump Slammed&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Mr Biden did not hold back in his condemnation of Mr Trump, particularly in relation to the former president's alleged disrespect for military service members.</p>

<p>"He called soldiers who gave their lives for this country, suckers and losers. Who does he think he is?" Mr Biden asked. "Trump bows down to (Vladimir) Putin. I never have and Kamala Harris will never do it."</p>

<p>Mr Biden criticised Mr Trump's "America First" doctrine, which he said had damaged the nation's global image, contrasting his own administration's efforts to unite Europe and counter Russian aggression. He cited the expansion of NATO, with the addition of Finland and Sweden, as an example to the success of his foreign policy.</p>

<p>Sharing an anecdote, Mr Biden revealed that former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, just days before his death, had called him to express concern over Russia's resurgence under Putin, likening the current situation to the days of Napoleon. "Putin thought he could take Kyiv in three days. Three years later, Ukraine is still free," Mr Biden said.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>'Freedom'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Mr Biden also spoke at length about the challenges he faced and the progress made during his presidency. His speech was punctuated by moments of reflection on the state of American democracy and the stakes of the upcoming election. "We are in a battle for the very soul of America," Mr Biden said.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris, America's first female, Black, and South Asian vice president, has taken a lead over Mr Trump in the polls.</p>

<p>In her brief but powerful remarks, Ms Harris expressed gratitude to Mr Biden, saying, "We are forever grateful to you." She praised his leadership and commitment to the country, setting the stage for her own formal acceptance of the party's nomination later in the week. With Beyonce's "Freedom" blaring from loudspeakers during her entrance on stage, Ms Harris said, "I want to kick us off by celebrating our incredible president Joe Biden."&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>'Hate Was On The March'</strong></h3>

<p>Mr Biden, joined by his wife Jill and daughter Ashley, spoke candidly about his reasons for running in 2020, recalling the violence during the US Capitol Hill riots and a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville and Mr Trump's response that "there were very fine people on both sides."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Hate was on the march in America. Old ghosts in new garments," Mr Biden said. "There is no place in America for political violence, none. You cannot say you love your country only when you win."</p>

<p>Mr Biden also addressed the ongoing conflict in Gaza, a subject of intense debate and protest both within the United States and around the world. He spoke of the urgent need to bring hostages home and end the war in Gaza, acknowledging the suffering on both sides of the conflict. "We are working around the clock to reunite hostages with families and end the civilian suffering in Gaza," Mr Biden said.</p>

<p>He also expressed empathy for the protestors demanding an end to the violence. "Those protestors out in the streets have a point. A lot of people have been killed on both sides," Mr Biden said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An emotional Joe Biden won a huge ovation as he gave a farewell speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Monday after Kamala Harris made a surprise appearance to thank him for being an "incredible" president.</p>

<p>"I love you," the tearful 81-year-old president told the crowd to deafening cheers, less than a month after dropping out of the White House race against Donald Trump and passing the torch to his vice president.</p>

<p>Biden took to the stage to chants of "We love you Joe" from the same party which had pushed him out over concerns about his age, in one of the biggest political shocks in US political history.</p>

<p>"We both know we have more to do, but we're moving in the right direction," he said, referring to himself and the 59-year-old Harris, who, in the space of a few breathtaking weeks, has turned the presidential race upside down.</p>

<p>America's first female, Black and South Asian vice president has quickly breathed new life into the Democratic Party and wiped out Republican rival Donald Trump's lead in the polls.</p>

<p>She heaped lavish tribute to Biden at what must be one of the toughest moments of his career, even breaking with tradition to speak on the first night of the convention in praise of her boss.</p>

<p>"I want to kick us off by celebrating our incredible president Joe Biden," said Harris, who was wearing a tan suit and took to the stage to Beyonce's "Freedom."</p>

<p>"We are forever grateful to you."</p>

<p>As he has been so often in his five-decade-long political journey, Biden was surrounded by family, with wife Jill Biden and their daughter Ashley introducing him.</p>

<p>"Joe and I have been together for almost 50 years. And still, there are moments when I fall in love with him all over again," the first lady said.</p>

<h3><strong>'Something is happening'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The Democrats are in an exuberant mood in Chicago, daring to hope for victory in November that seemed inconceivable just weeks ago after Biden's disastrous debate against Trump.</p>

<p>But Monday's first night of the convention was an emotional one on many levels, and for many of the key players.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton, who lost against Trump in 2016 in her own bid to become America's first woman president, backed Harris to finally break the glass ceiling.</p>

<p>"Something is happening in America, you can feel it -- something we've worked for and dreamed of for a long time," the former secretary of state and first lady said.</p>

<p>The crowd also chanted "lock him up" as she recalled Trump's recent conviction in a porn star hush money trial -- an ironic echo of when Trump led similar chants for Clinton to be jailed in a row over deleted emails.</p>

<p>Harris will formally accept the party's nomination on the final day Thursday, in her biggest chance yet to define her candidacy in front of a huge audience of tens of millions of American voters.</p>

<p>Her star turn will cap a week where the biggest names from the party's past will endorse her as its future, with former president Barack Obama speaking on Tuesday, and ex-president Bill Clinton introducing Harris's running mate Tim Walz on Wednesday.</p>

<h3><strong>'Craziness'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>For Biden, he is suddenly the convention's warm-up act instead of its headliner, and he reportedly still feels frustration at the way he was pushed aside despite feeling that he could still beat Trump.</p>

<p>But he has insisted he is at peace with his decision.</p>

<p>"I am," Biden told reporters earlier when asked if he was ready to pass the torch to Harris.</p>

<p>Protests against Israel's war in Gaza had earlier shadowed the opening of the convention, underscoring what remains a potential vote-loser for Democrats among left-wingers and Arab Americans.</p>

<p>A group of demonstrators broke through the outer security fence of the convention after splitting off from a larger protest of thousands of people.</p>

<p>Police in blue helmets with shields and carrying black batons prevented them from getting to the inner cordon.</p>

<p>Trump, meanwhile, has been sent into a tailspin by the sudden change at the top of the Democratic ticket.</p>

<p>While Democrats are in Chicago, the Republicans will spend the week crisscrossing the country.</p>

<p>In the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Monday, he highlighted what he called Harris's "craziness" and said she "has no idea what the hell she's doing" on the economy.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After US Presidential candidate Donald Trump said that he might consider offering Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk an advisory role within his administration, the latter responded with a social media post that read, "I am willing to serve."</p>

<p>The post features Mr Musk standing in front of a podium emblazoned with the words "Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)." The acronym is a playful nod to Dogecoin, the popular cryptocurrency that originated as a meme.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I am willing to serve <a href="https://t.co/BJhGbcA2e0">pic.twitter.com/BJhGbcA2e0</a></p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1825723913051000851?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Mr Musk's post came in the wake of an offer from Mr Trump, the Republican frontrunner in the upcoming US presidential race. On Monday, Mr Trump mentioned that, if elected, he would consider appointing Musk to a cabinet position or an advisory role within his administration. Mr Trump's comments followed his critique of the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle (EV) purchases, a measure he suggested he might abolish if he returns to the White House.</p>

<p>"Tax credits and tax incentives are not generally a very good thing," Mr Trump said after a campaign event in Pennsylvania. When asked specifically about the possibility of naming Mr Musk to a particular role in his administration, Mr Trump was unequivocal: "He's a very smart guy. I certainly would, if he would do it, I certainly would. He's a brilliant guy."</p>

<p>Mr Musk, who last month publicly endorsed Trump for the presidency, has not yet commented directly on whether he would accept such an offer. However, his post on X has sparked speculation about his potential involvement in a future Trump administration.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nothing, a British smartphone startup aiming to challenge Apple's dominance in the industry, is bringing its staff back to the office full-time in pursuit of growth. CEO of Nothing Carl Pei defended in a long email the necessity for his 450 workers to report to work five days a week, refuting a workplace policy that has supported remote work from the company's founding four years ago.</p>

<p>"We've come a long way in a short space of time. We are the only company to have established a smartphone business in the last 10 years. We are the fastest-growing smartphone brand in India at 567% YoY. Yet, we are at 0.1% of our potential. With the solid start we've made, we really have the chance to create a generational tech company that can change the world. This is an incredibly exciting opportunity that we've earned together, and now it's time to double down," he said in the email to staff.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Last Friday, we made an important decision to work 5 days a week in-office in London.<br />
<br />
This is the email I sent to everyone on the <a href="https://twitter.com/nothing?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@nothing</a> team.<br />

<br />
We've come a long way in a short space of time. We are the only company to have established a smartphone business in the last…</p>
— Carl Pei (@getpeid) <a href="https://twitter.com/getpeid/status/1825451734442922202?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Mr Pei stated that although remote or hybrid work environments have proven successful for certain companies, they do not support the high standards of ambition and speed necessary for Nothing to meet its goals. He identified three primary reasons for the change- the company's goal to become a tech company that defines a generation; the necessity of close cooperation in the production of physical goods; and the significance of creativity and innovation in outperforming more established rivals.</p>

<p>"First of all, we make physical products where design, engineering, manufacturing and quality have to collaborate closely together to deliver products to our users. This does not work well remotely," he said.</p>

<p>The CEO added, "We are not looking to create a good business that gets acquired by a big company, we are looking to realize our full potential of becoming a generation-defining company. And we're really serious about moving fast. Remote work is not compatible with a high ambition level plus high speed."</p>

<p>Mr Pei's email also mentioned that the new mandate will go into effect in two months and that he plans to host a town hall in London to address any concerns raised by staff members.</p>

<p>The CEO also advised staff members who were unable to work five days a week to find alternative jobs. "We know it's not the right type of setup for everybody, and that's okay. We should look for a mutual fit. You should find an environment where you thrive, and we need to find people who want to go the full mile with us in the decades ahead," he concluded.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President and Democratic nominee Kamal Harris has thanked US President Joe Biden for his "lifetime of service" to the nation. Addressing the opening of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, the Indian-origin leader said the country was "forever grateful" to the 81-year-old for his leadership.</p>

<p>"I want to kick us off by celebrating our incredible president, Joe Biden. Joe, thank you for your historic leadership, for your lifetime of service to our nation. We are forever grateful to you," she said in a surprise speech on the first day of the party's convention.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Usually, the presidential nominees deliver their remarks on the final day of the convention. But Harris broke tradition and was greeted by loud cheers from the crowd.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old leader is expected to officially accept her nomination for the November US elections at the convention.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"People from every corner of our country and every walk of life are here and this November we will come together and declare with one voice that we are moving forward. Let us always remember -- when we fight, we win," she said.</p>

<p>At the end of the four-day convention, which concludes on August 22, Harris and her running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walz will be nominated as the Democratic candidates for US' president and vice president.</p>

<p>Biden is expected to deliver a 'swan song' address and endorse his deputy against Donald Trump, the former US President.</p>

<p>Former US presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton are also expected to speak. The Democrats will also honour Hilary Clinton, their official candidate who lost to Donald Trump in the 2016 US Presidential Elections.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mpox cases and deaths are rising in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) as the central African country awaits vaccines from the United States and Japan, the health minister said on Monday.</p>

<p>The count this year has risen in a few days from 16,000 cases and 548 deaths to 16,700 cases and "a little more than 570" deaths, Health Minister Samuel-Roger Kamba said.</p>

<p>"We are talking about a continental emergency," Kamba told a press briefing as the World Health Organisation (WHO) called on affected countries to step up vaccination programmes to counter a more deadly strain of mpox.</p>

<p>The WHO on Wednesday declared the mpox surge in Africa a global public health emergency. Outbreaks have been reported in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda since July. A case of the new strain has also been detected in Sweden.</p>

<p>The United States has promised 50,000 vaccine doses for DRC, while Japan on Monday agreed Monday to send 3.5 million doses, "only for children," a medical source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told AFP.</p>

<p>The source said that DRC "plans to vaccinate four million people including 3.5 million children".</p>

<p>"I hope by the next week we will already be able to see the vaccines arriving," Kamba said.</p>

<p>"The vaccine is a solution to our problems," he added, urging people to get jabbed.</p>

<p>"Our strategic vaccination plan is ready. We are just waiting for the vaccines to arrive."</p>

<h3><strong>WHO calls for vaccines&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Cases have now surfaced in all 26 provinces in the country of around 100 million people.</p>

<p>The WHO has declared the outbreak "a public health emergency of international concern" -- its highest alert category.</p>

<p>On Monday it released updated guidelines on countering the surge, including by "the agile adaptation of immunization strategies and plans to concerned areas".</p>

<p>It called on countries to "scale up efforts to thoroughly investigate cases and outbreaks of mpox disease" to understand its transmission and prevent the spread "to household members and communities".</p>

<p>Health authorities must report new cases on a weekly basis and "identify, monitor and support the contacts of people with mpox to prevent onward transmission," it said.</p>

<p>It added that countries had to be ready to provide food and other support for mpox patients "including, as warranted and possible, isolation in care centres and guidance for home-based care".</p>

<p>The WHO said there has to be greater "cross-border collaboration" to monitor and handle suspected mpox cases "without resorting to general travel and trade restrictions unnecessarily impacting local, regional or national economies".</p>

<p>While mpox has been known for decades, a new more deadly and more transmissible strain -- clade 1b -- causes death in about 3.6 per cent of cases, with children more at risk, according to the WHO.</p>

<p>Kamba said that mpox is reaching "more and more young people" in DRC and there are a lot of children under 15 who have been affected.</p>

<p>A total of 18,737 suspected or confirmed cases of mpox were reported in Africa since the beginning of the year, including 1,200 cases in one week, the African Union health agency said Saturday.</p>

<p>Formerly called monkeypox, the virus was discovered in 1958 in Denmark, in monkeys kept for research.</p>

<p>It was first discovered in humans in 1970 in what is now the DRC.</p>

<p>Mpox is caused by a virus transmitted to humans by infected animals but can also be passed from human to human through close physical contact.</p>

<p>The disease causes fever, muscular aches and large boil-like skin lesions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Disgraced former Republican lawmaker George Santos, who was expelled from the US Congress for using stolen donor cash to bankroll a lavish lifestyle, pleaded guilty on Monday to wire fraud and identity theft.</p>

<p>Judge Joanna Seybert ordered Santos to pay more than $370,000 in restitution during a court hearing in Central Islip and set sentencing for February 7.</p>

<p>Santos, 36, faces at least two years in prison and a maximum of 22 years.</p>

<p>"After years of telling lies, George Santos stood in the courthouse right behind me and finally, under oath, told the truth," Breon Peace, US attorney for the Eastern District of New York, told reporters.</p>

<p>"And that truth is that he is a criminal," Peace said. "He lied, he stole and he conned people."</p>

<p>An emotional Santos, speaking to reporters after entering his guilty plea, apologized to his former constituents and said he had allowed "ambition to cloud my judgment," leading him to make "decisions that were unethical."</p>

<p>"This plea is not just an admission of guilt but an acknowledgement that I need to be held accountable like any other American that breaks the law," he said through tears.</p>

<p>The downfall of the congressman from Long Island came after it was revealed he had fabricated almost his entire backstory including his education, religion and work history.</p>

<p>Santos was elected to the US House of Representatives in 2022 and indicted the following year for stealing from campaign donors and engaging in credit card fraud, money laundering and identity theft.</p>

<p>Santos used donor money for Botox treatments and the OnlyFans porn website, as well as luxury Italian goods and vacations to the Hamptons and Las Vegas, according to an investigation by a congressional ethics committee.</p>

<p>He had been scheduled to go on trial on September 9 on some two dozen charges but opted instead to enter a guilty plea to wire fraud and identity theft.</p>

<p>Santos's bizarre biographical fabrications included claiming to have worked for Goldman Sachs, being Jewish and having been a college volleyball star.</p>

<p>He was ultimately doomed by the congressional probe that found overwhelming evidence of misconduct and accused him of seeking to "fraudulently exploit every aspect of his House candidacy."</p>

<p>Santos was expelled from the House last year, becoming only the third person to be ejected as a US lawmaker since the Civil War, a rebuke previously reserved for traitors and convicted criminals.</p>

<p>In February, voters in his suburban New York district picked Democrat Tom Suozzi to replace him.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge on Monday denied a bid by U.S. President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, to dismiss a federal tax evasion case brought against him in California.</p>

<p>Hunter Biden was convicted in Delaware in June for lying about his illegal drug use to buy a gun, and is scheduled to go to trial in September in the tax evasion case.</p>

<p>Biden, who has pleaded not guilty to the tax charges, had argued that David Weiss, the special counsel leading both prosecutions, was illegally appointed.</p>

<p>The president's son had relied on a federal judge's decision dismissing a criminal case accusing former President Donald Trump of illegally retaining classified documents after leaving office.</p>

<p>Florida-based U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon found the appointment of the special counsel in that case, Jack Smith, violated the U.S. Constitution because Congress had not given him the authority to pursue the case. Smith's office is appealing.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Monday that if elected he would consider ending a $7,500 tax credit for electric-vehicle purchases and that he would be open to naming Tesla CEO Elon Musk to a cabinet or advisory role.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Monday that if elected he would consider ending a $7,500 tax credit for electric-vehicle purchases and that he would be open to naming Tesla CEO Elon Musk to a cabinet or advisory role.</p>

<p>"Tax credits and tax incentives are not generally a very good thing," Trump told Reuters in an interview after a campaign event in York, Pennsylvania, when asked about the EV credit.</p>

<p>Asked if he would consider naming Musk to an advisory role or cabinet job, Trump said he would. "He's a very smart guy. I certainly would, if he would do it, I certainly would. He's a brilliant guy," Trump said.</p>

<p>Musk last month publicly endorsed Trump in the U.S. presidential race. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>If elected, Trump could take steps to reverse Treasury Department rules that have made it easier for automakers to take advantage of the $7,500 credit or could ask the U.S. Congress to repeal it entirely. While president, Trump sought to repeal the EV tax credit which was later expanded by President Joe Biden in 2022.</p>

<p>"I'm not making any final decisions on it," Trump said of the EV tax credit. "I'm a big fan of electric cars, but I'm a fan of gasoline-propelled cars, and also hybrids and whatever else happens to come along."</p>

<p>He added that he would rescind the Biden administration rules that will prod automakers to build more EVs and plug-in hybrids to meet stricter emissions standards and said he sees a "much smaller market" for EVs because of cost and battery range issues.</p>

<p>Trump also said on Monday he would take steps to discourage exports of vehicles produced by the Detroit Three automakers and others from Mexico for U.S consumers by imposing new tariffs and would prevent Chinese automakers from building new plants in Mexico for U.S. market vehicles. He made similar threats during his presidency.</p>

<p>"If you put tariffs on those cars, they're going to make it here" Trump said. "It's very simple. It's not complicated. If you tell Mexico, 'look, you're stealing our car industry,' which they're doing now."</p>

<p>But Trump is open to Chinese and other automakers building vehicles in the United States. "We're going to give incentives, and if China and other countries want to come here and sell the cars, they're going to build plants here, and they're going to hire our workers," Trump said. "We will make our own cars. I want to make our own cars."</p>

<p>Separately, Trump harshly criticized Alphabet's Google but declined to say if he thought the technology company should be broken up after a judge ruled this month that Google was an illegal monopoly.</p>

<p>"They're almost like the Wild West," Trump said of Google, without elaborating on what penalty it should face. "They're going to have to pay a great price."</p>

<p>Trump has previously said he would prevent short video app TikTok from being banned despite a law approved in April that sets a deadline of Jan. 19, 2025, for Chinese owner ByteDance to divest TikTok's U.S. assets. Asked if he could accept continued Chinese ownership of TikTok, Trump did not directly answer but said ByteDance might sell.</p>

<p>"It's very hard to ban something like that, because you're talking about free speech," Trump said. "You're talking about a lot of different things go into that equation, but TikTok has treated me very well."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US intelligence officials said on Monday that they considered Iran to be responsible for a recent hack of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, according to a statement, adding that it was part of ongoing cyber attacks by Tehran.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran was behind a recent hack targeting Donald Trump's presidential campaign, US security agencies said on Monday, accusing Tehran of seeking to influence the 2024 election.</p>

<p>The statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) confirmed the Trump campaign claim from earlier this month that it had been targeted, potentially by Iran.</p>

<p>"We have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting presidential campaigns," the security agencies said.</p>

<p>"This includes the recently reported activities to compromise former President Trump's campaign, which the (intelligence community) attributes to Iran," they said.</p>

<p>The intelligence community "is confident that the Iranians have through social engineering and other efforts sought access to individuals with direct access to the presidential campaigns of both political parties. Such activity, including thefts and disclosures, are intended to influence the US election process."</p>

<p>Trump's campaign said on August 10 that it had been hacked, blaming "foreign sources" for distributing internal communications and a dossier on running mate J.D. Vance.</p>

<p>"These documents were obtained illegally from foreign sources hostile to the United States, intended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our Democratic process," Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign implied Iran was behind the move as news outlet Politico reported it had received emails with the campaign material from a source who refused to identify themselves.</p>

<p>Cheung cited a report from Microsoft this week that said Iranian hackers "sent a spear phishing email in June to a high-ranking official on a presidential campaign."</p>

<p>The materials received by Politico included research on vetting Vance, Trump's vice presidential pick.</p>

<p>In 2016, a hack of Democratic National Committee emails -- blamed on Russians -- exposed internal party communications, including about candidate Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>Trump, who would go on to win the election, was criticized for encouraging the hack.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's jailed former prime minister Imran Khan has applied to become the next chancellor of Britain's prestigious University of Oxford, his party said.</p>

<p>Khan, prime minister from 2018 to 2022, has just marked one year in prison on various charges from corruption to inciting violence that he said are politically motivated and designed to keep him from power.</p>

<p>"Imran Khan had given instructions that he would like to submit his application and now the application scrutiny will take place," Sayed Zulfikar Bukhari, the London-based spokesman for Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, told AFP.</p>

<p>"It's a ceremonial post but one with utmost prestige and importance and Imran Khan, being one of the larger or more popular names coming out of Oxford, it would be brilliant to see him as chancellor," he said.</p>

<p>Conservative peer Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, announced in February he was stepping down as Oxford chancellor.</p>

<p>The list of candidates for the 10-year term will not be made public until October, according to the university's website, with voting taking place at the end of the month.</p>

<p>Khan graduated from Oxford in 1975 after studying philosophy, politics, and economics.</p>

<p>He led a playboy lifestyle during his career as one of Pakistan's greatest cricket players, regularly gracing the pages of Britain's gossip magazines.</p>

<p>Married three times, including to British socialite and filmmaker Jemima Goldsmith, he later turned to philanthropy and politics.</p>

<p>He faced a backlash from women's rights groups while prime minister for linking Pakistan's high rates of sexual violence to the clothes that women wear.</p>

<p>Khan was ousted in 2022 and then launched a comeback campaign in which he criticised Pakistan's powerful military, whose leading generals had once backed him, and drew massive crowds onto the nation's streets.</p>

<p>"If he does become the chancellor, he would be the first of Asian descent. It wouldn't be something only for Pakistan, but it would be a great achievement for all of Asia and the rest of the world," Bukhari said.</p>

<p>Other prominent applicants and Oxford alumni include former foreign secretary William Hague and former EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson, according to British media reports.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The 2024 Democratic National Convention will officially declare US Vice President Kamala Harris as its official nomination for the Presidential election today, replacing incumbent Joe Biden, who withdrew from the race last month.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>The four-day event, which will end on August 22, will officially nominate Kamala Harris's Vice President pick, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, in the presidential elections.</li>
	<li>Former US Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton are expected to speak at the National Convention and bid adieu to Joe Biden. The Democrats will also honour Hilary Clinton, their official candidate who lost to Donald Trump in the 2016 US Presidential Elections.</li>
	<li>Last month, Mr Biden dropped out of the Presidential race just 100 days before the election, an unprecedented move in modern US political history. Concerns over the 81-year-old's health surrounded the Presidential campaigns, with rival Republicans targeting the Democrats over the issue. The concerns were aggravated after Biden's presidential debate with Trump in June.</li>
	<li>To designate a formal nominee, delegates chosen from 50 US states, the US capital and overseas territories attend their party's nominating convention to officially anoint the candidate. Biden backed Kamala Harris as the candidate which was later endorsed by several leaders including former US President Barack Obama.</li>
	<li>Joe Biden will give a prime-time address and make a case for his incumbent deputy, Kamala Harris, who is up against Donald Trump, the former US President, with multiple court cases and survivor of an assassination attempt.</li>
	<li>In the Primary Election, a poll where parties select their candidates for the general election, Joe Biden won overwhelmingly with 87.1 per cent votes. The 26th Democratic National Convention will serve as a farewell for Mr Biden as he hangs up his boots. In 1968, President Lyndon B Johnson declared in the middle of the Vietnam War that he would not run for re-election.</li>
	<li>Kamala Harris, the first Black and South Asian US Vice President, is expected to share the stage with Mr Biden. Kamala Harris, who considers herself an "underdog" in the race against Trump, earlier said, "A lot of work has to be done to earn the vote of the American people,"</li>
	<li>Security has been increased near the convention centre in Chicago after an array of possible threats, including tens of thousands of protesters opposing Biden's support for Israel's actions in Gaza. They are expected to march through the city outside the security perimeter.</li>
	<li>The Secret Service, FBI and the local police reportedly spent a year formulating a security plan and cordoning off areas near the United Center Arena where the convention will take place. Musicians and Hollywood celebrities are expected to attend the event.</li>
	<li>Last week, Biden and Harris had put up a show of unity in Maryland when they made their first joint trip since the change of the Democratic Party's plans for the Presidential Elections.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States on Monday announced its approval of a $3.5-billion sale to South Korea of up to 36 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters and related equipment, including missiles.</p>

<p>"The proposed sale will improve the Republic of Korea's capability to meet current and future threats by providing a credible force capable of deterring adversaries and participating in regional operations," the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) said in a statement.</p>

<p>The sale will improve "the security of a major ally that is a force for political stability and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific region," the statement said, using the US foreign policy term for the Asia Pacific region.</p>

<p>The State Department approved the possible sale of the helicopters to South Korea, and the DSCA on Monday provided the required notification to Congress, which still needs to sign off on the transaction.</p>

<p>The principal contractors for the deal will be Boeing and Lockheed Martin, the DSCA said.</p>

<p>The announcement came on the same day that Washington and Seoul began major annual joint military drills, with new exercises aimed at containing the nuclear-armed North.</p>

<p>The Ulchi Freedom Shield exercise runs until August 29 and will involve thousands of military personnel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

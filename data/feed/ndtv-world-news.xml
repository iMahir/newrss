       <description><![CDATA[The year 2024 is set to be the warmest on record and the first with an average temperature above 1.5 degrees Celsius, European climate agency Copernicus said on Monday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The year 2024 is set to be the warmest on record and the first with an average temperature above 1.5 degrees Celsius, European climate agency Copernicus said on Monday.</p>

<p>Also, November 2024 became the second-warmest (after November 2023) with an average surface air temperature of 14.10 degrees Celsius -- 0.73 degrees Celsius above the 1991–2020 average for the month.</p>

<p>The month marked another milestone in global warming, recording a temperature 1.62 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</p>

<p>It also became the 16th month in the past 17 months where global temperatures exceeded the critical 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold above pre-industrial levels, the agency said.</p>

<p>According to the India Meteorological Department, India experienced the second warmest November since 1901, with the average maximum temperature clocking 29.37 degrees Celsius -- 0.62 degree above normal.</p>

<p>For the year so far (January to November), the global average temperature anomaly stands at 0.72 degrees Celsius above the 1991-2020 average, making it the highest on record for this period and 0.14 degrees Celsius warmer than the corresponding period in 2023.</p>

<p>The European climate agency said it is almost certain that 2024 will be the warmest year on record, with the annual temperature exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. 2023, the hottest year on record so far, was 1.48 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</p>

<p>Average sea surface temperatures (SSTs) for November 2024 were also the second-highest on record for the month, at 20.58 degrees Celsius, just 0.13 degrees Celsius below the November 2023 record.</p>

<p>While the equatorial eastern and central Pacific moved towards neutral or La Nina conditions, sea surface temperatures remained unusually high across many ocean regions, Copernicus said.</p>

<p>Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), said: "With Copernicus data in from the penultimate month of the year, we can now confirm with virtual certainty that 2024 will be the warmest year on record and the first calendar year above 1.5 degrees Celsius. This does not mean the Paris Agreement has been breached, but it underscores the urgent need for ambitious climate action.” The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, aims to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. A permanent breach of the 1.5-degree Celsius limit refers to long-term warming over a 20 or 30-year period. Earth's global surface temperature has already increased by around 1.3 degrees Celsius compared to the average in 1850-1900 due to the rapidly increasing concentration of greenhouse gases -- primarily carbon dioxide and methane -- in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>This warming is considered the reason behind record droughts, wildfires and floods worldwide.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[South Korea's opposition on Monday accused the ruling party of staging a "second coup" by clinging to power and refusing to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over his declaration of martial law.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea's opposition on Monday accused the ruling party of staging a "second coup" by clinging to power and refusing to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over his declaration of martial law.</p>

<p>Yoon plunged the country into political chaos with his attempt to scrap civilian rule, which lasted just six hours after lawmakers scuffled with soldiers in the parliament building and managed to vote the measure down, forcing Yoon into an embarrassing U-turn.</p>

<p>The president and a slew of top officials are now being investigated for insurrection, but a bid to impeach Yoon failed Saturday after a boycott by the ruling party, who claim the wildly unpopular leader has agreed to hand power to the prime minister and party chief.</p>

<p>"This is an unlawful, unconstitutional act of a second insurrection and a second coup," Democratic Party floor leader Park Chan-dae said, urging the ruling party to "stop it immediately".</p>

<p>Under South Korea's constitution, the president remains head of government and commander in chief of the army unless he or she is incapacitated, resigns or steps down.</p>

<p>In such a case, power would be handed to the prime minister on an interim basis, until elections could be held.</p>

<p>Claiming that Yoon can remain in office but has delegated his powers to the prime minister and leader of his ruling People Power Party -- who is not an elected official -- is "a blatant constitutional violation with no legal basis," Park said.</p>

<p>"Their attitude of placing themselves above the Constitution mirrors that of insurrectionist Yoon Suk Yeol," he added.</p>

<p>Investigators have already detained the former defence minister, raided his offices, slapped a host of top officials with travel bans, and on Monday called in the general who was made martial law commander for further questioning.</p>

<p>Yoon himself could be called in for questioning, police said Monday, adding that they are "considering" whether to ban him from traveling, as their investigation gathered speed.</p>

<p>"There are no human or physical restrictions to the subject of an investigation," said Woo Jong-soo, head of the National Investigation Headquarters of the National Police Agency.</p>

<p>Police will investigate "in accordance with the law and principles -- without any exceptions".</p>

<h3><strong>Power vacuum?</strong></h3>

<p>The defence ministry confirmed Monday that the embattled Yoon remained at the head of the country's security apparatus, despite the apparent power vacuum in the country -- which remains technically at war with the nuclear-armed North.</p>

<p>"Legally, (control of military forces) currently lies with the commander in chief," defense ministry spokesperson Jeon Ha-kyou said.</p>

<p>Yoon, 63, has apologised for "anxiety and inconvenience" caused by his declaration of martial law but has not stepped down, saying instead he would entrust decisions about his fate to his party -- and accept all political and legal responsibility for the martial law fiasco.</p>

<p>There is no constitutional basis supporting the ruling party's claim that Yoon can stay in office but hand over his power to unelected party officials, said Kim Hae-won, a constitutional law professor at Pusan National University Law School.</p>

<p>"It seems to resemble an unconstitutional soft coup," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"If there are issues with the President, there are ways laid out in the Constitution such as suspending the president from his duties, and then move on to proceedings set out in the Constitution, such as impeachment," he said.</p>

<p>The opposition has already said they will try again to impeach the president, with leader Lee Jae-myung saying another vote would be held on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Huge crowds are expected to gather again outside the National Assembly building.</p>

<p>Yoon's approval rating hit 11 percent, a historic low for the unpopular president, according to a new Gallup poll commissioned by local media.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Nobel committee spoke for the first time with Narges Mohammadi, the 2023 peace prize winner who is on temporary medical leave from Iranian prison, footage published late Sunday by the organisation showed.</p>

<p>Mohammadi recalled how the women's ward at Evin prison "erupted with chants" of the protest slogan "Woman Life Freedom" when they heard she had been awarded the prize, according to clips of the video call published on social media by Nobel.</p>

<p>"One of my fellow prisoners managed to call her husband who was also in prison in the men's ward. Through them we learned the incredible news: I had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize," Mohammadi told the committee, wearing a green top with her hair uncovered.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A case was lodged on Sunday over a clash between police and followers of Hindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das on the court premises in Chittagong, according to a media report.</p>

<p>The Dhaka Tribune newspaper said the case names the Hindu leader, arrested on a charge of sedition, as the prime accused, along with 164 identified individuals and 400 to 500 unidentified people.</p>

<p>The complaint was filed by Enamul Haque, a businessman and activist of Hefazat-e-Islam Bangladesh, in the court of Chittagong Metropolitan Magistrate Md Abu Bakar Siddique.</p>

<p>Haque in his complaint alleged that he was attacked by followers of Chinmoy Krishna Das while returning home after completing land registry work at the court on November 26.</p>

<p>The businessman claimed that he was targeted for wearing a ‘panjabi', a kurta, and a cap, which resulted in injuries to his right hand and head.</p>

<p>He was rescued by bystanders and admitted to Chittagong Medical College Hospital, the newspaper said. Haque also said that his delay in filing the case was due to his prolonged illness from the attack.</p>

<p>"Haque was assaulted on November 26 on the court premises by followers of Chinmoy Krishna. His right hand was fractured, and he sustained head injuries. The case names 164 individuals, with Chinmoy Krishna as the principal accused," his lawyer is quoted as saying.</p>

<p>The incident follows several clashes linked to the imprisonment of Chinmoy Krishna, spokesperson of the Bangladesh Sommilito Sanatani Jagaran Jote.</p>

<p>Previously on November 27, police filed three related cases at Kotwali police station, naming numerous individuals and hundreds of unidentified persons for obstruction and attacks on law enforcement.</p>

<p>Separately, another case was filed by a businessman on Tuesday, alleging assault by a group near Rangam Cinema Hall on November 26.</p>

<p>The complaint named 29 individuals, including members of political organisations and ISKCON (International Society for Krishna Consciousness), alongside 40 to 50 unidentified persons, the report said.</p>

<p>The relations between India and Bangladesh came under strain after the interim government headed by Muhammad Yunus came to power after deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country on August 5 following a student-led protest.</p>

<p>The relations deteriorated further in recent weeks over continued attacks on Hindus and especially after the arrest of the Hindu monk, a former member of ISKCON Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Das' arrest in a sedition case on November 25 from Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport had triggered demonstrations by supporters of the monk.</p>

<p>An assistant government prosecutor, Saiful Islam Alif, was killed during a protest in Chattogram after the monk was denied bail on November 26.</p>

<p>On December 3, a Bangladesh court deferred to January 2 hearing on the bail petition of Chinmoy Krishna on a government plea as no lawyer appeared on his behalf.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">US President Joe Biden today said Washington is "clear eyed" that the Islamic State extremist group, often known as ISIS, "will try to take advantage of any vacuum to reestablish" itself in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/after-bashar-al-assads-downfall-nations-urge-peace-stability-in-syria-7204379" target="_blank">Syria</a>, adding "they will not let that happen".</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Speaking from the White House, he said his forces conducted strikes against ISIS inside Syria on Sunday with the US military confirming that its warplanes hit Islamic State operatives and camps.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Strikes were carried out against "over 75 targets using multiple US Air Force assets, including B-52s, F-15s, and A-10s" in central Syria, the US Central Command said in an official statement.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The US maintains a force of around 900 troops in southeast Syria to fight the Islamic State fighters.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Biden also said the fall of the Assam regime was a "fundamental act of justice." "It's a moment of historic opportunity for the long-suffering people of Syria," he said.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Bashar Al-Assad fled to Moscow, the looters started raiding the presidential palace and people took the streets of Damascus to celebrate his demise. The Syrian president had tried to hang on until the bitter end, still&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-07/syria-s-besieged-assad-makes-overtures-to-us-in-bid-to-survive" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">desperately sending an SOS</a>&nbsp;to anyone who would listen, including Donald Trump. The despot had run out of road.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The world is still grasping the speed of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-08/syrian-tv-says-assad-s-government-has-fallen-after-rebel-advance" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">events in recent days</a>, and the collapse of a ruling dynasty that laid waste to the country during a catastrophic civil war. But the implications are also quickly sinking in — and not least the prospect of more upheaval and violence as groups tussle for control.</p>

<p>Assad had&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-08/where-is-assad-syria-s-leader-flees-damascus-ending-brutal-dynasty" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">managed to endure</a>&nbsp;the popular uprising against him for more than 13 years. But the message from his one-time allies and foes was clear: You're on your own. Russia, which had saved his skin back in 2015, only offered him sanctuary this time. Iran turned its back on him by saying in not so many words that he had brought it all on himself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Multiple Arab and US officials told Bloomberg that a power vacuum could now be dangerous. Memories of Muammar Qaddafi's Libya and Saddam Hussein in Iraq loom large in the region: In both countries, those entrenched rulers were swept aside in brief moments of euphoria, only for the countries to descend into deeper turmoil.</p>

<p>“Chaos is expected in transitions and so is factional — even bloody — competition,” said Bader Al-Saif, an assistant professor at Kuwait University and an associate fellow at Chatham House. “Syria has not been its normal self for over a decade now, divided into enclaves and spheres of influence on top of socioeconomic and political decay.”</p>

<p id="vjs_video_3_component_406_description">The onset of Syria's conflict in 2011 displaced millions of people, sparking a migrant crisis that still reverberates in European politics today. Its Middle East neighbors, meanwhile, are already grappling with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-07/israelis-trickle-back-to-damaged-homes-wary-of-lebanon-truce" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">fallout from Israel's war</a>&nbsp;against Hamas in Gaza and fighting with Hezbollah in Lebanon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Russia has military bases in Syria and will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-08/syria-s-assad-family-granted-asylum-in-russia-tass-reports" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">seek to protect its interests</a>. But the Kremlin is occupied by its war in Ukraine. Iran, which has traded direct attacks with Israel in recent months, is also weakened. Arab officials, though, don't expect the Islamic Republic to give up its influence in Syria without a fight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pace of the events that unseated Assad after more than 50 years of his family in power was stunning. A little over a week ago, his survival seemed almost a foregone conclusion. Then insurgents led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham captured the crucial cities of Aleppo and Hama, before closing in on Homs and Damascus, the capital.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, rebels seized control of the television station and hailed the “fall of the criminal Assad regime.” Assad decided to step down and left the country, Russia's foreign ministry later said.</p>

<p>The rebel advance unwound a stalemate in Syria, which had seen Assad's forces backed by Moscow and Tehran claw back control of most of the country, with the exception of a rebel stronghold in the northwest and a Kurdish stronghold in the northeast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It unleashed a political situation in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-08/biden-sees-moment-of-opportunity-and-risk-on-assad-s-ouster" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">which much remains uncertain</a>&nbsp;– not least the nature of the new government forming in Damascus. It's also unclear whether that leadership will be able to govern the war-torn country at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The mood reflected those concerns on Sunday night as a curfew was imposed and several buildings housing security agencies and the passport and immigration authority were consumed by flames, with locals speculating about Israeli strikes.</p>

<p>“The fear today is that all the factions are united against one enemy but they will eventually be consumed by infighting,” said Bahjat Hajjar, co-founder of an NGO called Madaniya who fled Damascus shortly after 2011 due to his opposition to the Assads.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking at a conference in Bahrain on Sunday Anwar Gargash, adviser to United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed, warned of threats to Syria's territorial integrity, an ongoing “spiral of chaos and violence” in the Arab world, and the prospect of “extremism and terrorism.” Saudi Arabia, which is involved in efforts to shape the transition period in Syria, issued a statement on Sunday warning against “chaos and division.”</p>

<p>US President-elect Trump, meanwhile, made one thing clear: America won't intervene to stop that from happening. In a&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1865434273953509462" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">post</a>&nbsp;on social media platform X on Saturday, Trump wrote, “Syria is a mess, but is not our friend.”</p>

<p>The US designates the rebel group HTS, which formed an alliance with al-Qaeda more than a decade ago, a terrorist organization. HTS has since sought to project itself as a force for unity, but many US and Middle Eastern officials are doubtful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The guys who are taking over are terrorists, but they're sending some interesting messaging,” said Jason Greenblatt, a former Middle East envoy in Trump's first administration. “If they realize Trump means business and is not going to tolerate that and is hopefully going to galvanize the region to fight against terrorism, they ought to figure out a way to comply.”</p>

<p>Still, the risks and opportunities presented by an unstable Syria have drawn in myriad foreign powers since 2011 and look likely to continue to do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More than a decade of conflict has left between 300,000 to 500,000 people dead, decimated cities and pushed much of its population into poverty. The World Bank has estimated that Syria's economy shrank by more than a half by 2020 from its prewar level of around $60 billion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to UNDP data, employment rose to nearly 50% as of 2020 and Syria's human development index rolled back 35 years because of faltering education and health services. There were reports of looting following the declaration that Assad's government had fallen.</p>

<p>Turkey is likely to seek to capitalize on opportunities created by Assad's fall after 24 years to repatriate the millions of Syrian refugees living in Turkey. To that end, Ankara has urged a peaceful transition of power.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We've been working for the stability of Syria for a long time — we are familiar with the actors,” Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan told media at a forum in Doha on Sunday. “We have to work together with Syrian people, not only Turkey but also regional actors, the international actors, to make sure that there is a good and smooth transition period.”</p>

<p>In another development, Israeli ground forces overtly crossed into Syrian territory for the first time since the 1973 October War, the New York Times reported, citing two Israeli officials.</p>

<p>That's as Iran finds itself on the defensive. The same goes for Russia, which is now needed to preserve some stability without Assad, according to Elena Suponina, a Moscow-based Middle East expert.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Syrian euphoria could help engender the kind of unity we need to see,” said Charles Lister, senior fellow and director of the Syria Program at the Middle East Institute. “But after 14 years of ferocious conflict and division, the hill ahead is steep.”&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>World powers vowed Sunday to work for stability in Syria and the surrounding region after Islamist-led rebels toppled its longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad.</p>

<p>Here is a round-up of key reactions:</p>

<h3><strong>High alert: Russia</strong></h3>

<p>Assad's ally Moscow said Russian troops in Syria were on high alert but that the rebels had "guaranteed" the security of its army bases in the country.</p>

<p>Prior to reports that Assad had fled to Moscow, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Saturday that Syria must not be allowed to fall into the hands of a "terrorist group".</p>

<h3><strong>'Assad should be held accountable': US</strong></h3>

<p>"We will engage with all Syrian groups... to establish a transition away from the Assad regime toward independent, sovereign" Syria, US President Joe Biden said.</p>

<p>Asked by reporters what should happen to the deposed president, who reportedly has fled to Moscow, Biden said that "Assad should be held accountable."</p>

<h3><strong>'Return to stability': China</strong></h3>

<p>Beijing "is closely following the development of the situation in Syria and hopes that Syria returns to stability as soon as possible", the foreign ministry said.</p>

<h3><strong>'Friendly relations': Iran</strong></h3>

<p>Iran's foreign ministry said it expects "friendly" relations with Syria to continue.</p>

<p>It said it would adopt "appropriate approaches" towards Syria in accordance with the behaviour of "effective actors" in Damascus.</p>

<h3><strong>'Heal wounds': Turkey</strong></h3>

<p>Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said his country, which has supported rebel movements in Syria, would help "to heal Syria's wounds and guarantee its unity, integrity and security".</p>

<h3><strong>'Cautious hope': UN</strong></h3>

<p>The UN envoy for Syria called the rebel takeover "a watershed moment" for the country marred by nearly 14 years of civil war.</p>

<p>"Today we look forward with cautious hope to the opening of a new (chapter) -- one of peace, reconciliation, dignity and inclusion for all Syrians," special envoy Geir Pedersen said.</p>

<h3><strong>End to 'barbaric' state: France</strong></h3>

<p>French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed the fall of Bashar al-Assad's "barbaric state" in Syria.</p>

<p>"I pay tribute to the Syrian people, to their courage, to their patience. In this moment of uncertainty, I send them my wishes for peace, freedom, and unity," he wrote on X.</p>

<h3><strong>'Contribute': Germany</strong></h3>

<p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who welcomed the fall of Assad as "good news", said Germany was ready to "bring its contribution" to a political solution to bring peace back to the war-stricken country, without specifying further.</p>

<p>"Bashar Al-Assad has oppressed his own people in a brutal manner, he has countless lives on his conscience," said the German head of state.</p>

<h3><strong>'Work together': UAE</strong></h3>

<p>A senior United Arab Emirates official urged Syrians to collaborate in order to avert a spiral into chaos.</p>

<p>"We hope that the Syrians will work together, that we don't just see another episode of impending chaos," presidential adviser Anwar Gargash said at the Manama Dialogue in Bahrain.</p>

<h3><strong>'Peace and stability': UK</strong></h3>

<p>Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer called for a peaceful and stable Syria, urging the protection of civilians and minorities.</p>

<p>Arriving in the United Arab Emirates on Sunday, the premier said he was "talking to regional allies", calling the removal of Assad a "real opportunity".</p>

<h3><strong>'Long-awaited': EU</strong></h3>

<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen likewise said the EU would help to rebuild "a Syrian state that protects all minorities".</p>

<p>The EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas hailed Assad's fall as "a positive and long-awaited development" which "also shows the weakness of Assad's backers, Russia and Iran".</p>

<h3><strong>Blow to Iran: Israel</strong></h3>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed Assad's overthrow as the fall of a "central link in Iran's axis of evil".</p>

<p>He called it "a direct result of the blows we have inflicted on Iran and Hezbollah", the group that Israel has been bombarding in Lebanon.</p>

<h3><strong>Don't rely on Putin: Ukraine</strong></h3>

<p>Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga welcomed Assad's departure, saying that authoritarians who rely on support from Putin are destined to fall, while stressing Kyiv's support for Syria's people.</p>

<h3><strong>'Relief': Netherlands</strong></h3>

<p>Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof called Assad's overthrow "a relief to all those who suffered under his cruel dictatorship".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Schoof urged a "peaceful transition and the restoration of stability, while ensuring respect for all the country's minorities".&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Independent Islamic government: Taliban</strong></h3>

<p>Afghanistan's Taliban government congratulated the Syrian people and rebels, hoping a transition would lead to "an independent and service-oriented Islamic government" and a Syria "free from external interference".</p>

<h3><strong>'Free will': Iraq</strong></h3>

<p>Iraq urged respect for the "free will of all Syrians and emphasises that the security, territorial integrity and independence of Syria are of paramount importance", government spokesman Basim Alawadi said.</p>

<h3><strong>'Immense needs': Red Cross</strong></h3>

<p>The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said that Syrians faced "immense and urgent needs" after "immense suffering" caused by more than a decade of conflict.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Incoming US President Donald Trump on Sunday said he would go ahead with his plans to deport all illegal immigrants after entering the Oval Office and said at the same time he would make it easier for people to come in, a move that could be helpful to Indians who mostly enter the US legally.</p>

<p>“I think you have to do it,” Trump told NBC News in an interview when asked if he plans to deport everyone who is here illegally over the next four years.</p>

<p>“You have to have, rules, regulations, laws. They came in illegally. People that have been treated very unfairly are the people that have been online for 10 years to come into the country. We are going to make it very easy for people to come in terms of they have to pass the test. They have to be able to tell you what the Statue of Liberty is. They have to tell you a little bit about our country. They have to love our country,” Trump said.</p>

<p>“They can't come out of prisons. We don't want people that are in for murder. So, we had 11,000 and 13,000 different estimates, 13,099 murderers released into our country over the last three years. They're walking down the streets. They're walking next to you and your family. They're very dangerous. You don't want those people in this country,” he said.</p>

<p>“I'm saying this. We have to get the criminals out of our country. We have to get people that were taken out of mental institutions and put them back into their mental institution, no matter what country it is,” Trump said, adding that his top priority on the deportation list is going to be such criminals.</p>

<p>“Number one, we're doing criminals and we're going to do them rapidly. We're getting the worst gang probably with MS-13 and the Venezuelan gangs are the worst in the world. They're vicious, violent people,” he said. “Is it realistic to deport everyone who's here illegally?” he was asked.</p>

<p>“You have no choice. First of all, they're costing us a fortune. But we're starting with the criminals, and we've got to do it. Then we're starting with others, and we're going to see how it goes. Others are other people outside of criminals. We have convicted murderers. We don't mean people that are even on trial. We have people that have murdered numerous people on our streets and in our farms, and we have to get them out of our country,” he said.</p>

<p>“The dreamers are going to come later and we have to do something about the dreamers because these are people that have been brought here at a very young age. Many of these are middle-aged people now. They don't even speak the language of their country. And yes, we're going to do something about the dreamers,” he said.</p>

<p>“I will work with the Democrats on a plan. And if we can come up with a plan. But the Democrats have made it very, very difficult to do anything. Republicans are very open to the dreamers. The dreamers, we're talking many years ago, they were brought into this country. Some of them are no longer young people. In many cases, they become successful. They have great jobs. We are going to have to do something with them,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's King Charles III said he feels "slightly anxious" when wearing the coronation crown in case it "wobbles", in an upcoming documentary about his mother's crowning ceremony.</p>

<p>"The big one that you're crowned with, the St Edward's Crown, it weighs five pounds (more than two kilogrammes)," Charles said in "Coronation Girls".</p>

<p>"It is much heavier and taller, so there's always that feeling of feeling slightly anxious, in case it wobbles," the king added, speaking of the 17th-century gold headpiece in which he was crowned last year after the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II.</p>

<p>"Coronation Girls" tracks the journey of 12 women from Canada who sailed across the Atlantic to London for Elizabeth's coronation in 1953.</p>

<p>The women retraced their steps to Buckingham Palace in 2023, where they were surprised by the king, who said he "remember(ed) quite a lot" from his mother's coronation despite being only four-years-old.</p>

<p>"I remember it all so well then, because I remember my sister and I had bath time in the evening," Charles said.</p>

<p>"My mama used to come up at bath time wearing the crown to practice. You have to get used to how heavy it is."</p>

<p>Directed by Canadian filmmaker Douglas Arrowsmith, "Coronation Girls" will be aired on Boxing Day in Canada.</p>

<p>The documentary will be released internationally next year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Unity was set during the French Revolution where Notre Dame, modelled over a period of 14 months, played a key part in the missions.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France's iconic Notre Dame Cathedral reopened its doors last week, five years after a catastrophic fire destroyed the 850-year-old landmark. As the first mass was held on Sunday (Dec 8), conspiracy theories that Ubisoft's models of Notre Dame, created for 2014's <em>Assassin's Creed Unity</em> video game helped reconstruct the building also resurfaced. Ever since the fire broke out, a section of social media users have claimed that the French publisher provided its original 3D models and photos to the authorities to restore the medieval building to its old glory.</p>

<p>The action-adventure game was the eighth installment in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gadgets360.com/games/news/assassincs-creed-shadows-new-direction-modern-day-story-ubisoft-report-6963349" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Assassin's Creed</em> </a>series and the successor to 2013's <em>Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</em>. The main story was set in Paris during the French Revolution where Notre Dame, modelled over a period of 14 months, played a key part in the initial missions.</p>

<p>Despite the claims, the truth cannot be far from it, as per a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/443162/assassins-creed-unity-notre-dame-cathedral-models-debunked" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Polygon</em></a>. Quizzed about helping the French government with the massive reconstruction job, Ubisoft issued a clarification, explaining it had held no conversation on the matter.</p>

<p>"We are not currently involved in the reconstruction of Notre Dame, but we would be more than happy to lend our expertise in any way that we can to help with these efforts," a studio spokesperson told <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/apr/17/assassins-creed-creators-pledge-500000-notre-dame-restoration" rel="noindex, nofollow">Guardian</a></em>, way back in 2019.</p>

<p>"It is important to keep in mind that what we did for the game was not a scientific reconstruction but rather an artistic vision. While we wanted to be very precise with details, there are some differences in terms of scale."</p>

<h3><strong>Ubisoft's development of Notre Dame</strong></h3>

<p>While the rendering of Notre Dame is magnificent in the game, the artists did take several creative liberties for the sake of level design, gameplay and compliance with copyright.</p>

<p>Associate Art Director at Ubisoft Montreal, Caroline Miousse -- the person widely credited with building Unity's Notre Dame also quashed the rumours, stating that art designers only used photos, blueprints, books, and Google to recreate the building.</p>

<p>"We were able to find a lot of blueprints showing us exactly how Notre Dame was constructed. Maxime Durand (Assassin's Creed historian) helped me a lot with it because he has the historical background. I have tons of books, too. Google was also my best friend for a while. You can just find so much stuff on the internet now," Ms Miousse <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://blog.siggraph.org/2019/05/how-ubisoft-re-created-notre-dame-for-assassins-creed-unity.html/" rel="noindex, nofollow">said</a>.</p>

<p>While photos and videos can be used to create a game model, it does not offer much help when reconstruction work of the scale of Notre Dame is involved.</p>

<p>"The people behind Assassin's Creed did an amazing job. But these are graphic artists, very skillful, who work based on photographs and blueprints that they've recovered. They're looking for a coherent visual," Denis Lachaud, the CEO of a company called Life3D which scanned Notre Dame prior to the fire told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2019/04/17/non-le-jeu-video-assassin-s-creed-unity-ne-servira-pas-a-reconstruire-notre-dame-de-paris_5451713_4408996.html" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Le Monde</em></a>.</p>

<p>"But if a statue is two meters taller than in reality, it's not important for them. We are looking for millimetric precision, we work with engineers, with data analysts," he added.</p>

<p>Ubisoft did not perform such elaborate scans as it did not need to. Though the cathedral feels real and accurate in the game, it is not an exact replica of the building.</p>

<p>If Ubisoft was indeed involved in the reconstruction, it would have certainly publicised the move as it did when donating $565,000 to Notre Dame and offering free Windows PC copies of the game for a week.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Syria War Live Updates: </strong>Ousted Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad and his family have been granted asylum in Russia, hours after the Islamist-led rebels took control of his country. The rebel alliance, led by Islamist leader Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, launched its offensive on November 27. Since then, Aleppo - the second largest city, and Hamas fell to them. On Sunday, hours after announcing full control of Homs, the third main city in the nation, the rebels also took control of the capital Damascus.</p>

<p>Syria's civil war, which began with Assad's crackdown on democracy protests, has killed more than 5,00,000 people and forced more than half the population to flee their homes. According to the United Nations, the violence has displaced 3.7 lakh people.</p>

<p>In a first reaction from the US, President Joe Biden said Assad should be "held accountable" and called the nation's political upheaval a "historic opportunity" for Syrians to rebuild their country.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syria's rebel leader hailed a "historic" victory Sunday from a landmark Damascus mosque after his Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group headed a lightning offensive, snatching the capital from government control in less than two weeks.</p>

<p>His speech came as Syria's president Bashar al-Assad fled &nbsp;-- for Moscow according to Russian news agencies -- triggering celebrations across Syria and beyond at the end of his oppressive rule.</p>

<p>"This victory, my brothers, is historic for the region," HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, now using his real name Ahmed al-Sharaa, said in a speech at the Umayyad Mosque.</p>

<p>He also said the rebel takeover was also a victory "for the entire Islamic nation", in the video statement shared by rebels on Telegram.</p>

<p>"Today, Syria is being purified," he said, adding that "this victory is born from the people who have languished in prison, and the mujahideen (fighters) broke their chains".</p>

<p>He said that, under Assad, Syria had become a place for "Iranian ambitions, where sectarianism was rife," in reference to Assad's allies Iran and its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah.</p>

<p>As he entered the mosque, crowds could be seen cheering him on and chanting "Allahu akbar (God is greatest)", videos circulating online showed.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ousted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and family have landed in Moscow and have been granted asylum, Russia state media reported today, hours after Islamist-led rebels took control of his country.</p>

<p>"Assad and members of his family have arrived in Moscow," a Kremlin source told the TASS and Ria Novosti news agencies. "Russia granted them asylum on humanitarian grounds," he added.</p>

<p>There was buzz on social media with flight trackers speculating the mysterious whereabouts of Assad for most part of Sunday.</p>

<p>A Syrian Air plane took off from Damascus airport around the time the capital was taken by rebels, according to data from the Flightradar website.</p>

<p>The aircraft initially flew towards Syria's coastal region, a stronghold of Assad's Alawite sect, but then made an abrupt U-turn and flew in the opposite direction for a few minutes before disappearing off the map.</p>

<p>The sudden change in course and disappearance of the plane from tracking could indicate it had been shot down, or that it had switched off its transponder.</p>

<p>With Assad and family in Russia now, it is clear the plane had switched off its transponder.</p>

<p>Assad's departure comes less than two weeks after the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group challenged more than five decades of the Assad family rule with a lightning offensive.</p>

<p>"After 50 years of oppression under Baath rule, and 13 years of crimes and tyranny and displacement... we announce today the end of this dark period and the start of a new era for Syria," the rebel factions said on Telegram.</p>

<p>The Islamist leader of HTS, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, visited the capital Damascus's landmark Umayyad Mosque, as crowds greeted him with smiles and embraces. HTS is rooted in the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda.</p>

<p>Proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Western governments, HTS has sought to soften its image in recent years.</p>

<p>Across Syria, people toppled statues of Hafez al-Assad, Bashar al-Assad's father and the founder of the system of government that he inherited. For the past 50 years in Syria, even the slightest suspicion of dissent could land one in prison or get one killed.</p>

<p>As rebels entered the capital, HTS said its fighters broke into a jail on the outskirts of Damascus, announcing an "end of the era of tyranny in the prison of Sednaya", which has become a by-word for the darkest abuses of Assad's era.</p>

<p>UN war crimes investigators on Sunday described Assad's fall as a "historic new beginning" for Syrians, urging those taking charge to ensure the "atrocities" committed under his rule are not repeated.</p>

<p>The rapid developments came just hours after HTS said it had captured the strategic city of Homs, where prisoners were also released. Homs was the third major city seized by the rebels, who began their advance on November 27.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden was keeping a close eye on the "extraordinary events" unfolding in Syria, the White House said. US president-elect Donald Trump said that Assad had "fled his country" after losing Russia's backing.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[US President-elect Donald Trump aims to deport all immigrants in the US illegally over his four-year term but wants a deal to protect so-called "Dreamer" immigrants, he said in an interview that aired on Sunday on NBC News.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump aims to deport all immigrants in the US illegally over his four-year term but wants a deal to protect so-called "Dreamer" immigrants, he said in an interview that aired on Sunday on NBC News' "Meet the Press with Kristen Welker."</p>

<p>Trump also said he plans to take executive action on his first day in office to try to end birthright citizenship, which confers citizenship on anyone born in the US regardless of their parents' immigration status.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Trump, a Republican who won a second term in the White House promising mass deportations, is expected to declare illegal immigration a national emergency when he takes office on Jan. 20 and draw on resources from across the federal government to support a wide-ranging crackdown.</p>

<p>The US Department of Homeland Security estimated some 11 million immigrants were in the US illegally as of January 2022, although the figure is likely higher today. In the NBC News interview, Welker asked Trump if his plan was to deport everyone without legal status.</p>

<p>"I think you have to do it," Trump said. "It's a very tough thing to do. You know, you have rules, regulations, laws."</p>

<p>Trump said he wanted a deal to protect "Dreamer" immigrants brought to the US illegally as children, saying Republicans are open to the idea.</p>

<p>During his 2017-2021 presidency, Trump tried to end a program that provides deportation relief and work permits to the immigrants, but was rebuffed by the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Trump's plans to try to end birthright citizenship will likely face legal challenges. The right stems from an amendment to the US Constitution and is supported by 1898 Supreme Court precedent.</p>

<p>Speaking to Welker, Trump suggested Republicans may need to pursue a constitutional amendment to address the issue - an arduous process.</p>

<p>"We'll maybe have to go back to the people," he said.</p>

<p>Trump's incoming border czar Tom Homan and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller both told Fox News' "Sunday Morning Futures" that Congress should provide a major funding increase for immigration enforcement.</p>

<p>The pro-immigration American Immigration Council estimated that deporting all immigrants in the US illegally over more than a decade would cost $88 billion annually.</p>

<p>Homan said the minimum needed would be near that amount.</p>

<p>"We're going to need as much money as Congress can get us," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mystery surrounded the whereabouts of Bashar al-Assad, who was no longer in Damascus when rebels captured the Syrian capital on Sunday, ending more than five decades of his family's rule.</p>

<p>Two senior army officers said Assad had boarded a plane early on Sunday in Damascus for an unknown destination.</p>

<p>Russia, one of Assad's closest allies, confirmed that Assad had left Syria but did not say where he was, including whether Moscow had given him refuge.</p>

<p>"As a result of negotiations between B. Assad and a number of participants in the armed conflict on the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic, he decided to resign from the presidency and left the country, giving instructions for a peaceful transfer of power," Russia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.</p>

<p>Assad has not spoken in public since the sudden rebel advance a week ago, when insurgents seized northern Aleppo in a surprise attack before marching into a succession of cities as frontlines crumbled.</p>

<p>There was also no official announcement on Sunday of the whereabouts of Assad's wife Asma or their children, the eldest of whom has long studied in Russia and received a degree from a university in Moscow last year.</p>

<p>A Syrian Air plane took off from Damascus airport around the time the capital was reported to have been taken by rebels, according to data from the Flightradar website.</p>

<p>The aircraft initially flew towards Syria's coastal region, a stronghold of Assad's Alawite sect, but then made an abrupt U-turn and flew in the opposite direction for a few minutes before disappearing off the map. Reuters could not ascertain who was on board.</p>

<p>Two Syrian sources said the sudden change in course and disappearance of the plane from tracking could indicate it had been shot down, or that it had switched off its transponder.</p>

<p>The plane departed Damascus soon after rebels had taken the central city of Homs, cutting the capital off from the coast where Assad's Russian ally has air and naval bases.</p>

<p>The only trackable flight departing Syria visible after midnight on Flightradar24, a flight tracking site, left Homs for the UAE, hours after rebels had captured the city.</p>

<p>As the rebel advance gathered steam over the past week, there was speculation that Assad might seek refuge in Moscow or with his other main ally Iran. Syrian state media had said on Saturday he was still in Damascus.</p>

<p>He had visited Moscow just before the rebel offensive. Iranian news agencies published a photograph of him on Saturday that they said showed him meeting a top Iranian official in Damascus.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Celebrations erupted around Syria and crowds ransacked President Bashar al-Assad's luxurious home on Sunday after Islamist-led rebels swept into Damascus and declared he had fled the country, in a spectacular end to five decades of Baath party rule.</p>

<p>Assad's whereabouts were not immediately clear, but his key backer Russia said he had resigned from the presidency and left Syria.</p>

<p>Residents in the capital were seen cheering in the streets as the rebel factions heralded the departure of "tyrant" Assad, saying: "We declare the city of Damascus free."</p>

<p>AFPTV footage showed a column of smoke rising from central Damascus, and AFP correspondents in the city saw dozens of men, women and children wandering through Assad's luxurious home after it had been looted.</p>

<p>The rooms of the residence had been left completely empty, save some furniture and a portrait of Assad discarded on the floor, while an entrance hall at the presidential palace not far away had been torched.</p>

<p>"I can't believe I'm living this moment," tearful Damascus resident Amer Batha told AFP by phone.</p>

<p>"We've been waiting a long time for this day," he said, adding: "We are starting a new history for Syria."</p>

<p>Assad's reported departure comes less than two weeks after the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group challenged more than five decades of Assad family rule with a lightning offensive.</p>

<p>"After 50 years of oppression under Baath rule, and 13 years of crimes and tyranny and (forced) displacement... we announce today the end of this dark period and the start of a new era for Syria," the rebel factions said on Telegram.</p>

<p>While there has been no communication from Assad or his entourage on his whereabouts, Prime Minister Mohammed al-Jalali said he was ready to cooperate with "any leadership chosen by the Syrian people".</p>

<p>The head of war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Rami Abdel Rahman, told AFP: "Assad left Syria via Damascus international airport before the army security forces left" the facility.</p>

<p>AFP has been unable to independently verify some of the information provided by the different parties, including the reported departure.</p>

<p><strong>Prisoners set free</strong></p>

<p>Around the country, people toppled statues of Hafez al-Assad, Bashar al-Assad's father and the founder of the system of government that he inherited.</p>

<p>For the past 50 years in Syria, even the slightest suspicion of dissent could land one in prison or get one killed.</p>

<p>As rebels entered the capital, HTS said its fighters broke into a jail on the outskirts of Damascus, announcing an "end of the era of tyranny in the prison of Sednaya", which has become a by-word for the darkest abuses of Assad's era.</p>

<p>The rapid developments came just hours after HTS said it had captured the strategic city of Homs, where prisoners were also released.</p>

<p>Homs was the third major city seized by the rebels, who began their advance on November 27, reigniting a years-long war that had become largely dormant.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden was keeping a close eye on the "extraordinary events" unfolding in Syria, the White House said.</p>

<p>US president-elect Donald Trump said that Assad had "fled his country" after losing Russia's backing.</p>

<p>Assad's rule had for years also been supported by Lebanese group Hezbollah, whose forces "vacated their positions around Damascus", a source close to it said Sunday.</p>

<p><strong>'Syria is ours'</strong></p>

<p>Rebel factions aired a statement on Syrian state television, saying they had toppled the "tyrant" Assad and urged fighters and citizens to safeguard the "property of the free Syrian state".</p>

<p>State TV later broadcast a message proclaiming the "victory of the great Syrian revolution".</p>

<p>According to the rebels, the Islamist leader of HTS, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, arrived in Damascus on Sunday.</p>

<p>HTS is rooted in the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda.</p>

<p>Proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Western governments, it has sought to soften its image in recent years, and has told minority groups living in areas it now controls not to worry.</p>

<p>Before Sunday's announcements, Damascus residents had described to AFP a state of panic as traffic jams clogged the city centre, with people seeking supplies and queueing to withdraw money.</p>

<p>But morning saw chants and cheering, with celebratory gunfire and shouts of "Syria is ours and not the Assad family's".</p>

<p>Before Damascus, a string of towns and cities, including the northern city of Aleppo, had fallen from Assad's hands.</p>

<p>The commander of Syria's US-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which controls much of northeast Syria, hailed "historic" moments with the fall of Assad's "authoritarian regime".</p>

<p>In a sign of the complexity of Syria's war, Israel struck Syrian army weapons depots Sunday on the outskirts of Damascus, according to the Observatory, which relies on a network of sources around the country.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the overthrow of Assad was a "historic day in the... Middle East" and the fall of a "central link in Iran's axis of evil".</p>

<p>"This is a direct result of the blows we have inflicted on Iran and Hezbollah, Assad's main supporters," he added.</p>

<p>The rebel offensive began the very day a ceasefire took effect in Lebanon after nearly a year of war between Israel and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>The UN envoy for Syria said Syria was at "a watershed moment", while Turkey, which has historically backed the opposition, called for a "smooth transition".</p>

<p>Iran, a key backer of Assad throughout the civil war years, said it expected "friendly" ties with Syria to continue, even as its embassy in Damascus was vandalised.</p>

<p>Jordan urged its citizens to leave neighbouring Syria "as soon as possible", as have the United States and Russia, which both keep troops in Syria.</p>

<p>Since the rebels' offensive began, at least 826 people, mostly combatants but also including 111 civilians, have been killed, the Observatory said.</p>

<p>The United Nations said the violence has displaced 370,000 people.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad in Syria was a "historic day in the... Middle East" and the fall of a "central link in Iran's axis of evil".</p>

<p>Netanyahu said the events are "a direct result of the blows we have inflicted on Iran and Hezbollah, Assad's main supporters. It has triggered a chain reaction across the Middle East, empowering those seeking to break free from this oppressive regime."</p>

<p>He spoke on a visit to the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.</p>

<p>In recent months, Israel has killed commanders in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as well as the senior leaders of Palestinian Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah, both of which are backed by Tehran.</p>

<p>The Israeli premier said Assad's overthrow "presents significant new opportunities" for Israel "but is not without risks".</p>

<p>He said his country was "pursuing a good neighbour policy" and that: "We extend a hand of peace to our Druze neighbours, who are brothers to our Druze citizens in Israel. We also extend this hand of peace to Kurds, Christians, and Muslims who wish to live peacefully with Israel."</p>

<p>Syria is a multi-ethnic, multi-confessional country with significant minorities of Christians, Alawites and Kurds as well as the Druze, an ethno-religious Arab minority group with significant populations in Israel and Lebanon, and others.</p>

<p>"We will closely monitor developments and take the necessary steps to defend our border and our security", Netanyahu said.</p>

<p>He also said he had ordered the military to take control of a demilitarised buffer zone on the Syrian border.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz, speaking on the same trip, said of Iran: "Its tentacles are being severed one by one".</p>

<p>Islamist-led Syrian rebels overthrew more than five decades of rule by Assad and his father Hafez in a lightning offensive that began on November 27, dramatically overturning a years-long stalemate in the civil war that began in 2011.</p>

<p>Assad was propped up by substantial military support from Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah, as well as by the Russian military from 2015 onwards.</p>

<p>The Israeli military killed long-time Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a massive air strike on Beirut in September.</p>

<p>Since the Syrian civil war erupted in 2011, Israel carried out hundreds of strikes in the country, mainly targeting the army and Iran-backed groups.</p>

<p>The military intensified such strikes after almost a year of hostilities with Hezbollah in neighbouring Lebanon escalated in late September, before a ceasefire took effect on November 27, the same day Syria's rebel advance began.</p>

<p>Israel rarely comments on individual strikes in Syria but has repeatedly said it will not allow Iran to expand its presence in the country.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syrian rebels declared the fall of President Bashar al-Assad today, less than two weeks after a lightning offensive that ended his family's decades of rule. As Syrians woke up to a changed country, the rebel flags had replaced the posters of Assad, that earlier loomed over almost every corner. The development could lead to a significant change - a new official flag for the country that had its fair share of flag changes.</p>

<p><strong>Current Syrian Flag</strong></p>

<p>The current Syrian flag has been in use since 1980 and is a nod to Arab unity. The colours in the flag mean the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Red represents the blood shed in the revolution for the freedom of Syrians</li>
	<li>White denotes a peaceful future</li>
	<li>The green stars in the middle represent Syria and Egypt - the two founding states of the United Arab Republic</li>
	<li>The Black is for the alleged oppression suffered by Arabs</li>
</ul>

<p>This flag was first adopted in 1958 when the country had become independent of European influence and decided to form the United Arab Republic with Egypt. The country changed its flag another three times between 1961 and 1980 before settling on the current design. However, with the ouster of Bashar al-Assad that could change soon.</p>

<p><strong>Syrian Rebels' Flag</strong></p>

<p>On Sunday, as rebels announced on <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/syria-damascus-bashar-al-assad-out-rebels-take-over-what-next-for-syria-and-its-people-7200024">Syria</a>'s state television that the 50-year family dynasty was eliminated, the green-white-black-red opposition flags were seen across the country. The celebrations echoed in Germany, Turkey and Greece where jubilant crowds of thousands waved the Syrian opposition flags.</p>

<p>Supporters of the rebels entered the Syrian embassy in Athens raised the Syrian opposition flag from the rooftop. The police detained four people, however, left the flag flying, as per a Reuters report.</p>

<p><strong>Rebel Flag And 'Independence'</strong></p>

<p>The rebel flag, however, is not all that much different to the current Syrian flag. It has green at the top, white in the middle and black at the bottom of the flag with three red stars in the middle.</p>

<p>This flag is a modified version of the independence flag first used in 1932 when Syria gained independence from France. The Syrian opposition favoured the flag to represent independence from the Assad government.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/syria-bashar-al-assad-assad-family-damascus-the-al-assads-syrias-first-familys-rapid-rise-brutal-rule-abrupt-end-7198899">Bashar al-Assad</a>&nbsp;and his family are in Moscow, Russian news agencies announced Sunday evening citing a Kremlin source. Russia has granted them "asylum on humanitarian grounds," the source added.</p>

<p>After his regime was toppled, a statement read on television quoted Abu Mohammed al-Jolani - the leader of the Islamist alliance that spearheaded the offensive - as saying: "We continue to work with determination to achieve the goals of our revolution... We are determined to complete the path we started in 2011".</p>

<p>In 2011, Assad cracked down on peaceful pro-democracy protesters, triggering a complex conflict that drew in foreign armies.</p>

<p>While there has been no communication from Assad or his entourage on his whereabouts, Prime Minister Mohammed al-Jalali said he was ready to cooperate with "any leadership chosen by the Syrian people".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a seismic moment for the Middle East, Islamist rebels in Syria announced President Bashar al-Assad's ouster on Sunday after seizing control of Damascus, forcing him to flee and ending his family's decades of rule after more than 13 years of civil war. The fall of Bashar al-Assad came as a major blow to the influence of Russia and Iran in the heart of the region, key allies who propped up the President during critical periods in the conflict.</p>

<p>The end of the Assad family's five-decade rule in Syria is set to reshape the power balance in the region, with regional and global forces rising to fill the power vacuum left behind by the dramatic regime change. While the Western and Arab states, along with Israel, would try to curtail Iran's influence in Syria, it is unlikely for them to support a radical Islamist regime to replace Assad, according to a report by CNN.</p>

<p>For Iran the fall of Syria could shatter its so-called Axis of Resistance, comprising allied states and militia.</p>

<h2><strong>What Led To Asaad's Fall?</strong></h2>

<p>Rebels reportedly were encouraged to make an advance for Aleppo last week after Israel debilitated Hezbollah and weakened Iran's footprint in the region. "Due to the Lebanese war and decrease in Hezbollah forces, (Assad's) regime has less support," Hadi al-Bahra, a Syrian opposition leader representing anti-Assad groups told news agency Reuters in an interview.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He added that Iran-backed militias also have fewer resources, and Russia is providing less air cover to Assad's forces due to its "Ukraine problem".&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What's At Stake?</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Iran</strong></h3>

<p>For years, Syria was used by Iran to expand its regional influence through proxy groups stationed in the majorly Sunni nation. Tehran, along with its proxy Hezbollah, have helped the Syrian government forces regain lost territory. &nbsp;The Islamic Republic also sent its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commanders to advise Assad's military, which proved instrumental in keeping the President in Power. &nbsp;</p>

<p>However, since the beginning of the Middle Eastern conflict in October last year after the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched its attack on Israel, Hezbollah pulled its forces out of Syria to focus on its war with Israel. Iran has been reportedly using supply routes in Syria to transfer weapons to its proxies fighting Israel. The fall of Aleppo and potentially other cities bordering Lebanon could disrupt those routes, placing Iran in a difficult position. Losing Syria would be "a huge blow" for Iran, according to experts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The investment Iranians have made in Syria is very significant, it's an important land bridge to Lebanon, but also the alliance the Iranians have with the Assad regime has lasted across the Islamic Republic's history," Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Washington DC-based Quincy Institute told CNN.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per the report, Iran would want to use its proxies in the region as leverage in potential talks with incoming US President Donald Trump's administration.</p>

<p>"If Iran loses too much of their position in the region, will they be too weak to negotiate? But if they fight back to try and retain as much of that position as possible, do they risk escalating the war to the point where diplomacy may no longer be possible?" Mr Parsi said.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Lebanon</strong></h3>

<p>As per experts, the events in Syria are bound to impact Lebanon, where a truce deal between Tehran's proxy Hezbollah and Israel is hanging by a thread. Hezbollah was a crucial player in keeping the Asaad regime afloat, but it has been weakened by the war with Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In case the Syrian insurgents manage to reach the Lebanese border, Hezbollah's key logistics and supply route from Iran-- which passes through Syria and Iraq-- could be cut off, confining Tehran's proxy in Lebanon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"One of the causes of what is happening today in Syria is the control of the Syrian-Lebanese borders to prevent the passage of strategic weapons into Lebanon," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.euronews.com/2024/12/04/syria-how-the-conflict-could-impact-the-ukraine-crisis-and-migration" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">Euronews</a> quoted Antoine Habchi, Lebanese MP from the Bekka Valley, as saying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Turkey has tried to make sure that the Lebanese borders are not a route for the transfer of strategic weapons through Syria. Even al-Assad doesn't control passage through his own territory here, which is controlled by other factions and international forces, and notably Iran," Mr Habchi added.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Turkey</strong></h3>

<p>Turkey had been seeking to increase its leverage with President Assad to boost its standing in the region and allow it to keep closer control of Kurdish separatists, located along the Turkish-Syria border, to create a buffer zone. Ankara had represented the rebels in negotiations with Russia in the past decade, which eventually led to a ceasefire agreement between the Syrian government and Opposition forces in 2020.</p>

<p>Despite its support for opposition forces, Turkey has not ruled out a rapprochement with Syria. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long opposed Kurdish nationalism. He has time and again said that his ultimate goal is to eliminate the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a Kurdish far-left militant and political group based in Turkey and Iraq that has fought the Turkish state for more than three decades.</p>

<p>Another goal for Ankara is to reportedly maintain control over oil-rich Syrian sanctuaries in semi-autonomous northern areas of the country.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Israel</strong></h3>

<p>The imbalance in power in Syria has also caught Israel in a difficult position. While President Assad viewed Israel as an enemy, he did not pose a direct threat to Tel Aviv and opted to not respond to the regular Israeli strikes in Syria over the past year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Asaad's regime allowed its territory to be used by Iran to supply weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon. But the fall of Mr Asaad did not come as a relief to Israel as the group leading the rebellion in Syria is Hayat Tahrir Al Sham (HTS) whose leader Abu Muhammad Al Jolani is a former al Qaeda fighter with an Islamist ideology that opposes Israel.</p>

<p>"Israel is in between Iran, its proxies and Syria's Islamic rebels," Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence official, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/world/syria-rebellion-middle-east-power-explainer-intl/index.html" rel="no follow, no index" target="_blank">CNN</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"None of the choices are good as far as Israel is concerned but for the time being Iran and its proxies are weakened, which is good," he said</p>

<p>The newly revived conflict has allowed Tel Aviv to resume strikes on targets in Syrian territory. Suspected Israeli airstrikes hit Mazzeh district of Damascus on Sunday, Reuters reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per the report, jets believed to be Israeli also bombed the Khalkhala air base in southern Syria which was evacuated by the Syrian army overnight. The regional security sources also told the agency that at least six strikes hit the main air base in the north of the city of Suweida which has a large stockpile of rockets and missiles left by Syrian troops.</p>

<p>The attack appeared aimed at preventing these weapons from falling into the hands of radical groups, one source told Reuters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Newly restored Notre Dame cathedral held its first mass on Sunday, with Christians celebrating the return of the French capital's most famous place of worship after a historic re-opening ceremony.</p>

<p>The beloved Paris monument nearly burned down in 2019, but has been fully renovated inside and fitted with a new roof and spire during a frenzied five-year refit.</p>

<p>The inaugural mass was led by Paris archbishop Laurent Ulrich with 150 bishops and more than 100 priests from the capital in attendance, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron.</p>

<p>The archbishop led prayers and consecrated a new altar which replaced the old one that was destroyed five years ago.</p>

<p>"Whether you are here in person in the cathedral or in front of a screen, including perhaps under the rain, I greet you with intense emotion," Ulrich told the congregation, referring to the small rain-drenched crowds outside watching events on public screens.</p>

<p>In a nod to France's ongoing political turmoil, he added that he "prayed also for our country that is looking to the future with worry."</p>

<p>A second mass in the evening at 6:30 pm (1730 GMT) will be open to the public, with roughly 2,500 people who secured free tickets this week expected to attend.</p>

<p>The cathedral will open fully to visitors on December 16 via an online reservation system.</p>

<p><strong>'For Jesus'</strong></p>

<p>During a re-opening service on Saturday attended by world leaders including US President-elect Donald Trump, Macron expressed the "gratitude of the French nation" for the restoration work since 2019.</p>

<p>"We have rediscovered what great nations can do -- achieve the impossible," he said.</p>

<p>Macron is under intense political pressure having called snap elections in June that led to a hung parliament, with the main parties now struggling to form a stable government.</p>

<p>One of the most moving moments on Saturday came when firefighters in their protective gear walked through the congregation to thunderous applause as the word "Merci" ("Thank you") was beamed on the intricate facade and famous belltowers of the Gothic masterpiece.</p>

<p>The architectural wonder had been in danger of collapsing during the April 2019 blaze and was saved only by firefighters pumping vast quantities of water onto the flames from the nearby River Seine.</p>

<p>Groups of worshippers huddled under umbrellas on Sunday beyond a strict security perimeter set up outside Notre Dame.</p>

<p>"Beyond the reconstruction work, it's beautiful because it shows that the church still has a role, discreet and small, but it still has a role to play in France," 21-year-old engineering student Jacques told AFP.</p>

<p>Monique Kashale, a 75-year-old from the Democratic Republic of Congo, said she was "very cold but for Jesus Christ I can put up with it, for the Virgin Mary it is bearable."</p>

<p><strong>Trump in Paris</strong></p>

<p>Saturday's re-opening service began with the archbishop Ulrich, dressed in brightly coloured new vestments designed by fashion designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, knocking on the doors of the cathedral three times.</p>

<p>Trump was placed on the front row as guest of honour next to Macron, with invitees marvelling at the freshly cleaned walls, new furniture and state-of-the-art lighting installed as part of the overhaul</p>

<p>The reconstruction effort cost around 700 million euros ($750 million), financed from donations, with the five-year re-opening deadline met despite predictions it could take decades.</p>

<p>Part of the cathedral's lead roofing base still needs to be finished and the statues of the apostles and saints, removed before the fire to allow for their restoration, will only be reinstalled in the first half of 2025.</p>

<p>The exact cause of the 2019 blaze has never been identified despite a forensic investigation by prosecutors, who believe an accident such as an electrical fault was the most likely reason.</p>

<p>Notre Dame welcomed around 12 million visitors a year before the fire, but expects to receive an even higher figure of "14 to 15 million" after the reopening, according to the church authorities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

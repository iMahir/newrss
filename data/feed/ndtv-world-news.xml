       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's Xiaomi has asked India's antitrust body to recall its report that found the company and Walmart's Flipkart breached competition laws, arguing it contains commercial secrets, two people familiar with the matter said.</p>

<p>Any recall of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) report could delay its antitrust investigation, which began in 2021. In a rare move in August, the commission recalled an antitrust report on Apple after the company similarly complained commercial secrets were disclosed.</p>

<p>Xiaomi has told the commission in an application the investigation report on Flipkart contains sensitive business data on the smartphone company which was supposed to be redacted when the document was shared with parties in the case, said the two sources familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>One of Xiaomi's concerns with the Flipkart report is that it contains its model-wise sales which is sensitive information, one of the sources said.</p>

<p>Xiaomi, Flipkart and the competition watchdog did not immediately respond to Reuters queries.</p>

<p>The commission does not make investigation reports public and they are only shared with parties to the case. A recall requires parties to return the report which then undergoes further review for redactions.</p>

<p>The watchdog has found that e-commerce giants Amazon and Flipkart gave preference to select sellers and prioritised certain listings, and also colluded with companies like Xiaomi to launch phones exclusively on their websites, Reuters reported this month citing the August reports on Flipkart and Amazon.</p>

<p>Counterpoint Research data shows that South Korea's Samsung and China's Xiaomi are two of India's biggest smartphone players, together holding an almost 36% market share, with China's Vivo on 19%.</p>

<p>Xiaomi is not concerned with data in the report made on Amazon, in which the investigators also said the two companies colluded on online sales in breach of antitrust laws, said both the sources, who declined to be named as the matter is confidential.</p>

<p>It wants the commission to ask parties to return the report and destroy any copies, allowing the watchdog to further redact the sensitive information and reshare the reports, said the first source.</p>

<p>The watchdog took a similar step with its Apple report, which found the U.S. company exploited its dominant position in the market for app stores on its iOS operating system. The company denies wrongdoing.</p>

<p>The commission's Flipkart report said the Indian units of Samsung, Xiaomi, Motorola, Vivo, Lenovo and Realme indulged in the practice of exclusive product launches on Flipkart's shopping website, saying this was "against free and fair competition" and "against the interest of consumers".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The head of South Africa's flagship Black economic empowerment programme plans to introduce additional incentives and potential fines to improve corporate participation and curb exploitation of the system meant to tackle the country's gross inequality, he said.</p>

<p>The African National Congress, which had ruled unchallenged for 30 years until it lost its parliamentary majority in the May elections, is under intense pressure to improve the lives of Black people left disadvantaged by decades of white minority rule.</p>

<p>The empowerment law enacted in 2003 created a scorecard system that encourages companies to hire and promote Black people by offering them tax breaks and access to government contracts.</p>

<p>Two decades later, unemployment is five times higher for Black people than for white people and income inequality is the worst in the world, according to the World Bank, and critics say the empowerment policy has not worked. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There's no society that can be viable with (this) level of inequality," Tshediso Matona, head of the Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment Commission told Reuters.</p>

<p>Under the voluntary programme, companies earn points in categories such as Black ownership, management control and skills development.</p>

<p>However, Matona says some companies inflate their scores by falsely listing Black people as managers, a practice commonly known in South Africa as "fronting", a crime under the law.</p>

<p>The commission, which refers cases of infringement to state prosecutors, has received 1,348 complaints of fronting since 2017, said Matona. He added, without saying how many cases had been sent to trial, that no one had yet been convicted of fronting largely because the criminal justice system was "still figuring out how to work with the B-BBEE regulation".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Listed companies are required to disclose their Black empowerment status in annual reports, but fewer and fewer are doing so. In 2022, only 141 of about 400 listed companies submitted a report.</p>

<p>Matona said he hoped to enhance company incentives for compliance while "naming and shaming" and possibly fining those who fail to submit the reports. &nbsp;</p>

<p>President Cyril Ramaphosa has said he wants to focus on showing companies the advantages of Black empowerment, but that if they refuse to comply then penalties would be needed.</p>

<p>"On this one (Black empowerment), we are unequivocal," Ramaphosa told reporters over a week ago, describing racial inequality as an "existential challenge" for South Africa.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It must be done, and it will be done."</p>

<p>Matona would not be drawn on the specifics of the proposals but said incentives could focus on increasing recognition for companies that invest in skills and enterprise development and should not be "too obsessed about ownership in existing businesses".</p>

<p>He said he hoped to have amendments to the law tabled in parliament within 12 months.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Any inclusion of punitive measures could set the ANC on a collision course with its coalition partner, the pro-business Democratic Alliance party, which has said it would resist them.</p>

<p>"Businesses don't exist for altruistic purposes, we must accept that," said DA labour spokesperson Michael Bagraim.</p>

<h3><strong>'BLACKWASHING' AND TRAINING LOOPHOLES&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>A common criticism of the affirmative action system is that it made a small number of political insiders extremely wealthy through shareholding deals, especially in its early years.</p>

<p>Economist Duma Gqubule said his research - based on an analysis of companies' annual reports and shareholding plans - found Black ownership of the 50 biggest firms listed on the Johannesburg bourse was barely 1%, far below the official average figure of about 30%.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This was because legal loopholes allowed firms to count Black shareholders even after they sold their stake, or to use shareholding structures that artificially increase Black ownership, a practice Gqubule described as "Blackwashing".</p>

<p>Matona blamed a lack of oversight of independent agencies which issue Black empowerment scorecards and said the industry needed regulation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His attempt to shift the focus away from ownership to skills development and training also has loopholes, consultants and trainees Reuters spoke to said.</p>

<p>To get skills points companies must pay for training courses for Black people, but they don't have to hire them. Some engage a consultancy to find them disabled people to train, because these earn more points, the head of one such consultancy said.</p>

<p>This often leaves Black job seekers in a cycle of training.</p>

<p>"They keep on promising us that they will hire us but they've never done that," said Nonhle Mnguni, a 22-year-old woman in Soweto who has done such courses in business administration, banking, freight forwarding and call centre work since leaving high school.</p>

<p>Giles Von Broembsen, CEO of property management company Pretor Group, said his company ran training programmes for employees, more than half of whom are Black, but that he could only earn points by sending them on a training course elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The points and the scoring and the system is all very laudable, but it's not practical," he said.</p>

<p>While some political and economic analysts agree with Matona's approach to push for more compliance, others want the law repealed, saying it adds unnecessary bureaucracy which increases business costs and deters foreign investment.</p>

<p>"I think the whole thing should be repealed," said political analyst Moeletsi Mbeki. "(The state) should help entrepreneurs to develop new businesses, irrespective of their race."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas's Gaza-based leader Yahya Sinwar has been incommunicado for a long time, making Israel look for evidence of his possible death. Reports by Israel's public broadcaster Kan, news outlets such as Haaretz, Maariv and Walla, and the IDF Military Intelligence Directorate suggested that Sinwar may have been killed in recent Israeli strikes in Gaza. However, there is no concrete evidence to support this claim. Meanwhile, the Shin Bet agency reportedly believes that he is still alive.</p>

<p>According to The Times Of Israel, some reports quoted sources stating that the elusive Hamas chief, who has been hiding in tunnels in Gaza since Hamas's October 7 attack, has a history of going off the radar before reemerging to deliver messages related to the ceasefire negotiations or other issues. Security officials, cited by multiple outlets, noted that any assertion of Sinwar's death was currently speculative and lacked a solid basis.</p>

<p>Haaretz, quoting sources, reported that Israel bombed tunnels in areas where Sinwar was thought to be hiding, but there was no definitive evidence that he was harmed or killed. He may be deliberately maintaining a low profile. The military's response to inquiries was succinct: “We have no information confirming or refuting the matter.”</p>

<p>Since the October 7 attack on Southern Israel -- believed to have been orchestrated by Sinwar -- Israel has targeted key figures within Hamas, including the group's military wing chief, Muhammad Deif, and Khan Younis Brigade chief, Rafa'a Salameh. Hamas chief&nbsp;Ismail Haniyeh and deputy chief Saleh al-Arouri were&nbsp;also killed in drone strikes in Iran and Beirut, respectively,&nbsp;earlier this year. Reports said that&nbsp;Yahya Sinwar and his brother Muhammad remained high-value targets for Israeli forces, yet attempts to locate them have proven unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Reports have also explored the intricate and secretive methods of communication that Sinwar allegedly employs from his hideouts, involving intermediaries and handwritten notes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Anura Kumara Dissanayake has been elected as Sri Lanka’s next president, securing victory in the country’s first election since its economic collapse in 2022.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anura Kumara Dissanayake, a left-leaning leader, has been elected Sri Lanka's next president in the country's first election since its economy collapsed in 2022. Mr Dissanayake, popularly known as “AKD,” was born into a small farming family in Anuradhapura. His political journey began with his involvement in the student wing of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), a Marxist-Leninist party.</p>

<p>Born on November 24, 1968, he comes from a modest background - his father was a government office help and his mother a homemaker. Politics wasn't initially a family pursuit, but Dissanayake's early life experiences, including the loss of his cousin to political violence, drew him to activism.</p>

<p>One of Mr Dissanayake's cousin was killed during the government's crackdown on the JVP's second insurrection in 1988. This period also saw his family home destroyed, deepening his resolve to remain loyal to the JVP's cause.</p>

<h2><strong>Political evolution and leadership</strong></h2>

<p>Initially, the JVP maintained a staunch anti-imperialist and socialist position, but by the 1980s, it shifted towards Sinhala nationalism. The party fiercely opposed Tamil political claims and external intervention in Sri Lanka's ethnic conflict. After being banned in the 1980s and later legalised, the JVP entered mainstream politics, winning seats in parliament. Mr Dissanayake himself became a Member of Parliament in 2000 and briefly served as the Minister of Agriculture under President Chandrika Kumaratunga Bandaranaike between 2004 and 2005.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/jkv96n4o_anura-kumara-dissanayaka-afp_625x300_23_September_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>In 2014, he was appointed leader of the JVP, succeeding Somawansa Amarasinghe. Under his leadership, the party underwent significant changes, focusing on expanding its political base. Recognising that the JVP's traditional appeal was limited, Mr Dissanayeke formed the National People's Power (NPP) Alliance, bringing together over two dozen political groups, professionals, academics, and activists. This move aimed to position the NPP as an alternative to the two traditional political camps — led by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the United National Party.</p>

<h2><strong>Leadership and ideology</strong></h2>

<p>Colleagues describe Mr Dissanayake as a clear-headed decision-maker who values collective input, a hallmark of his leadership style. Vijitha Herath, a fellow JVP MP, said that Mr Dissanayake is very good at factoring in multiple views and making the best decision quickly, in real-time.</p>

<p>His calm, composed demeanour and ability to build compelling narratives against Sri Lanka's ruling class have made him a magnetic figure in public life. Known for his powerful speeches in parliament, Sri Lanka's new President has been a vocal critic of government excesses and mismanagement, often stacking his arguments with facts and figures that resonate with the public.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/4p78iruo_anura-kumara-dissanayaka-afp_625x300_23_September_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Under his leadership, the NPP shifted its focus from purely socialist principles to a broader political message, seeking to address corruption and economic mismanagement. This ideological evolution has drawn criticism from some traditional leftists, but Mr Dissanayake remains unapologetic, emphasising that his party's goal is to serve the majority of the people rather than adhere strictly to labels of left-wing politics.</p>

<h2><strong>Presidential run and political campaigns</strong></h2>

<p>In 2019, Mr Dissanayake contested the presidential election against Gotabaya Rajapaksa. While some liberals and leftists feared that his candidacy would split the opposition vote and enable Rajapaksa's victory, Mr Dissanayake's NPP went ahead with the campaign, drawing large crowds but securing only 3.16 per cent&nbsp;of the vote. In the 2020 parliamentary elections, the NPP won just three seats, down from six in the previous term, earning the derisive label of the “3% party” from rivals. Despite these setbacks, Mr Dissanayake and his party doubled down on grassroots mobilisation, expanding their reach through relentless political organizing and engaging with the Sinhala expatriates in Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>

<h2><strong>The 2022 people's uprising</strong></h2>

<p>The turning point came in 2022, during the Janatha Aragalaya, or the people's struggle, resulting in the ouster of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Although the movement was decentralised and comprised a wide array of voices, Mr Dissanayake's NPP played a key role in sympathising with the people's demand for “system change” and maintaining its grassroots activism.</p>

<p>As political disillusionment deepened, particularly among the youth, the NPP began to be seen as a viable alternative to Sri Lanka's traditional political elites. Mr Dissanayake's rallies drew large crowds, and his oratory style, which combined calm analysis with impassioned calls for reform, resonated with many.</p>

<p>As Sri Lanka continues to grapple with significant economic challenges and political uncertainty, Mr Dissanayake has emerged as a symbol of hope for many citizens seeking change. At 55, Anura Kumara Dissanayake now stands as a prominent leader who embodies the aspirations of those disillusioned by the country's long-entrenched political elite.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lanka's first leftist president was sworn into office Monday vowing to restore public faith in politics after anger over the island nation's unprecedented economic crisis propelled him to a landslide poll win.</p>

<p>Self-avowed Marxist Anura Kumara Dissanayaka of the People's Liberation Front (JVP) took his oath at the colonial-era Presidential Secretariat in Colombo after trouncing his nearest rivals in Saturday's vote.</p>

<p>The previously fringe politician -- whose party led two failed uprisings that left tens of thousands dead -- saw a surge of support after the country's 2022 economic meltdown forced painful hardships on ordinary Sri Lankans.</p>

<p>Dissanayaka, 55, was sworn in by the chief justice in a ceremony attended by lawmakers, members of the Buddhist clergy and the military who sang the national anthem after the ceremony.</p>

<p>"I will do my best to fully restore the people's confidence in politicians," Dissanayaka said after taking the oath.</p>

<p>"I am not a conjurer, I am not a magician," he added. "There are things I know and things I don't know, but I will seek the best advice and do my best. For that, I need the support of everyone."</p>

<p>Dissanayaka succeeds outgoing president Ranil Wickremesinghe, who took office at the peak of the financial crisis following the government's first-ever foreign debt default and months of punishing food, fuel and medicine shortages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wickremesinghe, 75, imposed steep tax hikes and other austerity measures per the terms of an International Monetary Fund bailout.</p>

<p>His policies ended the shortages and returned the economy to growth but left millions struggling to make ends meet.</p>

<p>"I can confidently say that I did my best to stabilise the country during one of its darkest periods," he said in a statement after placing a distant third in Saturday's poll.</p>

<p>Shortly before the ceremony, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena resigned, clearing the way for Dissanayaka to appoint his own cabinet.</p>

<p>Dissanayaka's party has said he wants to have his own cabinet until a fresh parliament is elected later this year. His JVP party has only three members in the 225-member parliament.</p>

<p>He has vowed to press ahead with the IMF rescue package negotiated by his predecessor last year but modify its terms in order to deliver tax cuts.</p>

<p>"It is a binding document, but there is a provision to renegotiate," Bimal Ratnayake, a senior member of Dissanayaka's party, told AFP.</p>

<h3><strong>Legacy of violence&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Dissanayaka's party led two rebellions in the 1970s and 1980s that left more than 80,000 people dead before renouncing violence.</p>

<p>It had been a peripheral player in Sri Lankan politics in the decades since, winning less than four per cent of the vote during the most recent parliamentary elections in 2020.</p>

<p>But Sri Lanka's crisis proved an opportunity for Dissanayaka, who saw his popularity rise after pledging to change the island's "corrupt" political culture.</p>

<p>The 55-year-old labourer's son was a JVP student leader during the second insurrection and has described how one of his teachers sheltered him to save him from government-backed death squads that killed party activists.</p>

<p>He counts famous Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara among his heroes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since his rise to popularity, he has softened some policies, saying he believes in an open economy and is not totally opposed to privatisation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to ensure that Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology benefits the people of India and is challenging tech giants to do more in this direction, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has said.</p>

<p>"The Prime Minister has been focused on transforming India with his Digital India vision. He pushed us to continue making in India, designing in India. We are proud to now make our Pixel phones manufactured in India. He is thinking about how AI can transform India in a way that benefits the people. He challenged us to think about applications in healthcare, education, and agriculture," the Indian-born industry leader said following his meeting with Prime Minister Modi during his US trip.</p>

<p>"He is also thinking about the infrastructure of India, be it data centres, power, energy, and investing to make sure India can transition. We are proud to be partnering with India. We are robustly investing in AI in India. We look forward to doing more. We have several programmes and partnerships with MeitY, agriculture and health ministries, and central and state governments," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Pichai said the Prime Minister has always challenged them to do more for India. "He is asking to do the same with AI. He has a clear vision, both in terms of the opportunity AI will create, but he wants to make sure that ultimately AI is there to benefit the people of India."</p>

<p>Mr Pichai was among CEOs of tech giants who met Prime Minister Modi for a roundtable in New York today. Hosted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) School of Engineering, the roundtable was attended by Nvidia's Jensen Huang, Adobe's Shantanu Narayen,&nbsp;Accenture's Julie Sweet, AMD's Lisa Su, Biogen's Chris Viehbacher, HP's Enrique Lores, and IBM's Arvind Krishna, among others.</p>

<p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called Prime Minister Modi an "incredible student". "Every time I meet him, he wants to learn more about the technology. Artificial intelligence is a new industry and I am looking forward to partnering with India. We are partnering with many companies, start-ups and IITs in India," he said.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister said in a post on X that he had a&nbsp;fruitful roundtable with the tech CEOs and they discussed aspects relating to technology and innovation and more. "Also highlighted the strides made by India in this field. I am glad to see immense optimism towards India," he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the Ministry of External Affairs, the roundtable focused on artificial intelligence and quantum; biotechnology and life sciences; computing, IT and communication; and semiconductor technologies.</p>

<p>"Prime Minister highlighted the economic transformation happening in India, particularly in electronics and information technology manufacturing, semiconductors, biotech and green development. He stated that his government was committed to making India a global hub of semiconductor manufacturing. He also dwelt on India's BIO E3 policy to develop India into a biotech powerhouse. On AI, he noted that India's policy is to promote AI for All, underpinned by its ethical and responsible use," the MEA said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The CEOs expressed their strong interest in investing and collaborating with India. India's growing prominence as a global technology hub, driven by its innovation-friendly policies and flourishing market opportunities, got much appreciation from the tech-leaders," it added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US government has launched a high-profile sex trafficking and racketeering case against music mogul Sean Combs, aka Diddy, accusing him of orchestrating coercive and abusive sexual encounters at luxury hotels. The indictment, which includes accusations of arson, bribery, kidnapping and obstruction of justice, centres on what prosecutors refer to as&nbsp;“freak-offs”&nbsp;-&nbsp;“elaborate and produced sex&nbsp;performances,”&nbsp;involving drugs, prostitutes, and recordings - according to a report in the New York Times.&nbsp;Combs'&nbsp;legal team, however, insists these encounters were consensual.</p>

<p>According to the 14-page federal criminal indictment, these&nbsp;“freak-offs”&nbsp;were organised by Combs and his associates in hotel suites filled with baby oil, drugs and video equipment. Prosecutors allege that participants were coerced, with some requiring intravenous fluids to recover from the multi-day ordeals. The government claims Combs filmed the sessions and used the footage to blackmail participants into silence.</p>

<p>“Freak-off activity is the core of this case, and freak-offs are inherently dangerous,”&nbsp;said Emily A Johnson, one of the prosecutors. This depiction&nbsp;is echoed&nbsp;in the civil lawsuit filed by singer Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, against Combs last year. Cassie claimed that Combs directed frequent freak-offs, where she&nbsp;was coerced&nbsp;into performing sexual acts, which he filmed.</p>

<p>Combs, who has pleaded not guilty, faces a vastly different narrative presented by his defence team. His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, argued the events were consensual, part of an unconventional but voluntary relationship between Combs and Ventura. Agnifilo pointed out that several men involved denied being coerced or viewing themselves as sex workers.</p>

<p>The racketeering charges stem from allegations that Combs coordinated these events through a network of enablers who managed logistics such as securing prostitutes, booking hotel rooms, and cleaning up after the sessions. Prosecutors argue that violence often accompanied these encounters, a claim the defence denies.</p>

<p>In addition to&nbsp;Ventura's&nbsp;lawsuit, Combs faces a series of other civil suits from women who accuse him of drug-fuelled sexual abuse. One complainant, Adria English, alleged that Combs demanded she has sex with guests at his famous&nbsp;“white parties.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Combs's&nbsp;lawyers have dismissed the lawsuits as opportunistic.</p>

<p>Combs, who remains in federal custody after being denied bail, is accused of attempting to cover up evidence of the abuse. Prosecutors claim he offered hotel staff bribes and&nbsp;attempted&nbsp;to destroy surveillance footage after an alleged assault on Ventura in 2016.The investigation is underway, and&nbsp;Combs's&nbsp;legal battle is far from over.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The allegations against Combs go back to the 1990s when he founded Bad Boy Records, his label, according to Forbes.&nbsp;In 2022, he was in the&nbsp;14the&nbsp;spot among&nbsp;Forbes'&nbsp;list of the highest-paid entertainers after he made an estimated $90 million that year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Holloman, who has no prior criminal record, was taken into custody on September 19.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A decades-old cold case has been solved with the arrest of a man accused of murdering a young mother in Boston. James Holloman has been charged with the 1988 stabbing death of Karen Taylor after DNA evidence linked him to the crime scene, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/mans-spit-leads-to-his-arrest-in-1988-cold-case-murder-boston-woman-8716440" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>People</em></a> reported.</p>

<p>Although a check made out to Holloman was found near Taylor's body, authorities had been unable to definitively connect him to the murder until recently. A breakthrough came when Holloman's DNA was collected after he spat on the sidewalk last year.</p>

<p>Investigators compared the DNA to samples found under Taylor's fingernails, on a bloody sweatshirt, and a cigarette discovered near her body. The results confirmed a match, leading to Holloman's arrest.</p>

<p>Holloman, who has no prior criminal record, was taken into custody on September 19. His attorney has expressed scepticism about the DNA evidence, suggesting that it might not be conclusive after so many years.</p>

<p>Suffolk County District Attorney Kevin Hayden told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-taylor-1988-murder-boston-james-holloman-dna/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>CBS News</em></a> that this case exemplifies "superb investigative work by detectives and prosecutors utilizing modern criminological science."&nbsp;</p>

<p>He added, "Most importantly, it provides an opportunity for Karen Taylor's loved ones to see someone held accountable for her death after so many years of unanswered questions."</p>

<p>Taylor was found dead on May 27, 1988, in her apartment in Boston's Roxbury neighbourhood at the age of 25.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her body was discovered after her mother called the apartment, and Taylor's 3-year-old daughter answered, saying her mom "was sleeping and she couldn't wake her up," according to a statement from the Suffolk County District Attorney's office, reported by WHDH.</p>

<p>The statement further explained, "The mother went to Taylor's apartment at 37 Williams Street in Roxbury but couldn't access the building. She went around to the back and crawled through the window of her daughter's bedroom, where she found her lying face down in a pool of blood."</p>

<p>An autopsy revealed that Taylor had been stabbed 15 times in her chest, head, and neck.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas's multipronged attack on southern Israel on October 7 was unprecedented in scale. The panic and confusion it caused made many details of what was happening difficult to establish immediately.</p>

<p>Nearly one year later, the confirmed death count, which includes hostages killed in captivity, now stands at 1,205.</p>

<p>Here is a blow-by-blow timeline of Israel's deadliest day.</p>

<h3><strong>Caught by surprise&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>At 6:29 am (0329 GMT), the Israeli army detected thousands of rockets being fired from the Gaza Strip towards Israeli border communities.</p>

<p>Palestinian militant group Hamas, which rules Gaza, said it had launched some 5,000 projectiles in an offensive dubbed "Operation Al-Aqsa Flood", a reference to the mosque in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem that is Islam's third-holiest site.</p>

<p>Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system kicked in but was quickly overwhelmed by the amount of incoming fire.</p>

<p>At the same time, Hamas fighters -- the group would later say they numbered 1,200 -- stormed across the border on motorbikes, in pickup trucks and even in motorised paragliders.</p>

<p>They used explosives and bulldozers to break through the fence separating Gaza from Israel and attacked nearly 50 different sites, including kibbutzim communities, army bases and a music festival.</p>

<p>Militants killed festival-goers en masse and went door-to-door in farming communities, shooting residents dead in their homes.</p>

<p>In March, a United Nations report acknowledged there were "reasonable grounds to believe" that rapes were committed during the attack. It also found "clear and convincing information" that some hostages taken on that day had been raped.</p>

<h3><strong>Slow army response</strong></h3>

<p>By 8:30 am, the militants had stormed six military bases: Erez at the northern end of the Gaza Strip, Nahal Oz opposite Gaza City, two others near the Beeri kibbutz, one in Reim near central Gaza and two in the south close to the Egyptian border.</p>

<p>Residents of kibbutzim near Gaza were forced to fight the attackers on their own for hours, as the military was slow to come to their aid.</p>

<p>They would later describe cowering in safe rooms as militants tried to break down the doors, or taking whatever arms they had and rushing out to try to repel the assault.</p>

<p>At the Nova music festival, where nearly 3,000 people had gathered in fields and woods a few kilometres (miles) from central Gaza, militants went on an hour-long rampage that killed at least 370 people.</p>

<p>In kibbutz Beeri, one of the worst-hit communities, the first individual Israeli reinforcements came to help "from 13:30 onwards", an army report later said.</p>

<p>A full army division arrived at 4:15 pm to organise a coordinated evacuation of survivors and retake control of the kibbutz.</p>

<p>The military announced at around 6:00 pm that both soldiers and civilians had been seized by Hamas attackers and taken into Gaza.</p>

<h3><strong>Taken as hostages&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>A total of 251 people in Israel were taken hostage on October 7, including 44 from the Nova festival and at least 74 from kibbutz Nir Oz.</p>

<p>Some, including soldiers, were already dead and their bodies were taken into Gaza, the army has said.</p>

<p>Some hostages may have fallen to friendly fire, including in kibbutz Beeri, where witnesses told Israeli media a tank fired at a house in which 14 people were being held by Hamas.</p>

<p>The order may have been an instance of the "Hannibal Directive", which Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported was applied at least three times that day.</p>

<p>This measure allows for the use of force to prevent soldiers from being captured.</p>

<h3><strong>'We are at war'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>At 11:34 am, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered an almost unprecedented televised address on the rest day of Shabbat, declaring: "We are at war."</p>

<p>In the afternoon, the military called up 360,000 reservists to bolster an army that otherwise boasts 170,000 personnel, a mix of those performing mandatory service and career soldiers.</p>

<p>Israel quickly began a relentless bombardment of Gaza, the tiny Palestinian coastal territory home to 2.4 million people that has been ruled by Hamas since 2007.</p>

<p>An AFP journalist reported the first strike in Gaza at 10:39 am that day. Since then, the territory has been devastated by relentless air strikes.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive since October 7 has killed at least 41,431 people in Gaza, a majority of them civilians, according to data provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The United Nations has called the figures reliable.</p>

<p>As night fell on October 7, the search continued for any gunmen still inside Israel, with terrified civilians locked inside their homes and many streets deserted.</p>

<p>On October 10, the military said it had taken back control of all territory attacked by the militants.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kate Middleton made her first public appearance on Sunday after completing her chemotherapy. The 42-year-old royal, accompanied by her husband Prince William, attended a church service with King Charles III and Queen Camilla near their Balmoral estate in Scotland.</p>

<p>In photos published by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/royals/30589432/princess-kate-spotted-first-time-finished-chemotherapy/ ">The Sun</a>, Kate was seen in the passenger seat of a car driven by the Prince of Wales, who wore a navy suit and blue tie for the occasion.&nbsp;It marked her return to public duties after a period of absence due to cancer treatment.</p>

<p>On September 9, the Princess of Wales shared that she finished her chemotherapy six months after being diagnosed with an undisclosed type of cancer. Her revelation came just weeks after Buckingham Palace announced that King Charles III was also undergoing cancer treatment. In her announcement, Kate stated that she was optimistic about her recovery, adding her journey to complete health would be gradual, with plans to participate in limited engagements through the end of the year.</p>

<p>“The last nine months have been incredibly tough for us as a family,” Kate shared in <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kate-middleton-finishes-chemotherapy-course-says-cant-tell-what-a-relief-6527477 ">a video</a>. “Life as you know it can change in an instant, and we have had to find a way to navigate the stormy waters. The cancer journey is complex, scary and unpredictable for everyone, especially those closest to you. It brings a new perspective on everything.”</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Princess Kate quietly resumed her royal duties. For the first time since March, the Princess of Wales held a private meeting with team members from Kensington Palace and the Centre for Early Childhood at Windsor Castle.</p>

<p>Despite stepping away from most royal duties during her treatment, Kate made two public appearances earlier in the year. In June, she participated in the <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/in-pics-kate-middleton-military-parade-and-a-celebration-at-buckingham-5897094#:~:text=Kate%20Middleton%2C%20along%20with%20Princess,since%20her%20cancer%20diagnosis%20announcement">Trooping the Colour military parade</a> on King Charles' birthday. The Princess also attended the men's final at Wimbledon in July, receiving a <a href="http://https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kate-middleton-receives-standing-ovation-at-wimbledon-final-in-rare-outing-since-cancer-diagnosis-6108590 ">standing ovation</a> from the crowd.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel and Hezbollah have threatened to intensify their cross-border attacks, disregarding calls from the international community to de-escalate and step back from a potential all-out war.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>Hezbollah's deputy chief, Naim Qassem, issued a defiant message that the group has entered "a new phase" in its confrontation with Israel. Qassem made his remarks following Israeli strikes on northern Lebanon that targeted Hezbollah strongholds, resulting in widespread damage and numerous casualties.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant reiterated Israel's commitment to ensuring the security of its northern residents, stating, "Military actions will continue until we reach a point where we may ensure the safe return of Israel's northern communities to their homes." As both sides harden their stances, Army Chief Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi vowed that Israel would "hit anyone who threatens" its citizens.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The United States, Israel's biggest ally, has urged restraint. President Joe Biden emphasised that military escalation is not in Israel's "best interest" and that the US is working tirelessly to prevent a broader conflict. "We're going to do everything we can to keep a wider war from breaking out," Biden said.</li>
	<li>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres echoed similar concerns, warning of the risk of Lebanon becoming "another Gaza" amid the ongoing Gaza conflict.</li>
	<li>Over the weekend, Hezbollah launched a barrage of rockets that reached Kiryat Bialik near Haifa, Israel's largest northern city, damaging infrastructure and igniting fears of further escalation. In retaliation, Israel struck Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon, including an airbase and military production facilities. The exchange of fire led Israel's civil defence agency to order schools in the north to shut down.</li>
	<li>Lebanon's health ministry reported that three people were killed in Israeli strikes on southern areas, while Hezbollah confirmed that two of its fighters were killed. The Israeli army reported that over 150 rockets, missiles, and drones were fired into its territory overnight from Lebanon.</li>
	<li>Israel's recent airstrikes, including an attack on the densely populated Dahiyeh neighbourhood in Beirut, killed Ibrahim Aqil, head of Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force.</li>
	<li>Hezbollah has signalled that it will not be deterred, with Qassem stating that the group is prepared to face "all military possibilities." This comes as Israel continues to target Hezbollah's military infrastructure, attempting to prevent the group from expanding its influence along the Israeli-Lebanese border.</li>
	<li>Despite mediation efforts led by Qatar, Egypt, and the United States, the conflict shows no sign of abating. Attempts to secure a ceasefire and facilitate hostage release have stalled, with Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty indicating that the situation between Israel and Hezbollah is negatively affecting efforts to stabilize Gaza.</li>
	<li>The United Nations has described the situation as being "on the brink of an imminent catastrophe."&nbsp;</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man's bold decision to get the Monster Energy Drink logo tattooed across his chest has sparked amusement online. The tattoo, featuring the company's recognisable large "M" symbol, was shared on social media platform X. The image showed the surrounding skin red and inflamed, indicating the ink was freshly done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tattoo drew attention for its size, as the large "M" – designed to resemble three claw marks – was placed prominently on the man's chest, covering much of the space. While the man seemed proud of his new ink, Monster Energy's response on social media was far from enthusiastic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The energy drink company replied to the viral post with a humorous comment, saying, “Kinda wish we never saw this.”&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man who was abducted as a six-year-old boy over 70 years ago has been found alive on the East Coast of the United States. Luis Armando Albino disappeared on February 21, 1951, from a park in West Oakland, California. He was lured away by a woman who promised to buy him sweets while he played with his 10-year-old brother, Roger. For decades, his whereabouts remained a mystery, until this year, when DNA testing and family efforts revealed the truth.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/09/20/oakland-boy-kidnapped-1951-found-alive-new-york/ ">Mercury News</a> first reported the discovery, which came after Mr Albino's niece, Alida Alequin, set on a quest to find her uncle. Using DNA testing, newspaper clippings and help from the Oakland Police Department, FBI and Department of Justice, Ms Alequin, a 63-year-old Oakland resident, tracked her uncle down. Luis Albino He is now a retired firefighter and Marine Corps veteran, having served two tours in Vietnam.</p>

<p>In June, Mr Albino, now 79, was reunited with emotional family members, including his older brother, Roger, who died from cancer last month at the age of 82. The brothers shared a heartwarming reunion before Mr Roger's death, with Alida Alequin describing the moment, “They grabbed each other and had a really tight, long hug. They sat down and just talked."</p>

<p>Ms search began in 2020 when she casually took an online DNA test. The results revealed a 22 per cent match with Albino, leading her to dig deeper into family history. Along with her daughters, Ms Alequin sifted through newspaper archives and microfilm at local libraries, ultimately finding pictures of Luis Albino that confirmed her suspicions. Her determination was key to solving the decades-old mystery.</p>

<p>Mr Albino recalls parts of his abduction and journey to the East Coast but shared that those around him at the time refused to provide answers. Now, he prefers to keep some of his experiences private.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, their mother, who died in 2005 at the age of 92, never lived to see the mystery solved.</p>

<p>Ms Alequin described Roger's final days as peaceful. She said he "died happily" and was "at peace with himself, knowing his brother had been found."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the CEO of OpenAI, a leader in developing artificial intelligence (AI) tools, Sam Altman is no stranger to taking risks. In 2005, he made a career-defining decision by dropping out of Stanford to create Loopt, a location-based social networking app. This move ultimately led him to co-found OpenAI, the organization behind ChatGPT.</p>

<p>"It seemed like a really fun thing to try," the 39-year-old explained during an interview with students at his alma mater, John Burroughs School in the St. Louis area, as reported by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/17/openai-ceo-sam-altmans-his-no-1-strategy-for-living-without-regrets.html" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>CNBC Make It</em></a>. Altman noted that he was willing to take the risk because he could always return to his studies if entrepreneurship didn't pan out.</p>

<p>"That's the key to most risk, is most things are not a one-way door," Altman said. "You can try something, it doesn't work out, you can undo it, you can do something else." It's important to take the right risks but that doesn't mean that one should avoid taking them altogether, he added. "The risky thing is not to go try the things that might really work out" because regret can kick in, the OpenAI boss said. "You kind of look back at your career 10, 20, 30 years later and say, 'Man, I wish I had tried the thing I really wanted to try. You should just put a huge premium on doing that anytime you feel like you might say that later."</p>

<p>Mr Altman also encouraged students and young professionals to be open to deviating from a traditional path of going to college, getting a job and staying there "forever." He said that that might have been a guarantee of financial security for some people in previous generations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Now I think the traditional path is, I won't say falling apart, but it's quite challenged," he said. "And AI will probably disrupt things even more and put more variants in the traditional path."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday arrived in the United States for a crucial visit to present Kyiv's plan to end two and a half years of war with Russia.</p>

<p>Zelensky will present his proposals -- which he calls a "victory plan" -- to President Joe Biden, as well as presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The visit comes after a summer of intense fighting: with Moscow advancing fast in eastern Ukraine and Kyiv holding on to swathes of Russia's Kursk region.</p>

<p>It also comes as Kyiv has for weeks pressed the West to allow it to use long-range weapons to strike targets deep inside Russia -- so far to no avail.</p>

<p>When they meet at the White House on Thursday, Zelensky is expected to try to convince Biden to change his mind.</p>

<p>On the first leg of his US visit, Ukraine's president visited a factory in Pennsylvania on Sunday that produces badly needed 155mm artillery shells.</p>

<p>"I began my visit to the United States by expressing my gratitude to all the employees at the plant," Zelensky said Sunday in a post on X, formerly Twitter.</p>

<p>The post included photos of him shaking hands with workers at the plant, where he said production had been ramped up.</p>

<p>"It is in places like this where you can truly feel that the democratic world can prevail," he wrote.</p>

<p>He will next travel to New York and Washington.</p>

<p>Zelensky said the coming weeks would decide how more than 30 months of fighting that has killed thousands would end.</p>

<p>"It is now being determined what the legacy of the current generation of state leaders will be. Those in the highest offices," he said.</p>

<p>In comments before his trip, Zelensky said the United States and UK have not given Ukraine permission to use the long-range weapons as they fear escalation, but hinted he had not given up hope.</p>

<p>"We have had some decisions in the history of our relationship with Biden -- very interesting and difficult dialogues," Zelensky said earlier this week, adding: "He later changed his point of view."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moscow has said it considers such a go-ahead as NATO countries being "at war" with Russia.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>'Fair and stable peace'&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>A close adviser to Biden said this month that the US leader would use his remaining time in office to "put Ukraine in the best possible position to prevail."&nbsp;</p>

<p>No details on Ukraine's plan have been made public.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zelensky said Biden would be the first foreign leader to see the plan "in full" -- saying it will then also be presented to "all leaders of our partner countries."</p>

<p>Zelensky plans to present the proposals to the US Congress, Harris and Trump. The White House has said he will meet with Democratic Vice President Harris separately from Biden, and Zelensky has said he expects to meet with Republican Trump on Thursday or Friday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris has indicated she would continue Biden's policies on Ukraine, while Trump has been hugely critical of Washington's massive aid packages for Kyiv.</p>

<p>Zelensky said earlier this week that the plan envisages that "war will not return to us again in an even bigger wave" in years to come.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He has said Kyiv plans to hold meetings throughout autumn and that the "entire plan" will be ready by "early November."</p>

<p>The proposals, he told the media Friday, envisage "quick and concrete steps by our strategic partners."&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>'Clear place for Ukraine'&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>One of those steps, he said, is "related to strengthening Ukraine's weapons capabilities" while another demands a "clear place for Ukraine in the world's security architecture".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zelensky has also said he plans to invite Russia to a possible second international peace summit in November.</p>

<p>But Moscow this weekend said it would not attend and referred to President Vladimir Putin's conditions to enter talks: that Ukraine surrender four of its regions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I think both are still betting on the possibility of a military victory," UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres told CNN Sunday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Russian attacks on Ukraine killed six people -- including two children -- this weekend, while a strike on the city of Kharkiv wounded 21 people in a residential neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Ukraine said it struck two arms depots in Russia, with Kyiv's army saying it hit a key ammunition storage base important to the Russian army's logistics for its invasion.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX plans to launch about five uncrewed Starship missions to Mars in two years, CEO Elon Musk said on Sunday in a post on social media platform X.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Musk had said that the first Starships to Mars would launch in two years "when the next Earth-Mars transfer window opens."</p>

<p>On Sunday, the CEO said that the first crewed mission timeline would depend upon the success of the uncrewed flights. If the uncrewed missions land safely, crewed missions will be launched in four years. However, in case of challenges, crewed missions will be postponed by another two years, Musk said.</p>

<p>Musk, known for providing changing timelines on Starship's readiness, said earlier this year that the first uncrewed starship to land on Mars would be within five years, with the first people landing on Mars within seven years.</p>

<p>In June, a Starship rocket survived a fiery, hypersonic return from space and achieved a breakthrough landing demonstration in the Indian Ocean, completing a full test mission around the globe on the rocket's fourth try.</p>

<p>Musk is counting on Starship to fulfil his goal of producing a large, multipurpose next-generation spacecraft capable of sending people and cargo to the moon later this decade, and ultimately flying to Mars.</p>

<p>NASA earlier this year delayed Artemis 3 mission and its first crewed moon landing in half a century using SpaceX's Starship, to September 2026. It was previously planned for late 2025, NASA said.</p>

<p>Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa in June cancelled a private mission around the moon he had paid for, which was to have used SpaceX's Starship, citing schedule uncertainties in the rocket's development.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Notably, India has long weighed for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict.</p>

<p>PM Modi was one of the first global leaders to condemn the horrific terror attack on Israel by Hamas on October 7, but India has repeatedly expressed concerns over the deteriorating situation in Gaza.</p>

<p>India also sent humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza as part of its commitment. In July, India released the first instalment of 2.5 million dollars to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, for Palestine refugees for the year 2024-25.</p>

<p>Prior to this, PM Modi also held bilateral meetings with Nepali Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and Kuwait Crown Prince Sheikh Sabah Khaled Al-Hamad Al-Mubarak Al-Sabah.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Modi interacted with the top tech leaders and CEOs of the USA, in a Roundtable hosted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) School of Engineering, in New York today.</p>

<p>PM Modi emphasized India's growth prospects and discussed initiatives to foster collaborations and innovation across diverse sectors, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal stated.</p>

<p>PM Modi arrived in New York in the second leg of his three-day visit to the United States. On Saturday, PM Modi took part in the Quad Summit and held bilateral meetings with US President Joe Biden, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister addressed a huge gathering of the Indian diaspora at the Nassau Coliseum in New York on Sunday.</p>

<p>He will also address the 'Summit of the Future' at the UN General Assembly in New York today.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a bilateral meeting with Kuwait Crown Prince, Sheikh Sabah Khaled Al-Hamad Al-Sabah Al-Sabah, in New York on Sunday (local time).</p>

<p>Prior to this, PM Modi also held a bilateral meeting with Nepali Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli.</p>

<p>"The meeting was very good," PM Oli told ANI after his meeting with PM Modi.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar met Kuwait's Foreign Minister Abdullah Ali Al-Yahya and discussed strengthening India-Kuwait bilateral relations.</p>

<p>India and Kuwait enjoy traditionally friendly relations, which are rooted in history and have stood the test of time. India has been a natural trading partner of Kuwait and until 1961, Indian Rupee was a legal tender in Kuwait.</p>

<p>The year 2021-22 marked the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p>

<p>India was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with Kuwait following its independence from British Protectorate in 1961. Prior to the establishment of diplomatic relations, India was represented by a Trade Commissioner.</p>

<p>India's trade with Kuwait has seen a surge, with Indian exports to the Gulf nation reaching USD 2.10 billion in the fiscal year 2023-24, as per the official data by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.</p>

<p>PM Modi arrived in New York in the second leg of his three-day visit to the United States. On Saturday, PM Modi took part in the Quad Summit and held bilateral meetings with US President Joe Biden, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.</p>

<p>Quad has emerged as a key group of like-minded countries to work for peace, progress and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<p>PM Modi and President Biden reviewed and identified new pathways to further deepen the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership.</p>

<p>PM Modi interacted with important American business leaders, who are the key stakeholders, and provide vibrancy to the unique partnership between the largest and the oldest democracies of the world. He will also address the Summit of the Future at the UN General Assembly in New York.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

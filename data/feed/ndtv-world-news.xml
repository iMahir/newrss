       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dozens of residents from the Russian border region of Kursk have been returned to Russia from Ukraine following rare and "painstaking" talks between Moscow and Kyiv, Moscow said Friday.</p>

<p>Kyiv launched a major ground offensive into the Kursk region in August, capturing large swathes of Russian territory home to thousands of civilians.</p>

<p>It was not clear why the residents had been transported into Ukraine, and there was no immediate comment from Kyiv.</p>

<p>"Today, 46 residents of the Kursk region returned to Russia from Ukraine as a result of a negotiation process with the Ukrainian side," Russian human rights ombudsman Tatiana Moskalkova said.</p>

<p>The residents were all from the Sudzhansky district, home to the border town of Sudzha which Ukraine captured shortly after launching its offensive, according to local governor Alexei Smirnov.</p>

<p>"The painstaking and lengthy negotiations to return our fellow countrymen to their homeland have brought results," he said on Telegram.</p>

<p>The residents included 12 children and were returned via Belarus, with all of them being given "all necessary assistance", he added.</p>

<p>One of the children being returned in the deal was three-year-old Darina, her mother, Anastasia Gridina, told AFP.</p>

<p>"They are already on the way. In four hours I will meet Darina," she said.</p>

<p>Gridina had gone to Moscow for temporary work, leaving her daughter with her grandmother in the Kursk region village of Lebedevka when Ukraine launched its shock offensive.</p>

<p>In October she told AFP she had been pleading for help "everywhere," even writing a personal letter to President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>At one point she tried to cross the front line herself, but was forced to turn back.</p>

<p>The deal comes at a tense moment in the Ukraine conflict, with Kyiv firing British and US-supplied long-range missiles into Russia and Moscow firing a hypersonic missile at its neighbour.</p>

<p>The limited return of civilians, as well as exchanges of captured soldiers and bodies of killed fighters have become the only areas of co-operation between the two sides, which have been fighting since Moscow launched its full-scale offensive in February 2022.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Astronomers have spotted orbiting around a young star a newborn planet that took only 3 million years to form - quite swift in cosmic terms - in a discovery that challenges the current understanding of the speed of planetary formation.</p>

<p>This infant world, estimated at around 10 to 20 times the mass of Earth, is one of the youngest planets beyond our solar system - called exoplanets - ever discovered. It resides alongside the remnants of the disk of dense gas and dust circling the host star - called a protoplanetary disk - that provided the ingredients for the planet to form.</p>

<p>The star it orbits is expected to become a stellar type called an orange dwarf, less hot and less massive than our sun. The star's mass is about 70% that of the sun and it is about half as luminous. It is located in our Milky Way galaxy about 520 light-years from Earth. A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).</p>

<p>"This discovery confirms that planets can be in a cohesive form within 3 million years, which was previously unclear as Earth took 10 to 20 million years to form," said Madyson Barber, a graduate student in the department of physics and astronomy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and lead author of the study published this week in the journal Nature.</p>

<p>"We don't really know how long it takes for planets to form," UNC astrophysicist and study co-author Andrew Mann added. "We know that giant planets must form faster than their disk dissipates because they need a lot of gas from the disk. But disks take 5 to 10 million years to dissipate. So do planets form in 1 million years? 5? 10?"</p>

<p>The planet, given the names IRAS 04125+2902 b and TIDYE-1b, orbits its star every 8.8 days at a distance about one-fifth that separating our solar system's innermost planet Mercury from the sun. Its mass is in between that of Earth, the largest of our solar system's rocky planets, and Neptune, the smallest of the gas planets. It is less dense than Earth and has a diameter about 11 times greater. Its chemical composition is not known.</p>

<p>The researchers suspect that the planet formed further away from its star and then migrated inward.</p>

<p>"Forming large planets close to the star is difficult because the protoplanetary disk dissipates away from closest to the star the fastest, meaning there's not enough material to form a large planet that close that quickly," Barber said.</p>

<p>The researchers detected it using what is called the "transit" method, observing a dip in the host star's brightness when the planet passes in front of it, from the perspective of a viewer on Earth. It was found by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS, space telescope.</p>

<p>"This is the youngest-known transiting planet. It is on par with the youngest planets known," Barber said.</p>

<p>Exoplanets not detected using this method sometimes are directly imaged using telescopes. But these typically are massive ones, around 10 times greater than our solar system's largest planet Jupiter.</p>

<p>Stars and planets form from clouds of interstellar gas and dust.</p>

<p>"To form a star-planet system, the cloud of gas and dust will collapse and spin into a flat environment, with the star at the center and the disk surrounding it. Planets will form in that disk. The disk will then dissipate starting from the inner region near the star," Barber said.</p>

<p>"It was previously thought that we wouldn't be able to find a transiting planet this young because the disk would be in the way. But for some reason that we aren't sure of, the outer disk is warped, leaving a perfect window to the star and allowing us to detect the transit," Barber added.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said Thursday it had launched a joint investigation with its French counterparts into "suspected bribery and corruption" at the France-based multinational defence giant Thales.</p>

<p>"Investigators from the SFO and French authority Parquet National Financier (PNF) have informed the company of the investigation," it said, noting the two agencies were probing "in their respective jurisdictions".</p>

<p>Thales has its headquarters in Paris. Thales UK is a subsidiary and one of the British government's key defence contractors, employing over 7,000 staff at 16 sites across the country.</p>

<p>It built hundreds of lightweight missiles which the UK sent to Ukraine in September.</p>

<p>A Thales spokesperson confirmed that the SFO and the PNF had "commenced an investigation in relation to four of its entities in France and the UK".</p>

<p>"Thales is co-operating with the PNF in France and the SFO in the UK. The group complies with all national and international regulations.</p>

<p>"As the investigation is ongoing, Thales will not comment further."</p>

<p>The SFO announcement follows police in France, the Netherlands and Spain searching the multinational's offices in June, over suspicions of corruption linked to arms sales, according to reports.</p>

<p>SFO director Nick Ephgrave said he hoped the joint probe would reinforce the SFO's and PNF's "long-standing relationship, built on mutual cooperation and shared success".</p>

<p>"We will together rigorously pursue every avenue in our investigation into these serious allegations," he added in a statement, which did not provide any further details about the accusations.</p>

<p>The SFO is a specialist prosecuting authority tackling top level serious or complex fraud, bribery and corruption, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Thales specialises in defence electronics, and built the 650 so-called Lightweight Multirole Missiles (LMMs) that the UK announced it would supply to Ukraine in September, costing 162 million Pounds ($204 million).</p>

<p>The firm also won a 1.8-billion Pound UK defence contract in February, which will see it maintain the Royal Navy's fleet of ships and submarines for the next 15 years.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The British government indicated on Friday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be arrested on an International Criminal Court arrest warrant if he travelled to the UK.</p>

<p>The ICC on Thursday issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and ex-defence minister Yoav Gallant in response to accusations of crimes against humanity and war crimes in Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza, triggered by the militant Palestinian group's October 7, 2023 attack.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesman refused to be drawn specifically on whether UK police would detain Netanyahu, telling reporters he would not "get into hypotheticals in relation to individual cases".</p>

<p>But he added: "The UK will always comply with its legal obligations as set out by domestic law and indeed international law."</p>

<p>Britain signed the Rome Statute, the international treaty that created the ICC, in 1998 and ratified it three years later.</p>

<p>The UK's ICC Act 2001 stipulates that when a government minister receives a request from the ICC for the arrest of an indictee they "shall transmit the request and the documents accompanying it" to an appropriate court.</p>

<p>"If the request is accompanied by a warrant of arrest and the appropriate judicial officer is satisfied that the warrant appears to have been issued by the ICC, he shall endorse the warrant for execution in the United Kingdom," the act adds.</p>

<p>Officials say the act has not yet been used because someone charged by the ICC has never visited Britain.</p>

<p>It is not clear whether the UK court process begins after the ICC issues the arrest or once the indicted person lands on British soil.</p>

<p>"We would obviously fulfil our obligations under the act," added Starmer's spokesman.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A court in southeast France on Friday sentenced to 20 years in jail a man who for years raped his teenage daughter and offered her up to strangers for sex.</p>

<p>The case echoed the ongoing high-profile trial that has shocked the nation in which 51 men are accused of raping Gisele Pelicot, drugged by her husband so he could invite strangers to their home to abuse her.</p>

<p>The 38-year-old father was convicted by the court in the southeastern Var region of forcing sexual acts on his daughter from the age of 13.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Estelle Bois described how the father exercised total control over the young girl, his adoptive daughter.</p>

<p>He also brought her to other men, many of them much older, who he contacted through online classified ads.</p>

<p>The father claimed to the other men that he and his daughter were both consenting adults living out a sexual fantasy. But he was convicted and sentenced to the maximum 20 years in prison, in line with the demands of the prosecutors.</p>

<p>Some of the defendants in the Pelicot case have claimed that they were given that same impression by the victim's then-husband, Dominique Pelicot.</p>

<p>Also like Dominique Pelicot, the father in Friday's case directed, participated in and filmed the sex acts involving his daughter, who was blindfolded during the encounters.</p>

<p>He admitted to the accusations, but claimed in court that he had a loving relationship with the young girl and had responded to her initiating sexual contact.</p>

<p>"This is not about love, but about power and domination. He doesn't love (his daughter), he loves having total control over her, her belonging to him, her obeying him," prosecutor Bois said.</p>

<p>She also asked judges to jail for 16 years a second defendant, the only one of the other men to have abused the girl who could be identified.</p>

<p>As in the Pelicot case, the second defendant - a man his 60s with six children - was identified thanks to the photo and video documentation by the father of the abuse, this time via geolocation data.</p>

<p>The second defendant told the court that he had been taken in by the father's claim that the girl was consenting in three of his four meetings with them.</p>

<p>In the fourth, "things went badly. Rather than acting like a responsible man, he followed through on his own pleasure and closed his eyes" to the abuse, his lawyer Christophe Mairet said.</p>

<p>Now aged 18, the girl was accompanied in court by a golden retriever trained to comfort victims of abuse.</p>

<p>She had, like Gisele Pelicot, declined the option of the trial being held behind closed doors.</p>

<p>It was the teenager, then aged 15, who put a stop to her own abuse in 2021 by fleeing after her father's violence and humiliation escalated.</p>

<p>She ran from their home in Cavalaire-sur-mer, south of glitzy resort town Saint-Tropez, before being brought to police by a holidaymaker.</p>

<p>Her father had bombarded her phone with calls and texts throughout her escape.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before Bruce Willis' diagnosis with aphasia and later frontotemporal dementia (FTD), his wife Emma Heming Willis noticed subtle changes in his speech. However, she initially attributed these changes to his lifelong struggle with a severe stutter.</p>

<p>People with FTD can live with the disease but there's no cure.</p>

<p>Willis' family announced in 2022 that the "Die Hard" star would retire from acting due to a cognitive disorder. A year later, they revealed that he had been diagnosed with FTD, a rare condition affecting approximately 50,000 to 60,000 Americans.</p>

<p>"For Bruce, it started with language," Heming Willis shared in a recent interview with Town and Country. But she said those shifts in his speech did not alarm her because he used to stutter as a teen.</p>

<p>Willis' stutter was so severe that it took him three minutes to complete a sentence. However, when he became another character in a play, his stutter disappeared. "Yet, when I became another character, in a play, I lost the stutter. It was phenomenal" he says in 'Bruce Willis: The Unauthorized Biography'. This discovery propelled him into acting.</p>

<p>Heming Willis reflected on how Willis' stutter affected his early life and career. "Bruce has always had a stutter, but he has been good at covering it up. As his language started changing, it seemed like it was just a part of a stutter, it was just Bruce."</p>

<p>She admitted that she never suspected that the changes in his speech could be a sign of dementia, especially given his relatively young age.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Demi Moore is basking in the success of The Substance and according to Radar Online, a family insider claimed, "They're worried Demi is working too much and want her home with them and Bruce. It's not like Demi needs the money."</p>

<p>She opened up about Willis and his struggles on October 13th when she was awarded the Career Achievement in Acting Award at the 2024 Hamptons International Film Festival. She said, "The disease is what the disease is. And I think you have to be in real deep acceptance of what that is. But for where he's at, he is stable."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The British government indicated on Friday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be arrested on an International Criminal Court arrest warrant if he travelled to the UK.</p>

<p>The ICC on Thursday issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and ex-defence minister Yoav Gallant in response to accusations of crimes against humanity and war crimes in Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza, triggered by the Palestinian group's October 7, 2023 attack.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesman refused to be drawn specifically on whether UK police would detain Netanyahu, telling reporters he would not "get into hypotheticals in relation to individual cases".</p>

<p>But he added: "The UK will always comply with its legal obligations as set out by domestic law and indeed international law."</p>

<p>Britain signed the Rome Statute, the international treaty that created the ICC, in 1998 and ratified it three years later.</p>

<p>The UK's ICC Act 2001 stipulates that when a government minister receives a request from the ICC for the arrest of an indictee they "shall transmit the request and the documents accompanying it" to an appropriate court.</p>

<p>"If the request is accompanied by a warrant of arrest and the appropriate judicial officer is satisfied that the warrant appears to have been issued by the ICC, he shall endorse the warrant for execution in the United Kingdom," the act adds.</p>

<p>Officials say the act has not yet been used because someone charged by the ICC has never visited Britain.</p>

<p>It is not clear whether the UK court process begins after the ICC issues the arrest or once the indicted person lands on British soil.</p>

<p>"We would obviously fulfil our obligations under the act," added Starmer's spokesman.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sweden will not be intimidated by Russia's provocations, Defence Minister Pal Jonson said Friday after President Vladimir Putin hinted at strikes on Western countries supplying weapons to Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Swedish minister's remarks came as he announced "substantial funding" to Ukraine for the procurement of long-range missiles and drones.</p>

<p>"The Russian escalation and provocation that we've been noticing recently is an attempt to scare us from supporting Ukraine, and that will fail. This will not happen," Jonson told reporters at a joint press conference in Stockholm with his Ukrainian counterpart Rustem Umerov.</p>

<p>"Supporting Ukraine is both the right thing to do and it's a smart thing to do, and it's an investment into our own security, because (Ukraine's) security is also our security," he said.</p>

<p>"Ukraine has the full right, in accordance with international law, to defend itself inside and outside of its territory, and we're glad if we can further develop both your capability to produce long-range missiles and also long-range strike drones," Jonson told Umerov.</p>

<p>Putin said Thursday that the conflict in Ukraine had characteristics of a "global" war, criticising Ukraine's allies for granting permission for Kyiv to use Western-supplied weapons to strike targets on Russian territory.</p>

<p>In recent days Ukraine has fired US and UK-supplied missiles at Russian territory for the first time, escalating already sky-high tensions in the nearly three-year-long conflict.</p>

<p>"We consider ourselves entitled to use our weapons against the military facilities of those countries that allow their weapons to be used against our facilities," Putin said.&nbsp;<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five years after a massive fire engulfed the centuries-old Notre-Dame de Paris and toppled its iconic spire, leaving a gaping hole in the heart of Paris while the world watched helplessly, the Catholic cathedral has been restored to its former glory and is set to reopen next month amid grand celebrations.</p>

<p>X boss Elon Musk, in a post on the micro-blogging site, provided a glimpse into the gothic monument that, several reports claimed, has been rebuilt with the help of hundreds of specialist artisans and millions of donations.</p>

<p>"Notre-Dame has been restored," Musk said on X, as he shared a 94-minute clip of the renovated cathedral that is set to reopen on December 7.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Notre-Dame has been restored!<br />
<a href="https://t.co/g7RKQDHRlr">pic.twitter.com/g7RKQDHRlr</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>A report by the National Geographic said everything has been spruced up - the frescoes, checked floor and the bells - which have been removed from the belfry, cleaned of lead dust, and restored at the Norman foundry where they were first cast - among others. A high-tech new lighting system will also contribute to the effect.</p>

<p>According to Forbes, the renovation was carried out at a cost of around 500 million euros.</p>

<p>"A surplus of about 140 million euros will be used for future preservation work on the 861-year-old building," Philippe Jost, who has overseen the project, told Forbes.</p>

<p>An AFP report said before the fire, Notre-Dame was among the most visited buildings in Europe, with 14 to 15 million a year expected to visit once the cathedral reopens next month.</p>

<p>On April 15, 2019, a fire broke out in the attic, beneath the cathedral's roof, causing severe damages to the wooden spire, which had collapsed, and the wooden roof, besides the cathedral's upper walls.</p>

<p>Several works of art and religious relics were moved to safety but others suffered smoke damage. Some of the exterior art was also damaged or destroyed in the blaze. At least two police officers and one firefighter were injured as around 400 firefighters worked through the night, taking roughly around nine hours to extinguish the blaze.</p>

<p>According to the European Commission (a politically independent executive arm of the European Union), a large part of the cathedral roof and spire were made of lead, and some studies suggested that 150 kg of lead was spread during the fire. Others hinted that one tonne of lead must have fallen within one kilometre of the cathedral.</p>

<p>The exact cause of the fire could not be determined but French authorities claimed an electrical fault or a cigarette may have been responsible for the fire, according to Reuters.</p>

<p>Notre-Dame did not hold a Christmas mass in 2019, for the first time since 1803. French President Emmanuel Macron had announced a five-year plan to rebuild what was lost.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Continuing with his trend of picking loyalists, Donald Trump has made yet another nomination picking Pam Bondi as Attorney General. This came after Matt Gaetz withdrew his candidacy amid a deluge of allegations regarding sex trafficking and drug use.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">Pam Bondi wrote history in 2010 when she was elected as the first female attorney general of Florida. She had already spent more than 18 years as a prosecutor in the Hillsborough County State Attorney's Office; she rose to fame only after holding the state's principal legal officer position. In office, Bondi highlighted the issue of human trafficking and advocated for stricter laws on the matter. She also started a litigation in Florida against opioid manufacturers. She held the position for a period of 8 years, from 2011-2019.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">As a longtime ally of Trump, Bondi was present as one of his lawyers during his first impeachment trial when the latter was accused but not convicted of abusing his powers for allegedly pressuring the Ukraine president to investigate his Democrat rivals while withholding $400 million military assistance to the country.&nbsp;Bondi stood by Trump's claims of Joe Biden engaging in corruption along with son Hunter. Although the accusations have never been substantiated, her eagerness to support Trump gained her a principal spot at the Republican National Convention, the same year.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Bondi was entangled in a 16-month long custody battle over a dog called Master Tank who was rescued in Florida after Hurricane Katrina. She then adopted him and renamed him Noah. The Louisiana family that previously had him learned about his whereabouts in 2006.&nbsp;However, Bondi refused to give him back citing negligence by the earlier owners. "I took a dog who was a walking skeleton," she told St. Petersburg Times. "That's what was wrong with him before the hurricane." She added that if it had been a stable environment, she would have dropped the dog back herself. Subsequently the two sides settled before the trial with Bondi returning the dog.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Pam Bondi reinforced Trump's claims of election fraud in 2020 when Joe Biden won the presidential elections. a Fox News host asked her "Pam, did you just say fake ballots?" to which she responded saying, "There could be. That's the problem." Although she did not provide any evidence.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Trump and Bondi go back quite a few years. He said in a Truth Social post, "I have known Pam for many years -- She is smart and tough, and is an AMERICA FIRST Fighter, who will do a terrific job as Attorney General!" In 2013, Bondi received a $25,000 donation for her fundraising committee for her attorney general reelection campaign.&nbsp;During that time her office had a case that probed Trump and Trump University. Ultimately she did not join the lawsuit and moreover, both of them denied that the donation was the reason she was not part of the lawsuit.&nbsp;</li>

       <description><![CDATA[The new intermediate-range ballistic missile called Oreshnik used by Russia in a strike on Ukraine is a nuclear-capable weapon that has not been previously mentioned in public.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new intermediate-range ballistic missile called Oreshnik used by Russia in a strike on Ukraine is a nuclear-capable weapon that has not been previously mentioned in public.</p>

<p>In an unscheduled television appearance on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the strike on the city of Dnipro had tested in combat conditions "one of the newest Russian mid-range missile systems".</p>

<p>He said missile engineers had christened the missile Oreshnik, or hazel tree in Russian.</p>

<p>Putin said it had been deployed "in a non-nuclear hypersonic configuration" and said that the "test" had been successful and had hit its target.</p>

<p><strong>Speed</strong></p>

<p>Air defences cannot intercept the Oreshnik, which attacks at a speed of Mach 10, or 2.5-3 kilometres per second, Putin said.</p>

<p>Hypersonic missiles travel at speeds of at least Mach 5 -- five times the speed of sound -- and can manoeuvre mid-flight, making them harder to track and intercept.</p>

<p>"Modern air defence systems... cannot intercept such missiles. That's impossible," Putin said.</p>

<p>"As of today there are no means of counteracting such a weapon," the president boasted.</p>

<p><strong>Warheads</strong></p>

<p>The Oreshnik missile could have three to six warheads, military expert Viktor Baranets wrote in the Komsomolskaya Pravda tabloid.</p>

<p>Igor Korotchenko, editor of the Moscow-based National Defence journal, told TASS state news agency that based on video footage of the strike, Oreshnik has multiple independently guided warheads.</p>

<p>In this case they were conventional, but it could also carry nuclear warheads, military experts said.</p>

<p>The "practically simultaneous arrival of the warheads at the target" shows the system is "very effective", Korotchenko said, calling it a "masterpiece of modern Russian solid-fuel military missile construction".</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong></p>

<p>The missile was reported by Ukrainian media to have been fired from the Kapustin Yar range in the Astrakhan region, around 900 kilometres (550 miles) from Dnipro.</p>

<p>Putin described the missile in Russian as "medium-range" but Russian military experts said the English term would be "intermediate-range".</p>

<p>An intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) has a range of 1,000-5,500 kilometres, a level below that of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).</p>

<p>Military expert Ilya Kramnik told Izvestia newspaper that Oreshnik's range could be at the top end of intermediate, around 3,000 - 5,000 kilometres.</p>

<p>"In any case we witnessed the first combat use in history by Russia of an intermediate-range missile," Dmitry Kornev, editor of Military Russia website, told Izvestia.</p>

<p><strong>Origins</strong></p>

<p>The US Department of Defense described Oreshnik as an "experimental" missile based on Russia's RS-26 Rubezh ICBM.</p>

<p>Little is known about Rubezh, a modification of Topol ICBM.</p>

<p>TASS state news agency reported, citing a source, in 2018 that development of Rubezh was frozen under the state weapons programme up to 2027, to prioritise another system, Avangard.</p>

<p>Russian weapons expert Yan Matveyev wrote on Telegram that Oreshnik probably had two stages and would be "quite expensive", heavy and not mass-produced.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong></p>

<p>Its range means "Oreshnik can threaten practically all of Europe" but not the United States, weapons expert Pavel Podvig, director of the Russian Nuclear Forces Project, told Russian Telegram channel Ostorozhno Novosti.</p>

<p>The US and the Soviet Union in 1987 signed a treaty agreeing to give up all use of missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometres.</p>

<p>Both Washington and Moscow withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 2019, each accusing the other of violations.</p>

<p>Putin said Thursday that Russia will "address the question of further deployment of intermediate and shorter-range missiles based on the actions of the United States and its satellites".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The COP29 summit at Baku is ending, yet a draft text with a proposed figure for climate finance and emission reductions goals is elusive. The key goal of COP29 is to agree on how much money should be provided by developed countries to developing countries to help them deal with climate-induced weather disasters and changeover to cleaner energy systems.</p>

<p>An earlier pledge to provide $100 billion per year expires in 2025. At the Baku summit, delegates were to decide on a 10-fold increase in financial flows to at least $1 trillion annually from 2026.</p>

<p>The proposed figures on finance, called NCQG (New Collective Quantified Goal), will sum up cooperation on three issues - quantity, quality, and contributors.</p>

<p><strong>Sticking Points</strong></p>

<p>According to developing countries including India, developed countries are pushing for higher reduction goals without a financial commitment.</p>

<p>One of the major disagreements between developed and developing nations is over the balance between emission reduction and climate finance. The argument from developing countries is that they should not be forced to commit stringent mitigation goals without enough money on the table to address climate change.</p>

<p>The developed countries are keen to expand their contributor base to include emerging economies, which has been opposed by the developing countries as a violation of the 2015 Paris Agreement.</p>

<p>Developing countries, including India and China, have repeatedly demanded $1.3 trillion from the national budgets of the rich developed countries. They have maintained that this money is a legal obligation under the Paris Agreement, and not charity.</p>

<p>The $1.3 trillion amount is based on cost estimates by the Independent High-Level Expert Group on Climate Finance, a new body appointed by the United Nations, for developing and deploying technology that would keep the global temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), compared to the pre-industrial average.</p>

<p>The source of the hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of funds that developing countries say they require to adapt to a fast-changing climate, is also a subject of contention. Whether the money will come from governments, multilateral banks, or the private sector has become a flashpoint in the summit.</p>

<p>Developed nations have been silent on the amount so far, but have been vocal in supporting a multi-layered approach to financing climate action, including support from public and private funds.</p>

<p><strong>Tussle Over Source Of Funding</strong></p>

<p>The developing countries, particularly those facing debt crises, have called for prioritising public finance over private finance, raising concerns about accessibility and adequacy of market-based mechanisms.</p>

<p>Until now, a major portion of previous climate fundings have been in the form of high interest loans where the receiver country has had to then pay interest on the principal amount. This type of funding places the burden on the financial health of the recipients, who are mostly the least developed countries.</p>

<p>At COP29, the least developed countries, especially from Africa, have highlighted their vulnerabilities to climate-induced disasters like drought, food shortage, water scarcity, and displacement, and the high cost their countries are paying to meet the challenges year-on-year.</p>

<p>This year, the delegates from developing and least developed countries have voiced apprehensions about relying on market-based fundings for meeting their climate challenges. They have also flagged the need for clear and transparent mechanisms that can track and account flow of climate finance.</p>

<p>Bolivian representative Diego Pacheco, speaking on behalf of Like-Minded Developing Countries, said developed countries are trying to shift their own responsibility on to developing countries, which is in violation of the Paris Agreement and not acceptable. India and China are part of this group.</p>

<p><strong>What's Worrying Developed Countries</strong></p>

<p>Also complicating the talks is the demand by developed nations to include China and Saudi Arabia among their ranks, thus becoming donor countries liable for financial contributions. Developed countries are upset about China being bracketed in the developing country category.</p>

<p>The financing question has become even more tricky with Donald Trump's election victory in the US. The world's biggest economy and history's biggest emitter, is expected to withdraw from the Paris Agreement when Trump takes office, which means the country would very likely default on whatever financial commitments the final agreement sets out. This will hugely impact climate funding.</p>

<p><strong>The Way Out</strong></p>

<p>With little progress in the first week of COP29, the Azerbaijani presidency gave the responsibility to a pair of ministers from developed and developing countries to take the negotiations further. Egypt and Australia were told to hold discussions on the structure, contributors, and overall "quantum" of the new finance goal.</p>

<p>Ministers from Norway and South Africa were tasked with shaping the outcome on emission reduction goals. These two factors - the basic formulation of a reduction plan (how countries would make climate commitment to meet Paris Agreement goals) and the new finance goal - are the main reasons for the near-collapse of talks in Baku.</p>

<p>The only significant takeaway until now has been the inclusion of tourism in the action agenda of the UN Climate Change Conference, with more than 50 governments endorsing the COP29 Declaration. The aim is to support the tourism sector, a key economic driver, in adopting sustainable practices to reduce its environmental impact.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>London's Gatwick Airport today evacuated people from a large part of the airport over a security threat, the airport authorities said in a post on social media website X. It said that passengers will not be allowed to enter the section of the airport till the incident is addressed.</p>

<p>"A large part of the South Terminal has been evacuated as a precaution while we continue to investigate a security incident," the airport management said.</p>

<p>It further stated that the part of the airport which is affected due to this is "a large part of the South Terminal", adding that "We continue to investigate a security incident."</p>

<p>Requesting passengers to cooperate and remain calm, the airport authority said, "Safety and security of our passengers and staff remains our top priority. We are working hard to resolve the issue as quickly as possible."</p>

<h2><strong>LONDON ON ALERT</strong></h2>

<p>The police in London are on high alert after a suspicious package outside the US Embassy in the city. The police had to carry out a controlled explosion to tackle the situation.</p>

<p>London's Metropolitan Police carried out the controlled explosion after evacuating the area and setting up cordons near the site. The US Embassy is located near Nine Elms, just south of the River Thames.</p>

<p>After the controlled explosion was conducted successfully, the police released a statement on social media website X saying "</p>

<p>"We can confirm that the 'loud bang' reported in the area a short time ago was a controlled explosion carried out by officers. Enquiries are still ongoing and cordons will remain in place for the time being."</p>

<p>The US Embassy in London also shared an update on X saying that an investigation over "a suspicious package" is currently being carried out, and that the area around the embassy and roads leading to it have been closed till further notice "out of an abundance of caution".<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK police said Friday officers had carried out a controlled explosion after a suspicious package which turned out to be a "hoax device" was found outside the United States embassy in London.</p>

<p>The capital's Metropolitan Police force conducted the explosion after setting up cordons near the high-security site in Nine Elms, just south of the River Thames.</p>

<p>"We can confirm that the 'loud bang' reported in the area a short time ago was a controlled explosion carried out by officers," the force said in a post on X.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We're aware of speculation online about an incident in the vicinity of the US Embassy in Nine Elms.<br />
<br />
Cordons are in place in the area as a precaution while officers investigate a suspect package.<br />
<br />
We will provide a further update in due course.</p>
— Metropolitan Police (@metpoliceuk) <a href="https://twitter.com/metpoliceuk/status/1859895814459695433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>"Initial indications are that the item was a hoax device," it added.</p>

<p>The US embassy said earlier in a post on the same platform that local authorities were investigating "a suspicious package" outside the building.</p>

<p>It added that police had closed a nearby road "out of an abundance of caution".</p>

<p>In another sign that UK authorities were on high alert, Gatwick Airport said a "large part" of its south terminal had been evacuated while a "security incident" was investigated.</p>

<p>The building was closed for more than four hours before the airport released a statement at around 1445 GMT stating that the "south terminal is reopening to staff and will be open to passengers shortly".</p>

<p>"The earlier security alert has now been resolved and cleared by police," it said.</p>

<p>Police earlier deployed a bomb disposal unit as a precaution after the "discovery of a suspected prohibited item in luggage".</p>

<p>A number of flights to and from the south terminal were cancelled, including at least 16 departures and 13 arrivals by British Airways.</p>

<p>Other flights continued to depart but were only carrying passengers who had passed through security before the evacuation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Iraq to Afghanistan to the US, basic freedoms for women are being eroded as governments start rolling back existing laws.</p>

<p>Just a few months ago a ban on Afghan <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20rq73p3z4o">women speaking in public</a> was the latest measure introduced by the Taliban, who took back control of the country in 2021. From August the ban included singing, reading aloud, reciting poetry and even laughing outside their homes.</p>

<p>The Taliban's ministry for the propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice, which implements one of the most radical interpretations of Islamic law, enforces these rules. They are part of a broader set of <a href="https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2024/09/27/afghan-women-taliban-human-rights">“vice and virtue”</a> laws that severely restrict women's rights and freedoms. Women are even banned <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/afghan-women-cannot-pray-loudly-recite-front-women-says-taliban-minist-rcna177990">from reading the Quran</a> out loud to other women in public.</p>

<p>In the past three years in Afghanistan, the Taliban has taken away many basic rights from women who live there, so that there's very little that they are allowed to do.</p>

<p>From 2021, <a href="https://www.usip.org/tracking-talibans-Mistreatment-women">the Taliban started</a> introducing restrictions on girls receiving education, starting with a ban on coeducation and then a ban on girls attending secondary schools. This was followed by closing blind girls' schools in 2023, and making it mandatory for girls in grades four to six (ages nine to 12) to cover their faces on the way to school.</p>

<p>Women can no longer attend universities or receive a degree certificate nationally, or follow midwifery or nursing training in the Kandahar region. <a href="https://www.usip.org/tracking-talibans-Mistreatment-women">Women are no longer allowed</a> to be flight attendants, or to take a job outside the home. Women-run bakeries in the capital Kabul have now been banned. Women are mostly now unable to earn any money, or leave their homes. In April 2024, the Taliban in Helmand province told media outlets to even refrain from airing women's voices.</p>

<p>Afghanistan is ranked last on the <a href="https://giwps.georgetown.edu/the-index/">Women, Peace and Security Index</a> and officials at the UN and elsewhere have called it <a href="https://www.passblue.com/2023/06/21/the-gender-apartheid-happening-in-afghanistan-un-experts-say-should-be-labeled-an-international-crime/">“gender apartheid”</a>. Afghan women are putting their lives on the line — facing surveillance, harassment, assault, arbitrary detention, torture and exile — to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7hgYu43Krk">protest against</a> the Taliban.</p>

<p>Many diplomats discuss how important it is to <a href="https://press.un.org/en/2022/sc15038.doc.htm">“engage”</a> with the Taliban, yet this has not stopped the assault on women's rights. When diplomats “engage”, they tend to focus on counter-terrorism, counternarcotics, business deals, or <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/04/05/taliban-afghanistan-hostage-diplomacy-western-prisoners/">hostage</a> returns. Despite everything that has happened to Afghan women <a href="https://asiapacific.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2023/09/summary-report-of-country-wide-womens-consultations">over a short period</a>, critics suggest this rarely makes it onto diplomats' priority list.</p>

<h2>Iraq's age of consent</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, in Iraq, on August 4 2024, an amendment to Iraq's 1959 personal status law which would possibly lower the age of consent for marriage <a href="https://time.com/7011752/proposed-bill-amendment-iraq-could-allow-girls-as-young-as-nine-to-marry/">to nine years old</a> from 18 (or 15 with permission from a judge and parents) was proposed by member of parliament Ra'ad al-Maliki and supported by conservative Shia factions in the government.</p>

<p>The law would have the potential of having matters of family law – such as marriage – adjudicated by religious authorities. This change could not only legalise child marriage but also strip women of rights related to divorce, child custody and inheritance.</p>

<p>Iraq already has a high rate of <a href="https://www.girlsnotbrides.org/learning-resources/child-marriage-atlas/atlas/iraq/#:%7E:text=Minimum%20legal%20age%20of%20marriage%20below%2018%20years,-What's%20the%20prevalence&amp;text=28%25%20of%20girls%20in%20Iraq,%2C%20Muthana%20(27%25).">underage marriage</a>, with 7% of girls married by 15 years old, and <a href="https://www.girlsnotbrides.org/learning-resources/child-marriage-atlas/atlas/iraq/#:%7E:text=Minimum%20legal%20age%20of%20marriage%20below%2018%20years,-What's%20the%20prevalence&amp;text=28%25%20of%20girls%20in%20Iraq,%2C%20Muthana%20(27%25).">28%</a> married before the legal age of 18.</p>

<p>Unregistered marriages, not legally recorded in court but conducted through religious or tribal authorities, <a href="https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00K2Z4.pdf">prevent girls from accessing civil rights</a>, and leave women and girls vulnerable to exploitation, abuse and neglect, with limited options for seeking justice.</p>

<p>Many women's groups have already <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/aug/09/proposed-iraqi-law-change-would-legalise-child-say-activists">mobilised against the law</a>. But the amendment has <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/10/iraq-reject-changes-to-personal-status-law-which-would-allow-child-marriage-and-further-entrench-discrimination/">passed its second reading</a> in parliament. If introduced, it could pave the way for further modifications that deepen sectarian divides and move the country further away from a unified legal system. It would also be an especially troubling step backward in protecting children's rights and gender equality.</p>

<h2>Abortion rights in the US</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, in the US, women's access to abortion has been eroded significantly in the past few years. In late 2021, the US was officially labelled a <a href="https://msmagazine.com/backsliding-democracies/">backsliding democracy</a> by an international thinktank.</p>

<p>Six months later, the landmark US Supreme Court ruling of Roe v Wade, which had safeguarded the constitutional right to abortion for nearly 50 years, was overturned. This led to a cascade of restrictive laws, with more than a quarter of US states enacting outright bans or <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/maps/abortion-laws-by-state/">severe restrictions on abortion</a>.</p>

<p>Republican US congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene suggested, in May 2022, that women should stay celibate if they did not <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-celibacy-abortion-dont-have-sex-1707684">want to get pregnant</a>. If only all women had that choice. In fact, in the US a sexual assault occurs <a href="https://rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence">every 68 seconds</a>. One in every five American women has been the victim of <a href="https://www.nsvrc.org/statistics">an attempted or completed rape</a>. From 2009-13, US Child Protective Services agencies found strong evidence indicating that <a href="https://paar.net/child-family-services/statistics/">63,000 children per year were victims of sexual abuse</a>.</p>

<p>These developments reflect a troubling pattern. There is evidence from Donald Trump's first term that there could be further erosion of women's rights in his second presidency. During his previous term there were significant <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-a-second-trump-presidency-is-likely-to-threaten-abortion-rights-and-womens-healthcare-globally-243346">attempts to weaken healthcare access</a>, with his foreign policy reinstating the <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2020/04/unprecedented-expansion-global-gag-rule-trampling-rights-health-and-free-speech">“global gag rule”</a> restricting access to women's reproductive healthcare worldwide via funding conditions.</p>

<h2>Fragility of women's rights</h2>

<p>If the world can tolerate the Taliban's abuses, Iraq's restrictive laws and the US restrictions on abortion access, it reveals the fragility of women's and girls' rights globally, and how easy it is to take them away.</p>

<p>The UN agency, UN Women, says it could take another <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/sites/default/files/2022-09/Progress-on-the-sustainable-development-goals-the-gender-snapshot-2022-en_0.pdf">286 years</a> to close the global gender gaps in legal protections. <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/06/gender-backlash-underscores-urgency-achieve-substantive-equality-women-and">No country has yet achieved gender equality</a>, based on the gender pay gap, legal equality and <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/7625/gender-equality-worldwide/#topicOverview">social inequality</a> levels. Women and girls continue to face discrimination in all corners of the world, and it seems to be getting worse. But despite everything women <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNLvTBZD5AE">continue to resist</a>.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that an arrest warrant issued against him by the International Criminal Court over his conduct of the Gaza war would not stop him defending Israel.</p>

<p>"No outrageous anti-Israel decision will prevent us –- and it will not prevent me –- from continuing to defend our country in every way," Netanyahu said in a video statement. "We will not yield to pressure," he vowed.</p>

<p>The premier is accused alongside his former defence minister Yoav Gallant of "war crimes" and "crimes against humanity" for Israel's actions in Gaza.</p>

<p>He described Thursday's decision as a "dark day in the history of nations".</p>

<p>"The International Criminal Court in The Hague, which was established to protect humanity, has today become the enemy of humanity," he said, adding that the accusations were "utterly baseless".</p>

<p>Israel has been fighting in Gaza since October 2023, when a cross-border attack by Hamas militants resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Its retaliatory campaign has led to the deaths of 44,056 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry which the United Nations considers reliable.</p>

<p>UN agencies have warned of a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, including possible famine, due to a lack of food and medicines.</p>

<p>The court said it had found "reasonable grounds" to believe Netanyahu and Gallant bore "criminal responsibility" for the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare, as well as the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said the court was accusing Israel of "fictitious crimes", while ignoring "the real war crimes, horrific war crimes being committed against us and against many others around the world".</p>

<p>In addition to Netanyahu and Gallant, the court also issued an arrest warrant for Hamas military wing chief Mohammed Deif, who Israel said was killed in an air strike last July.</p>

<p>Hamas has never confirmed his death.</p>

<p>Netanyahu mocked the court's decision to issue a warrant for "the body of Mohammed Deif."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India is among the top ten countries in Artificial Intelligence (AI) readiness, and the country holds immense potential for public sector transformation through AI, according to a report.</p>

<p>"Readiness" for AI refers to an economy's ability to effectively implement and integrate AI. The report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) based on data from 73 economies showed that India ranks second globally in AI specialists, and third in research publications, with a strong base in AI-related patents.</p>

<p>On the other hand, over 70 per cent of the economies studied score below average in critical areas such as ecosystem participation, skills, and research and development.</p>

<p>"India's journey to becoming an AI contender underscores the nation's emphasis on integrating technology into high-priority sectors like agriculture, education, and healthcare. As one of the top 10 countries in AI readiness, India holds immense potential for public sector transformation through AI," said Saibal Chakraborty, India Leader, Technology and Digital Advantage Practice, BCG.</p>

<p>"India ranks second globally in AI specialists and 3rd in research publications, with a strong base in AI-related patents," he added.</p>

<p>The report further showed that AI exposure spans several key sectors in India. Business services account for 16 per cent of GDP and have significant AI exposure, with potential improvements in administrative efficiency for government operations.</p>

<p>Retail and wholesale make up 10 per cent of GDP, where AI could streamline public distribution and supply chain management, reducing wastage. Public services represent 6 per cent of GDP, with opportunities for AI to enhance service delivery and emergency response.</p>

<p>Agriculture, forestry, and fisheries contribute 17 per cent of GDP and could use AI in precision farming and risk assessment to boost productivity.</p>

<p>The construction sector, at 8 per cent of GDP, can utilise AI for infrastructure planning and asset maintenance. Arts, recreation, and personal services, also at 8 per cent, could benefit from AI in managing public facilities.</p>

<p>"Realising this potential requires a multi-faceted approach: strengthening infrastructure, enhancing AI research capabilities, and expanding workforce training. Investments in research hubs, cloud capabilities, and data systems are critical, alongside efforts to expand AI education in rural areas and foster public-private collaborations," Chakraborty said.</p>

<p>The report also called for regulatory frameworks to address the ethical use of AI, monitor bias, and ensure responsible adoption of the technology.</p>

<p>Aparna Bharadwaj, managing director, BCG urged "policymakers to act decisively to prepare for an AI-driven world". This can be achieved by "enhancing resilience, productivity, job creation, modernisation, and competitiveness".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

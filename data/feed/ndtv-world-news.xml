       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The apparently pristine Gerardmer lake in the Vosges mountains of eastern France conceals a bleak legacy of 20th-century conflict -- dozens of tonnes of unexploded ordnance from the two world wars.</p>

<p>The lake 660 metres (2,170 feet) above sea level is a popular summer bathing spot and is sometimes also tapped for drinking water for the picturesque local town.</p>

<p>Gerardmer's mayor Stessy Speissmann-Mozas started asking questions about the water safety after the Odysseus 3.1 environmental group said samples taken from the lake showed high levels of TNT explosive, as well as metals like iron, titanium and lead.</p>

<p>The group said it found artillery shells in the mud at the bottom of the lake. Some were "gutted, allowing the explosive they contained to escape", Odysseus 3.1's founder Lionel Rard said in a documentary broadcast by the France 5 channel in May.</p>

<p>Samples sent to a German lab showed TNT levels among "the highest ever measured by that team", as well as metal concentrations above legal limits.</p>

<p><strong>'Stick all this in the lake'</strong></p>

<p>The mayor has said the government should pay for a more detailled study of the risks from the munitions that were initially dumped in Gerardmer by the French army. As a theatre of multiple conflicts over the past century and more, France is particularly afflicted by unexploded ordnance.</p>

<p>Most dates back to the world wars but shells are still found from the Franco-Prussian war of 1870, noted Charlotte Nihart of Robin des Bois (Robin Hood), an association that has charted unexploded bombs across France.</p>

<p>Unexploded ordnance is involved in around 10 deaths nationwide every year.</p>

<p>During the wars, retreating armies would dump munitions in lakes to stop enemy forces getting them, Nihart said.</p>

<p>In Gerardmer, disposal drives started in 1977 after a man was burned by a phosphorous shell. They continued through to 1994, removing explosives up to 10 metres below the lake surface.</p>

<p>"They took out 120 tonnes of munitions, made up of almost 100,000 individual pieces of different types from 1914-18 and 1939-45," said Pierre Imbert, an assistant to the mayor and former local fire chief and diver.</p>

<p>Disposal teams brought each explosive to the surface, where they could remove the detonator.</p>

<p>"Then they went and blew it up at the end of the lake," Imbert recalled.</p>

<p>Photos he has kept from the disposal campaigns show everything from "handmade grenades from World War I, more recent things from World War II, and even a little axe".</p>

<p>Officials called a halt to the ordnance disposal due to the difficulty of working further from the shore and deeper under the mud of the lake bed, the regional authority told Robin des Bois.</p>

<p>The region estimated that around 70 tonnes remain at the bottom of Gerardmer.</p>

<p>"There's no way of evaluating the quantity of munitions still sunk in the mud" up to 30 metres below the surface, Imbert said.</p>

<p><strong>'Decontaminate everything'</strong></p>

<p>Since 1945, some of the munitions have moved around in the lake currents.</p>

<p>The state should "decontaminate everything around the edge" of the lake, said Aurelie Mathieu, head of the Vosges region's AKM eco-tourism association.</p>

<p>But the regional authority is refusing to act on the sole basis of the Odysseus 3.1 analysis.</p>

<p>"Neither the ARS (regional health agency) nor Anses (national health and safety agency) were involved in this investigation and we have no details of the methods used to collect and analyse samples," it told AFP.</p>

<p>Samples were taken by state agencies in February and analysed by "several French and German labs", it added.</p>

<p>"Initial results confirmed the conclusions of previous campaigns -- no concerning levels were detected" in the lake water, the regional authority said.</p>

<p>"No health risk has been identified" either for drinking the water or for swimming in it, it added.</p>

<p>One company has put in a bid to map the ordnance still lying at the bottom of the lake.</p>

<p>It would cost "almost 300,000 euros ($334,000)", mayor Speissman-Mozas said.</p>

<p>He is interested in the offer, as long as the national government pays.</p>

<p>"It's the French army who put all these munitions here," he reasoned.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As Israel faces a critical juncture in its history with its war on two fronts - with Hamas and Hezbollah - the country's envoy to India has said all its actions are driven by the objective of rooting out radicalism.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Israel faces a critical juncture in its history with its war on two fronts - with Hamas and Hezbollah - the country's envoy to India has said it has been attacked more than any other nation in modern times and all its actions are driven by the objective of rooting out radicalism and establishing peace and stability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a wide-ranging, exclusive interview with NDTV on Tuesday, Israeli Ambassador Reuven Azar was also asked about the pager and walkie-talkie explosions in Lebanon, for which Israel is being blamed. He answered that war has a hybrid nature now and, given the attacks on it, Israel has to be in a situation where it not only has to defend itself, but also be able to "surprise its enemy".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Azar also spoke about the support Israel has received from the US and India, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly session in New York on Monday.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>'Attacked Like No Other'</strong></p>

<p>To a question on the pager and handheld radio explosions across Lebanon last week, in which at least 37 people were killed and thousands injured and a Mossad hand has been suspected, the ambassador said, "In the past, there used to be either wars against conventional armies or fights against terrorism, but I think that, today, war has a hybrid nature. We have seen it in Israel because we have been attacked like no other country in the history of modern times. We have been attacked not only with rockets and missiles but there have also been cyberattacks; we have been attacked from the air, from the sea, from the land, from tunnels..."</p>

<p>"At the end of the day, you have to create a situation in which you can not only defend yourself but also be able to surprise your enemy. I won't go into details of what Israel is doing or not doing, but the bottom line is that if we want to achieve stability, we have to show these terrorists that are using uncoventional and unethical and immoral ways of fighting, that we can also surprise them," he warned.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Civilian Casualties?</strong></p>

<p>Israel has announced that it has shifted its focus to the northern front with Lebanon and its overnight strikes on the south of the country killed over 550 people, including 50 children. Israel also struck over 1,500 suspected Hezbollah sites around the country as part of what it called "Operation Northern Arrows".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Asked about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's statement that Lebanese people should not become "human shields" for Hezbollah and the high civilian casualties in Gaza and Lebanon, Mr Azar said most of the 1,700 military targets that Israel targeted in southern Lebanon in the past 48 hours were "embedded" in the homes of civilians.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"What Hezbollah has done in the past few years is a double war crime. They have been embedding their missiles inside the homes of people to conceal them from Israel and they have been firing indiscriminately at civilians in northern Israel from these installations. So what Israel had to do is meticulously gather intelligence about these locations over a few years and, fortunately we have been able to target and destroy thousands of missiles that were in those areas," he said.</p>

<p>The ambassador claimed that some of the families that were living there did not evacuate on time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"(This was) despite the fact that we called them over the phone, we intercepted radio communications... we tried every way possible to take them out of harm's way. Despite that, &nbsp;yes, there were some civilians that were killed as well. But when you look at the magnitude of this - 1,700 military targets in 48 hours - you will see that, actually, this is has been very successful; because at the end of the day, when you compare the damage that would be caused from these missiles to Israeli civilians to the price that the people have to pay, it's a relatively low price," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Azar said every loss of life is tragic and claimed that Israel does whatever is possible to take civilians out of harm's way. "Fortunately, today, thousands and tens of thousands of civilians from South Lebanon have been evacuated, and that's a very important thing. We will continue to put pressure on Hezbollah," he asserted.</p>

<p><strong>'War Can Be Stopped Right Now'</strong></p>

<p>The ambassador said Israel is not interested in war and claimed that the country has been trying to - along with the US - find a diplomatic solution despite Hezbollah firing 8,300 rockets "in an unprovoked way" at Israel in the last 11 months. He said that if the Hezbollah respects an earlier UN resolution and moves away from the border, there will be a ceasefire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Our civilians will be able to go back to their homes and we can stop the war now. But if Hezbollah continues to be stubborn and continues to fire at Israel and continues to refuse to implement the UN Security Council resolution, this war will continue," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On protests in Israel over 700 Israeli defence personnel having lost their lives, Mr Azar insisted that there is "wall-to-wall" consensus in his country that it has to deal with "security threats" in the Gaza Strip and the north of the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Israel has to go back to a normal life and we cannot do that when we have a threat of imminent attack by terrorists. Now, of course, this has a cost. And yes, there are people that are not satisfied, especially the families that have hostages still in the Gaza Strip. So we will have to deal with the dilemma and we will have to solve the situation because we cannot surrender to Hamas and we are trying to get into a deal that is actually sponsored by the United States and by the Security Council. But, as the spokesperson of the White House has said, Hamas is refusing this deal and therefore we will have to be persistent... we have to create a situation in which these terrorist organisations will no longer attack Israel in the future," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>'India Has Suffered Too'</strong></p>

<p>Mr Azar said that the fact that India abstained from a UN General Assembly Resolution demanding that Israel bring an end to its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory shows that India supports a realistic solution.</p>

<p>To a question on whether India can play a peacemaker, the ambassador said, "We appreciate very much the support of India since October 7 (the day of the Hamas attacks last year) and the fact that India condemned the attacks and supported the right for self-defence. I think that the voting of India in the General Assembly is testament that they are following a path of supporting a realistic solution and not something that is completely detached from reality," he said.</p>

<p>"If we want to see a situation in which the Palestinians rule themselves - this is something that Israel wants to see as well, not just India - we will have to work together to defeat the terrorists and also encourage the more pragmatic and moderate forces within Palestinian society. We will have to fight radicalism in West Asia because this is actually the source of the instability we are seeing around us. And India knows that very well because you have been suffering from that kind of radicalism around you," he added.</p>

<p>On PM Modi's meeting with Palestinian President Abbas in which he expressed concern over the situation in Gaza and also called for an end to these hostilities, the ambassador said, "We also want to see an end to the hostilities. We are a peace-loving country. We are a democracy. We thrive because we maintain periods of stability. And we need the help of our friends in order to restore that stabilty. And it's going to be up to India to decide to what extent it wants to be involved."&nbsp;</p>

<p>He said that Israel and other "pragmatic countries" can be a corridor between India and Europe once peace prevails.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Broad Support In US</strong></p>

<p>The ambassador said there is broad support for Israel in the US and Vice President Kamala Harris has not said she will limit assistance to the country if she is elected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Actually, 80% of American people support Israel and its right to defend itself. And this happens both on the Republican and Democratic sides. We enjoy overwhelming support in Congress, and we saw that when Prime Minister Netanyahu visited the United States and gave his fourth speech in Congress - the foreign leader who gave the most number of speeches before both houses of Congress. So I think that our situation in the United States is solid, and I'm confident that we'll find a way to cooperate with any American administration that will be elected in &nbsp;November," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India on Tuesday said companies will have to seek fresh approvals to import laptops and tablets starting from January 1 and guidelines to do so will be issued shortly.</p>

<p>India launched an "import management system" in November 2023, which required companies to register with the government the quantity and value of their laptop and tablet imports.</p>

<p>The government said at the time the data would be used for monitoring imports. The system, due to expire this month, has been extended until year-end.</p>

<p>"Importers would be required to apply for fresh authorisations for the period from 01.01.2025 subject to detailed guidance to be provided shortly," said a government notification issued on Tuesday.</p>

<p>India announced the new system for laptops, tablets, personal computers and servers after it rolled back an earlier plan to impose a licensing regime, requiring the likes of Apple, Dell and HP to obtain licences for shipments of imported laptops and tablets.</p>

<p>The laptop licensing policy, seen as a trade restriction, was reversed after criticism from industry and Washington.</p>

<p>The policy was part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's efforts to boost local manufacturing and ensure a trusted supply chain, as India remains reliant on imports for such electronics.</p>

<p>Reuters reported in March that India reversed the laptop licensing policy after lobbying by US officials who remained concerned about New Delhi's compliance with WTO obligations and new rules it may issue.</p>

<p>"India's repeated delay in implementing laptop import restrictions, likely influenced by U.S. concerns, needs to end," said Ajay Srivastava, founder of Global Trade Research Initiative, a Delhi-based basked think-tank.</p>

<p>India's laptop and personal computer imports between April to July stood at $1.7 billion, according to the government data.</p>

<p>Under a federal subsidy scheme for local production of laptops, tablets and personal computers, India last year approved applications from companies including Dell.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Affirming support for the reformation of the United Nations Security Council to better represent the developing world, US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken said that the United States has long endorsed permanent seats in the council for India.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Affirming support for the reformation of the United Nations Security Council to better represent the developing world, US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken said that the United States has long endorsed permanent seats in the council for India, Japan and Germany.</p>

<p>Speaking at the 'Summit of the Future' at the 79th United Nations General Assembly in New York on Monday (local time), Mr Blinken put forward the US' idea of two permanent seats for Africa, one rotating seat for Small Island Developing States, and permanent representation for Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>

<p>"Reforming the UN Security Council to better represent the developing world and, more broadly, the world as it is today. The United States believes that this should include two permanent seats for Africa, one rotating seat for Small Island Developing States, and permanent representation for Latin America and the Caribbean. In addition to the permanent seats for countries, we've long endorsed Germany, Japan, and India," he said.</p>

<p>"The United States supports starting negotiations on Council reforms immediately," he added.</p>

<p>Mr Blinken conveyed the US's commitment to adapting the UN system to reflect the current geopolitical situation driving the world, which didn't exist back in 1945. However, he resolutely opposed to any revision of any reformers, which could alter the core principle of the UN Charter.</p>

<p>"The United States is committed to adapting the UN system to reflect this world of today and tomorrow--not the one that existed in 1945 but we are and we will remain resolutely opposed to revisionism. We will not accept efforts to tear down, dilute, or fundamentally alter the core principle of the UN Charter," Mr Blinken further said.</p>

<p>Notably, India has long sought a permanent seat in the Security Council to better represent the interests of the developing world. The nation's quest has gained momentum with support from the international community.</p>

<p>The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is composed of 15 member states, including five permanent members with veto power and ten non-permanent members elected for two-year terms.</p>

<p>The five permanent members of the UNSC include China, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, and the United States. The non-permanent members of the United Nations Security Council are elected for 2-year terms by the UNGA.</p>

<p>Earlier on Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address at the 'Summit of the Future' at the UN General Assembly in New York, also called for reforms in the global institutions and termed reforms the "key to relevance."</p>

<p>He also called the African Union's inclusion as a permanent member in the G20 an "important step" in this direction.</p>

<p>PM Narendra Modi also expressed India's willingness to share its experiences of success with the Global South. He said that the success of humanity lies in "collective strength" and not the battlefield.</p>

<p>"When we discuss the global future, we must accord the highest priority to a human-centric approach. While prioritising sustainable development, we must also ensure human welfare, food, and health security. By lifting 250 million people out of poverty in India, we have demonstrated that sustainable development can be successful. We are ready to share our experiences of our success with the Global South. The success of humanity lies in our collective strength, not on the battlefield," PM Modi said.</p>

<p>Later during the special briefing on the Prime Minister's US visit, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri also appreciated that the UN Summit document has a detailed paragraph on UN Security Council reforms, which is a "very good beginning."</p>

<p>"I would only point you in the direction of the fact that for the first time, a UN Summit document has a detailed paragraph on UN Security Council reform, so it may not have every single detail in every area that we would imagine or we would like there to be but I think it's a good beginning and we look forward eventually to the beginning of text-based negotiations in a fixed time frame going forward. But this should be seen as the first step towards that objective and the fact that till now we haven't had discussions based on text but an agreement at this level in the pact that keeps open the possibilities of a reform of the UN system is a gain from any perspective," he stated.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 37-year-old man in Vietnam has been arrested for committing a shocking act of stealing his uncle's bones from a grave and using them to extort money from his family. According to the <em>South China Morning Post (SCMP)</em>, the man, identified as Luu Thanh Nam, from Thanh Hoa province in northern Vietnam, attempted to extort 5 billion Vietnamese dong ($203,000) from his extended family to settle his gambling debts. The deceased, who died four years earlier, was identified as the father of his cousin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wionews.com/trending/man-digs-up-uncles-grave-steals-bones-extorts-family-to-pay-off-debt-761530" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>SCMP</em></a>, the incident took place on September 9. The 37-year-old used a shovel to dig a 20cm hole in his uncle's grave. He reportedly removed some of his uncle's remains and concealed them in a nearby pile of rubbish. Then, the next day, he sent a threatening message to his cousin Luu Thanh Hoi's wife using an anonymous phone number and demanded payment for the return of the bones. He also warned that if they contacted the cops, they would never recover the remains.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alarmed by the message, Mr Hoi's family checked the grave and discovered the hole in the coffin cap. They promptly alerted the authorities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After an investigation, the 37-year-old was identified as the perpetrator. He later confessed to the crime, citing overwhelming gambling debts as his motive. The police recovered the stolen bones and returned them to the family.</p>

<p>On September 12, Luu Thanh Nam was arrested for grave desecration and extortion, with the specific penalties yet to be disclosed. Notably, penalties for grave desecration in Vietnam can be up to seven years in prison, and those convicted of extortion may face sentences of up to 20 years, depending on the amount involved.</p>

<p>Disturbing a grave is considered highly disrespectful in Vietnamese tradition. It is believed that digging up a grave can cause unrest to the deceased's soul, potentially impacting the living. So, Mr Hoi reinterred his father's remains according to local customs, hoping to restore peace to the spirit.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on social media, the incident has garnered significant attention. "Isn't this man afraid of facing bad karma? He should work honestly to repay his debts," wrote one user.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Stay away from gambling; don't let money cloud your judgment," said another.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Israeli airstrike on the southern suburbs of Beirut on Tuesday killed a Hezbollah commander who was a leading figure in its rocket division, two security sources in Lebanon said, as fears of a full-fledged war in the Middle East mounted.</p>

<p>The sources identified the commander who was killed as Ibrahim Qubaisi. The attack, in which six people were killed, dealt another blow to the Iran-backed group which has faced a series of setbacks at the hands of Israel over the past week.</p>

<p>The relentless pressure on Hezbollah has increased fears that nearly a year of conflict will explode into another all-out war and destabilise the Middle East, where a conflict between Israel and Hezbollah's ally Hamas is already raging in Gaza.</p>

<p>Israel struck the Hezbollah-controlled area of the Lebanese capital for a second consecutive day after mounting a new wave of airstrikes on targets in Lebanon.</p>

<p>After nearly 12 months of war against the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza on its southern border, Israel is shifting its focus to the northern frontier, where Hezbollah has been firing rockets into Israel in support of Hamas, which is also backed by Iran.</p>

<p>The health ministry gave an initial toll of six dead and 15 wounded in the Beirut strike.</p>

<p>The Israeli military carried out airstrikes against Hezbollah on Monday which Lebanese authorities said killed more than 500 people.</p>

<p>The airstrike hit a building in the usually busy Ghobeiry neighbourhood in Beirut. One of the security sources shared a photo showing damage to the top floor of a five-storey building.</p>

<p>Israel's military chief said earlier that attacks on Hezbollah would be accelerated.</p>

<p>"The situation requires continued, intense action in all arenas," said Military Chief of General Staff Herzi Halevi after holding a security assessment.</p>

<p>Lebanese authorities said 558 people had been killed, including 50 children and 94 women, in Israel's airstrikes on Monday. A further 1,835 were wounded, they said, and tens of thousands more have fled for safety.</p>

<p>The casualty tolls and the charge from the most powerful and advanced military in the Middle East has spread panic in Lebanon, which suffered from devastating destruction when Israel and Hezbollah fought in 2006.</p>

<p>"We are waiting for victory, God willing, because as long as we have a neighbour like Israel, we can't sleep safely," said Beirut resident Hassan Omar.</p>

<p>Afif Ibrahim, a taxi driver from southern Lebanon, was defiant.</p>

<p>"They (Israel) want us (Lebanese) to kneel, but we kneel only to God in our prayers; we bow our heads to no one but God," he said.</p>

<p><strong>GROWING CALLS FOR DIPLOMACY</strong></p>

<p>Calls for diplomacy are growing as the conflict worsens, with UN human rights chief Volker Turk urging all states and actors with influence to avert further escalation in Lebanon.</p>

<p>"I believe that we can still find a path forward to get de-escalation between Israel and across that northern border between Israel and Lebanon and bring about a diplomatic solution that allows people to return to their home," White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told MSNBC.</p>

<p>The fighting has raised fears that the United States, Israel's close ally, and regional power Iran, which has proxies across the Middle East - Hezbollah, Yemen's Houthis and armed groups in Iraq - will be sucked into a wider war.</p>

<p>Hezbollah last week suffered heavy losses when thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by its members exploded in the worst security breach in its history.</p>

<p>The operation was widely attributed to Israel, which has a long history of sophisticated attacks on foreign soil. It has not confirmed or denied responsibility.</p>

<p>Israel's intelligence and technological prowess has given it a strong edge in both Lebanon and Gaza. It has tracked down and assassinated top Hezbollah commanders and Hamas leaders.</p>

<p>But Hezbollah has proven resilient during decades of hostilities with Israel, challenging superior firepower.</p>

<p>The group, which was founded by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in 1982 to counter an Israeli invasion of Lebanon, is a more formidable enemy than Hamas.</p>

<p>Hezbollah used a new rocket, Fadi 3, in an attack on an Israeli army base, the group announced in a message posted on Telegram on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Its media office said on Tuesday that Israel was dropping leaflets with a "very dangerous" barcode on them onto Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley, warning that scanning it by phone would "withdraw all information" from any device.</p>

<p>There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Hezbollah's media office did not say if anything else was written on the flyers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fungal infections are evolving and becoming resistant to the medicines used to treat them, causing what some researchers are calling a "silent pandemic" that needs to be addressed urgently. According to molecular biologist Norman van Rhijn from the University of Manchester in the UK, the threat of fungal pathogens and antifungal resistance is being overlooked in global health discussions. Without urgent attention and action, some particularly nasty fungal infections, which already infect 6.5 million a year and claim 3.8 million lives annually, could become even more dangerous, he warned, as per <em>Science Alert</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The biologist, along with an international group of scientists, is urging government, research communities and the pharmaceutical industry to "look beyond just bacteria". Fungal infections are left out of too many initiatives to tackle antimicrobial resistance, the researchers said, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.sciencealert.com/deadly-fungal-infections-causing-a-silent-pandemic-scientists-warn" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Science Alert</em></a>. Without urgent attention, fungal infections could become even more dangerous, they said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The disproportionate focus on bacteria is concerning because many drug resistance problems over the past decades were the result of invasive fungal diseases, which are largely under-recognized by the community and governments alike," Norman van Rhijn and his colleagues, who hail from institutions in China, the Netherlands, Austria, Australia, Spain, the UK, Brazil, the US, India, Turkiye, and Uganda, said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fungal diseases such as Aspergillus fumigatus, which affects the lungs, and Candida, which causes yeast infections, are considered the most dangerous. People with weakened immune systems and older adults are at the highest risk, per the outlet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scientists explained that compared to bacteria and viruses, fungi are more complicated organisms, which makes it harder and more expensive for scientists to develop a medicine that kills the cells of fungi without damaging other important cells in the body. Currently, there are only four classes of antifungal drugs, and resistance to them is increasing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"To treat deep or invasive fungal infections, only four systemic antifungal classes are available and resistance is now the rule rather than the exception for those currently available classes," the researchers wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The team said that it is concerned that agricultural practices are contributing to the problem. They explained that fungicides used in farming can cause cross-resistance in the fungi that affect humans. They suggest that the world needs a balance between protecting crops and treating fungal infections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Antifungal protection is required for food security. The question is, how do we balance food security with the ability to treat current and future resistant fungal pathogens?" the researcher wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The team recommends a global agreement to limit certain antifungal drugs to specific purposes, as well as collaborative regulations to balance food security with health.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Telegram can disclose users' data upon reasonable requests from authorities, the encrypted messaging service's co-founder Pavel Durov said on his Telegram channel.</p>

<p>"We've made it clear that the IP addresses and phone numbers of those who violate our rules can be disclosed to relevant authorities in response to valid legal requests," Pavel Durov said on Monday, specifying that the messenger has updated its terms of service and privacy policy, bringing them to uniformity across the world, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Such changes were introduced to "further deter criminals from abusing Telegram Search," he noted.</p>

<p>Pavel Durov also pointed out that some users were abusing Telegram's search function to sell illegal goods. However, the team of the platform has removed all problematic content from searches in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Pavel Durov, a native of Russia, was detained in Paris last month and later released on a $5.6 million bail for charges including failing to act against Telegram users involved in cyberbullying, sharing pedophilic content and glorifying terrorism. He was placed under judicial supervision and banned from leaving France.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[This groundbreaking technology, expected to be operational by 2030, will be a significant step forward in AI development and scientific research.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan is building a super-fast computer, the first of its kind, that will be 1,000 times faster than any computer we have now. It will be ready to use in 2030 and could cost over $780 million to make. This new computer will help Japan stay ahead in developing artificial intelligence (AI).</p>

<p>According to Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT), development of a successor to the country's flagship supercomputer, Fugaku, will begin in 2025. The supercomputer could reach speeds on a zetaFLOPS scale, which has never been achieved before.</p>

<p>According to<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/japan-to-start-building-1st-zeta-class-supercomputer-in-2025-1000-times-more-powerful-than-todays-fastest-machines"><em> Live Science,</em></a> "Floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) is used to measure how fast computers can solve problems-where one floating-point operation is a single calculation. A supercomputer with a speed of 1 zetaFLOPS could make one sextillion (1 followed by 21 zeros) calculations per second. Today's most powerful supercomputers have only just broken the exaFLOPS barrier, meaning they can make just over one quintillion (1 followed by 18 zeros) calculations per second."</p>

<p>The<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOSG215U40R20C24A8000000/?s=31"> Japanese news site Nikkei</a> stated in a translated article that the decision to create such a powerful machine was taken "in order to keep up with the development of scientific research using artificial intelligence."</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-in-japan-are-about-to-build-a-supercomputer-like-no-other"><em>ScienceAlert,</em></a> supercomputers have proved consistently useful to scientists, helping researchers simulate black holes, discover new materials, model Earth's future, and probe the foundations of mathematics. As these machines continue to get more powerful, we should see their capabilities expand too.Unlike quantum computers, supercomputers aren't too different from the desktops and laptops we all use every day; they're just scaled up to an incredibly high level. They're still based on processors, memory, and storage, but taken to extremes.</p>

<p>An upgraded zetta-class machine could be trained on more data at a faster speed and produce results that are more detailed, more accurate, and more comprehensive. If all goes well, six years from now, there should be a new supercomputer standard.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a stunning breakthrough, South Korean police have solved a shocking cold case from 2008, arresting a man in his 50s for murdering his live-in girlfriend and encasing her body in cement on their apartment balcony. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2024/09/113_382939.html"><i>Korea Times</i></a>, the gruesome crime went undetected for years, filed as a missing person case until a chance discovery last month. A construction worker repairing a leak on the rooftop balcony stumbled upon a travel suitcase encased in concrete and bricks, containing the partially preserved remains of the victim, identified as B.</p>

<p>Initial investigations in 2011 suspected the boyfriend identified as A, but lack of evidence and leads led to a dead end. However, advances in forensic technology and a thorough re-examination of the case led police to re-question the boyfriend.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During interrogation, the boyfriend confessed to killing his girlfriend --who was in her 30s at the time--during a heated argument over a romantic issue in October 2008. He admitted to striking her on the head and face with a blunt object. He then placed her dead body into a suitcase, which he buried under a layer of bricks and cement on his balcony.</p>

<p>Fingerprint analysis identified the partially preserved body, and an autopsy revealed blunt force trauma to the head as the cause of death. Police promptly identified the boyfriend as the prime suspect and arrested him on September 19 in Yangsan.</p>

<p>Additional revelations exposed how the crime remained hidden for so long. The boyfriend deceived B's family and the landlord, claiming she had left after an argument. Notably, her family had lost contact with her and were misled about her whereabouts. When they travelled to Geoje in search of their daughter, they were informed by Mr A that the couple had separated, and B had departed the city.</p>

<p>He continued occupying the apartment until 2017 when he was imprisoned for drug charges.&nbsp;The landlord, unaware of the gruesome secret, used the room as storage space, leaving the concrete-encased body undisturbed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The boyfriend faces charges related to his drug use, as the statute of limitations for concealing a corpse has expired. Prosecutors will review the case once the investigation is complete.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Larry, the Chief Mouser at 10 Downing Street, has addressed the arrival of UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's new kitten. Starmer recently shared the first picture of Prince, a tiny Siberian kitten, nestled comfortably on his work documents.</p>

<p>However, Larry, who has been a fixture at No. 10 since 2011, wasn't going to let Prince's debut steal his thunder. In a playful nod to his new housemate, Larry shared Starmer's post and confidently declared, “My position as best looking cat on Downing Street remains unchallenged.”</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">My position as best looking cat on Downing Street remains unchallenged <a href="https://t.co/UTKM157c3P">https://t.co/UTKM157c3P</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>And it was obvious that people would take note of Larry's first reaction to Prince's arrival. Many even wondered if Larry was already "staring him down".<br />
<br />
"That cat looks rather terrified. Are you staring her[?] down?!" said a person.</p>

<p>Larry, a staple of British political life, was brought in to help tackle a rat problem. The cat has become a beloved figure, often seen lounging on the steps of Downing Street.</p>

<p>A report in The Independent in August said that Downing Street officials were developing a “media plan” to address the eventual death&nbsp;of Larry. Larry, now 17, is believed to be in his twilight years, having outlived the typical tabby cat.</p>

<p>Keir Starmer revealed earlier this month that, after “a long summer of negotiations” with his children over the prospect of getting a dog, the family ultimately decided on a new kitten to join their household, according to a report in the Mirror. Prince joins the family's rescue cat, JoJo, who moved into Downing Street with the Starmers this summer.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it appears Prince and Larry have yet to meet.</p>

<p>According to the Mirror, when asked last week if Prince had crossed paths with Larry, Keir Starmer said, “No, because Prince can't go out, Prince is young, he's fantastic though.” He added that logistical challenges might be to blame: “The problem we've got, which is the same for JoJo the cat, is that the only door out of our new flat is bomb-proof. Therefore, getting a cat flap is proving a little bit difficult."</p>

<p>Despite the obstacle, Starmer's daughter was the driving force behind the family's decision to adopt Prince, convinced that “the problem isn't any bigger for two cats than one.”</p>

<p>Now, the Starmers are a two-cat household, even if the newest addition is confined indoors for the time being.</p>]]></content:encoded>

An analysis of satellite data revealed the Earth's crust below the Konya Basin in the Central Anatolian Plateau of Turkey has been reshaping over millions of years. The research, conducted by Earth scientists at the University of Toronto, was published in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52126-7">Nature Communications</a>.</p>

<p>Researchers said experimental simulations, combined with geological, geophysical and geodetic data, explain the enigmatic sinking of the basin, inside the rising plateau interior.</p>

<p>It further adds to the existence of a new class of plate tectonics that have implications for other planets in the universe, like Mars and Venus, that do not have Earth-like plate tectonics.</p>

<p>The study suggests the sinking is due to the multi-stage lithospheric dripping — the phenomenon named for the instability of rocky material that creates the crust and upper mantle of the Earth.</p>

<p>Major landforms like basins and mountainous folding of the crust are formed at the surface as the dense rock fragments beneath get detached and sink into more fluid layers of the mantle of the planet, the research said.</p>

<p>“Looking at the satellite data, we observed a circular feature at the Konya Basin where the crust is subsiding or the basin is deepening,” said lead author Julia Andersen, a PhD candidate in the Department of Earth Sciences in the Faculty of Arts &amp; Science at the <a href="https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/news/geoscientists-confirm-millions-year-old-dripping-earths-crust-beneath-central-anatolian">University of Toronto</a>.</p>

<p>This prompted the researchers to look at other geophysical data beneath the surface. There they witnessed a "seismic anomaly in the upper mantle and a thickened crust, telling us there is high-density material there and indicating a likely mantle lithospheric drip," Andersen added.</p>

<p>In the past, studies have suggested that the Central Anatolian Plateau has risen by around one kilometre over the past 10 million years due to the lithospheric dripping phenomenon.</p>

<p><strong>How it happens</strong></p>

<p>Russell Pysklywec, a co-author of the study, has given insight into the phenomenon and stated that when the lithosphere thickened and further dripped below the region, this led to the formation of a basin at the surface that "later sprang up when the weight below broke off and sank into the deeper depths of the mantle".</p>

<p>However, this process was not a one-time tectonic event, Pysklywec said and suggested that the "initial drip seems to have spawned subsequent daughter events elsewhere in the region, resulting in the curious rapid subsidence of the Konya Basin within the continuously rising plateau of Turkiye.”</p>

<p>To conclude, the research team recreated the dripping process in laboratory experiments and further analysed the observations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">For almost a year, Israel and Hezbollah have engaged in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/11/mapping-11-months-if-israel-lebanon-cross-border-attacks">increasingly provocative cross-border skirmishes</a> as onlookers warn that this escalating war of attrition could land the region in an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/09/22/israel-and-hizbullah-creep-closer-to-all-out-war">all-out conflict</a>. The past few days have made that devastating scenario closer to a reality.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>First came Israel's <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/18/pager-and-walkie-talkie-attacks-on-hezbollah-were-audacious-and-carefully-planned">pager and walkie-talkie attack</a>, an unprecedented assault on Hezbollah's communications that injured thousands of the organization's operatives. It was followed by <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y9wyy9pr2o">the assassination of Ibrahim Aqil</a>, a key Hezbollah leader, who died in an airstrike that also killed other senior commanders of the militant group, as well as some civilians. Hezbollah responded by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/22/world/gaza-israel-hamas-hezbollah">extending the geographical range</a> of its rockets fired at Israel, targeting both military facilities and civilian neighbourhoods across northern Israel. Israel then launched a fresh air assault in which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/23/world/gaza-israel-hamas-hezbollah">more than 270 people were killed</a>, according to Lebanese health authorities, leading also to the flight of thousands of residents from South Lebanon to the north of the country.</p>

<p>As a <a href="https://kroc.nd.edu/faculty-and-staff/asher-kaufman/">scholar of Lebanon and Israel</a>, I have followed the dynamics of this war of attrition since Oct. 8, 2023, the day after Hamas executed an unprecedented and deadly attack on Israel, which responded by bombarding the Gaza Strip. Hezbollah then began firing rockets into northern Israel in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>Despite the high rhetoric and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/22/world/gaza-israel-hamas-hezbollah">mutual threats</a> <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/doctrine-hezbollah">of destruction</a>, until recent days neither Israel nor Hezbollah, nor the latter's sponsor Iran, have shown an interest in a full-scale war. All parties surely know the likely destructive consequences of such an eventuality for themselves: Israel has the military power to devastate Beirut and other parts of Lebanon as it did in Gaza, while even a weakened Hezbollah could fire thousands of missiles at Israeli strategic sites, from the airport to central Tel Aviv, water supply lines and electricity hubs, and offshore gas rigs.</p>

<p>So instead, they have exchanged fire and blows along their shared boundary, with somewhat agreed-upon red lines concerning the geographical scope of attacks and efforts not to intentionally target civilians.</p>

<p>But Israel's recent attacks in Lebanon may have turned the page of this war of attrition into a new and far more acute situation, putting the region on the brink of a full war. Such a war would wreak havoc in Lebanon and Israel, and might also <a href="https://theconversation.com/escalating-israel-hezbollah-clashes-threaten-to-spark-regional-war-and-force-us-into-conflict-with-iran-232803">drag Iran and the United States</a> into direct confrontation. In doing so, it would also <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/10/26/1208456496/iran-hamas-axis-of-resistance-hezbollah-israel">fulfill the apparent</a> of the Hamas gunmen who <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/haaretz-explains/2023-10-19/ty-article-magazine/israels-dead-the-names-of-those-killed-in-hamas-massacres-and-the-israel-hamas-war/0000018b-325c-d450-a3af-7b5cf0210000">murdered around 1,200 Israelis</a> on Oct. 7 in the hope that a heavy-handed Israeli response would draw in more groups across the region.</p>

<h3><strong>A dangerous ‘new phase'</strong></h3>

<p>Hezbollah's secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah, has insisted throughout the near-yearlong hostilities that his organization would hold its fire only if a cease-fire agreement is reached between Israel and Hamas. In recent weeks, however, Israel has taken the conflict in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>The country's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/israel-defense-minister-yoav-gallant-new-phase-war-hezbollah/">described the coordinated attacks</a> on Hezbolah targets as a “new phase,” adding that the “center of gravity” in the war was moving north into Lebanon. The Israeli government has added the “return of the residents of the north securely to their homes” as <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglkkrj94ldo">an additional war goal</a>.</p>

<p>The assault on Hezbollah's communications system targeted the organization's operatives but <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/09/18/lebanon-exploding-pagers-harmed-hezbollah-civilians">hit many civilian bystanders</a>, leaving Lebanese in shock, trauma, anger and desperation.</p>

<p>It demonstrated Israel's tactical military advantage over Hezbollah. The unprecedented penetration into the heart of the organization's command and rank-and-file structures has never been seen before in any conflict or war globally. It struck Hezbollah in its most vulnerable places and even exposed its coordination with Iran – one of the injured persons from the pager explosions <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-ambassador-lebanon-injured-by-pager-explosion-2024-09-17/">was the Iranian ambassador</a> in Lebanon.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-mideast-tensions-attack-8ec89de2b117b52e2c09b19155e35d13">killing of Akil</a> two days later was another signal that the Israeli government had now decided to try to change the rules of this risky game of reprisals and counter-reprisals. It is clear that rather than the uneasy status quo that defined this war of attrition for nearly a year, Israel's intent is now to pressure Hezbollah to concede.</p>

<h3><strong>Getting out of control</strong></h3>

<p>Nasrallah delivered a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/19/middleeast/lebanon-hezbollah-hassan-nasrallah-speech-analysis-intl-latam/index.html">gloomy and defiant speech</a> in the aftermath of the pager attack. While acknowledging that Hezbollah was severely undermined by this operation, he defined the Israeli attack as a continuation of “multiple other massacres perpetrated by the enemy over decades.”</p>

<p>By doing so, he framed it within a popular historical narrative among many Lebanese and Palestinians who <a href="https://english.ahram.org.eg/News/510520.aspx">regard Israel as a criminal entity</a> that regularly carries out massacres against innocent civilians.</p>

<p>Nasrallah also insisted that his commitment to supporting Hamas in Gaza remains unwavering.</p>

<p>While stating that Israeli actions have “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79n1v4d203o">crossed all red lines</a>” and could amount to a declaration of war, Nasrallah also reiterated a point he had made in previous peaks of this ongoing conflict: that retribution is coming, the only question being of timing and scale. By doing so, Nasrallah hinted that he may still not be interested in a full war.</p>

<p>Israel, on the other hand, appears less circumspect. After almost a full year of contained tension with Hezbollah, Israel's leaders appear willing to risk an escalation that might get out of control.</p>

<p>It is hard to determine what the strategy behind Israel's actions is: Since Oct. 7; as the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/03/18/israel-gaza-biden-netanyahu-rafah/">Biden administration has noted</a>, Israel has not displayed a coherent strategy with clear political goals.</p>

<p>Rather, critics of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggest that he is mainly motivated by his own political survival and the <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-israels-netanyahu-survives-in-his-job-237382">retention of power</a> as the head of state, tying Israel's interests to his own.</p>

<h3><strong>Uniting the ‘axis of resistance'</strong></h3>

<p>So where does this leave Nasrallah as he weighs Hezbollah's response, surely in consultation with Iran? After such devastating blows to Nasrallah's organization, it is hard to think that Hezbollah would be willing to scale down, stop its cross-border attacks and retreat away from the Israeli border, or give up its commitment to support Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>On the other hand, opting for a full-scale war, after spending a year avoiding it, is fraught with risk – both Nasrallah and his sponsors in Tehran know well the high costs of such a war for Hezbollah, Lebanon and potentially also for Iran.</p>

<p>If Hezbollah went to war now against Israel, it would embark on its most consequential move since its <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67307858">foundation in 1982</a>. But it would do so with crippled communications systems and without much of its leadership – some of whom had worked for decades side by side with Nasrallah, building with him the military capacity of the organization.</p>

<p>In some respects, Israelis under Netanyahu's leadership, and Lebanese in a country increasingly held hostage by Hezbollah's interests, face similar predicaments: Their well-being is being sacrificed for other priorities.</p>

<p>Netanayhu's <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-hamas-war-hezbollah-lebanon-attacks-haifa-west-bank-al-jazeera-rcna172130">recent statements</a> about concern for Israeli citizens in the north sound hollow after 11 months of pursuing policies that put them more in danger, as well as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-06-24-2024-f5de2ed8288ac3cdb02c4e9e2fbaeda1">opposing a Gaza cease-fire deal</a> that would also end hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel.</p>

<p>In Lebanon, Hezbollah has dragged the country into this war <a href="https://mondediplo.com/2024/08/02lebanon">against the will of most Lebanese</a> – a decision that has led to significant devastation in parts of a country already suffering extreme political and economic duress.</p>

<p>Nasrallah's speech described Hezbollah's predicament as that of all Lebanon – while sending a veiled threat that dissent would not be tolerated. Many Lebanese are undoubtedly sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and resent Israel's war in Gaza. But at the same time, they may balk at the idea that their own well-being has to be sacrificed in the process.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Yahya Sinwar, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/17/nx-s1-5075313/who-is-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar">Hamas leader and mastermind</a> behind the Oct. 7 massacre, may well be looking on at the unfolding events between Israel and Hezbollah with satisfaction. His plan was designed to trigger the unification of all fronts of the so-called “axis of resistance,” which includes the Houthis in Yemen as well as Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups with the hope for a regional war against Israel.</p>

<p>A year later, we are closer than ever to that scenario.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TikTok, a popular video app, has kicked off accounts belonging to Russian state-owned media outlets RT and Sputnik. They said these accounts were trying to secretly influence people, which is against their rules. This means that users can no longer see content from these Russian news organisations on TikTok.</p>

<p>In its official announcement on its<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/en-us/us-election-hub"> website</a>, TikTok has said that it is "removing accounts associated with Rossiya Segodnya and TV-Novosti for engaging in covert influence operations on TikTok, which violates our Community Guidelines. Previously, these accounts were restricted in the EU and UK."</p>

<p>TV-Novosti and Rossiya Segodnya are the parent organisations of the RT television network and the Russian news agency Sputnik.</p>

<p>"Globally, under our state-affiliated media policy, their content was also ineligible for the For You feed to limit attempts to influence foreign audiences on topics of global events and affairs, and their accounts were labelled as state-controlled media to provide important context about the source of the content. The removed accounts will be reported in our September Covert Influence Operations report," the statement mentioned.</p>

<p>This is not the first time when the RT and other Russian media outlets have been banned from any social media platforms. A few days ago, social media giant Meta, the company that owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and Whatsapp, announced on September 16 that it is banning Russian media outlet RT, days after the Biden administration accused RT of acting as an arm of Moscow's spy agencies.</p>

<p>"After careful consideration, we expanded our ongoing enforcement against Russian state media outlets. Rossiya Segodnya, RT, and other related entities are now banned from our apps globally for foreign interference activity," a Meta spokesperson said in a statement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Just as individual humans handle stress differently, so do corals. Even coral colonies of the same species, growing side by side, vary in their tolerance to pressures such as heatwaves.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just as individual humans handle stress differently, so do corals. Even coral colonies of the same species, growing side by side, vary in their tolerance to pressures such as heatwaves.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01649-4">research published today</a>, we discovered surprising new evidence of variable heat tolerance in corals. As the world's oceans warm, these differences are important.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the world's <a href="https://icriforum.org/4gbe/">fourth global mass bleaching event</a> was declared. The Great Barrier Reef has suffered <a href="https://www2.gbrmpa.gov.au/learn/reef-health/reef-health-updates#:%7E:text=In%20March%202024%2C%20the%20fifth,record%20levels%20of%20heat%20stress.">five mass bleachings</a> since 2016 – most recently this past summer. The declarations followed the world's <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67861954">warmest year on record</a>.</p>

<p>To keep the world's coral reefs healthy and functioning, global carbon emissions must be <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1674">dramatically curbed</a> to reduce the rate of ocean warming. As humanity works towards that goal, interventions may buy time for corals to survive in their warming environments.</p>

<h3><strong>What we did</strong></h3>

<p>The heat tolerance of corals can be measured by analysing their responses to elevated water temperatures. Our research involved measuring the bleaching thresholds of more than 500 colonies of the tabular coral, <em>Acropora hyacinthus</em>.</p>

<p><em>Acropora hyacinthus</em> is a common coral that forms “tables” of tiny branchlets. This species is <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/conl.12817">both</a> ecologically important and highly vulnerable to heat waves, making it a prime candidate for conservation.</p>

<p>The characteristic colour of coral is provided by algae living inside its tissue. The algae also provide most of the coral's nutrition. When water temperatures get too high for too long, the coral expels the algae, causing it to bleach and starve.</p>

<p>While at sea, we visited 17 reefs to scuba dive and search for <em>Acropora hyacinthus</em>. We then brought samples of these corals on board a research vessel to conduct experiments.</p>

<p>Our specially designed portable experiment system contained 12 tanks set to four different temperatures. Coral fragments were placed in each tank and subjected to short-term heat stress at different temperatures.</p>

<p>Afterwards, we measured the amount of pigment left in the coral fragments, which directly aligns with the amount of algae left in the coral's cells.</p>

<p>We then determined each coral's bleaching thresholds - in other words, the temperature at which the coral's pigmentation drops to 50% of its healthy level. This allowed us to understand how much variation exists and where the most heat-tolerant colonies live.</p>

<p>So what did we find? Under our experiments, the amount of pigment retained under high temperatures varied from 3% to 95%. This means at high temperatures, some coral colonies completely bleached while others seemed barely affected.</p>

<p>Of the 17 reefs we studied, 12 contained colonies with bleaching thresholds in the top 25%. This means heat-tolerant corals could be found at most of the reefs we sampled.</p>

<h3><strong>Nature versus nurture</strong></h3>

<p>Corals handle stress differently for two reasons: nature and nurture.</p>

<p>Each coral has a unique “nature” or genetic makeup that can affect its heat tolerance. Our results suggest corals found across the entire Great Barrier Reef may hold unique genetic resources that are important for recovery and adaptation.</p>

<p>However, aspects of the marine environment may nurture, or hinder, a coral's heat stress response. These include water temperatures, nutrient conditions, and the symbiotic algae living inside coral tissue.</p>

<p>We found corals living in warmer regions, such as the northern Great Barrier Reef, can handle higher water temperatures. However, because the water is so warm in these areas, the corals are already pushed close to their temperature limits.</p>

<p>Corals in the southern Great Barrier Reef cannot handle temperatures as high as their northern neighbours. Our findings suggest these corals can tolerate more warming above their local temperatures than corals to the north.</p>

<p>These tolerance patterns may affect which corals survive marine heat waves.</p>

<h3><strong>Giving our reefs a future</strong></h3>

<p>Our findings have potentially important implications for the ability of corals to adapt to warmer seas under climate change.</p>

<p>The results may also inform reef restoration and conservation efforts. For example, heat-tolerant parent corals could be <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abg6070">selectively bred</a> to produce offspring better suited to warmer waters.</p>

<p>The success of such programs depends on the extent to which a coral's genetic makeup controls its tolerance to heat. So, the next step in this research is investigating these genetic differences.</p>

<p>Selective breeding trials are already <a href="https://gbrrestoration.org/">underway</a>, using the most heat-tolerant corals identified in this study.</p>

<p>When it comes to protecting our coral reefs, reducing greenhouse gas emissions is imperative. However, interventions such as selective breeding may be useful supplements to give coral reefs the best future possible.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <description><![CDATA[Yoga Nidra practice causes many changes in brain activity, including in areas involved in regulating emotions, mind wandering, and sleep.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The conscious sleep practice known as 'Yoga Nidra' has long fascinated people with its promise of improving mental and physical health. Now, Indian researchers have explored these effects by scanning brains with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology to understand its value better. Researchers from IIT Delhi, AIIMS Delhi, and Mahajan Imaging Delhi have conducted this study, which was published in the international journal Scientific Reports, exploring the neural mechanisms underlying 'Yoga Nidra'. The study shows how 'Yoga Nidra' practice brings deep relaxation and increased awareness. It also shows that more significant brain changes occur during 'Yoga Nidra' practice in individuals with greater experience in yoga/meditation.</p>

<p>According to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://home.iitd.ac.in/show.php?id=56&amp;in_sections=Research">release</a> by the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, the study, titled <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-63765-7"><em>"Functional connectivity changes in meditators and novices during 'Yoga Nidra' practice,"</em></a> included two groups: 30 meditators (householders with an average of 3000 hours of experience in meditation and/or yogic practices) and 31 matched novice controls. The study found that the Default Mode Network behaves differently (less connected) in experienced meditators compared to novices. This difference in brain communication patterns helps us understand how 'Yoga Nidra' modulates our brain functions, promoting a state of deep relaxation while staying aware.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://home.iitd.ac.in/show.php?id=56&amp;in_sections=Research">The study </a>found a strong link between the amount of meditation and yoga practice participants had and the reduction in DMN connectivity during 'Yoga Nidra'. In other words, the more hours participants spent practicing meditation and yoga, the more noticeable the changes in their brain activity during 'Yoga Nidra'. These results could potentially indicate that experienced meditators have reduced mind-wandering as compared to novices, leading to changes in the DMN connectivity.</p>

<p>The researchers behind this study say 'Yoga Nidra' (YN) practice, a meditative technique originating from the ancient Indian tradition, has garnered global attention for its potential to improve psychological well-being and health. Despite the growing interest in its clinical applications, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying neural correlates of YN remains largely unexplored.</p>

<p>"Literally translated as "Yogic Sleep Practice," 'Yoga Nidra' practice is typically attempted in <em>Shavasana</em>, a supine position resembling the stillness of a corpse, which contrasts it from other conventional meditation practices that require a seated, upright posture, thus making it suitable for MRI-based scanning approaches," the study authors said.</p>

<p>As the researchers involved in this project have found, "Yoga Nidra practice employs audio-guided instructions that systematically guide the awareness of the participant to different parts of the body, breathing, or mantras that aim to induce a deeply relaxed state, mirroring the serenity experienced during deep sleep but with conscious awareness in contrast to the self-regulated focus typically associated with focused attention styles of meditations."</p>

<p>The practitioner remains in a state of light withdrawal of the five senses (pratyahara) with four of their senses internalised and only the hearing still connects to the instructions. The exceptional allure of this technique stems not merely from the deep relaxation and mindful awareness it provides but also as a method to progressively master entering the most profound states of meditation (samadhi).</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/492-dead-in-israeli-strikes-on-hezbollah-strongholds-in-lebanon-6634643 ">Israeli airstrikes</a> on Monday killed at 492, including 35 children, in Lebanon, marking the deadliest attack on the country in nearly two decades. This came just days after thousands of pagers, still used in the country, exploded and killed at least 32 people and injured scores of others. Lebanon claimed Israel was behind those explosions as well.</p>

<p>Tensions between Israel and militant-group Hezbollah have escalated on unprecedented levels in the last year after Hamas' October 7 attack. Even though Hezbollah said it had nothing to do with the attack on Southern Israel, it has continued to support the militant group in Gaza where Israeli airstrikes have killed over 40,000 Palestinians and displaced nearly the entire population. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The shadow war</strong></p>

<p>The shadow war between Israeli intelligence agencies and Hezbollah goes back over 40 years. In the early 1980s, Israel invaded Lebanon to uproot the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). While Israel achieved an initial victory by forcing the PLO to withdraw from Beirut, a disastrous event in November 1982 marked the beginning of Israel's ongoing struggle against Hezbollah.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In one of the first major blows, a massive explosion destroyed the headquarters of Israel's internal intelligence service, Shin Bet, in the town of Tyre, killing 91 people. It was revealed to be one of the first suicide car bombings, orchestrated by militant Shia Islamists who would later go on to form Hezbollah.</p>

<p><strong>Hezbollah</strong></p>

<p>Founded in 1983 with Iranian backing, Hezbollah quickly became one of Israel's most formidable enemies. The organisation, adept at both guerilla warfare and covert operations, continued its efforts to destabilise Israeli targets both within and outside Lebanon. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Hezbollah conducted numerous attacks, including the bombings of the US and French military barracks in Beirut.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hezbollah managed to fund its operations through a vast network of supporters, including in South America, which emerged as a key aspect of the shadow war. The organisation's involvement in both legal and illegal activities, such as drug trafficking and money laundering, enabled it to amass significant resources, which Israel struggled to disrupt.<br />
<br />
A prime example of Hezbollah's global reach came in the early 1990s when following the assassination of Hezbollah leader Abbas al-Musawi by Israeli forces, the militant group retaliated by bombing the Israeli embassy and a Jewish community centre in Argentina's Buenos Aires, killing over 100 people.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Spy Ops</strong></p>

<p>However, Israel's spy agency Mossad also remained relentless. Mossad, in a series of high-profile assassinations, targeted senior Hezbollah and Iranian operatives involved in planning attacks against Israel.</p>

<p>The elusive Hezbollah military commander, Imad Mughniyeh, was a particular target of Israeli intelligence. Mughniyeh, credited with masterminding several high-profile attacks, including the 1983 bombings in Lebanon, evaded capture for decades. It wasn't until 2008 that Israeli forces, along with the CIA, succeeded in killing Mughniyeh with a car bomb in Damascus.</p>

<p>Hezbollah retaliated with numerous attempts to target Israeli embassies and civilians, including the 2012 suicide bus bombing in Bulgaria that killed five Israelis.</p>

<p>This year, in July 2024, Israel successfully eliminated two high-ranking Hezbollah officials, Fuad Shukr and Ibrahim Aqil. They were involved in the 1980s attacks on Israeli forces in Lebanon.</p>

<p>The shadow war has not been limited to conventional or even guerilla tactics. One of the most infamous attacks came in the form of the Stuxnet computer virus, a joint Israeli-American operation that targeted Iran's nuclear facilities in 2010. This cyberattack, which destroyed centrifuges at Iran's Natanz facility, marked the first known instance of a cyber operation causing physical damage.</p>

<p>Most recently, Hezbollah and Israel have engaged in a new type of high-tech warfare. In September 2024, Hezbollah acknowledged that a series of attacks involving exploding pagers and walkie-talkies had inflicted severe damage on the group. The operations bore the hallmarks of Mossad even though Israel has not officially claimed responsibility.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, called Israel's recent actions a “declaration of war”.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At a time when the global artificial intelligence revolution is already reshaping the world as it is redefining and revolutionising industries, economies, and even daily life sooner than expected, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has said that he believes that the arrival of superintelligence is just a few thousand days away.</p>

<p>In a recent blog post, titled <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://ia.samaltman.com/"><em>'The Intelligence Age',</em></a> the creator of the biggest generative AI tool ChatGPT, Mr Altman, said that, "It is possible that we will have superintelligence in a few thousand days! It may take longer, but I'm confident we'll get there."</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/openai-ceo-sam-altman-reveals-his-top-strategy-for-life-without-regrets-put-a-huge-premium-on-it-6627724"><strong>Also Read | OpenAI CEO Sam Altman Reveals His Top Strategy For Life Without Regrets: "Put A Huge Premium On It"</strong></a></p>

<p>"In the next couple of decades, we will be able to do things that would have seemed like magic to our grandparents. This phenomenon is not new, but it will be newly accelerated. People have become dramatically more capable over time; we can already accomplish things now that our predecessors would have believed to be impossible," he wrote.</p>

<p>Talking about the beginning of a new age in human life, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://ia.samaltman.com/">Mr Altman said</a>, "Technology brought us from the Stone Age to the Agricultural Age and then to the Industrial Age. From here, the path to the intelligence age is paved with computation, energy, and human will."</p>

<p>The biggest question that AI has raised till now is, "Will AI replace human jobs?" And in his blog, Mr Altman tried to address this issue, saying that "many of the jobs we do today would have looked like trifling wastes of time to people a few hundred years ago, but nobody is looking back at the past, wishing they were a lamplighter. If a lamplighter could see the world today, he would think the prosperity all around him was unimaginable. And if we could fast-forward a hundred years from today, the prosperity all around us would feel just as unimaginable."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk offered effusive praise for Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in brief remarks at an awards ceremony in New York, the latest sign of cosiness between a billionaire who's trying to get Donald Trump elected and a European leader at odds with her Group of Seven allies.</p>

<p>Musk, bestowing an Atlantic Council Global Citizen Award on Meloni, said it was an honour to present the accolade to "someone who is even more beautiful on the inside than she was on the outside."</p>

<p>"She's also someone who is authentic, honest, truthful - and that can't always be said about politicians," Musk added.</p>

<p>The remarks were in keeping with the warm relationship between Musk and Meloni, whose political roots on the right align her with Trump, even as she's backed the G-7's support of Ukraine in its struggle against the Russian invasion.</p>

<p>At a festival organized by Meloni's right-wing Brothers of Italy party in December, Musk exhorted the crowd to "make more Italians" and warned of unchecked migration while addressing Italy's birth rate, which is the lowest in Europe.</p>

<p>Meloni has refrained from backing either Trump or his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, saying she will work closely with whoever occupies the White House, given long-standing ties between the two countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After Musk spoke, Meloni delivered an implicit rebuke to the left, lamenting the desire to "to violently erase the symbols of our civilizations in the US as in Europe."</p>

<p>"I know that we should not be ashamed to use and defend words and concepts like nation and patriotism, words that mean more than a physical place," Meloni said. "They mean a state of mind to which one belongs."</p>

<p>Meloni is in New York with leaders from more than 190 other nations for the annual high-level meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. On Sunday, she met with Sundar Pichai and Sam Altman, the chief executives of Alphabet Inc. And OpenAI Inc.</p>

<p>The choice to give a Global Citizen Award to the prime minister, and have Musk present it, has angered some former and current Atlantic Council staff, Politico reported last week, given the dissonance between their views on Ukraine and immigration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meloni received the award "for her strong support of the EU and becoming the first female prime minister of Italy," according to a media package distributed by the Atlantic Council.</p>

<p>Musk has business interests in Italy. He and Meloni have scheduled a closed-door meeting later this month to discuss investment opportunities in Italy's space and artificial intelligence sectors, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Italy approved a new regulatory framework in June that grants foreign space companies permission to operate in the country, a move that it expects to generate investments of about &amp;#8364;7.3 billion ($8.1 billion).</p>

<p>Italy is already serviced by Musk's Starlink, which delivers broadband internet through a global network of more than 6,000 satellites operated by his Space Exploration Technologies Corp.</p>

<p>Meloni has also expressed interest in artificial intelligence, though she sounded a note of caution about the technology in a speech to the United Nations Summit of the Future earlier Monday. She called AI a "great multiplier" but warned it could widen global imbalances.</p>

<p>"Machines will not answer this question," she said. "Politics must guarantee that artificial intelligence remains controlled by humans and keeps humans at the centre."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

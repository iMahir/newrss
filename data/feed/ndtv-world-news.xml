       <description><![CDATA[Ms Levine emphasizes the importance of a well-presented resume, free of typos and inaccuracies.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Emily Levine, a seasoned executive at Career Group Companies, has interviewed countless candidates over her 15-year career. Her clientele includes high-profile individuals who rely on her to find top-tier staff. Ms Levine emphasizes the importance of a well-presented resume, free of typos and inaccuracies. She warns that even minor errors can significantly impact a candidate's chances, as they reflect a lack of attention to detail.</p>

<p>"I definitely have interviewed thousands and thousands of people throughout my 15-year career," she says. She shared that each interview process starts with a resume, and she needs to be convinced why she should move forward with that candidate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"If the resume is not presentable," she says, that can prevent her from passing it along. Here are two of her biggest red flags.</p>

<p>Typos raise eyebrows. "I've seen somebody spell their name wrong," says Levine. "I've seen somebody spell the name of their university incorrectly, or the company that they worked for." Ms Levine says the typos show a lack of attention to detail that reflects poorly on the candidate.</p>

<p>She shared that a single spelling error on a resume can be ignored, but more than that "doesn't look good," adding "it would discourage a company from meeting with a candidate."</p>

<p>Ms Levine revealed that she sometimes helps candidates and gives her feedback on the typos. She recommends every job-seeker "go back and double check all the information to make sure it's accurate" before submitting anything. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Second, a resume needs to be accurate.</p>

<p>"Don't try to fudge the dates [to] make a gap seem shorter" between jobs, says Ms Levine.</p>

<p>Don't lie on your resume. Citing an example, Ms Levine shared don't say you have a degree if you left school a few credits shy of graduating, or if you never attended at all. Some people are "embarrassed to say they don't have" a degree, she says, so they lie and say they do.</p>

<p>She emphasised that the truth will come out in a background check, she says, and it'll make it very hard for that prospective employer to trust you going forward.</p>

<p>"I've seen countless offers being pulled from candidates" who lie, she says.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[People who carry out a swatting prank call aim to fool emergency services into sending a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team to respond to the supposed emergency.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several of President-elect Donald Trump's cabinet and administration nominees were targeted this week with actions including bomb threats and "swatting," a spokesperson for the transition team said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The threats were made Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, and law enforcement acted quickly to ensure the safety of those targeted, spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. While bomb threats are a common occurrence, "swatting" is a less known phenomenon.</p>

<p>An FBI spokesperson said the bureau is aware of numerous bomb threats and swatting incidents targeting incoming administration nominees and appointees and is working with its law enforcement partners.</p>

<p><strong>What is Swatting?</strong></p>

<p>Swatting is the filing of false reports to police to induce a potentially heavy, armed response by officers at someone's home. Law enforcement experts see it as a form of intimidation or harassment that is increasingly being used to target prominent figures.</p>

<p>This is often creating a situation where a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team arrives ready for a possible violent encounter.</p>

<p>"The individuals who engage in this activity use technology to make it appear that the emergency call is coming from the victim's phone," said one FBI public announcement in 2013, titled, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/the-crime-of-swatting-fake-9-1-1-calls-have-real-consequences1"><em>"The Crime of 'Swatting': Fake 9-1-1 Calls Have Real Consequences - FBI.</em></a></p>

<p>"Sometimes swatting is done for revenge, sometimes as a prank. Either way, it is a serious crime, and one that has potentially dangerous consequences."</p>

<p>Most who engage in swatting are serial offenders also involved in other cyber crimes such as identity theft and credit card fraud, Kolbye said. They either want to brag about their swatting exploits or exact revenge on someone who angered them online.</p>

<p>Kevin Kolbye, an assistant special agent in charge in our Dallas Division suggests making a police report about any swatting threats you receive online. Such threats typically come from the online gaming community, where competitors can play and interact anonymously. With a report on file, if a 9-1-1 incident does occur at your home, the police will be aware that it could be a hoax.</p>

<p>"The FBI takes swatting very seriously," Kolbye said. "Working closely with industry and law enforcement partners, we continue to refine our technological capabilities and our investigative techniques to stop the thoughtless individuals who commit these crimes. The bottom line," he added, "is that swatting puts innocent people at risk."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly 30 years after being bought for just 10 pounds, a rare first edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone sold for 36,000 pounds at an auction on Wednesday. Unaware of the book's future worth, Christine McCulloch bought the copy for her son Adam in 1997 from a Stratford-upon-Avon bookstore. Now, the memorabilia has been sold for a fortune at an auction held at Lichfield, Staffordshire. The bidder paid £45,000, including a buyer's premium, reported <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx273wnvw9go" rel="nofollow noindex" target="_blank">BBC</a>.</p>

<p>According to Hansons Auctioneers, the book is one of 500 hardback copies printed during the first-ever print run in 1997. It was estimated to be worth between 30,000 pounds and 50,000 pounds.</p>

<p>Adam McCulloch, from Tansley, Derbyshire, said the copy had been stashed in a cupboard beneath the stairs of his family's old Chesterfield home. The family only became aware of its possible worth during the 2020 lockdown after reading about the sales of first editions.</p>

<p>"Once we got it verified it was a bit of a pinch yourself moment," he said.</p>

<p>Talking about her 1997 purchase, Christine McCulloch said, “We went in [the bookshop], bought it for 10 pounds. Adam really loved the book and it started this sort of fascination, as with so many children all over the world now.”</p>

<p>Adam believed it was the right time to sell the book so others could appreciate it.</p>

<p>"In some ways, I think having that bit of a story around it, some tea stains there and a folded over corner here where someone's enjoyed reading it - I think that adds to the magic," he said.</p>

<p>The Harry Potter book series, written by British author JK Rowling, consists of seven books written over 10 years. The series chronicles the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, who study at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Uniqlo doesn't use cotton from China's Xinjiang region to make its products, Tadashi Yanai, the chief executive of Fast Retailing, the company behind the global fashion chain, has said. "We're not using (cotton from Xinjiang)," Yanai said in Tokyo. "By mentioning which cotton we're using..." he continued but paused and concluded, "Actually, it gets too political if I say anymore so let's stop here".</p>

<p>Although cotton from Xinjiang is considered among the best fabrics around the world, it fell out of favour after it came to light that the Muslim Uyghur minority was pushed into forced labour to produce it, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79zqdl7j2go">BBC</a> reported.</p>

<p>China stands as a crucial market for Uniqlo from both customers' points of view and as a major manufacturing hub.</p>

<p>Earlier, tough regulations from the US came into effect on the import of goods from China's Xinjiang region.</p>

<p>In recent times, several global companies have removed products made using cotton from Xinjiang from their shelves. This ultimately led to a fierce backlash in China where big names such as Nike, Adidas, H&amp;M, Nike, Burberry and Esprit were boycotted.</p>

<p>H&amp;M witnessed its clothes removed from major e-commerce stores in China.</p>

<p>Addressing the issue then, Yanai, who is the richest man in Japan, refused to deny or confirm whether Uniqlo was using cotton from Xinjiang. He simply said he wanted to be "neutral between the US and China".</p>

<p>As a result, his decision helped the Japanese brand to remain quite popular in the retail market of China.</p>

<p>While Uniqlo expands its business in Europe and the US, Yanai said, "We are not a known brand globally," adding that Asia remains its biggest market.</p>

<p>As far as the company's presence in China is concerned, it has more stores in the country than Japan, its home country. And Yanai said he was not planning to change that strategy despite the challenges in the second-biggest economy in the world.</p>

<p>He said that while there are 1.4 billion people in China, they only have 900 to 1,000 stores there. "I think we can increase that to 3,000," he added.</p>

<p>Apart from China, the company also makes clothes in India, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Indonesia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An endangered type of cockatoo found only in southwest Australia is among the longest-living bird species in the world, according to a new research.</p>

<p>The research, published in the Pacific Conservation Biology on Thursday, found that Carnaby's cockatoos can live for up to 35 years in the wild, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>The Carnaby's cockatoo is a large black cockatoo endemic to the southwest of Australia's state of Western Australia (WA). It has been officially recognised as an endangered species since 1999.</p>

<p>The research team from the WA Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions looked at eight live wild birds, five females and three males, and found their ages ranged from 21 to 35 years.</p>

<p>It puts the species in the top 2 per cent of all wild birds globally in terms of longevity.</p>

<p>The oldest bird, a male, was photographed by the researchers in 2021 and identified by a leg band it was fitted in November 1986.</p>

<p>"This sighting was the first time the cockatoo had been observed since the breeding season in 1986 when it fledged from a nest hollow 5.7 kilometres from where it was photographed," the study said.</p>

<p>"Its estimated hatching date was September 24, 1986, and it was 35 years old when photographed. This is the oldest living Carnaby's cockatoo recorded in the wild."</p>

<p>All eight of the studied birds were still breeding at the time when they were photographed by the researchers.</p>

<p>The 35-year-old had strayed the furthest from its natal site, with the remaining seven all remaining within 2.5 kilometres.</p>

<p>The researchers said that the findings show that conservation efforts for the species should focus on older adults as well as juveniles.</p>

<p>They said it is important for the species' sustainable survival that adults live out their long lifespans and continue breeding.</p>

<p>Carnaby's cockatoos have a low rate of reproduction, with females typically laying only two eggs every year and fledging one hatchling. Juveniles also have low survival rates in the wild -- all characteristics the researchers said are shared by fellow long-living birds such as albatrosses and petrels.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian-origin NASA astronaut Sunita Williams is set to celebrate Thanksgiving in space with ‘smoked turkey, mashed potato'.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving is observed every year in the US on the fourth Thursday of November to honour the blessings and harvest of the year.</p>

<p>“Our Crew up here just wanted to say Happy Thanksgiving to all our friends and family who are down on Earth and everyone who is supporting us,” Williams said in a video message, shared by NASA on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The astronauts shared that NASA has provided them with food items like butternut squash, apples, sardines, and smoked turkey for the occasion.</p>

<p>In a recent interview with NBC News, Williams shared her plans of celebrating the day, along with other astronauts -- Butch Wilmore, Nick Hague and Aleksandr Gorbunov -- aboard the International Space Station (ISS).</p>

<p>The plans include watching the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and a lavish feast with “some smoked turkey, some cranberry, apple cobbler, green beans and mushrooms and mashed potatoes.”</p>

<p>In June Williams and Butch Willmore became the first to ride the much-delayed Starliner, developed by Boeing.</p>

<p>What began as an eight-day sojourn on the International Space Station (ISS) has now extended to eight months in space for Williams and Willmore as the faulty Starliner was declared unfit for human travel by NASA.</p>

<p>While Starliner is back on Earth unharmed, Williams is expected to return to Earth onboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule in February 2025.</p>

<p>Amid concerns for their prolonged stay in space, NASA recently said that both Williams and Willmore “are safe aboard the space station”. Williams also said that she is “feeling good, working out, and eating right,” amid claims of her weight loss in space.</p>

<p>The Indian-Origin astronaut also celebrated Diwali "from 260 miles above the earth on the ISS".</p>

<p>According to NASA, "Sunita has spent a cumulative total of 322 days in space”, and she is the second woman astronaut with the highest number of spacewalks.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mark Zuckerberg joined Donald Trump for dinner at his Mar-a-Lago estate Wednesday, with an advisor to the president-elect saying the tech billionaire "wants to support the national renewal of America."</p>

<p>The 40-year-old chief executive of Meta -- which owns Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp -- has been carefully trying to mend ties with Trump.</p>

<p>Both men have had a strained relationship over the years, with Facebook being among social media networks that banned Trump after the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.</p>

<p>But on Wednesday, a Meta spokesperson said: "Mark was grateful for the invitation to join President Trump for dinner and the opportunity to meet with members of his team about the incoming Administration."</p>

<p>In a statement, the spokesperson added that it was an important time for the future of American innovation.</p>

<p>It was not immediately clear if billionaire Elon Musk, a close Trump ally who previously challenged Zuckerberg to a cage match fight, also attended the dinner, though he has frequently been present at Mar-a-Lago since the election.</p>

<p>Stephen Miller, Trump's incoming deputy chief of staff for policy, told Fox News on Wednesday that Zuckerberg "has been very clear about his desire to be a supporter of, and a participant in, this change that we're seeing all around America."</p>

<p>"He's made clear that he wants to support the national renewal of America under President Trump's leadership," Miller said in a televised interview.</p>

<p>While treading cautiously in Trump's first term, tech titans were quick to laud the Republican's election victory this time -- with Zuckerberg among those who offered his congratulations.</p>

<p>Before the election, Zuckerberg stopped election-related philanthropy and Meta modified its algorithms to reduce political content.</p>

<p>Zuckerberg had previously contributed large sums to fund nonprofits working to support US electoral infrastructure during the Covid pandemic.</p>

<p>The donations had been seized upon by Trump after his 2020 loss to Joe Biden, falsely alleging that they were part of a plot to swing the election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The US Federal Trade Commission has opened an antitrust investigation of Microsoft Corporation, drilling into everything from the company's cloud computing and software licensing businesses to cybersecurity offerings and AI products.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Federal Trade Commission has opened an antitrust investigation of Microsoft Corp., drilling into everything from the company's cloud computing and software licensing businesses to cybersecurity offerings and artificial intelligence products.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After more than a year of conducting informal interviews with competitors and business partners, antitrust enforcers have crafted a detailed request to force Microsoft to turn over information, according to people familiar with the matter. The demand, which is hundreds of pages long, has been sent to the company after FTC Chair Lina Khan signed off, said one of the people.</p>

<p>FTC antitrust lawyers are set to meet with Microsoft competitors next week to gather more information about the Redmond, Washington-based company's business practices, according to two other people familiar with the plans who like the others asked not to be named discussing a confidential matter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Microsoft and the FTC declined to comment.</p>

<p>The FTC's scrutiny of Microsoft's cloud computing business gained steam after a string of cybersecurity incidents that involved the company's products. The company is a top government contractor, providing billions of dollars in software and cloud services to US agencies including the Defense Department.</p>

<p>The Microsoft information demand is one of Khan's parting shots as she steps down after helming one of the most aggressive pushes against consolidated corporate power the agency has delivered in decades. While business leaders are hoping that President-elect Donald Trump will usher in an era of lighter regulation, it will fall to his new FTC chair — still unnamed — to decide how to proceed with the case.</p>

<p>The FTC inquiry renews scrutiny of Microsoft for its business practices more than 25 years after the government sued the company over similar conduct involving bundling its Windows operating system and browser and unsuccessfully tried to break it up.</p>

<p>A key focus of the current probe is Microsoft's bundling of both its popular office productivity and security software with its cloud offerings, according to the people familiar with the information request. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Microsoft's cybersecurity failings, combined with its heft as a government contractor, are seen by the FTC as an example of the company's problematic power over the market, those people said.</p>

<p>In a November 2023 report, the FTC highlighted concerns that the concentrated nature of the cloud market means that “outages, or other issues that degrade the service of a cloud provider, could have a cascading impact on the economy or specific sectors.”</p>

<p>The CrowdStrike crash that affected millions of devices operating on Microsoft Windows systems earlier this year was itself a testament to the widespread use of the company's products and how it directly affects the global economy.</p>

<p>A portion of the probe is focused on the company's practices related to security software called Microsoft Entra ID — formerly known as Azure Active Directory — which helps authenticate users logging in to cloud-based software, some of the people said.</p>

<p>Competitors have complained that Microsoft's licensing terms and bundling of software with cloud services makes it harder for rival authentication and cybersecurity companies to compete.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Companies such as Salesforce Inc.'s Slack and Zoom Communications Inc. have said that Microsoft's practice of giving away its Teams video-conferencing software for free in a bundle with popular software products like Word and Excel is anticompetitive and makes it harder for them to compete.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The standoff between the Pakistani government and the supporters of former Prime Minister Imran Khan has reached a boiling point. With deadly clashes, sweeping arrests, and widespread discontent, Pakistan once again faces political turmoil.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Imran Khan, the former cricket star turned politician, has been in jail since August 2023 on corruption charges. His detention followed a turbulent year in which his government was ousted via a parliamentary no-confidence vote in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since then, Mr Khan has faced over 150 legal cases ranging from corruption to sedition. His popularity, however, remains undiminished among his supporters, who view him as a victim of political vendettas by the ruling coalition led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Sunday, Imran Khan's party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), launched a march toward Islamabad, demanding the release of its jailed leader. Thousands of PTI supporters, led by Mr Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, and other senior party leaders, descended upon the capital.</p>

<p>Mr Khan was arrested in May 2023 arrest over allegations that he and Bushra Bibi, accepted land as a bribe through a trust. Mr Khan also faces anti-terrorism charges tied to clashes that followed his arrest. Other allegations include unlawfully disclosing state secrets in 2022, for which he was acquitted, and an unlawful marriage in 2018, also resulting in acquittal.</p>

<p>In August 2023, Mr Khan was arrested for allegedly selling state gifts, a case in which Bushra Bibi, now leading protests, was also implicated but granted bail in October. Though Mr Khan secured bail in November, he remains imprisoned on other charges.</p>

<h3><strong>Rally Turns Violent</strong></h3>

<p>What began as a support rally for Mr Khan quickly turned violent. By Tuesday night, the situation had escalated into full-scale clashes between protesters and law enforcement. Pakistani security forces, equipped with riot gear and backed by paramilitary personnel, deployed tear gas and barricades to contain the crowds. Protesters broke through multiple security checkpoints, reaching the edge of Islamabad's highly secured red zone, home to key government buildings and embassies.</p>

<p>Amid a blackout in central Islamabad, the Pakistani government launched an operation involving tear gas and mass detentions. The crackdown resulted in over 1,000 arrests, including many senior PTI leaders. At least four paramilitary personnel and six protesters were killed in the clashes, and dozens more were injured, according to news agency Reuters who cited local news reports. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In the aftermath of the raid, PTI announced a temporary suspension of its protest. Citing "state brutality," the party stated that it would regroup and strategise for future action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bushra Bibi and Ali Amin Gandapur, a senior PTI leader and chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, retreated to the party's northern stronghold. Mr Gandapur later assured supporters that the protests were not over.</p>

<h3><strong>Party Under Siege</strong></h3>

<p>The PTI described the midnight crackdown as a "massacre" orchestrated by a "fascist military regime." Party officials alleged that live ammunition was used against demonstrators, accusations vehemently denied by the government. Videos circulated on social media allegedly showed excessive use of force by law enforcement.</p>

<p>PTI also claimed that its workers were killed in the operation, with reports suggesting as many as 40 deaths. However, these numbers remain unverified, and government officials have dismissed the allegations as "propaganda."</p>

<p>According to Islamabad Police, 954 protesters were detained between Sunday and Tuesday, with more than 600 arrests occurring on Tuesday alone. Law enforcement defended its actions, arguing that the protests had devolved into "terrorism" after security personnel were targeted and public property was damaged.</p>

<h3><strong>Government's Response</strong></h3>

<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's coalition government has deployed massive security forces, shut down mobile internet services, and banned public gatherings in Islamabad.</p>

<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi dismissed PTI's allegations of excessive force, accusing the party of spreading misinformation to justify its actions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>Claim:&nbsp;</strong>Video of a cloud sinking/ falling from the sky in Indonesia.</p>

<p><strong>Fact:&nbsp;</strong>The white substance seen in the video is not an actual cloud falling from the sky. The Indonesian Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) Director confirmed that it is most likely a condensation of water vapour or gas created due to human activity and not a natural cloud. Hence, the claim made in the post is&nbsp;<strong>False</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>“Andri explained that the clouds cannot fall to the surface as dense clumps because the particles are very light and scattered with low density. This is because clouds are a collection of very small and light water droplets or ice crystals, so they continue to float in the atmosphere with the help of air currents.”</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://voi.id/en/news/434278" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">VOI reported</a>. He further said that cloud particles generally evaporate before reaching the ground.</p>

<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/cloud/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">National Geographic</a>, clouds are a visual accumulation of water droplets in the Earth's atmosphere, and they are found at heights of 2000-12000 meters above the Earth's surface.

       <description><![CDATA[Before her death on August 9, the ex-YouTube CEO wrote a final letter and talked about lung cancer diagnosis and efforts to research the disease.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>YouTube has shared a heartfelt letter from its former CEO, Susan Wojcicki, three months after she died from lung cancer at the age of 56. The letter, penned just weeks before her death, was released this month in recognition of Lung Cancer Awareness Month. The letter was released on November 25.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the message, Wojcicki reflected on her battle with the disease and highlighted the critical need for improved treatments. She also underscored the fact that lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women.</p>

<p>"At the end of 2022, I was diagnosed with lung cancer. I had almost no symptoms and was running a few miles a day at the time. I had never smoked so I was totally shocked with this diagnosis. My life changed dramatically after that day. I decided to resign from my role as CEO of YouTube, to focus on my health and my family. I was able to live an almost normal life, thanks to modern medicine," she wrote.</p>

<p>After stepping down from her role as YouTube's CEO following her diagnosis, Susan Wojcicki remained active, serving on the boards of companies such as Salesforce, Planet Labs, and Waymo. In her letter, she shared how her illness profoundly altered her perspective on life.</p>

<p>"Having cancer hasn't been easy. As a person, I have changed a lot, and probably the most important lesson I have learned is just to focus and enjoy the present! Life is unpredictable for everyone, with many unknowns, but there is a lot of beauty in everyday life. My goals going forward are to enjoy the present as much as possible and fight for better understanding and cures for this disease," she added.</p>

<p>Wojcicki died on August 10 after a two-year battle with lung cancer. Her legacy now encompasses a dedication to raising awareness and advocating for progress in cancer treatments.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Generational cohorts, from the Greatest Generation to Generation Alpha, reveal how historical, cultural, and technological influences shape societies.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gen Z, Millennials, and Baby Boomers are examples of generational categories that provide insight into how common historical, cultural, and technological factors change societies. These groups, which often last 15 to 20 years, offer valuable perspectives on parenting approaches, cultural norms, and group dynamics. The main generational cohorts and their characteristics are broken down here.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>1: The Greatest Generation (1901-1927)</strong></p>

<p>They lived through the Great Depression and served in World War II. This group is known as the "GI Generation." Popularized by Tom Brokaw's book The Greatest Generation, their values revolved around resilience, hard work, and patriotism. Events such as the Roaring Twenties and the Stock Market Crash shaped their ethos.</p>

<p><strong>2: The Silent Generation (1928-1945)</strong></p>

<p>This group, which was notorious for conforming during the McCarthy era, saw the end of World War II, the start of the Cold War, and the emergence of television. Their practical philosophy placed a strong focus on stability and discipline in both life and parenting.</p>

<p><strong>3: Baby Boomers (1946-1964)</strong></p>

<p>Born during the post-war population boom, Boomers were shaped by the Vietnam War, civil rights movements, and countercultural revolutions. They pushed for higher education and upward mobility, redefining societal norms.</p>

<p><strong>4: Generation X (1965-1980)</strong></p>

<p>This generation grew up amid the rise of personal computers, video games, and the AIDS crisis. Known for valuing independence and work-life balance, their parenting emphasized choice and individuality.</p>

<p><strong>5: The Millennial Generation (1981-1996)</strong></p>

       <description><![CDATA[This "once-in-a-lifetime" find is believed to be the first message in a bottle ever discovered inside a Scottish lighthouse.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Engineers have uncovered a 132-year-old message in a bottle hidden within the walls of a lighthouse in southern Scotland. The discovery was made at Corsewall Lighthouse, located at the northernmost tip of the Rhins of Galloway, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cje0x5j7wgjo" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>BBC </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This "once-in-a-lifetime" find is believed to be the first message in a bottle ever discovered inside a Scottish lighthouse. Written in quill and ink, the note, dated September 4, 1892, lists the names of three engineers who installed a new type of light in the 100-foot (30-meter) tower, along with the names of the lighthouse's three keepers.</p>

<p>Ross Russell, a mechanical engineer with the Northern Lighthouse Board, found the 8-inch (20 cm) bottle while inspecting the lighthouse. It was wedged behind panels in a cupboard and out of reach. The team used a makeshift tool- a rope attached to a broom handle- to retrieve it. They waited for Barry Miller, the retained lighthouse keeper, to arrive before opening the bottle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"My goodness, am I grateful for them doing that," Miller said.</p>

<p>The bottle, made of coarse glass filled with tiny air bubbles, features a distinctive convex base that prevents it from standing upright. It is thought to have once contained oil. The cork stopper had expanded over time, adhering to the glass, while the securing wire had rusted away. To access the message, the team carefully cut and drilled through the cork.</p>

<p>Extracting the note proved challenging as it initially appeared too large to fit through the bottle's narrow neck. Using a custom tool crafted from two pieces of cable, the team gently twisted the message free.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr. Miller, 77, recounted the moment he opened the bottle to BBC Scotland News, admitting his hands were trembling with excitement.</p>

<p><em>Corsewall Light &amp; Fog Signal Station, Sept 4th 1892.</em></p>

<p><em>This lantern was erected by James Wells Engineer, John Westwood Millwright, James Brodie Engineer, David Scott Labourer, of the firm of James Milne &amp; Son Engineers, Milton House Works, Edinburgh, during the months from May to September and relighted on Thursday night 15th Sept 1892.</em></p>

<p><em>The following are keepers at the station at this time, John Wilson Principal, John B Henderson 1st assistant, John Lockhart 2nd assistant.</em></p>

<p><em>The lens and machine were supplied by James Dove &amp;Co Engineers Greenside Edinburgh and erected by William Burness, John Harrower, and James Dods. Engineers with the above firm.</em></p>

<p>The bottle was found by Ross Russell, Morgan Dennison and Neil Armstrong.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The note was just sensational, I was just in utter amazement," Ross said.</p>

<p>"Being the first person to touch the bottle after 132 years was just mind blowing.</p>

<p>"It's a once in a lifetime find."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A young Belgian YouTube adventurer, Storm De Beul, has tragically lost his life in a severe snowstorm while trekking alone in the frozen landscapes of Swedish Lapland. The 22-year-old, known for sharing his daring expeditions online, sent heartbreaking final messages to his loved ones before succumbing to the extreme weather.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.leuvenactueel.be/nieuws/leuven/storm-de-beul-22-overleden-tijdens-trektocht-in-zweeds-lapland?nid=20998"><em>Leuven Actueel, </em></a>YouTuber Storm was out in the woods close to Jokkmokk on October 30 when the blizzard came in. He called the emergency services around 2 am as the situation kept worsening and he was feeling some injuries, requesting assistance as soon as possible, but snow fell relentlessly while strong winds hampered the rescuers in making it to him.</p>

<p>De Beul was about a day's walk away from his car and had been heading back to the vehicle when the storm struck the Jokkmokk region of the Scandinavian country.&nbsp;The next day, his lifeless body was discovered in the remote woods. Storm had also shared a video message with a friend as the storm closed in. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"Tonight, it's going to get worse. Jesus Christ," he said, showing how heavy snow was already filling his backpack and shoes.</p>

<p>"It's snowing heavily here," he said to his grandmother in a separate message. "But don't worry, I'll survive, you know."</p>

<p>Storm's family is devastated by the loss of the adventurous young man, whose passion for exploration inspired thousands.</p>

<p>His death has sent shockwaves through his fan base and the wider community, prompting reflections on the risks faced by outdoor enthusiasts. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"A very sad message: my eldest grandson, our sporty loner Storm, 22 years old, was found dead on October 30th in Swedish Lapland, where he had been doing outdoor trekking since this summer. He was surprised by a snowstorm one day away from his final destination, before the rescue services could leave because of the bad weather," Storm's grandmother Hedwig DJ told&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.leuvenactueel.be/nieuws/leuven/storm-de-beul-22-overleden-tijdens-trektocht-in-zweeds-lapland?nid=20998"><em>Leuven Actueel.&nbsp;</em></a></p>

<p>"The funeral had to be postponed; only after a long procedure could his body be repatriated."</p>

<p>Three weeks after the accident, the body was brought to our country, and the funeral took place on Saturday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The magazine placed Rihanna at No. 3, Drake at No. 4, Lady Gaga at No. 5, and Britney Spears at No. 6.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taylor Swift was recently ranked the second greatest pop star of the 21st century by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/taylor-swift-greatest-pop-stars-21st-century-1235839222/" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>Billboard </em></a>magazine, which has gradually revealed its list through a series of articles. According to Billboard, the ranking highlights "the artists who have most defined pop stardom for the last 25 years."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The magazine placed Rihanna at No. 3, Drake at No. 4, Lady Gaga at No. 5, and Britney Spears at No. 6. Swift's ranking is notably five spots above Ye (formerly Kanye West), with whom she has had a long-standing feud. Other prominent artists below Swift include Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande, Adele, and Usher.</p>

<p>Previously, Swift was named Billboard's Top Artist of 2023. In an accompanying piece, Billboard writer Hannah Dailey explained Swift's influence, stating that by "honouring all the traits that made her different," she managed to "gravitationally bend culture to her will" and emerge as one of the world's most undisputed pop stars, despite starting her career in country music. Dailey acknowledged that Swift's second-place ranking might spark controversy but argued that it highlights her immense cultural impact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The fact that controversy will likely tear through the internet over her being just one small space below No. 1 is just another testament to her power," Dailey wrote, adding that Swifties likely wouldn't stay upset for long, considering her relatively late entry into pop music.</p>

<p>This recognition caps off a monumental year for Swift. In February, she made history as the first artist to win the Grammy for Album of the Year four times. She was also named Time magazine's 2023 Person of the Year and, as of October, was recognized by Forbes as the richest female musician with a net worth of $1.6 billion. Additionally, her Eras Tour became the highest-grossing concert tour of all time. Her latest album, The Tortured Poets Department, broke records in April by earning over 300 million streams on Spotify daily.</p>

<p>Billboard has yet to reveal the top spot on its list, but many fans speculate it will go to Beyonce, who has not appeared in the rankings so far. As predicted, some of Swift's fans voiced disappointment on social media, with one user on X calling the ranking a "joke" and insisting Swift deserved the top spot. Others, particularly those who expect Beyonce to be No. 1, felt the ranking was fair.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Taylor has been bigger in recent years, but Beyonce has been huge since the very beginning of this century," wrote one Reddit user who identified as a fan of both artists.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>International Holding Co's (IHC) outlook on investments in India's Adani Group remains unchanged, the Abu Dhabi conglomerate said, in response to a US indictment of billionaire Gautam Adani.</p>

<p>"Our partnership with the Adani Group reflects our confidence in their contributions to the green energy and sustainability sectors," IHC said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"As with all our investments, our team continues to evaluate relevant information and developments. At this time, our outlook on these investments remains unchanged."</p>

<p>Last week US authorities accused Adani, his nephew and executive director Sagar Adani and managing director of Adani Green, Vneet S. Jaain, of being part of a scheme to pay bribes of $265 million to secure Indian power supply contracts and misleading U.S. investors.</p>

<p>The ports-to-power conglomerate denied the charges as "baseless" and vowed to seek "all possible legal recourse".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p><br />

       <description><![CDATA[Before the war, Ukraine already hosted tens of thousands of tourists every year in Chernobyl, which saw the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spanish traveller Alberto Blasco Ventas looked out at Ukraine's destroyed Irpin bridge, blown up to stop Russian troops in 2022 and now a hotspot for thrill-seeking tourists visiting the country.</p>

<p>Russian forces had planned to cross the bridge in their attempts to seize the Ukrainian capital Kyiv at the beginning of the war.</p>

<p>The Russian army has since retreated hundreds of kilometres away, but launches near-daily missile and drone strikes on the Ukrainian capital that Blasco Ventas chose as his vacation spot.</p>

<p>"It's my first time in a war zone," the 23-year-old software engineer said. "I'm a little bit scared, I'm not going to lie, because you never know."</p>

<p>He was on a "dark tourism" tour offered by one of a dozen or so Ukrainian companies specialising in a marginal but growing sector -- allowing tourists to visit locations of tragic events.</p>

<p>To get to Ukraine, he shrugged off concerns expressed by his family and got on a flight to Moldova, followed by an 18-hour train ride.</p>

<p>The wannabe influencer filmed every step of the trip, which he planned to post on his YouTube channel -- followed by 115,000 people -- where he has already chronicled the "most horrible psychiatric hospital" in the United States and "the most dangerous border" in the world, between China, Russia and North Korea.</p>

<p><strong>'Like a vaccine'</strong></p>

<p>Before the war, Ukraine already hosted tens of thousands of tourists every year in Chernobyl, which saw the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986.</p>

<p>Answering critics that would consider such trips morbid or immoral, Blasco Ventas insisted he was acting "with respect".</p>

<p>War Tours, which organised his visit, said it has accommodated around 30 customers since January, mainly Europeans and Americans paying between 150 euros ($157) and 250 euros ($262) for the whole tour.</p>

<p>Part of the profits are given to the army, said company co-founder Dmytro Nykyforov who insisted the initiative was "not about money, it's about memorialization of the war."</p>

<p>Svitozar Moiseiv, the manager of tourism company Capital Tours Kyiv, said profits are negligible but the visits have an educational value.</p>

<p>"It's like a vaccine to prevent this from ever happening again," he said.</p>

<p>The visits generally centre around Kyiv and its suburbs that saw alleged massacres from Russian troops in the early 2022.</p>

<p>But some companies come closer to the front -- including a visit of several days in southern Ukraine costing up to 3,300 euros.</p>

<p><strong>'The next best thing'</strong></p>

<p>American Nick Tan, who works in finance for a New York tech company, was among those who wanted to go even further than Kyiv.</p>

<p>So he went in July to Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city that faces constant bombing from Russian forces, located around 20 kilometres away.</p>

<p>"I just wanted to see it because I think our lives in the West are just too comfortable and too easy," the 34-year-old said.</p>

<p>He said he wanted to get even closer to the front but was met with his guide's refusal.</p>

<p>The self-described thrill-seeker said he had already gone skydiving, regularly attended boxing classes and raves.</p>

<p>"Jumping out of planes and partying all night and punching people in the face just didn't do it for me anymore. So what's the next best thing? Going to a war zone."</p>

<p>His quest baffled some residents of the scarred Irpin suburb, who live under the constant threat of Russian air attacks.</p>

<p>"A Shahed drone recently fell 300 metres away from my house. I wouldn't have any desire to live through this kind of experience," said Ruslan Savchuk, 52.</p>

<p>"But if people want that for themselves, it's their right," he said.</p>

<p>Savchuk advises Irpin on its tourism strategy as a volunteer.</p>

<p>"Even a subject as difficult as war can lead to something good," he said, adding that tourists could generate useful incomes for local communities.</p>

<p><strong>'See our grief'</strong></p>

<p>But Mykhailyna Skoryk-Shkarivska, local councillor in Irpin and former deputy mayor of Bucha, said most residents are fine with "dark tourism" but some consider the profits from it as "blood money".</p>

<p>"There are accusations -- 'Why do you come here? Why do you want to see our grief?'," she said, recalling conversations with locals.</p>

<p>Mariana Oleskiv, head of the National Agency for Tourism Development, said the development of war tourism posed many ethical questions but that the market was bound to grow.</p>

<p>Her agency was preparing specific training for guides, as well as memorial tours in the Kyiv region.</p>

<p>The Russian invasion triggered an immediate collapse of the tourism industry, but the sector's revenues should this year exceed those of 2021 -- a year marked by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>That growth mainly comes from domestic tourism fuelled by Ukrainian men of fighting age who are generally not allowed to leave the country due to martial law.</p>

<p>Ukraine even recorded 4 million foreign visitors last year, according to Oleskiv.</p>

<p>The number is twice as high as it was in 2022, but comprises mainly business travellers.</p>

<p>Ukraine is already preparing for the post-war period, including by signing deals with Airbnb and TripAdvisor.</p>

<p>"War brought attention to Ukraine, so we have stronger brand. Everybody knows about our country," Oleskiv said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A CBS News poll found that 71 percent of Americans will try to avoid discussing politics during the holiday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Millions of Americans are reuniting with loved ones for the Thanksgiving holiday this week, but not 59-year-old Jeff, whose opposition to Donald Trump in the US election has seen him ostracized by his family.</p>

<p>"They don't want to speak with us," Jeff, who did not want to share his last name to avoid his family cutting him off altogether, said of him and his husband.</p>

<p>A real estate agent in Washington, Jeff said his brother "thinks gay people should be sentenced to death" and has not spoken to him for five years due to his sexuality.</p>

<p>"My parents and my brother are MAGA supporters. Extreme, extreme MAGA supporters," Jeff said, referring to Trump's "Make America Great Again" political movement.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving, the annual US tradition marked by a feast, will be the first time many Americans reconcile with relatives since the divisive November 5 election.</p>

<p>A CBS News poll found that 71 percent of Americans will try to avoid discussing politics during the holiday.</p>

<p>But many, like Jeff, will find the tension too much to bear.</p>

<p><strong>'Slap in the face'</strong></p>

<p>Deb Miedema, 50, has prepared Thanksgiving dinner in the midwestern state of Minnesota for her family for more than two decades -- but this year has decided to cancel the festivities.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine preparing a meal for 40 people and half of them are OK with this situation," she told AFP. "Trump doesn't stop telling lies, he's a criminal, and all of that is fine with them."</p>

<p>She said the Republican's election victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, "felt like a slap in the face."</p>

<p>Laurie Kramer, a psychology professor at Northeastern University, said that people need to find ways to tolerate one another to preserve family relationships.</p>

<p>"In our society, we all think that family should be joyous," she said, but when that is not the case "people feel depressed, alone, isolated."</p>

<p><strong>'Accept each other'</strong></p>

<p>Ana, whose name was changed at her request to protect her identity, typically visits her grandmother's house near Philadelphia, but this year lied that she was sick.</p>

<p>"I come from a big Italian family with 18 aunts and uncles. My uncles love Trump," the 31-year-old said. "I don't want to see my cousins being raised this way."</p>

<p>She added that Thanksgiving felt like it had come too soon after the US election.</p>

<p>"I'm feeling very isolated, alone," Ana said, adding that she plans instead to mark the holiday with friends in New York.</p>

<p>Spencer Roberts, 35, is in a similar situation after a discussion with relatives about his left-leaning views turned awry on his last trip home.</p>

<p>"I was really vocal about being more left and saying some of their thoughts and beliefs were not correct, and that caused a lot of tension in my family," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Kramer, the professor, said that deep political divisions like these have a negative impact on both individuals and families.</p>

<p>"We have to accept that everyone is different and find ways to accept each other over our differences to preserve important relationships," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Over 90 percent of deaths linked to air pollution from landscape fires were in low and middle-income countries, with nearly 40 percent in sub-Saharan Africa alone.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Air pollution caused by fires is linked to more than 1.5 million deaths a year worldwide, the vast majority occurring in developing countries, a major new study said on Thursday.</p>

<p>This death toll is expected to rise in the coming years as climate change makes wildfires more frequent and intense, according to the study in The Lancet journal.</p>

<p>The international team of researchers looked at existing data on "landscape fires", which include both wildfires that rage through nature and planned fires such as controlled burns on farming land.</p>

<p>Around 450,000 deaths a year from heart disease were linked to fire-related air pollution between 2000 and 2019, the researchers said.</p>

<p>A further 220,000 deaths from respiratory disease were attributed to the smoke and particulates spewed into the air by fire.</p>

<p>From all causes around the world, a total of 1.53 million annual deaths were associated with air pollution from landscape fires, according to the study.</p>

<p>More than 90 percent of these deaths were in low and middle-income countries, it added, with nearly 40 percent in sub-Saharan Africa alone.</p>

<p>The countries with the highest death tolls were China, the Democratic Republic of Congo, India, Indonesia, and Nigeria.</p>

<p>A record amount of illegal burning of farm fields in northern India has been partly blamed for noxious smog that has recently been choking the capital New Delhi.</p>

<p>The authors of the Lancet study called for "urgent action" to address the huge death toll from landscape fires.</p>

<p>The disparity between rich and poor nations further highlights "climate injustice", in which those who have contributed the least to global warming suffer from it the most, they added.</p>

<p>Some of the ways people can avoid smoke from fires -- such as moving away from the area, using air purifiers and masks, or staying indoors -- are not available to people in poorer countries, the researchers pointed out.</p>

<p>So they called for more financial and technological support for people in the hardest-hit countries.</p>

<p>The study was released a week after UN climate talks where delegates agreed to a boost in climate funding that developing countries slammed as insufficient.</p>

<p>It also came after Ecuador declared a national emergency over forest fires that have razed more than 10,000 hectares in the country's south.</p>

<p>The world has also been battered by hurricanes, droughts, floods and other extreme weather events during what is expected to be the hottest year in recorded history.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Norwegian diplomat and former UN Environment Programme Executive Director Erik Solheim has questioned the US government report on the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/adani-group" target="_blank">Adani Group</a>, calling it a case of "American overreach." Speaking out on global media coverage of the report, Mr Solheim asked, "When will American overreach stop?"</p>

<p>The US report accuses certain Adani Group-linked individuals of discussing bribes to secure solar energy contracts in India. However, Mr Solheim pointed out that the allegations lack evidence of actual bribe payments or involvement of top Adani leaders. Mr Solheim said that such actions by US authorities hinder India's green energy transformation and disrupt one of the country's largest economic powerhouses.</p>

<p>"When will American overreach stop? The last week global media have been full of stories about indictment against the Adani Group by an American Prosecutor. It is time the world starts asking when American overreach will stop. Let's turn the table for a second and assume that an Indian Court charged top American business executives for crimes allegedly done in the US. Would this be acceptable to America? Would American media find it appropriate?" he posted on X.&nbsp;</p>

— Erik Solheim (@ErikSolheim) <a href="https://twitter.com/ErikSolheim/status/1861670275701731427?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>"Added it is now clear that the accusations are not against the top Adani leaders, Gautam and Sagar Adani. Nor is there evidence that bribes were paid by Adani executives to Indian government officials. The indictment solely rests on claims that bribes were promised or discussed."</p>

<p>Mr Solheim, former Norwegian environment minister and under-secretary of the United Nations argued that the "American overreach" has real-life consequences that impact people's lives, adding that the report forces the Adani Group to waste resources in courts rather than building solar and wind plants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's time to put a stop to American overreach!" he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yesterday, senior lawyer and former Indian MP Mahesh Jethmalani dismissed the report as lacking substance. Mr Jethmalani argued that the charges were politically motivated, accusing the "Democratic deep state" in the US of weaponising its judiciary to destabilise India.</p>

<p>"The indictment offers no evidence of bribery in India, nor does it implicate any top Adani executives. This is nothing but political noise," Mr Jethmalani said.</p>

<p>The Adani Group also rejected the charges as baseless. In a statement, the conglomerate clarified that none of its directors or listed firms were accused of wrongdoing. The report, it said, rests on claims of promised or discussed bribes, with no proof of execution.</p><br />

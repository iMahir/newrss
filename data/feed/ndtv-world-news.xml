       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Justin Trudeau-led Canadian government's latest action suggests it has started treating India as an enemy country. India has been added to a list of enemy nations in terms of cyber security and has been labelled a 'cyber adversary'. New Delhi today called it another Canadian strategy to attack and malign India internationally.</p>

<p>In a press conference today, the Ministry of External Affairs also said that under Trudeau's administration, senior Canadian officials have openly confessed that Canada is seeking to manipulate global opinions against India. The foreign ministry also said that like other instances, these allegations in their cyber security report are made without a shred of evidence.</p>

<p>"We see this as another Canadian strategy to attack and malign India. Their senior officials have openly confessed that Canada is seeking to manipulate global opinions against India. As on other occasions, allegations are made repeatedly without a shred of evidence," Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs said at a press conference in New Delhi today.</p>

<h2><strong>WHAT CANADA ALLEGED</strong></h2>

<p>In its most recent report about cyber security, titled 'National Cyber Threat Assessment 2025-2026', the Government of Canada has called India a "cyber adversary".</p>

<p>In the report it claimed that, "India's leadership almost certainly aspires to build a modernized cyber program with domestic cyber capabilities. India very likely uses its cyber program to advance its national security imperatives, including espionage, counter-terrorism, and the country's efforts to promote its global status and counter narratives against India and the Indian government. We assess that India's cyber program likely leverages commercial cyber vendors to enhance its operations."</p>

<p>It further claimed that "We assess that Indian state-sponsored cyber threat actors likely conduct cyber threat activity against Government of Canada networks for the purpose of espionage. We judge that official bilateral relations between Canada and India will very likely drive Indian state-sponsored cyber threat activity against Canada."</p>

<p>The report also claimed that "countries that aspire to become new centres of power within the global system, such as India, are building cyber programs that present varying levels of threat to Canada.</p>

<p>Canada made these claims under 'Section 1' of its cyber security report titled 'Cyber Threat From State Adversaries' which it says "introduces the state cyber threat ecosystem and discusses the cyber threats to Canada."</p>

<p>India has been added to the list of enemy countries which include China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.</p>

<h3><strong>CANADA HARASSES INDIAN DIPLOMATIC STAFF</strong></h3>

<p>The Justin Trudeau-led Canada government has started violating all established international diplomatic norms in its hateful and spiteful pursuit malign India in order to cater to its domestic political motives and objectives. Diplomats and other Indian mission staff are being kept under round-the-clock surveillance and are even being intimidated routinely.</p>

<p>In a move that highlights its double-standards, Justin Trudeau's administration, which harps on a "rules-based" order has itself not being following any established rules, diplomatic norms and practices.</p>

<p>India today called out Canada for indulging in such illegal activity to harass and intimidate Indian officials in diplomatic missions. New Delhi has called such surveillance activity a "flagrant violation of relevant diplomatic and consular conventions".</p>

<p>The foreign ministry also said that by citing technicalities the Canadian government cannot justify that it is indulging in harassment and intimidation.</p>

<p>In its official statement, the Ministry of External Affairs said, "Some of our officials have recently been informed by the Canadian government that they have been, and continue to be under audio and visual surveillance. Their communications have also been intercepted."</p>

<p>It added that "New Delhi has formally protested to the Indian government as we deem these actions to be a flagrant violation of relevant diplomatic and consular conventions. By citing technicalities the Canadian government cannot justify that it is indulging in harassment and intimidation."</p>

<p>The foreign ministry concluded by saying that "Our diplomatic and consular persons are already functioning in an environment of extremism and violence. This action of the Canadian government aggravates the situation and is incompatible with established diplomatic norms and practices."</p>

<p>India and Canada are currently in the midst of the worst-ever diplomatic spat between the two nations. India has blamed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alone for the fallout between the two countries. Mr Trudeau has openly been supporting terrorism, extremism, separatism and violence against India by personally and politically being a part of the Khalistani narrative. He has been seen at Khalistani rallies and hate speeches against India. Mr Trudeau is dependent on this vote bank for his political gains.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As its ties with Canada continued to remain at an all-time low, India on Saturday said some of its consular officials were informed by the Canadian government that they have been under audio and video surveillance, and termed the action a "flagrant violation" of diplomatic conventions.</p>

<p>Asserting that Canada could not hide behind technicalities to justify its harassment and intimidation, India said it had lodged a protest with the Canadian government.</p>

<p>Addressing a briefing on Saturday, Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, "Some of our consular officials were recently informed by the Canadian government that they have been and continue to be under audio and video surveillance. Their communications have also been intercepted. We have formally protested to the Canadian government as we deem these actions to be a flagrant violation of relevant diplomatic and consular conventions."</p>

<p>Pointing out that India's diplomatic and consular personnel are already functioning in an environment of "extremism and violence", Mr Jaiswal added, "By citing technicalities, the Canadian Government cannot justify the fact that it is indulging in harassment and intimidation... This action of the Canadian government aggravates the situation and is incompatible with established diplomatic norms and practices."</p>

<p>During the briefing, Mr Jaiswal also revealed that a Canadian diplomat had been summoned on Friday over claims by Canada's Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister David Morrison that Home Minister Amit Shah had ordered the targeting of Khalistani extremists in the country.</p>

<p>Stating that a diplomatic note had been handed over to the representative of the Canadian High Commission, the spokesperson said, "It was conveyed in the note that the Government of India protests in the strongest terms to the absurd and baseless references made to the Union Home Minister of India before the committee by Deputy Minister David Morrison."</p>

<p>Referring to reports of Canada admitting that its officials leaked sensitive information to the Washington Post, the Ministry of External Affairs said such actions will have "serious consequences" for ties between India and Canada.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In fact, the revelation that high Canadian officials deliberately leak unfounded insinuations to the international media as part of a conscious strategy to discredit India and influence other nations only confirms the view the Government of India has long held about the current Canadian government's political agenda and behavioural pattern. Such irresponsible actions will have serious consequences for bilateral ties," he warned.</p>

<p>Ties between India and Canada have been strained since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau claimed - without offering any evidence - last year that "Indian agents" were involved in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. The allegation has been rubbished by New Delhi several times and it has asked Canada to produce evidence to back up the claim.</p>

<p>The relationship hit a new low earlier this month when the Indian High Commissioner was termed a "person of interest" in the killing. India dismissed the fresh charge as "ludicrous" and withdrew the High Commissioner and some diplomats while expelling six Canadian officials, including Canada's acting High Commissioner Stewart Ross Wheeler.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rubbishing a Canadian minister's claims that Home Minister Amit Shah had ordered the targeting of Khalistani extremists in the country, India has termed them "absurd and baseless" and said a Canadian diplomat had been summoned.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Canada's Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister David Morrison had made the allegations while addressing members of the country's Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Replying to a question on Saturday, Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said a representative of the Canadian High Commission had been summoned on Friday and a diplomatic note was handed over.</p>

<p>"It was conveyed in the note that the Government of India protests in the strongest terms to the absurd and baseless references made to the Union Home Minister of India before the committee by Deputy Minister David Morrison," Mr Jaiswal said.&nbsp;</p>

Such irresponsible actions will have serious consequences for bilateral ties," the spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Categorisation, Surveillance</strong></p>

<p>Responding to reports that Canada has named India an "adversary" alongside China, North Korea, Russia and Iran in its National Cyber Threat Assessment, Mr Jaiswal said this was another example of imputations being made without evidence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This appears to be another example of a Canadian strategy to attack India. As I mentioned earlier, their senior officials have openly confessed that they are seeking to manipulate global opinion against India. As on other occasions, imputations are made without any evidence," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson also said some of India's consular officials were informed by the Canadian government that they have been under surveillance and called it a "flagrant violation" of diplomatic conventions. He also made it clear that New Delhi sees the action as a form of harassment and intimidation.</p>

<p>"Some of our consular officials were recently informed by the Canadian government that they have been and continue to be under audio and video surveillance. Their communications have also been intercepted. We have formally protested to the Canadian government as we deem these actions to be a flagrant violation of relevant diplomatic and consular conventions," Mr Jaiswal said.&nbsp;</p>

Our diplomatic and consular personnel are already functioning in an environment of extremism and violence. This action of the Canadian Government aggravates the situation and is incompatible with established diplomatic norms and practices," he asserted.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Diwali Celebrations</strong></p>

<p>To a question on Canada's opposition leader Pierre Poilievre cancelling Diwali celebrations that were scheduled to be held at Parliament Hill in Ottawa, sparking a backlash from the Indian community, Mr Jaiswal said, "We have seen some reports in this regard. It is unfortunate that the prevailing atmosphere in Canada has reached high levels of intolerance and extremism."</p>

<p>On the reduction in the number of visas by the Canadian government, the spokesperson said the ministry is monitoring the well-being of students and temporary workers from India who are currently in Canada and its concern for their safety and security remains strong.</p>

<p>Ties between India and Canada have been strained since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau claimed, without offering any evidence, last year that "Indian agents" were involved in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar - an allegation that has been dismissed by New Delhi several times.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moscow on Saturday denied it was behind fake videos about the US election after American intelligence said Russia was behind a fake video showing a Haitian immigrant claiming to have voted multiple times.</p>

<p>Three US intelligence agencies on Friday said in a joint statement that "Russian influence actors" created the video as part of "Moscow's broader effort to raise unfounded questions about the integrity of the US election".</p>

<p>The statement also said Russian actors were behind another fake video.</p>

<p>"We have noticed the statement of the US intelligence services accusing our country of disseminating fabricated videos about electoral violations in the United States. We view these allegations as baseless," the Russian embassy in the United States said in a statement on Telegram.</p>

<p>The 20-second clip features a man saying in a stilted, robotic delivery: "We are from Haiti. We came to America six months ago, and we already have our American citizenship -- we're voting Kamala Harris."</p>

<p>Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, the top election official in the swing state, said Friday the video was an example of "targeted disinformation".</p>

<p>Raffensperger said the "obviously fake" video was likely a production of "Russian troll farms".</p>

<p>The embassy said that Russia had not received "any proof for these claims during its communications with US officials".</p>

<p>"As President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly stressed, we respect the will of the American people. All insinuations about 'Russian machinations' are malicious slander," the embassy said in a statement also released by the Russian foreign ministry.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan logged record-breaking temperatures in October, marking the hottest October since record-keeping began in 1898, data from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) showed.</p>

<p>The monthly average temperature across Japan exceeded typical October temperatures by 2.21 degrees Celsius, according to the JMA data released on Friday.</p>

<p>Regionally, temperatures in northern Japan averaged 1.9 degrees higher, while eastern and western Japan saw temperatures increase by 2.6 degrees, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Cities like Kyoto, Nagano, and central Tokyo experienced significant temperature hikes, with October averages rising by 3.2 degrees, 3.1 degrees, and 2.6 degrees respectively.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, the JMA forecasts that November temperatures will likely remain above average, though colder air is expected to arrive in the latter half of next week, potentially leading to more dramatic temperature fluctuations.</p>

<p>The pattern of high temperatures in Japan has been persistent since July, raising concerns over the frequency of such unseasonal warmth.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI on Thursday ramped up its ChatGPT generative AI chatbot with search engine capabilities, as the startup takes on Google's decades-long dominance of web search.</p>

<p>The upgrade enables users to receive "fast, timely answers" with links to relevant web sources -- information that previously required using a traditional search engine, the company said.</p>

<p>The significant upgrade to ChatGPT enables the AI chatbot to provide real-time information from across the web.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ChatGPT's homepage can now also offer direct tabs to sourced material on topics ranging from weather forecasts and stock prices to sports scores and breaking news, the company said.</p>

<p>These would link to news and data from providers that have signed content deals with OpenAI, including France's Le Monde, Germany's Axel Springer and the UK's Financial Times.</p>

<p>Examples of the new interface shown on the OpenAI website closely resembled search results on Google and Google Maps, though without the clutter of advertising.</p>

<p>They also resembled the interface of Perplexity, another AI-powered search engine that offers a more conversational version of Google with sources referenced in the answer.</p>

<p>Both OpenAI and Perplexity are facing lawsuits from the New York Times for scraping or linking to copyrighted content without permission.</p>

<p>Rather than launching a separate product, OpenAI has integrated search directly into ChatGPT for paying subscribers, though this will be expanded to users that use the free version of the chatbot.</p>

<p>Users can enable the search feature by default or activate it manually via a web search icon.</p>

<p>The company added that any website or publisher can opt-in to appear in ChatGPT's search results, with OpenAI actively seeking feedback from content creators to refine the system further.</p>

<p><strong>'Favorite Feature'</strong></p>

<p>Since their launch, data on AI chatbots like ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude have been limited by time cutoffs, so the answers provided were not up to date.</p>

<p>This has been seen as a weakness of AI chatbots, especially at OpenAI, which does not have a stand-alone search engine providing more timely data. In contrast, Google and Microsoft both combine AI answers with web results.</p>

<p>For now, the feature would not include advertising, allowing ChatGPT to offer much cleaner results than Google.</p>

<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote Thursday on X that search is his "favorite feature we have launched" on ChatGPT since the bot's debut in 2022.</p>

<p>"I find it to be a way faster/easier way to get the information I'm looking for," Altman added on Reddit.</p>

<p>The launch will raise more questions about the startup's link to Microsoft, a major OpenAI investor, which is also trying to expand the reach of its Bing search engine against Google.</p>

<p>Altman has set his company on a path to become an internet powerhouse.</p>

<p>He successfully catapulted the company to a staggering $157 billion valuation in a recent round of fundraising that included Microsoft, Tokyo-based conglomerate SoftBank and AI chipmaker Nvidia as investors.</p>

<p>Enticing new users with search engine capabilities will increase the company's computing needs and costs, which are enormous.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A French court sentenced a graphic artist who worked on beloved animated feature films for Pixar and Disney to 25 years in jail for ordering the livestreamed rape of preteen girls in the Philippines.</p>

<p>The Paris court late Thursday found Bouhalem Bouchiba guilty of complicity in the rape of hundreds of girls and in human trafficking and of viewing child pornography online.</p>

<p>Bouchiba, 59, had confessed to the charges during the four-day trial.</p>

<p>"I am aware of everything I did. I ask the victims' forgiveness," he told the court.</p>

<p>Bouchiba worked at the Pixar and Disney animation studios, contributing to blockbusters like 2004 hit "The Incredibles" and "Ratatouille", released in 2007.</p>

<p>"One the one hand you have a graphic artist who delighted children," said state prosecutor Philippe Courroye.</p>

<p>"On the other, Bouhalem Bouchiba was a paedophile film maker who staged his own horror movies."</p>

<p>He was convicted of paying women in the Philippines between 2012 and 2021 to rape and sexually assault girls aged between five and 10 in front of a camera while he watched via livestream and issued instructions.</p>

<p>Bouchiba admitted during his testimony that the violence resembled "torture".</p>

<p>Each show cost between 50 and 100 euros ($54-$108), with the total Bouchiba spent on the performances coming to just over 50,000 euros.</p>

<p>Police became interested in Bouchiba when Europol, the European Union's law enforcement agency, sent out an alert about suspicious money transfers to the Philippines.</p>

<p>On October 4, 2021, Bouchiba -- who was living in the United States at the time -- was arrested at San Francisco's airport and extradited to France.</p>

<p>The suspect was already known to police, having been found guilty in 2009 of the sexual abuse of his stepdaughter.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon's Hezbollah said on Saturday it had launched rockets at an Israeli intelligence base near Tel Aviv in the early hours of Saturday.</p>

<p>At 2:30 AM (00:30 GMT) Hezbollah "fired a salvo of rockets at the Glilot base of the 8200 military intelligence unit in the suburbs of Tel Aviv" the Iran-backed group said in a statement.</p>

<p>Hezbollah and Israel exchanged cross-border fire for nearly a year after Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel triggered the Gaza war, before Israel ramped up the conflict on September 23.</p>

<p>The group frequently claims to have fired rockets at Israeli bases or urban areas in Israeli territory, and has several times claimed the targeting of Glilot.</p>

<p>It also said it had fired rocket salvos on Saturday morning at areas in the north of Israel, in particular at the city of Safed, another repeat target.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Israeli military said on Saturday that sirens were activated following the arrival of "suspicious aerial targets" from Lebanon and the targets remained under surveillance in an ongoing incident.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump announced that Kennedy family scion and vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. would play a "big role" in his administration if the Republican former president were to win next week's election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump announced Friday that Kennedy family scion and notorious vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. would play a "big role" in his administration if the Republican former president were to win next week's election.</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters outside an upscale halal restaurant in Dearborn, Michigan, Trump exuded confidence in Kennedy, who has spent two decades fueling vaccine disinformation, claiming he had the perfect credentials for a high-level job.</p>

<p>"He's going to have a big role in health care," Trump declared, adding with a trademark flourish: "He knows about it better than anybody."</p>

<p>Trump noted that Kennedy has "got some views that I happen to agree with very strongly and I have for a long time," but he dodged questions on whether he specifically endorsed Kennedy's vaccine rhetoric.</p>

<p>Kennedy, a 70-year-old former Democrat, ran as an independent earlier in this election cycle before dropping his campaign in August to support the 78-year-old Republican tycoon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He is widely rumored to be a contender for a cabinet position, with speculation centering on the role of secretary of health and human services.</p>

<p>"For 19 years, I pray every morning, without a single exception, that God would put me in a position to end this chronic disease epidemic," Kennedy said Friday at a rally alongside Trump in Michigan.</p>

<p>During a raucous rally in New York's Madison Square Garden on Sunday, Trump teased he would allow Kennedy to "go wild on health," without elaborating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And on Thursday night, he suggested to a Nevada crowd that Kennedy's portfolio would extend to "women's health," further angering Democrats already incensed over Republican-led abortion rights rollbacks in more than 20 states.</p>

<p>Trump doubled down on that idea on Friday.</p>

<p>"He's so into health and all, he's going to take care of women's health and men's health and your children's health," the candidate said.</p>

<p>Kennedy added: "We are the sickest country in the world, and this is the sickest generation of kids. And if you elect Kamala Harris, you're going to get more of the same."</p>

<p>Cabinet appointments require Senate confirmation by a simple majority of 51 votes, with the vice president breaking ties if needed.</p>

<p>Since the mid-2000s, Kennedy -- whose father was assassinated in 1968 while vying for the Democratic presidential nomination -- has risen to become a leading figure in the global anti-vaccine movement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His claims include calling Covid-19 vaccines the "deadliest ever made" and suggesting the virus was "ethnically targeted" to harm Black and white people while sparing "Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese."</p>

<p>He was once a well-respected climate lawyer and was widely reported as a leading candidate for chief of the Environmental Protection Agency under former Democratic president Barack Obama, before ultimately being passed over.</p>

<p>Five of his siblings denounced his decision to endorse Trump, calling it a "betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold most dear."</p>

<p>Kennedy's presidential run this year featured some bizarre moments -- including his claim to have recovered from a parasitic brain worm and an admission that he dumped a dead bear cub in Central Park after initially picking it up to "skin" it.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A squirrel named Peanut who was propelled to the heights of internet celebrity has been euthanised, New York authorities said Friday, biting a government staffer on the way out.</p>

<p>With 537,000 followers on Instagram, the domesticated black squirrel had fans around the world who delighted in his exploits, such as nibbling on waffles and doffing tiny costumes.</p>

<p>New Yorker Mark Longo said he rescued the animal after seeing its mother killed by a car, going on to bottle feed the baby squirrel before attempting to release him into the wild.</p>

<p>However, the animal lost part of its tail and returned to Longo, living with him for seven years and starring in posts on the Instagram account peanut_the_squirrel12.</p>

<p>"Internet, you WON. You took one of the most amazing animals away from me because of your selfishness. To the group of people who called (the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation), there's a special place in hell for you," Longo wrote in an Instagram post.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He said he was "in shock, disbelief, and disgusted... for the last seven years, Peanut has been my best friend."</p>

<p>The Chemung County Department of Health and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation said in a statement Friday that Peanut, along with a racoon living with Longo, were possessed illegally, and had been euthanised to test for rabies.</p>

<p>"On October 30, DEC seized a raccoon and squirrel sharing a residence with humans, creating the potential for human exposure to rabies," the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In addition, a person involved with the investigation was bitten by the squirrel. To test for rabies, both animals were euthanised."</p>

<p>The department called on anyone exposed to the animals to consult a doctor.</p>

<p>Longo wrote that "the fight goes on" and called on supporters to donate to his legal bills and plans for an animal sanctuary.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The father of Sara Sharif, a British-Pakistani 10-year-old girl whose death sparked an international manhunt last year, forced his daughter to do sit-ups all night because she hid his keys, a court heard earlier this week.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The father of Sara Sharif, a British-Pakistani 10-year-old girl whose death sparked an international manhunt last year, forced his daughter to do sit-ups all night because she hid his keys, a court heard earlier this week. Urfan Sharif was also said to have made the little girl put her hands in the air after beating her so badly that her stepmother, Beinash Batool, feared he would break her arms and legs, <em>The Guardian</em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The chilling details came to light as prosecutors on Thursday read out a series of WhatsApp messages between Batool and her older sister Qandeela Saboohi from 2019 to 2013, which the court was told detailed the alleged abuse. In the text messages, Batool described the 10-year-old's father as a "psycho" who "beat the crap out of Sara". According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/31/sara-sharifs-father-hit-her-like-crazy-and-made-her-do-sit-ups-all-night-court-hears" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>The Guardian</em></a>, she also said that Sharif had told her to cover up the girl's bruises with makeup and sunglasses after the 10-year-old's teachers became worried that she was to be homeschooled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, Sharif, 42, his wife, Batool, 30, and brother Faisal Malik, 29, are on trial accused of carrying out a violent "campaign of abuse" before the 10-year-old was found dead at the family home in Surrey in August 2023. The three allegedly killed Sara on August 8 before fleeing to Pakistan, from where Sharif called police to say he had "beat her up too much". He had also left a handwritten "confession" near her body saying, "I swear to God that my intention was not to kill her. But I lost it".&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Thursday, the court heard how the girl was "literally beaten black" by her father, as jurors were shown pictures of inside the house where Sara was found dead. Text messages recovered from Batool's sister's phone revealed that the stepmother once told Saboohi that Sharif would "regret" it if Sara revealed he "hits her like crazy and all the bruises" before adding: "I literally have to push Urfan out the way and save Sara."</p>

<p>Batool also sent 10 photographs showing bruises, saying, "This is how bad he is beating her ... I feel really sorry for her, he beats the crap out of her."&nbsp;</p>

<p>On 24 January 2021, Batool told Saboohi that Sharif had "beat Sara up like crazy" and "went ballistic" with her. Describing another incident in May 2021, Batool wrote, "Urfan is going crazy beating Sara up. I'm kind of having a panic attack ... He's literally (going) to break her arm or leg, I have no idea what to do ... I'm in the other room, he's locked us out, he's not opening the door."</p>

<p>The following day, Batool told her sister that she wanted to report Sharif for beating "the crap out of Sara". "She's covered in bruises, literally ... black," Batool said, adding, "Poor girl can't walk, she literally fainted in the kitchen in the morning" and "he made her do sit-ups all night".&nbsp;</p>

<p>In February 2022, Batool messaged another sister, Amima Shahid, to say that Sharif was beating Sara up at home. "(If) something happens to Sara I will not be able to forgive myself," she said, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4l6g9qyg9o" rel="noindex, nofollow">BBC</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The same year in June, Batool told her sister she was considering removing Sara from school. "Sara's body is literally bruised because Urfan beat her up, I can't even cover it up," she said. The 30-year-old also stated that Sara was beaten for being "rude and rebellious".</p>

<p>A few days later, Batool told Saboohi that the school was "worried" about Sara and that Sharif had been told to bring her in. Batool said: "Urfan told me to cover it (the bruises) up with make up and she's going to wear sunglasses."</p>

<p>In November 2022, Batool messaged the other sister, Shahid, saying that she was "too stressed to talk" and that she and Sharif had separated. Batool also said Sharif was going to Pakistan the following day, adding: "He went crazy today", and that he had taken money and a passport.</p>

<p>In April 2023, Batool said Sara was not eating properly and was trying to make herself vomit. In May she added that Sharif had beaten up Sara "like crazy" and said, "Her oxygen level dropped really low, she's finding it hard to stay awake ... She's breathing really rapidly."</p>

<p>The day before Sara died, Saboohi tried to make contact but Batool told her she was "not in the mood to speak".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sharif, Batool and Malik, all deny murder and causing or allowing the death of a child. Jurors were previously told that Sara had been hooded, burned, bitten and beaten during more than two years of abuse. They were also told by the prosecution that the accuracy of messages sent by Batool to her sisters over a number of years was in dispute, as they only reflected what she was choosing to tell them.</p>

<p>The trial is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk, who is busy promoting Donald Trump for the keenly-watched US presidential election on November 5, has reportedly laid off more employees from his X social media platform.</p>

<p>According to a report in The Verge, a new wave of layoffs has hit X, primarily affecting its engineering department, citing sources inside X and posts on the workplace forum Blind.</p>

<p>"The exact scale of the job cuts remains unknown. These cuts come just two months after staffers were required to submit a one-page summary telling leadership their contributions to the company," the report claimed.</p>

<p>Musk or X were yet to comment on the report.</p>

<p>Recently, the tech billionaire had reportedly sent an email to X staff about their much-anticipated stock grants - although with a catch.</p>

<p>In an email to staff seen by The Verge, the social media platform planned to award stock options based on the anticipated impact of employees.</p>

<p>"That means staff have to submit a one-page summary telling leadership their contributions to the company in order to get their stock," said the report.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind how the company has continued to struggle under Musk's ownership, employees have been bracing for more layoffs.</p>

<p>Musk bought X (then called Twitter) in 2022 and laid off more than 6,000 employees- roughly 80 per cent of the company's staff.</p>

<p>The workforce was forced to justify their roles and even judge whether their own colleagues should be retained.</p>

<p>The job cuts affected departments like diversity and inclusion teams as well as product development and design. Even, Twitter's content moderation team was not spared.</p>

<p>In January this year, X reportedly fired 1,000 employees from its 'safety' staff which was responsible for stopping abusive content online. Out of these 80 per cent were software engineers that were focused on "trust and safety issues".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 36-year-old man, who earlier worked as a programmer for Nvidia, spent around a year of his life and invested a considerable amount of money to discover the world's largest known prime number.</p>

<p>Officially named as 'M136279841,' Luke Durant's discovery consists of 41,024,320 digits, marking the maiden prime breakthrough in nearly six years, CNN reported.</p>

<p>A prime number is a whole number, which can only be divided by 1 or itself, such as 2, 3, 5, 7, and so on.</p>

<p>Based in San Jose, California, Luke Durant's historic finding has been classified as a Mersenne prime, named after French monk Marin Mersenne. He studied these numbers over 350 years ago.</p>

<p>As per the report, Mersenne primes are rare, making Durant's discovery even more impressive. In simple terms, to consider a number as Mersenne prime, it needs to be written in the form '2ᵖ-1'.</p>

<p>While other large prime numbers are used in some applications for protecting internet security, the Mersenne primes remain crucial for other key reasons.</p>

<p>"The historical record of the world's largest prime tells us something about the historical capability of computers, and in particular it tells us something about the progress of humanity in this area," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/science/world-largest-prime-number-found/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN</a> quoted Dr Kevin Buzzard, professor of pure mathematics at Imperial College, London, as saying.</p>

<p>Mr Durant's research was announced on October 21 by the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS), a community-based project.</p>

<p>An example of citizen science, GIMPS allows non-specialists to discover the largest known primes, according to Buzzard "I recognised that the GIMPS community has put together an incredible system with amazing technology for searching for huge prime numbers," Mr Durant said.</p>

<p>For this project, Luke Durant first got himself familiar with its software and learned to use cloud computers. Later on, he combined these elements that enabled him to run enough worldwide systems for creating an incredibly speedy supercomputer.</p>

<p>People from different cities around the world are volunteers in the GIMPS community as they run the project's software on their personal computer systems to search for new primes.</p>

<p>Luke Durant was inspired to hunt for the world's largest primes due to his interest in developing large computing systems as well as exploring the limitations of the laws of physics. Through his effort, he "wanted to push the boundaries of the known universe in whatever small way I was able".</p>

<p>"These enormous prime numbers are, in some senses, the largest 'unique pieces of information' in the known universe," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US has imposed sanctions on 275 individuals and entities, including 15 from India, for allegedly supporting Russia's military-industrial base.</p>

<p>Companies from China, Switzerland, Thailand, and Turkiye have also been slapped with sanctions for supplying Russia with advanced technology and equipment that it desperately needs to support its war machine, the Department of Treasury said in a statement on Thursday.</p>

<p>In addition to disrupting global evasion networks, this action also targets domestic Russian importers and producers of key inputs and other material for Russia's military-industrial base, the statement said.</p>

<p>“The United States and our allies will continue to take decisive action across the globe to stop the flow of critical tools and technologies that Russia needs to wage its illegal and immoral war against Ukraine,” Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo said.</p>

<p>“As evidenced by today's action, we are unyielding in our resolve to diminish and degrade Russia's ability to equip its war machine and stop those seeking to aid their efforts through circumvention or evasion of our sanctions and export controls,” Adeyemo said.</p>

<p>The State Department has also targeted sanctions evasion and circumvention in multiple third countries, including several China-based companies exporting dual-use goods that fill critical gaps in Russia's military-industrial base and entities and individuals in Belarus related to the Lukashenka regime's support for Russia's defence industry, the statement said.</p>

<p>The US also targeted several senior Russian Ministry of Defence officials and defence companies and those supporting Russia's future energy production and exports.</p>

<p>As per the list released by the Department of Treasury, the India-based companies are Abhar Technologies and Services Private Limited; Denvas Services Private Limited; Emsystech; Galaxy Bearings Ltd; Orbit Fintrade LLP; Innovio Ventures; KDG Engineering Private Limited; and Khushbu Honing Private Limited.</p>

<p>The Indian companies also include Lokesh Machines Limited; Pointer Electronics; RRG Engineering Technologies Private Limited; Sharpline Automation Private Limited; Shaurya Aeronautics Private Limited; Shreegee Impex Private Limited; and Shreya Life Sciences Private Limited.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the US imposed sanctions on <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-war-us-cracks-down-on-indian-firms-for-supplies-to-russian-companies-6913424">nearly 400 entities and individuals</a> for enabling Russia's illegal war against Ukraine.</p>

<p>"The Department of State is targeting sanctions circumvention by parties in multiple third countries, several senior Russian Ministry of Defence officials and defence companies, and those that support the development of Russia's future energy production and exports," Secretary of State Antony Blinken had said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The US, he said, is imposing sanctions on several Chinese companies exporting dual-use goods that fill critical gaps in Russia's military-industrial base as well as entities and individuals connected to the Lukashenka regime's support for Russia's defence industry.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA's 47-year-old Voyager 1 spacecraft recently established contact with Earth after a brief halt with the help of a radio transmitter that has not been used since 1981. NASA engineers at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California re-established contact with the spacecraft on October 24.</p>

<p>The spacecraft, which is in interstellar space over 15 billion miles away, experienced a brief interruption in communication on October 16 due to a shutdown of one of its transmitters. This shutdown was likely triggered by the spacecraft's fault protection system, which powers down certain systems when power usage is too high.</p>

<p>According to NASA, a message takes around 23 hours to travel one way - from Earth to Voyager 1 and vice-versa. On October 16, when the NASA engineers sent a command to the spacecraft, they could not detect its response till October 18. A day later, communication with Voyager 1 stopped completely.</p>

<p>After an investigation, the space agency team discovered that Voyager 1's fault protection system had switched the spacecraft to a second, lower-power transmitter.</p>

<p>Voyager 1 has two radio transmitters, but has been using only one for years called an 'X-band'. However, the other transmitter - the 'S-band' - uses a different frequency which has not been employed since 1981.</p>

<p>Presently, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/nasa-identifies-9-potential-landing-sites-for-artemis-iii-mission-near-moon-s-south-pole-6915265">NASA</a> has opted to avoid switching back to the X-band transmitter until they can determine what activated the fault protection system - which may take weeks.</p>

<p>"Engineers are being cautious because they want to determine whether there are any potential risks to turning on the X-band. In the meantime, engineers sent a message to Voyager 1 on October 22 to check that the S-band transmitter was working and received confirmation on October 24. But it's not a fix the team wants to rely on for too long," Voyager mission assurance manager, Bruce Waggoner told CNN.</p>

<p>Voyager 1 was launched after Voyager 2, but because of a faster route it exited the asteroid belt earlier than its twin, and it overtook Voyager 2 on December 15, 1977. The spacecraft is the first human-made object to venture into interstellar space.</p>

<p>The spacecraft was the first to cross the heliosphere - the boundary where the influences from outside our solar system are stronger than those from the Sun.</p>

<p>So far, the Voyager 1 has discovered a thin ring around Jupiter and two new Jovian moons - Thebe and Metis. It also found five new moons and a new ring called 'G-Ring' at Saturn.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel's 'Iron Beam', designed to use high-power laser to down projectiles, will be operational within a year.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's 'Iron Beam', designed to use high-power laser to down projectiles, will be operational within a year, according to reports. The laser defense system will complement the country's Iron Dome and other defense systems, heralding in a "new era of warfare", the Israeli defence ministry said.</p>

<p>Costing Israel over $500 million, the Iron Beam will engage and neutralise missiles, drones, rockets and mortars at a time the country is at war with the Hamas in Palestine and Hezbollah in Iran. Retaliatory strikes between the three countries have caused widespread destruction, recently hitting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in the coastal city of Caesarea.</p>

<p>Developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, architect of Israel's Iron Dome, and Elbit Systems, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.rafael.co.il/system/iron-beam/">Iron Beam</a> can engage at the speed of light from a range of hundreds of meters to several kilometers. It has an unlimited magazine, almost zero cost per interception and causes minimal collateral damage.</p>

<p>Israel's defence ministry said that the Iron Beam will shoot down the smaller projectiles, while larger targets like ballistic missiles will be tackled by the Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 interceptors. The system will heat and destroy the target, including drones, which are small, light and have a low radar signature, making them tough targets for the Iron Dome, experts told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/01/middleeast/israel-iron-beam-laser-system-intl/index.html"><em>CNN</em></a>.</p>

<p>Further, the system will function at a fraction of the cost that goes into operating the Iron Dome. Tel Aviv think tank Institute for National Security Studies said each interceptor missile fired by the Iron Dome costs approximately $50,000.</p>

<p>The system, however, does not operate well in low visibility conditions, including inclement weather.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the United States said it will deploy B-52 bombers, fighter jets, refueling aircraft and Navy destroyers to the Middle East, in a readjustment of military assets as the Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group prepares to leave the region. The latest adjustment in US forces in the region follows direct exchanges of fire in October between Israel and Iran.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since late September Israel has been fighting a two-front war, against Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon and against Hamas, which triggered the Gaza war by attacking Israel on October 7 last year. Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures. Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed 43,259 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry which the United Nations considers reliable.</p>

<p>US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators have tried for months to broker a truce and hostages for prisoners exchange for Gaza.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rescuers raised the death toll in Spain's worst floods for a generation to 205 on Friday and fears grew for the dozens missing as hopes of finding survivors faded.</p>

<p>The floods that have tossed vehicles, collapsed bridges and covered towns with mud since Tuesday are the European country's deadliest such disaster in decades.</p>

<p>The organisation coordinating emergency services in the hardest-hit eastern Valencia region said 202 people had been confirmed dead there.</p>

<p>Officials in neighbouring Castilla-La Mancha and Andalusia in the south had already announced a combined three deaths in their regions.</p>

<p>Rescuers equipped with helicopters, drones and sniffer dogs waded through water and rummaged through debris in search of dozens of people the authorities believe are still missing.</p>

<p>The government has deployed another 500 troops to the stricken areas to bolster the 1,200 already on site for search, rescue and logistics tasks. Another 500 will be dispatched on Saturday.</p>

<p>The Civil Guard alone had rescued more than 4,500 people as of Friday afternoon, Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska said.</p>

<p>But three days on from the disaster, hopes of finding more survivors are dwindling.</p>

<p>The courthouse in Valencia city has been converted into a morgue, where health workers wearing smocks carried stretchers covered with white sheets.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'People are desperate'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Some cut-off areas went without water, food or power for days after the floods began, and many roads and railways remain inaccessible.</p>

<p>Engineers worked to remove abandoned cars strewn over warped railway tracks and slabs of tarmac from destroyed roads littered inundated fields, AFP journalists saw.</p>

<p>French volunteers also announced their staff had arrived in Spain on Friday bringing equipment to help clear debris, pump water and rescue victims.</p>

<p>In the devastated town of Paiporta near Valencia city, some residents complained aid was coming too slowly and frustrating the efforts of volunteers.</p>

<p>"There aren't enough firefighters, the shovels haven't arrived," Paco Clemente, a 33-year-old pharmacist, told AFP as he helped clear mud from a friend's house.</p>

<p>Thousands of people remain cut off from the electricity and telephone networks, but it is hoped the estimated number of missing people will fall once connections are restored.</p>

<p>With several places seeing signs of order breaking down, government minister Angel Victor Torres on Thursday vowed an uncompromising response to looting.</p>

<p>Police said they had arrested 50 people for incidents including theft from vehicles and a jewellery store.</p>

<p>In the Valencia region town of Aldaia, Fernando Lozano told AFP he saw thieves grabbing items from an abandoned supermarket as "people are a bit desperate".</p>

<p>"Until things return to normal and the supermarket opens, it's going to be very bad here."</p>

<p>Sports centres and schools were among the sites being used for emergency food distribution, Valencia region leader Carlos Mazon told reporters.</p>

<p>- Wave of solidarity -</p>

<p>An army of thousands of volunteers set off from Valencia on Friday armed with shovels, buckets and shopping trolleys laden with food and nappies to help distressed neighbours in the city's flooded suburbs.</p>

<p>Among them was Federico Martinez, a 55-year-old engineer who headed to help Paiporta residents clear their town of mud.</p>

<p>"We took what we had at home, and now it's time to help. It's emotional, it gives you goosebumps," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Helpers also flocked to Valencia football club's Mestalla stadium where volunteers formed human chains to collect mountains of essential supplies.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez hailed "the limitless solidarity and dedication of Spanish society" on X and pledged aid "for as long as it takes".</p>

<p>But the Valencia regional government urged people to stay at home, saying they risked holding up the emergency services rushing to the worst-affected areas.</p>

<p>Pope Francis expressed his solidarity with the victims and their families in Spain, historically a deeply Catholic country.</p>

<p>Sanchez will on Saturday chair another meeting of a special committee made up of top cabinet ministers to follow the crisis.</p>

<p>Marlaska has been sent to Valencia to facilitate the cooperation between the central government and regional authorities in Spain's highly decentralised state.</p>

<p>The storm that sparked the floods formed as cold air moved over the warm waters of the Mediterranean and is common for the time of year.</p>

<p>But scientists warn climate change driven by human activity is increasing the ferocity, length and frequency of such extreme weather events.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>He accused Kyiv's allies of "just waiting for the North Korean military to start striking at Ukrainians" instead of providing "the long-range capability that is so necessary".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States announced Friday the deployment of additional military assets to the Middle East, including ballistic missile defense destroyers and long-range B-52 bomber aircraft, serving as a warning to Iran as it and Israel trade tit-for-tat strikes.</p>

<p>"Should Iran, its partners, or its proxies use this moment to target American personnel or interests in the region, the United States will take every measure necessary to defend our people," Pentagon spokesman Major General Pat Ryder said in a statement.</p>

<p>The additional resources build on previous US defense deployments to the Middle East in support of Israel, including a THAAD missile defense system deployed to the country late last month, operated by American troops on the ground.</p>

<p>The new forces "will begin to arrive in coming months," Ryder said.</p>

<p>Israel launched significant strikes against Iran on October 26, devastating military infrastructure to the Islamic republic while steering clear of critical nuclear and oil sites.</p>

<p>Iran has carried out two major attacks against Israel in 2024 -- one in April after a strike on its consulate in Damascus that was blamed on Israel, and another in October that Tehran said was in response to the assassination of leaders of armed groups it backs in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Observers warn the continued military operations between the regional rivals could escalate further.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[US Vice President Kamala Harris lambasted Donald Trump on Friday for her White House rival's "violent rhetoric," saying his recent verbal attack on a Republican critic should disqualify him from becoming president again.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump came under fire for violent rhetoric against a prominent Kamala Harris supporter Friday as the candidates hold dueling rallies in battleground Wisconsin four days before the climax of the most volatile US presidential campaign in modern history.</p>

<p>More than 68 million Americans have already cast early ballots ahead of Election Day on Tuesday. Opinion polls show Trump and Harris running dead even, with victory depending on who prevails across the seven swing states, including Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Both were campaigning in the state's largest city Milwaukee.</p>

<p>Trump was holding a rally in the same venue where he celebrated the Republican Party nomination over the summer and delivered a triumphant acceptance speech just days after the 78-year-old had narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Harris -- who only entered the race in July after President Joe Biden dropped out amid fears over his declining mental acuity -- was to be joined by star rapper Cardi B in the latest of a series of high-energy rallies.</p>

<p>But before the big campaign events, Harris lambasted Trump for using "violent rhetoric" when discussing one of his chief critics in the Republican Party.</p>

<p>Trump has "suggested rifles should be trained on former representative Liz Cheney," Harris told reporters in Madison, Wisconsin.</p>

<p>"This must be disqualifying. Anyone who wants to be president of the United States who uses that kind of violent rhetoric is clearly disqualified and unqualified to be president."</p>

<p><strong>- Guns 'trained on her face' -</strong><br />
As the contest draws to a close, Trump has upped his provocative rhetoric in a bid to fire up a base he needs to turn out in massive numbers.</p>

<p>Wisconsin is part of the Democrats' "blue wall" across the Midwest, but the region could go either way -- and with it the presidency.</p>

<p>The other path to victory could run through southern and western "Sun Belt" swing states, where Trump and Harris both campaigned Thursday.</p>

<p>At an Arizona event Thursday with rightwing influencer Tucker Carlson, Trump called Harris, 60, a "sleaze bag" and Biden a "stupid bastard."</p>

<p>He also claimed, without evidence, that polls are already being rigged in the biggest swing state Pennsylvania -- reinforcing expectations that, as in 2020, he will refuse to accept the results if he is defeated.</p>

<p>But it was his comments about Cheney, once a senior Republican leader who has become a supporter of Harris, that stirred most controversy.</p>

<p>Citing her hawkish foreign policy views, Trump conjured the image of Cheney -- daughter of former Republican vice president Dick Cheney -- being shot.</p>

<p>"She's a radical war hawk. Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, OK? Let's see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face," Trump said.</p>

<p>Cheney responded, saying, "This is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death."</p>

<p>Harris rushed to her defense, and warned that Trump is "someone who considers his political opponents the enemy, is permanently out for revenge and is increasingly unstable and unhinged."</p>

<p>Adding to tensions, social media is awash with disinformation that authorities say has been stirred by Russian operatives and amplified by US right-wing influencers -- including Trump ally Elon Musk, the world's richest man and owner of the X platform.</p>

<p>Much of Musk's effort has involved pushing lies about non-citizen immigrants voting.</p>

<p>Trump notably made a stop Friday in Dearborn, Michigan, the country's largest Arab-American city, where outrage over Israel's war in Gaza has alienated many Muslims from the Democratic Party -- something Trump is hoping to exploit.</p>

<p>After meeting supporters at an upscale halal restaurant, Trump confirmed to reporters that vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr would play a "big role" in health care if Trump were elected.</p>

<p><strong>- Jobs surprise -</strong><br />
Harris is running on warnings about an authoritarian Trump takeover, promising to help the middle class, and pushing back against Republican abortion curbs.</p>

<p>Trump has focused his campaign on stirring fears about immigrant violence and pessimism over the economy.</p>

<p>Economists say the US economy is actually in robust shape, shrugging off the last Covid pandemic cobwebs, with low unemployment and strong growth.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal, a major daily closely read by many conservatives, offered a very positive assessment Thursday, saying "the next president inherits a remarkable economy."</p>

<p>Figures released Friday though showed much lower job growth in October, denting Democratic messaging. Economists said the job slowdown was a blip, caused by knock-on effects from hurricanes and a strike at Boeing.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shanghai Museum has pulled in crowds this summer for an exhibition of ancient Egyptian relics including cat statues and other feline imagery, which on Saturday nights allows up to 200 visitors to bring along their own four-legged friends.</p>

<p>Inspired by ancient Egyptians' worship of Bastet, the goddess of protection - often depicted as a cat - the museum has given cats the chance to interact with part of the exhibition called "The Secrets of Saqqara".</p>

<p>"Egyptian archaeological teams discovered a cat temple in Saqqara and unearthed many cat mummies and cat statues. So when we were planning the event, we had cats as a theme, and then came the idea for 'Meow Night'," said Shanghai Museum Deputy Director Li Feng.</p>

<p>The "Top of the Pyramids: Ancient Egyptian Civilization Exhibition" began on July 19 and runs until Aug. 17, 2025, with "Meow Night" planned for at least 10 Saturdays. It has held six so far with tickets, including 200 bring-a-cat tickets, selling out each time.</p>

<p>Visitors bring their cats in carriers or pet strollers and can take them out only at designated areas, such as for a photo opportunity next to a statue of Bastet.</p>

<p>The cats are checked on entry to ensure up-to-date vaccinations and for signs of illness or stress. There are veterinarians onsite and rest areas for cats in case the stimulation from their night at the museum gets a bit much.</p>

<p>"It's very special that you can bring a cat with you," said visitor Qiu Jiakai who was attending "Meow Night" with one-year-old puss An Mao.</p>

<p>"I listened to the narrator's introduction saying ... many of today's pet cats are related to the cats domesticated in ancient Egypt. So I thought I would have to bring my cat here to see its ancestors and the cat goddess," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do not leave the building, or take a coffee break - these are among the new instructions an Australian mining boss plans to give all his employees. The billionaire said this was costing their company a fortune and hence they plan to "hold staff captive all day long".</p>

<p>Chris Ellison, the managing director of Mineral Resources, has announced that his company will install amenities at their head office in Perth which ensures that employees do not leave the building during their work hours.</p>

<p>During a financial results presentation, Ellison expressed his disapproval of staff leaving the building to buy coffee or work from home, stating that it's costing the company too much money.</p>

<p>"I want to hold them captive all day long. I don't want them leaving the building. I don't want them walking down the road for a cup of coffee. We kind of figured out a few years ago how much that costs."</p>

<p>He also criticised other companies that allow remote work, despite the trend towards more flexible work arrangements since the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>To keep employees in the office, Mineral Resources has invested in amenities such as a restaurant, gym, staff psychologists, and even a creche, which costs just 20 dollars a day. Ellison believes that these facilities will make the head office a desirable place to be, eliminating the need for staff to leave.</p>

<p>The company formally banned work-from-home arrangements last year, and Ellison is urging other businesses to follow suit. He also expressed concerns about the trend towards shorter working weeks, stating that the industry cannot afford to have employees working fewer days while receiving full pay.</p>

<p>"The industry cannot afford it. We can't have people working three days a week and picking up five days a week pay - or four days," he said.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Preliminary investigations suggest that asphyxiation due to oxygen deprivation was the probable cause of death.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thai authorities have confirmed the deaths of three foreign workers who were trapped in a collapsed train tunnel for over five days, despite extensive rescue efforts, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn49gwexqy1o" rel="nofollow, noindex">BBC</a></em> reported. The victims, comprising two Chinese nationals and one Myanmar citizen, were initially believed to have survived until Thursday. However, on Friday, authorities announced all three had died.&nbsp;All three bodies were found about 25 metres from the point of the tunnel collapse, officials said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The victims have been identified as Chinese project supervisor Hu Siang Min, Chinese backhoe driver Dong Chinlin, and a truck driver from Myanmar whose identity was yet to be confirmed, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/southeast-asia/thailand-tunnel-collapse-dead-chinese-national-b2604301.html" rel="nofollow, noindex">Independent</a></em> reported. Preliminary investigations suggest that asphyxiation due to oxygen deprivation was the probable cause of death, as announced by officials on Friday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tunnel, which was still under construction as part of the Thailand-China high-speed railway project, collapsed around 23:40 local time (16:40 GMT) last Saturday due to a landslide.&nbsp;To save the trapped workers, a dedicated team of rescuers from the State Railway of Thailand (SRT) and a specialised Chinese disaster response team worked tirelessly around the clock for over a week.&nbsp;They tried to pump oxygen into the tunnel to keep the workers alive, but it is unclear whether the tubes they used reached the workers at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Advanced scanners and trained sniffer dogs had also detected faint vital signs, suggesting that the trapped workers might still be clinging to life. However, the rescue operation was slow due to the treacherous conditions caused by the ongoing landslide. Rescuers faced a constant battle as falling debris and dirt continually filled in the holes they painstakingly dug, blocking their path.&nbsp;The rescue teams also had to be extremely careful while digging&nbsp;so that it would not cause other parts of the tunnel to collapse.</p>

<p>Anutin Charnvirakul, Thailand's caretaker Interior Minister, noted that rescue efforts were limited by the challenging engineering conditions.</p>

<p>"Nobody wanted [this incident] to happen. "We did not only try to save the lives of the victims, but we also had to [ensure the safety] of the rescuers and workers," he said at a press conference on Friday.</p>

<p>The state railways company offered its condolences to the victims' families and said it was ''ready to assist the families of the deceased''.</p>

<p>Following the tragic incident, the Thai authorities have launched a comprehensive investigation into the tunnel collapse. In the meantime, all construction activities in the vicinity of the tunnel have been temporarily suspended.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump's dance moves at a public event on Friday have taken social media by storm. The annual Moms for Liberty event, held in Washington DC, saw 78-year-old Tump shake a leg on stage with the group's co-founder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Trump just ended his Moms For Liberty event with his impressive dance moves! Moms love Donald Trump! Kamala (Harris) definitely doesn't want you to share this!" posted a Trump supporter with the video.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">?TRUMP JUST ENDED HIS MOMS FOR LIBERTY EVENT WITH HIS IMPRESSIVE DANCE MOVES!<br />
<br />
MOMS LOVE DONALD TRUMP!<br />
<br />
Kamala definitely doesn't want you to share this! <a href="https://t.co/EV5BNLsyKM">pic.twitter.com/EV5BNLsyKM</a></p>
— Bo Loudon (@BoLoudon) <a href="https://twitter.com/BoLoudon/status/1829702054383640916?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 31, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>The internet is divided over the dance video. While some cheered Trump for being able to dance at the age of 78, some termed the entire episode as "comical".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Trump is the people's president!" wrote one user.</p>

<p>"He's the worst version of the creepy, unstable uncle in the family," wrote another.</p>

<p>Moms for Liberty, a national group that has made strides within conservative circles, has been at the forefront of efforts to influence school curricula across the United States. The organisation has led initiatives to remove references to LGBTQ+ identities and discussions of structural racism from classrooms.</p>

<p>The Republican presidential frontrunner discussed issues surrounding these topics and did not shy away from making pointed political comments, particularly aimed at US Vice President Kamala Harris. In his address, Trump described her as a "defective person." He also expressed surprise at her limited media appearances, suggesting that her lack of interviews was indicative of her shortcomings as a leader. "I was surprised she didn't do a lot of interviews, but she's not good at it, I guess," Trump said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US Presidential elections are scheduled to be held in November this year and is largely seen as a direct battle between Trump and Harris.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 700 people arrested during protests that erupted after Venezuela's disputed presidential election have been transferred to maximum security prisons, a human rights group said Saturday.</p>

<p>The detainees, who had been held at police stations around the country, were transferred over the past week to two notorious prisons that were previously controlled by gangs, the Venezuelan Prisons Observatory said.</p>

<p>In many cases the transfers were conducted under questionable circumstances, with detainees' relatives not informed of the moves to Tocuyito and Tocoron prisons, the group said.</p>

<p>"They were conducted with many irregularities," the NGO said in a press release.</p>

<p>More than 2,400 people were arrested after the protests that broke out after President Nicolas Maduro was declared winner of the disputed July 28 election.</p>

<p>The opposition claims it won by a landslide and has voting records to prove this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The leftist Maduro government, brushing off accusations of authoritarianism, has resisted intense international pressure to release vote tally numbers to back up its claim of victory.</p>

<p>The United States, the European Union and several Latin American countries have refused to recognize Maduro as having won without seeing detailed voting results.</p>

<p>The violence that accompanied the protests left 27 people dead and 192 injured.</p>

<p>Venezuelan Prisons Observatory said none of the people transferred to maximum security facilities have been allowed to contact their families or attorneys.</p>

<p>Of the 2,400 detainees, 1,581 have been listed as political prisoners by another advocacy group, called Penal Forum.</p>

<p>It said 114 of the total are adolescents and 18 of them were released on bail Saturday. This raised to 34 the number of youths freed from detention.</p>

<p>Some of those arrested are as young as 13 and have been sent to prisons with older, common criminals, opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said this week.</p>

<p>"What they have done is brutal," she said of the Maduro government.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman allegedly killed her boyfriend's 9-year-old daughter by thrashing her and making her Rottweiler dog attack the child at their home in US' Florida, police said.</p>

<p>Tyshael Elise Martin, 34, told police she had found Jamaria Sessions unresponsive when she went to wake her up for a family vacation to California on June 17.</p>

<p>But police suspected Martin's involvement in the girl's death as her body was found covered in cuts, burns, bruises and bite marks.</p>

<p>While checking the security footage inside their home, police found that the woman trying to let her Rottweiler dog loose on the unsuspecting child, even encouraging the dog to attack the little girl.</p>

<p>The footage then shows the dog "viciously attack" Jamaria even as Martin herself kept beating her.</p>

<p>In the video, she can be seen kicking the girl until she went limp and then dragging her across the floor and hitting her again.</p>

<p>At one point, the CCTV captures her saying she wants to murder the child. "I'm fixin' to kill her," she says.</p>

<p>Reports suggest the violence the 9-year-old faced was not new to her as she was frequently subjected to punishments like being struck with objects, prolonged wall sits and other forms of abuse.</p>

<p>Policemen who watched the video have called it the "the worst case of aggravated child abuse" they've ever seen. The brutal death has been devastating to family who said their "beautiful little girl was now gone.”</p>

<p>A case of murder, aggravated child abuse and child neglect have been filed against Martin. She was arrested and remains in jail.</p>

<p>Her death was ruled a homicide caused by blunt force trauma to the head and thermal injury to the foot.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A health official said a polio vaccination campaign began in Gaza on Saturday, while an aid worker said a large-scale rollout would begin on Sunday, coinciding with a "humanitarian pause" agreed by Israel and Hamas.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A health official said a polio vaccination campaign began in Gaza on Saturday, while an aid worker said a large-scale rollout would begin on Sunday, coinciding with a "humanitarian pause" agreed by Israel and Hamas.</p>

<p>The vaccination drive was announced after Gaza recorded its first polio case in a quarter of a century earlier this month.</p>

<p>Local health officials along with the UN and NGOs "are starting today the polio vaccination campaign", Moussa Abed, director of primary health care at the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, told AFP on Saturday.</p>

<p>An unspecified number of children received the first dose of the vaccination, which involves two doses and is administered orally, at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Yunis.</p>

<p>Among them was Amal Shaheen's three-year-old daughter, who was already in the hospital being treated for pneumonia.</p>

<p>"We have been in the hospital for 17 days... I spend all my days worrying about her," Shaheen said.</p>

<p>"Today she was vaccinated against polio to protect her, like all the children in the hospital have been vaccinated."</p>

<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday that Israel had agreed to a series of three-day "humanitarian pauses" in Gaza to facilitate vaccinations, though officials had earlier said the campaign was expected to start on Sunday.</p>

<h2><strong>'Not a ceasefire'</strong></h2>

<p>An international aid worker told AFP that Palestinian authorities had organised a launch event on Saturday and that the vaccination campaign was still expected to begin in full on Sunday.</p>

<p>COGAT, the Israeli defence ministry body which oversees civilian affairs in the Palestinian territories, said on Saturday that vaccines would be given daily from 6:00 am (0300 GMT) until 2:00 pm for three days in central Gaza, three days in southern Gaza and three days in northern Gaza.</p>

<p>"At the end of each regional vaccination campaign, a situational assessment will be conducted for the area," it said.</p>

<p>The Palestinian health ministry distributed a slightly different schedule, with the vaccine programme lasting four days in each location.</p>

<p>The ministry identified 67 vaccination centres -- mostly hospitals, smaller health centres and schools -- in central Gaza, 59 in southern Gaza and 33 in northern Gaza.</p>

<p>Poliovirus is highly infectious and most often spread through sewage and contaminated water -- an increasingly common problem in Gaza as the Israel-Hamas war drags on.</p>

<p>The media office of the Hamas-run government in Gaza said on Saturday that the vaccination campaign required an "immediate ceasefire".</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said measures to facilitate polio vaccination in Gaza are "not a ceasefire".</p>

<p>The campaign aims to cover more than 640,000 children under 10 years old.</p>

<p>Michael Ryan, WHO deputy director-general, told the UN Security Council this week that 1.26 million doses of the oral vaccine had been delivered in Gaza, with another 400,000 still to arrive</p>

<p>The Ramallah-based Palestinian health ministry said earlier this month that tests in Jordan had confirmed polio in an unvaccinated 10-month-old baby from central Gaza.</p>

<p>Poliovirus is highly infectious and most often spread through sewage and contaminated water -- an increasingly common problem in Gaza as the Israel-Hamas war drags on.</p>

<p>The disease mainly affects children under the age of five. It can cause deformities and paralysis and is potentially fatal.</p>

<h2><strong>'100 per cent safe'</strong></h2>

<p>Bakr Deeb told AFP on Saturday that he brought his three children -- all under 10 -- to a vaccination point on Saturday despite some initial doubts about its safety.</p>

<p>"I was hesitant at first and very afraid of the safety of this vaccination," he said.</p>

<p>"After the assurances of its safety, and with all the families going to the vaccination points, I decided to go with my children as well, to protect them."</p>

<p>Abed, the health official, stressed on Saturday that the vaccine was "100 percent safe".</p>

<p>The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on October 7 which resulted in the deaths of 1,199 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 40,691 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry. The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.</p>

<p>Incessant Israeli bombardment has also caused a major humanitarian crisis and devastated the health system.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A beluga whale named Hvaldimir which captured the world's imagination in 2019 was found dead in Norway, a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/31/world/europe/hvaldimir-spy-whale-dead.htm">report</a> said. The 14-foot-long and 2,700-pound whale was spotted with a harness seemingly designed for a camera five years ago, prompting the internet to nickname him Hvaldimir the spy whale.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The harness bore the marking "equipment" from St. Petersburg, fueling widespread speculation that the whale was part of a Russian reconnaissance mission. The mystery deepened as no official claim of ownership was made by Russia, leaving the world to wonder if this whale was a spy or just an unfortunate whale caught in a strange circumstance.</p>

<p>The beluga, whose name is a blend of the Norwegian word for whale, "hval," and the Russian name Vladimir, quickly became a subject of global fascination. Unlike other belugas, which typically inhabit the remote and frigid Arctic waters, Hvaldimir appeared unusually comfortable around humans, leading experts to believe he had been in captivity for much of his life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's heartbreaking. He's touched thousands of people's hearts just here in Norway," Sebastian Strand, founder of the nonprofit Marine Mind, which worked to protect Hvaldimir, said as quoted by the New York Times.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last year, Norway requested its citizens to avoid any type of contact with Hvaldimir who was seen in a fjord close to Oslo.</p>

<p>"The white whale known as "Hvaldimir" now resides in the inner Oslofjord. This means that it has arrived in a very densely populated area, and the risk that the whale may be injured due to human contact has thus become significantly greater," a statement by the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries read.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Israel's army on Saturday announced the first death of a soldier during its ongoing raid in the occupied West Bank that began four days ago.</p>

<p>An army statement said 20-year-old Elkana Navon "fell during operational activity" on Saturday and that another soldier was "severely injured" in the same incident, without providing details.</p>

<p>Since Wednesday at least 22 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli army, most of them operatives, in simultaneous raids in several cities in the northern West Bank.</p>

<p>Since Friday, soldiers have concentrated their operations on the city of Jenin and its refugee camp, long a bastion of Palestinian armed groups fighting against Israel.</p>

<p>Violence has surged in the West Bank since Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel triggered the war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>The United Nations said on Wednesday that at least 637 Palestinians had been killed in the territory by Israeli troops or settlers since the Gaza war began.</p>

<p>Twenty Israelis, including soldiers, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or during army operations over the same period, according to Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>During a visit to Jenin on Saturday, Israeli army chief of staff Herzi Halevi said Israeli forces "have no intention of letting terrorism (in the West Bank) raise its head" to threaten Israel.</p>

<p>"Therefore the initiative is to go from city to city, refugee camp to refugee camp, with excellent intelligence, with very good operational capabilities, with a very strong air intelligence envelope... We will protect the citizens of Israel just like that."</p>

<p>Of the 22 Palestinians reported dead since Wednesday, Hamas and its ally Islamic Jihad have said at least 14 were members of their armed wings.</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, Hamas issued a statement saying one of its fighters carried out an "ambush" using "a highly explosive device" in the Jenin refugee camp "which led to the deaths and injuries of members of the advancing (Israeli) force".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UNICEF said Saturday that it has launched an emergency tender for mpox vaccines to help countries hardest hit by the recent outbreak of the disease.</p>

<p>"The emergency tender is designed to secure immediate access to available mpox vaccines as well as to expand production," UNICEF said in a statement issued along with the World Health Organization, the Gavi vaccine alliance and Africa CDC (Centres for Disease Control and Prevention).</p>

<p>"Depending on demand, production capacity of manufacturers and funding, agreements for up to 12 million doses through 2025 can be put in place," it said.</p>

<p>Under the emergency tender, UNICEF plans to set up conditional supply agreements with vaccine manufacturers.</p>

<p>This "will enable UNICEF to purchase and ship vaccines without delay once countries and partners have secured financing, confirmed demand and readiness, and the regulatory requirements for accepting the vaccines are in place".</p>

<p>The WHO declared an international emergency over mpox on August 14, concerned by the surge in cases of the new Clade 1b strain in the Democratic Republic of Congo that spread to nearby countries.</p>

<p>More than 18,000 suspected cases of mpox have been reported in the DRC so far this year, with 629 deaths.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris said Saturday that her Republican rival Donald Trump "disrespected sacred ground" at a US military cemetery during a contentious pre-election visit.</p>

<p>Trump's presence at the hallowed Arlington National Cemetery -- intended to provide a campaign boost ahead of the November 5 vote -- has instead mushroomed into a public dispute consuming the candidates and the military.</p>

<p>"Let me be clear: the former president disrespected sacred ground, all for the sake of a political stunt," Harris said of Monday's incident at the cemetery near Washington, where Trump defied the rules and posed for photos with relatives of US service members killed in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>In one image, he is standing with family members of a fallen Marine, posing among headstones while grinning broadly and giving a thumbs-up.</p>

<p>"If there is one thing on which we as Americans can all agree, it is that our veterans, military families, and service members should be honored, never disparaged, and treated with nothing less than our highest respect and gratitude," Harris wrote on X.</p>

<p><strong>'Abruptly pushed aside'</strong></p>

<p>On Thursday, the US Army issued a rare statement confirming that a cemetery staff member had been "abruptly pushed aside" after asking Trump's team to stop filming in a burial section for those killed in recent wars, where photography for political purposes is banned.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign team has gone on the offensive by describing the employee as a "despicable individual" and claiming she was suffering a mental health episode.</p>

<p>But the military said the staff member had "acted with professionalism" and it condemned the incident as "unfortunate."</p>

<p>Trump has made criticism of the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the US retreat from Afghanistan a keynote of his campaign, arguing that he would have managed it better.</p>

<p>He visited the cemetery with families of some of the 13 service members killed in a 2021 bombing in Kabul during the last, chaotic hours of the US withdrawal.</p>

<p>Trump's relationship with the military has long spawned controversy.</p>

<p>While often touting his support for the armed forces, he privately mocked the war dead while he was president and did not want to be seen near military amputees, according to his former chief of staff.</p>

<p>Harris's blunt response Saturday over the cemetery incident appeared to underline her determination to take the fight directly to Trump in what is shaping up to be a bruising presidential election.</p>

<p>Trump has repeatedly mocked Harris's name, intelligence, appearance and racial identity, while the Harris campaign has replied that the former president is "weird," an aspiring dictator, and "out of his mind."</p>

<p>Harris earlier faced withering criticism over the cemetery incident from Trump's running mate, Senator J.D. Vance, who has launched a series of fierce attacks against the vice president.</p>

<p>Apparently responding to a mistaken report that Harris had already reacted to the cemetery visit, Vance accused her of feigning outrage and said, "She can go to hell."</p>

<p>"Don't focus on Donald Trump showing up to grieve with some people who lost their children. Focus on your own job. Don't do this fake outrage thing," he later told the Washington Post.</p>

<p>At that point Harris had not publicly mentioned the cemetery visit.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seven people, including a six-year-old and 16-year-old, were killed when a bus overturned east of Vicksburg, Mississippi, early Saturday, Warren County Coroner Doug Huskey said.</p>

<p>The two young victims were siblings, according to the coroner.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Highway Patrol said the incident took place around 12:40 a.m. on Interstate 20 near Bovina in Warren County when a 2018 Volvo commercial passenger bus traveling westbound left the roadway and overturned.</p>

<p>Thirty-seven passengers were transported to different hospitals with unknown injuries, the agency said. It said the co-driver was not transported.</p>

<p>"Anytime you have people injured or killed, it's tragic but when you have a situation like this where you have multiple fatalities and multiple injuries, it makes it even worse," Warren County Sheriff Martin Pace told an ABC affiliate.</p>

<p>Huskey said most of the passengers on the bus were Latin American.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yemen's Houthi said on Saturday that they attacked a Liberia-flagged container vessel for a second time in the latest action against commercial shipping in the Gulf of Aden.</p>

<p>Yemeni military spokesperson Yahya Saree's televised statement did not specify when the latest attack on the MV Groton took place.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations said in an advisory note that two missiles exploded on Friday in close proximity to the vessel, 130 nautical miles east of Yemen's Aden. It said the crew was safe. There was no mention of damage to the vessel.</p>

<p>"The operation was carried out by the naval, UAV, and the missile forces ... This is the second targeting of the ship since it was previously targeted on Aug. 3," Saree said.</p>

<p>Houthi have sunk two vessels during a nine-month drone and missile campaign against commercial shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.</p>

<p>They say their attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip and likely will continue if a ceasefire is not reached.</p>

<p>In one of their most recent attacks, the Houthis carried out multiple assaults against Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion, which is carrying about 1 million barrels of oil.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A crew member on Mike Lynch's yacht has spoken of being thrown into the water and efforts to rescue passengers as a storm sank the vessel off Sicily this month, in a disaster that killed the British tech tycoon and six other people.</p>

<p>Matthew Griffiths, who was on watch duty on the night of the tragedy, told investigators that the crew members did everything they could to save those on board the Bayesian, according to comments reported by Italian news agency Ansa.</p>

<p>Griffiths, the boat's captain James Cutfield, and ship engineer Tim Parker Eaton have been placed under investigation by the Italian authorities for potential manslaughter and shipwreck. Being investigated does not imply guilt and does not mean formal charges will follow.</p>

<p>"I woke up the captain when the wind was at 20 knots (23 mph/37 kph). He gave orders to wake everyone else," Ansa quoted Griffiths as saying.</p>

<p>"The ship tilted and we were thrown into the water. Then we managed to get back up and tried to rescue those we could," he added, describing the events of the early hours of Aug. 19, when the Bayesian had been anchored off the Sicilian port of Porticello.</p>

<p>"We were walking on the walls (of the boat). We saved who we could, Cutfield also saved the little girl and her mother," he said, referring to passenger Charlotte Golunski and her one-year-old daughter. In all there were 15 survivors of the wreck.</p>

<p>Cutfield exercised his right to remain silent when questioned by prosecutors on Tuesday, his lawyers said, saying he was "worn out" and that they needed more time to build a defence case. Parker Eaton has not commented on the investigation.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Raffaele Cammarano said last week that the vessel was most likely hit by a "downburst", a very strong downward wind.</p>

<p>However, the sinking has puzzled naval marine experts, who said a vessel like the Bayesian, built by Italian high-end yacht manufacturer Perini, should have withstood the storm and, in any case, should not have sunk as quickly as it did.</p>

<p>Prosecutors in the town of Termini Imerese, near Palermo, have said their investigation will take time, with the wreck yet to be salvaged from the sea.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday suggested his support for the decriminalization of marijuana, saying taxpayer dollars should not be wasted arresting people carrying "personal amounts."</p>

<p>"In Florida, like so many other states that have already given their approval, personal amounts of marijuana will be legalized for adults with Amendment 3," Trump said about an effort in his home state to legalize the possession and purchase of up to 3 ounces for adults over the age of 21.</p>

<p>"Whether people like it or not, this will happen through the approval of the voters, so it should be done correctly."</p>

<p>Trump, who is the Republican nominee for president, said state lawmakers should create laws that ban use of marijuana in public spaces.</p>

<p>He added that someone should not be a criminal in one state when marijuana use is legal in others.</p>

<p>"We do not need to ruin lives and waste taxpayer dollars arresting adults with personal amounts of it on them, and no one should grieve a loved one because they died from fentanyl laced marijuana," Trump said.</p>

<p>Marijuana is legal in some form in nearly 40 states.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[A new blood test developed by scientists can detect glioblastoma, a deadly brain cancer, in just 60 minutes using a small blood sample.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have created a novel method for detecting brain cancer that is faster and less invasive than typical surgical biopsies. The newly developed 'liquid biopsy' uses only 100 microlitres of blood and can detect biomarkers associated with glioblastoma-the most prevalent and lethal type of brain tumour-in just one hour.</p>

<p>The test, which is more accurate than any known approach for detecting glioblastoma, is described by its researchers as having "near turn-key functionality." A team of researchers from the University of Notre Dame in the United States collaborated with Australian scientists to develop the new approach. While still in its early stages, this proof of concept marks a huge step forward in brain cancer diagnosis.</p>

<p>According to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://news.nd.edu/news/researchers-develop-affordable-rapid-blood-test-for-brain-cancer/"><em>release by University Of Notre Dam</em></a>, the average glioblastoma patient survives 12-18 months after diagnosis. The crux of the diagnostic is a biochip that uses electrokinetic technology to detect biomarkers, or active Epidermal Growth Factor Receptors (EGFRs), which are overexpressed in certain cancers such as glioblastoma and found in extracellular vesicles.</p>

<p>"Extracellular vesicles or exosomes are unique nanoparticles secreted by cells. They are big - 10 to 50 times bigger than a molecule - and they have a weak charge. Our technology was specifically designed for these nanoparticles, using their features to our advantage," said Hsueh-Chia Chang, the Bayer Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Notre Dame and lead author of the study about the diagnostic published in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-024-06385-1"><em>Communications Biology.</em></a></p>

<p>The challenge for researchers was two-fold: to develop a process that could distinguish between active and non-active EGFRs, and create a diagnostic technology that was sensitive yet selective in detecting active EGFRs on extracellular vesicles from blood samples.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US rapper Fatman Scoop has died, his family and manager announced Saturday, after the 53-year-old artist suffered a medical emergency while performing on stage, prompting a wave of tributes from the world of hip-hop.</p>

<p>Scoop, best known for the hit tracks "Be Faithful" and "It Takes Scoop," collapsed on stage at Hamden Town Center Park, Connecticut and was taken to hospital where doctors were unable to revive him, US media reported.</p>

<p>Medical staff apparently attempted to administer CPR while he was still on the stage, according to a video of the incident obtained by celebrity news site TMZ. He was then carried away on a stretcher.</p>

<p>In a post on his Instagram account, his family wrote that "it is with profound sadness and very heavy hearts that we share news of the passing of the legendary and iconic Fatman Scoop."</p>

<p>"Fatman Scoop was known to the world as the undisputed voice of the club. His music made us dance and embrace life with positivity," they wrote.</p>

<p>Scoop's manager Birch Michael confirmed his death on Facebook, writing: "I love you Scoop. Thank you so much for everything you gave to me."</p>

<h3><strong>'Want to dance'</strong></h3>

<p>Hip-hop star Missy Elliott wrote on X that Scoop's "voice and energy have contributed to many songs that made the people feel happy and want to dance for over two decades. Your impact is huge and will be never be forgotten."</p>

<p>Radio host Shelley Wade posted a photograph of herself with Scoop, writing: "We are losing too many of our hip-hop legends too soon. Rest easy, Scoop."</p>

<p>Scoop briefly became embroiled in a political row in Australia in 2018 when the country's then-prime minister Scott Morrison posted a clip that featured his hit "Be Faithful."</p>

<p>Morrison, a conservative evangelical Christian, deleted the post after his critics said the entertainer's lyrics were inappropriate and unparliamentary.</p>

<p>"It's quite clear that that is not a song on my playlist," he later told reporters in Sydney.</p>

<p>The uproar prompted a response from Scoop, who tagged Morrison in an Instagram post saying: "I am humbled to have my voice rocking in the highest offices of the Australian Government!"</p>

<p>The rapper defended his lyrics: "It's a fun PARTY SONG that has no NEGATIVITY or HARM in it!!" before extending Morrison a backstage invite to a festival appearance in Australia.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With its ban of X, which went into effect on Saturday, Brazil joins a small club of countries to have taken similar measures against the social network, most of them run by authoritarian regimes.</p>

<p>Beyond permanent bans, some nations have temporarily restricted access to X, formerly Twitter, which has often been used by political dissidents to communicate.</p>

<p>These have included Egypt in 2011 during the Arab Spring uprisings, Turkey in 2014 and 2023, and Uzbekistan around that country's 2021 presidential election.</p>

<p>Here is a list of some of the others.</p>

<p><strong>China</strong></p>

<p>Beijing banned Twitter in June 2009 -- before it secured the prominent place it enjoyed in Western media and politics for much of the 2010s.</p>

<p>The block came two days before the 20-year anniversary of the government's crushing of pro-democracy demonstrations in the capital's Tiananmen Square.</p>

<p>Since then, many Chinese people have turned to home-grown alternatives such as Weibo and WeChat.</p>

<p><strong>Iran</strong></p>

<p>Twitter was also blocked by Tehran in 2009, as a wave of demonstrations broke out following a contested June presidential election.</p>

<p>The network has nevertheless been used since then to pass information to the outside world about dissident movements, including the demonstrations against Iran's repression of women's rights since late 2022.</p>

<p><strong>Turkmenistan</strong></p>

<p>Isolated Central Asian country Turkmenistan blocked Twitter in the early 2010s alongside many other foreign online services and websites.</p>

<p>Authorities in Ashgabat surveil closely citizens' usage of the internet, provided through state-run monopoly operator TurkmenTelecom.</p>

<p><strong>North Korea</strong></p>

<p>Pyongyang opened its own Twitter account in 2010 in a bid to woo foreigners interested in the country.</p>

<p>But the application has been blocked along with Facebook, Youtube and gambling and pornography websites since April 2016.</p>

<p>Internet access beyond a few government websites is under tight government watch in the hermit regime, with access restricted to a few high-ranking officials.</p>

<p><strong>Myanmar</strong></p>

<p>X has been blocked since February 2021, when authorities took aim at the app for its use by opponents of the military coup that overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi's civilian government.</p>

<p>Since then, the junta has kept a tight grip on internet access in Myanmar.</p>

<p><strong>Russia</strong></p>

<p>Access to Twitter was throttled from 2021 by Moscow, which complained the site was allowing users to spread "illegal content".</p>

<p>A formal ban came in March 2022, just after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Many Russian users continue to connect to X via VPN services that allow them to get around the block.</p>

<p><strong>Pakistan</strong></p>

<p>X has been banned since parliamentary polls in February this year.</p>

<p>Pakistan's government, backed by the army, say the block is for security reasons.</p>

<p>Former prime minister Imran Khan -- now in jail -- was targeted by widespread allegations of fraud spread via the platform against his opposition party.</p>

<p><strong>Venezuela</strong></p>

<p>Nicolas Maduro, who was declared winner of July's presidential election despite grave suspicions of fraud, ordered access to X suspended for 10 days on August 9 as security forces were violently putting down nationwide demonstrations.</p>

<p>The block has remained in place beyond the expiry of the 10-day period.</p>

<p><strong>Brazil</strong></p>

<p>The country's block on X has come from the judiciary, via Supreme Court judge Alexandre de Moraes.</p>

<p>He has highlighted the reactivation of accounts that had been ordered suspended by Brazilian courts.</p>

<p>Users connecting to X via a VPN face a fine of 50,000 reais ($8,900) per day.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations Security Council needs urgent reforms and India should get its rightful place as a permanent member of the top UN body, says former Singapore diplomat professor Kishore Mahbubani.</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview to NDTV's Sonia Singh, Mr Mahbubani talked about the much-needed reforms in the United Nations, saying that he believes the United Kingdom should give up its permanent seat at the UN Security Council (UNSC) for India.</p>

<p>"There is absolutely no question that India is the third-most powerful country in the world today after the United States and China. And that Great Britain is no longer 'great'," he said.</p>

<p>Explaining why the UK should relinquish its seat, Mr Mahbubani mentioned that the UK has not used its veto power for decades, fearing backlash. "So, the logical thing for the UK to do is give up its seat to India," he said.</p>

<p>Speaking on the UN reforms, he said the founders of the UN ensured that all great powers of the time had vested interests in the organisation in order to make it work.</p>

<p>"The lesson that (UN's founders) learned from the collapse of the League of Nations early in the 20th century is that if a great power leaves, the organisation collapses," the former diplomat said.</p>

<p>"But they also believed that you must have the great powers of today, not the great powers of yesterday. Unfortunately, they didn't create a mechanism for changing the seats," he said.</p>

<p>"Another reason for the UK to give up its seat is that it will free them up to act independently," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

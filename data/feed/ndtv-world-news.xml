       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy has spoken out strongly against attacks on the Hindu minority community in Bangladesh during the recent political unrest in the country following the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.&nbsp;Condemning the violence, Mr Ramaswamy said the deeper issues in Bangladesh are rooted in the country's long-standing, yet controversial, quota system.</p>

<p>"The targeted violence against Hindus in Bangladesh is wrong, it's concerning, and it's a cautionary tale for victimhood-laced quota systems," Mr Ramaswamy wrote on X.&nbsp;</p>

Here's what happened: Bangladesh fought a bloody war for its independence in 1971. Hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi civilians were…</p>
— Vivek Ramaswamy (@VivekGRamaswamy) <a href="https://twitter.com/VivekGRamaswamy/status/1823533267984749035?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Mr Ramaswamy went on to explain the origins of the quota system, which was implemented after the 1971 war that saw Bangladesh gain independence from Pakistan.</p>

<p>"Bangladesh fought a bloody war for its independence in 1971. Hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi civilians were raped and murdered. It was a tragedy, and it was rightly mourned. But in its aftermath, Bangladesh implemented a quota system for jobs in their civil service: 80% of the jobs were allocated to specific social groups (war veterans, rape victims, underrepresented residents, etc.), and only 20% were allocated based on merit," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The political turmoil in Bangladesh reached a climax on August 5, when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, aged 76, fled the country by helicopter to India as protesters overran the streets of Dhaka. Her 15-year rule, marked by allegations of human rights abuses, came to a dramatic end. The weeks leading up to her ousting were bloody, with more than 450 dying during the unrest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The quota system proved to be a disaster," Mr Ramaswamy claimed, pointing to the 2018 protests that led Bangladesh to scrap most of the quotas, only for them to be reinstated in 2024. The Indian-origin politician warned that such systems, designed to rectify past wrongs, can inadvertently perpetuate cycles of violence.</p>

<p>"Once chaos begins, it can't easily be reined in. Radicals are now targeting Hindu minorities. A quota conflict created to rectify the wrongs of rape and violence in 1971 is now leading to more rape and violence in 2024. Bloodshed is the endpoint of grievance and victimhood. It's hard not to look at Bangladesh and wonder what lessons we would do well to learn right here at home," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Members of Ms Hasina's Awami League party went into hiding, and the country plunged into further instability. According to reports from the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council and the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad, there have been at least 205 incidents of attacks on minority communities across 52 districts since Ms Hasina's departure. Thousands of Bangladeshi Hindus have sought refuge in India, fearing for their safety in the volatile environment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities investigating the Brazilian plane crash that killed all 62 on board last week now have the full transcript of the "black box" but its content did not immediately explain the cause of the accident, local TV station Globo said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The transcript from the cockpit voice recorder shows the pilot and copilot noticed a steep loss of altitude about one minute before the crash, TV Globo reported in its main newscast Jornal Nacional on Wednesday evening, citing unnamed people working on the investigation.</p>

<p>TV Globo did not release the audio or the transcript.</p>

<p>According to TV Globo, the transcript covers about two hours of audio recording, including a question from the copilot to the pilot about what was going on, and saying the plane needed "more power" to be stabilized.</p>

<p>The plane, an ATR-72 turboprop from local airline Voepass, was bound for Sao Paulo from Cascavel, in the southern state of Parana, and crashed at around 1:30 p.m. (1630 GMT) in the town of Vinhedo, some 80 km (50 miles) northwest of Sao Paulo.</p>

<p>The crash killed all aboard but no one on the ground was hurt.</p>

<p>Video shared on social media right after the accident showed the ATR-72 aircraft spinning out of control as it plunged down behind a cluster of trees near houses, followed by a large plume of black smoke.</p>

<p>The pilots did not report an emergency or adverse weather conditions, the Brazilian Air Force said on Friday in a statement.</p>

<p>TV Globo said that, according to people investigating the crash, analysis of the audio alone will not make it possible for now to determine the cause of the crash.</p>

<p>TV Globo also said the authorities did not identify any characteristic sounds, such as from fire, electrical collapse or engine breakdowns, although the audio was said to be difficult to listen to.</p>

<p>A potential icing issue on the plane's wing was neither discarded nor confirmed by authorities, TV Globo said.</p>

<p>Videos of the crash analyzed by aviation experts led some to speculate that ice had built up on the plane.</p>

<p>Brazil's aviation accident investigation centre, Cenipa, could not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment about the TV Globo report outside of regular business hours.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Columbia University President Minouche Shafik resigned on Wednesday, nearly four months after the Ivy League university's handling of campus protests over Israel's war in Gaza was criticized by pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian sides alike.</p>

<p>"It has also been a period of turmoil where it has been difficult to overcome divergent views across our community," Shafik said in an email to staff and students. "This period has taken a considerable toll on my family, as it has for others in our community."</p>

<p>Shafik said her departure "at this point would best enable Columbia to traverse the challenges ahead." She said she made the announcement so new leadership could be in place before the new term begins.</p>

<p>Columbia was rocked in April and May as protesters occupied parts of the Upper Manhattan campus in opposition to Palestinian civilian deaths in Gaza, resulting in hundreds of arrests. The demonstrators denounced Shafik for calling police onto campus to halt the demonstrations, while pro-Israel supporters castigated her for failing to crack down sufficiently.</p>

<p>Katrina Armstrong, Columbia's executive vice president for health and biomedical services, will serve as the interim president, according to the university website.</p>

<p>Republican US Representative Elise Stefanik from upstate New York, who castigated Shafik and other university leaders in congressional hearings over Gaza protests nationwide, welcomed her resignation on X, saying it was "overdue" because of her failure to protect Jewish students.</p>

<p>Shafik, an Egyptian-born economist who holds British and U.S. nationality, was previously deputy governor of the Bank of England, president of the London School of Economics and deputy managing director at the International Monetary Fund.</p>

<p>She became the 20th president of Columbia University in July 2023.</p>

<p>After protesters set up dozens of tents and demanded that the university sell its Israeli assets, university officials tried to negotiate an agreement with protesters on dismantling the camps.</p>

<p>As talks failed, Shafik on April 18 took the unusual step of asking New York police to enter the campus, angering many rights groups, students and faculty.</p>

<p>More than 100 people were arrested and the tents were removed from the main lawn, but within a few days, the encampment was back in place. The university called the police back in on April 30, when they arrested 300 people at Columbia and the City College of New York.</p>

<p>Shafik then asked police to stay until at least May 17 - two days after graduation - "to maintain order and ensure that encampments are not re-established."</p>

<p>The current Gaza conflict was triggered on Oct. 7 when Palestinian fighters from Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent assault on the Hamas-governed enclave has since killed nearly 40,000 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry, while displacing nearly the entire population of 2.3 million, causing a hunger crisis and leading to genocide allegations at the World Court that Israel denies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke on the phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday and discussed the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, Axios reported, citing two US sources.</p>

<p>One source told Axios that Trump's call was intended to encourage Netanyahu to take the deal, but stressed he did not know if this was indeed what the former president told Netanyahu. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Late last month, Netanyahu visited the US and met President Joe Biden, Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris and Republican former President Trump.</p>

<p>Egypt, the United States and Qatar have scheduled a new round of Gaza ceasefire negotiations for Thursday.</p>

<p>Biden laid out a three-phase ceasefire proposal in an address on May 31. Washington and regional mediators have since tried arranging the Gaza ceasefire-for-hostages deal but have run into repeated obstacles.</p>

<p>Hamas said on Wednesday it would not take part in a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks slated for Thursday in Qatar, but an official briefed on the talks said mediators expected to consult with the Palestinian Islamist group afterwards.</p>

<p>Washington, Israel's most important ally, has said that a ceasefire in Gaza will reduce the rising threat of a wider war in the Middle East.</p>

<p>There has been an increased risk of a broader war after the recent killings of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran and Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut. Both drew threats of retaliation against Israel.</p>

<p>The latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on Oct. 7 when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent assault on the Hamas-governed enclave has since killed nearly 40,000 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry, while also displacing nearly the entire population of 2.3 million, causing a hunger crisis and leading to genocide allegations at the World Court that Israel denies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Google on Tuesday confirmed that hackers backed by Iran are targeting the campaigns of US presidential rivals Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google on Tuesday confirmed that hackers backed by Iran are targeting the campaigns of US presidential rivals Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.</p>

<p>A hacker group known as "APT42" linked to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps went after high-profile individuals and organizations in Israel and the United States, including government officials and political campaigns, according to a threat report released by Google.</p>

<p>Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris's campaign said Tuesday it had been targeted by foreign hackers, days after rival Donald Trump's campaign suggested that it had been hacked by Iran.</p>

<p>"In July, the campaign legal and security teams were notified by the FBI that we were targeted by a foreign actor influence operation," a Harris campaign official told AFP.</p>

<p>"We have robust cybersecurity measures in place and are not aware of any security breaches of our systems resulting from those efforts."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Google's threat analysis group continues to see unsuccessful attempts from APT42 to compromise personal accounts of individuals affiliated with President Joe Biden, Vice President Harris and Trump, the report said.</p>

<p>- <strong>Phishing</strong> -<br />
The hacking group works by gleaning information about targets and tailoring "phishing" efforts to dupe victims into revealing log-in information for accounts like Gmail.</p>

<p>Examples given in the report included posing as a think tank or other credible contact to lure victims to fake video meeting landing pages, where log-in credentials are needed to take part.</p>

<p>While technical tools abound in hacker arsenals, some opt for "social engineering" tactics that trick people into clicking on booby-trapped links or logging in to realistic replicas of legitimate web pages.</p>

<p>Google said it disrupted APT42 attempts to hack the campaigns of Biden and Trump in 2020.</p>

<p>In May and June of this year, the Iranian hacker group's targets included personal email accounts of about a dozen people affiliated with Biden or Trump and Google blocked numerous attempts by APT42 to log in to their accounts, according to the report.</p>

<p>Google also reported that the group got into the personal Gmail account of an influencial political consultant.</p>

<p>"APT42 is a sophisticated, persistent threat actor and they show no signs of stopping their attempts to target users and deploy novel tactics," Google said.</p>

<p>"This spring and summer, they have shown the ability to run numerous simultaneous phishing campaigns, particularly focused on Israel and the United States."</p>

<p>Google urged high-risk individuals associated with the coming election to remain vigilant and to take advantage of ramped-up defenses offered by the internet firm.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US State Department warned Iran on Monday of consequences over election interference following the Trump campaign's announcement that it had been hacked.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign has suggested that Iran was behind the breach, which resulted in private documents being sent to reporters, including research the campaign used to vet running mate J.D. Vance.</p>

<p>It warned media outlets against reprinting the documents, saying that such action would be "doing the bidding of America's enemies."</p>

<p>The tone was different from 2016, when Trump said at a news conference that he hoped Russia would "find" Hillary Clinton's emails, remarks widely viewed as encouraging further hacks of his election opponent.</p>

<p>US intelligence concluded that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to support Trump, who has rejected the findings.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 1.4 million girls in Afghanistan have been denied access to secondary education since the Taliban returned to power in 2021, with the future of an entire generation now "in jeopardy", the United Nations' cultural agency said Thursday.</p>

<p>Access to primary education has also fallen sharply, with 1.1 million fewer girls and boys attending school, UNESCO said in a statement as the Taliban authorities marked three years since retaking Afghanistan on August 15, 2021.</p>

<p>"UNESCO is alarmed by the harmful consequences of this increasingly massive drop-out rate, which could lead to a rise in child labour and early marriage," the agency said.</p>

<p>"In just three years, the de facto authorities have almost wiped out two decades of steady progress for education in Afghanistan, and the future of an entire generation is now in jeopardy."</p>

<p>There are now nearly 2.5 million girls deprived of their right to education, representing 80 percent of Afghan school-age girls, the UN agency said.</p>

<p>The Taliban administration, which is not recognised by any other country, has imposed restrictions on women that the UN has described as "gender apartheid."</p>

<p>Afghanistan is the only country in the world to stop girls and women attending secondary schools and universities.</p>

<p>"As a result of bans imposed by the de facto authorities, at least 1.4 million girls have been deliberately denied access to secondary education since 2021," UNESCO said.</p>

<p>This represents an increase of 300,000 since the previous count carried out by the UN agency in April 2023.</p>

<p>UNESCO Director General Audrey Azoulay urged the international community to remain mobilised "to obtain the unconditional reopening of schools and universities to Afghan girls and women."</p>

<p>The number of primary pupils has also fallen. Afghanistan had only 5.7 million girls and boys in primary school in 2022, compared with 6.8 million in 2019, UNESCO said.</p>

<p>The UN agency blamed the drop on the authorities' decision to ban female teachers from teaching boys as well as the lack of incentive for parents to send children to school.</p>

<p>Enrolment in higher education in equally concerning, the statement said, adding that the number of university students had decreased by 53 percent since 2021.</p>

<p>"As a result, the country will rapidly face a shortage of graduates trained for the most highly-skilled jobs, which will only exacerbate development problems," UNESCO said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A U.S. judge on Wednesday said he was planning to issue an order forcing Alphabet's Google to give Android users more ways to download apps, but would not micromanage the tech giant's business, following a jury verdict last year for “Fortnite” maker Epic Games.</p>

<p>U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco heard from technology experts and lawyers for Epic and Google about proposed reforms in the blockbuster antitrust case.</p>

<p>Donato showed impatience for Google's protests about the costs and difficulty of implementing many of Epic's proposals, and signaled he would issue a ruling that would maximize users' and developers' flexibility to download and distribute apps outside the Play store.</p>

<p>“You're going to end up paying something to make the world right after having been found to be a monopolist,” Donato said.</p>

<p>He said his injunction will be about three pages long and will ensure Google knows what the “rules of the road are.”</p>

<p>Donato said he will rule in the coming weeks and set up a three-person compliance and technical committee to implement and monitor the injunction.</p>

<p>“Google foreclosed competition for years and years and years. We're opening the gate now and letting competitors come in,” Donato said.</p>

<p>Google declined to comment, and Epic did not immediately respond to a request for one.</p>

<p>Epic's lawsuit accused Google of monopolizing how consumers access apps on Android devices and how they pay for in-app transactions.</p>

<p>The Cary, North Carolina-based company persuaded a jury in December 2023 that Google unlawfully stifled competition through its controls over app distribution and payments.</p>

<p>Epic has asked Donato to require Google to make it easier for Android users to download apps from third-party app stores, such as Epic's, and from other internet sources. It also wants the court to forbid Google from automatically installing its Play store on Android devices.</p>

<p>Google has denied harming competition, and it told Donato that Epic's proposals "would make it nearly impossible" for the Alphabet unit to compete and harm consumer privacy and security.</p>

<p>Google lawyer Glenn Pomerantz told Donato on Wednesday that Google should not be forced to distribute its rivals' app stores. "Competition will be worse if you impose a duty that you have to deal with your competitor," Pomerantz said.</p>

<p>Epic's lawyer Gary Bornstein urged the court to direct Google to act quickly to implement his injunction.</p>

<p>Google faces another threat to its business practices in a separate government lawsuit in Washington, D.C. challenging the company's dominant search engine.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The University of California in Los Angeles cannot allow pro-Palestinian protesters to block Jewish students from accessing campus buildings, classes and services, a federal judge has ruled.</p>

<p>US District Judge Mark Scarsi's order appears to be the first ruling against a US university connected with the demonstrations protesting the Israel-Gaza conflict that erupted at hundreds of college campuses earlier this year.</p>

<p>The decision to issue a preliminary injunction against the prestigious university, issued on Tuesday, came as part of a lawsuit filed in June by three Jewish students, who said pro-Palestinian protesters blocked them from campus based on their faith.</p>

<p>"In the year 2024, in the United States of America, in the State of California, in the City of Los Angeles, Jewish students were excluded from portions of the UCLA campus because they refused to denounce their faith," Scarsi wrote, calling it "unimaginable" and "abhorrent."</p>

<p>He barred the school from offering any programs, activities or access to campus buildings if it knows any of them are not available to Jewish students.</p>

<p>In court papers, the school had argued it could not be held legally responsible for alleged discrimination perpetrated by third parties. The university also said it worked with law enforcement to dismantle encampments and had taken steps to improve its response to protests in the future, including creating a new campus safety office and blocking at least three new efforts to occupy parts of campus.</p>

<p>The school's vice chancellor for strategic communications, Mary Osako, said in a statement that UCLA was considering "all our options" in response to the ruling.</p>

<p>"UCLA is committed to fostering a campus culture where everyone feels welcome and free from intimidation, discrimination, and harassment," she said. "The district court's ruling would improperly hamstring our ability to respond to events on the ground and to meet the needs of the Bruin community."</p>

<p>One of the students who brought the lawsuit, law student Yitzchok Frankel, said in a statement, "No student should ever have to fear being blocked from their campus because they are Jewish."</p>

<p>UCLA was thrust into the national spotlight when masked assailants attacked a pro-Palestinian encampment on April 30 with clubs and poles, sparking a fight that saw both sides exchanging blows and pepper spray.</p>

<p>The next night, police forcibly dismantled the encampment and arrested more than 200 people.</p>

<p>Activists criticized police for responding too slowly to the attack and then for moving too aggressively to take down the tent camp a day later. The chief of the campus police department was reassigned pending an outside review.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States Department of State strongly rejected the allegations of the government's involvement in former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation, terming them 'laughable' and 'absolutely false' claims.</p>

<p>"That's laughable. Any implication that the United States was involved in Sheikh Hasina's resignation is absolutely false," Principal Deputy Spokesperson of the US Department of State, Vedant Patel, said in a press briefing on Tuesday (local time).</p>

<p>Patel further said that a lot of disinformation has been seen in recent weeks regarding the current happenings in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>"We have seen a lot of disinformation in recent weeks and we were made incredibly committed to strengthening information and integrity across the regional ecosystem, especially our partners in South Asia," he said.</p>

<p>Recently, in an interview with ANI, Michael Kugelman, a US-based Foreign Policy expert, and Director of the South Asia Institute at The Wilson Center, refuted allegations of foreign interference behind the mass uprising that led to Sheikh Hasina's ouster, stating he had not seen any 'plausible evidence' to support these claims.</p>

<p>He noted that the Hasina government's harsh crackdown on protesters escalated the movement. "My view has been very simple. I see this as a crisis that was driven by purely internal factors, by students who were unhappy about a particular issue, job quotas that they didn't like and they were worried about the government. Sheikh Hasina's government cracked down very hard on the students and that then turned the movement into something much bigger. And this was simply driven by internal factors," Kugelman said.</p>

<p>Kugelman dismissed allegations from Sheikh Hasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, who claimed foreign interference behind the protests, saying that the unrest was driven by "internal factors."</p>

<p>"Now, you know, when there is a conspiracy theory that is rooted in issues of foreign influence, one cannot disprove such type of allegation. Also, at the same time, one cannot conclusively prove it. I think the onus, is the responsibility to provide a plausible explanation for how it can be true. I am yet to hear that from Sheikh Hasina's son, from anyone," he added.</p>

<p>Bangladesh has been witnessing a fluid political situation ever since protests started across the country, leading to Sheikh Hasina's resignation from the post of Prime Minister on August 5. The protests, led mainly by students demanding an end to a quota system for government jobs, evolved into anti-government demonstrations.</p>

<p>A large number of people protested outside the White House in Washington on Friday last week against alleged violence targeting minority Hindus and others in Bangladesh since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster.</p>

<p>Protesters carried American and Bangladeshi flags and held posters demanding that Bangladeshi minorities be "saved." They chanted slogans of "We want justice" and called for peace amid the recent surge in violence.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Health Organization on Wednesday declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years, following an outbreak of the viral infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has spread to neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>Mpox can spread through close contact. Usually mild, it is fatal in rare cases. It causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions on the body.</p>

<p>Determining a disease outbreak as a "public health emergency of international concern" or PHEIC - the WHO's highest level of alert - can accelerate research, funding and international public health measures and co-operation to contain a disease.</p>

<p>The outbreak in Congo began with the spread of an endemic strain, known as clade I. But a new variant, clade Ib, appears to spread more easily through routine close contact, including sexual contact. It has spread from Congo to neighbouring countries, including Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, triggering the action from the WHO.</p>

<p>"It's clear that a coordinated international response is essential to stop these outbreaks and save lives," said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Africa's top public health body declared an mpox emergency for the continent after warning that the viral infection was spreading at an alarming rate.</p>

<p>More than 17,000 suspected mpox cases and 517 deaths have been reported on the African continent so far this year, a 160% increase in cases compared to the same period last year, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said. A total of 13 countries have reported cases.</p>

<p>A different form of the mpox virus - clade IIb - spread globally in 2022, largely through sexual contact among men who have sex with men. This prompted the WHO to declare a public health emergency then, which it ended 10 months later.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump failed for a third time on Wednesday to force out the judge who is due to sentence him for covering up hush money payments.</p>

<p>Lawyers for the Republican presidential nominee had again argued that the work of judge Juan Merchan's daughter for a Democrat-leaning organization created a "perceived conflict of interest" and that he should recuse himself.</p>

<p>A jury convicted the former president of 34 felonies in May for covering up payments to silence former adult star Stormy Daniels over an alleged affair.</p>

<p>On September 16, the judge will consider a separate request by Trump's lawyers to overturn the verdict and dismiss the case following a Supreme Court ruling in July on presidential immunity.</p>

<p>Depending on the outcome of that hearing, Merchan has scheduled Trump's sentencing for September 18.</p>

<p>Merchan forcefully rejected Trump's latest bid to have him removed.</p>

<p>"Stated plainly, Defendant's arguments are nothing more than a repetition of stale and unsubstantiated claims," Merchan wrote in the ruling.</p>

<p>"Defense Counsel's reliance, and apparent citation to his own prior affirmation, rife with inaccuracies and unsubstantiated claims, is unavailing. As such, Defendant's motion is again DENIED."</p>

<p>A New York State ethics panel previously found no issue in Merchan continuing to handle the case, and the judge said the "Court will continue to base its rulings on the evidence and the law, without fear or favour, casting aside undue influence."</p>

<p>Despite the ethics ruling, Trump's legal team insisted that work undertaken by Merchan's daughter, which they said included past fundraising efforts for Trump's rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, undermined the judge's independence.</p>

<p>In a tirade on his Truth Social platform, Trump called an order by Merchan limiting his ability to attack the judge's family members "suppression and manipulation of the vote."</p>

<p>Trump, the first former US president convicted of a crime, has been doing everything in his power to delay multiple trials against him until after the November election.</p>

<p>He faces charges in Washington and Georgia related to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's spy chiefs will attend talks in Doha on Thursday seeking a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal after more than 10 months of war, the prime minister's office said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has approved the departure of the Israeli delegation to Doha tomorrow, as well as the mandate for conducting the negotiations," a statement said.</p>

<p>The head of Israel's Mossad spy agency, David Barnea, and Shin Bet security service chief Ronen Bar are part of the team, Netanyahu's spokesman Omer Dostri told AFP.</p>

<p>"The head of the Mossad, the head of the Shin Bet, Nitzan Alon and Ophir Falk" make up the team, Dostri said. Alon coordinates issues related to hostages, and Falk is a political adviser to Netanyahu.</p>

<p>Palestinian militant group Hamas has not said whether it would send negotiators to Doha.</p>

<p>A Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP that "negotiations with the mediators are continuing and have even intensified in recent hours".</p>

<p>"Hamas wants the Biden plan imposed and doesn't want to negotiate just to negotiate," the official said, referring a ceasefire proposal laid out in late May by US President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>"We have to force the (Israeli) occupation government to stop its policy, which consists of dragging out the negotiations, and force it to stop massacring our people."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The socio-political unrest in Bangladesh has impacted the medical tourism inflow from the neighbouring country and if the turbulence persists the total footfall from the country may drop by 10-15 per cent this year, a report has said.</p>

<p>Bangladesh is the leading contributor to medical tourism among neighbouring countries and accounts for 50-60 per cent of India's total medical tourism inflow, says the report released on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Current internal challenges in Bangladesh have impacted the flow of patients as a considerable number of these travellers have either cancelled or postponed their visits, according to a report by knowledge-based analytical group CareEdge Ratings.</p>

<p>According to CareEdge Ratings, if the unrest persists, the footfall is likely to decline by 10-15 per cent from Bangladesh during 2024.</p>

<p>The contribution of medical tourism to the entire Indian hospital sector is about 3 per cent to 5 per cent.</p>

<p>Considering the drop in footfall from Bangladesh along with its gradual revival to normalcy by the end of 2024, the sector will see minimal impact, according to the report.</p>

<p>"The effect on individual hospitals will vary depending on their reliance on Bangladeshi medical tourists. Hospitals with a high dependency on these tourists may experience revenue declines in the second and third quarter of FY25, while larger, multi-location hospitals in India are likely to see a relatively minor impact.</p>

<p>"Most Indian industry players appear to be largely unaffected by the crisis, supported by their strong financial resilience and robust cash accruals," CareEdge Ratings Associate Director D Naveen Kumar added.</p>

<p>In recent years, medical tourism in India has been on a gradual upward trend, driven by the relatively low cost of surgery, high-quality critical care, hospitals with advanced technology, and the expanding e-medical visa facility.</p>

<p>Although 2021, saw some growth in medical tourism following the significant impact of the Covid-19 pandemic the previous year, it remained subdued due to the ongoing travel restrictions in parts of that year.</p>

<p>However, 2022 marked a significant comeback, with medical tourism nearly returning to pre-Covid levels, and the trend continued in 2023, showing a 33 per cent year-on-year growth.</p>

<p>The government's initiative to extend the e-medical visa facility to nationals from 167 countries is expected to further boost medical tourism in the coming years, said the report.</p>

<p>This particularly benefits the hospitals in metro cities the most as they are prime beneficiaries of international patient flow, said the report adding that nearly 70-80 per cent of medical tourists arriving in India are from Bangladesh and Middle East countries.</p>

<p>India ranks among the top 10 countries for medical tourism globally and is especially preferred amongst South-Asian, African and Middle East countries.</p>

<p>Bangladesh stands out as the leading contributor to medical tourism among neighbouring countries, surpassing the Middle East, Myanmar, Maldives, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan.</p>

<p>However, recent socio-political instability in Bangladesh poses a risk to this flourishing segment of the industry as the current internal challenges have shown signs of affecting the flow of patients.</p>

<p>The hospital sector in India was valued at around Rs 5.8 lakh crore in FY23, with an anticipated annual growth rate of 12 per cent over the next three years. Each year, an estimated 3 to 3.5 lakh individuals from Bangladesh seek medical treatment in India.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The video was originally shared by Mike Lee, US Senator for Utah.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The video has garnered over 6,50,7000 views and has more than 3,500 re-tweets. While some users loved the video, some pointed out the drawbacks of AI in the comment section.</p>

<p>The video comes days after Trump and Musk discussed the 2024 US presidential elections, his Democratic counterpart Kamala Harris, and climate change on the billionaire's platform X. The much-anticipated discussion was, however, marred by technical issues.</p>

<p>The live stream, delayed by more than 40 minutes due to a DDOS attack and technical issues, drew in over 1.3 million users.</p>

<p>Musk repeated his endorsement of Trump, who faces a resurgent new Democratic candidate, Vice-President Kamala Harris, in November's election.</p>

<p>The former President talked about his past policies on Iran, claiming his administration's measures effectively curtailed Tehran's ability to fund terrorism.</p>

<p>Donald Trump also announced plans to build an Iron Dome defence system, citing Israel's successful implementation of the technology.</p>

<p>Donald Trump was banned from Twitter (now X) after his supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. On February 21, 2022, he launched his own social media platform, Truth Social.</p>

<p>Months later, in November 2022, Elon Musk acquired Twitter and restored Trump's account, @realDonaldTrump.</p>

<p>Last month, the Tesla CEO also endorsed Trump shortly after the former president survived the attempt on his life.</p>

<p>The relationship between the two has shifted over the years and they have traded online barbs in the past.&nbsp;<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mohammed Abu Al-Qumsan had just picked up birth certificates for his newly-born twins when he found out they had been killed, along with his wife and her mother, by an Israeli strike on the Gaza apartment where they were sheltering.</p>

<p>He waved the laminated documents, supposed to signify rare joy in the besieged Palestinian enclave, as a man held him while he wept at the morgue where their bodies were brought.</p>

<p>"My wife is gone, my two babies and my mother-in-law. I was told it's a tank shell on the apartment they were in, in a house we were displaced to," said Abu Al-Qumsan, 31, recalling the devastating phone call from people in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>He and others carried his boy and girl, Asser and Ayssel, who were wrapped in white shrouds - a common sight in Gaza, where Israel's land and air campaign has put hundreds of thousands of people regularly on the move in search of shelter.</p>

<p>A man prayed as the bodies were placed in the back of a car and a crowd gathered and people looked on from the balcony of one of Gaza's overwhelmed emergency rooms, at the Al-Aqsa Maryrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah in the centre of the coastal strip.</p>

<p>Ten months after the Gaza war erupted, air strikes, artillery shells and severe shortages of medicine, food and clean water have brought one of the world's most densely populated places to its knees.</p>

<p>"Today, it was registered in history that the occupation army targets newborn children who are barely four days old, twins along with their mother and grandmother," hospital doctor Khalil al-Daqran said.</p>

<p>Israel says it goes to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties and accuses arch-foe Hamas of using human shields, charges the militants deny.</p>

<p>The Palestinian Iranian-backed militant group started the conflict in an Oct. 7 cross-border raid on Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking over 250 hostage, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel struck back with an offensive that has killed nearly 40,000 people and wounded more than 92,000, according to Gaza health authorities, and reduced much of the enclave to rubble</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vaccines to help curb an escalating mpox outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo and neighbouring countries may still not reach the central African country for months even as the World Health Organization considers following Africa's top public health agency in declaring the outbreak an emergency.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention declared a public health emergency of continental concern for the first time ever, and on Wednesday, a WHO-led panel meets to decide if it represents a global threat.</p>

<p>But while experts hoped the meetings would galvanise action worldwide, many obstacles remain, including limited vaccine supply, funding and competing disease outbreaks.</p>

<p>"It is important to declare an emergency because the disease is spreading," said Jean-Jacques Muyembe-Tamfum, head of Congo's Institut National pour la Recherche Biomedicale (INRB). He said he hoped any declaration would help provide more funding for surveillance as well as supporting access to vaccines in Congo.</p>

<p>But he acknowledged the road ahead was not easy in a huge country where health facilities and humanitarian funds are already stretched by conflict and outbreaks of diseases like measles and cholera.</p>

<p>"If the big declarations remain just words, it won't make any material difference," said Emmanuel Nakoune, an mpox expert at the Institut Pasteur de Bangui in Central African Republic.</p>

<p>Africa CDC said last week it had been granted $10.4 million in emergency funding from the Africa Union for its mpox response, and its director general Jean Kaseya said on Tuesday there was a clear plan to secure 3 million doses of vaccine this year, without elaborating further.</p>

<p>However, sources involved in planning a vaccination roll-out in Congo said only 65,000 doses were likely to be available in the short-term, and campaigns were unlikely to begin before October at the earliest.</p>

<p>There have been more than 15,000 suspected cases of mpox in Africa this year and 461 deaths, mainly among children in Congo, according to Africa CDC. The viral infection is usually mild but can kill, and causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions.</p>

<p>A new offshoot of the virus has caused outbreaks in refugee camps in the east of Congo this year, and spread to Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda and Kenya for the first time.</p>

<p>Ivory Coast and South Africa are also experiencing outbreaks linked to a different strain of the virus, which spread globally in 2022, largely among men who have sex with men. This outbreak prompted WHO to declare a global emergency before ending it 10 months later.</p>

<p>Then, two vaccines were used - Bavarian Nordic's Jynneos, and LC16, made by KM Biologics. Outside clinical trials, neither has ever been available in Congo or across Africa, where the disease has been endemic for decades. Only LC16 is approved for use in children.</p>

<p>Congo's regulators approved the use of the vaccines domestically in June, but the government is yet to officially request any from either the manufacturers or governments like the United States looking to make donations through the global vaccine group, Gavi.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaza ceasefire talks will be held in the Qatari capital today, two sources close to the negotiations said, while it remains unclear if Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas will participate.</p>

<p>Qatar has been engaged in behind-the-scenes efforts, with support from Egypt and the United States, to reach a deal for a Gaza truce and hostage-prisoner exchange after more than 10 months of war.</p>

<p>A source close to Hamas and a second source close to the talks confirmed today's meeting in Doha.</p>

<p>CIA director William Burns was also scheduled to travel to Doha for talks, according to a US source familiar with the meeting.</p>

<p>The US State Department has said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had confirmed Israel's participation.</p>

<p>"Our Qatari partners have assured us that they are working to ensure that there is Hamas representation as well," State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters.</p>

<p>The Israelis should "come to agree on a (deal) or not come at all", said a source close to Hamas, without specifying if the Palestinian movement will take part in the talks.</p>

<p>Qatar, Egypt and the United States last week called for the resumption of talks "to close all remaining gaps and commence implementation of the deal without further delay".</p>

<p>A letter signed by Qatar's emir and the presidents of the United States and Egypt said a framework agreement was "now on the table, with only the details of implementation" left to conclude.</p>

<p>A prospective cessation of hostilities has centred around a phased deal beginning with an initial truce.</p>

<p>Recent discussions have focused on a framework outlined by US President Joe Biden on May 31 which he said had been proposed by Israel.</p>

<p>Ahead of the ceasefire talks, a Hamas official said the Islamist movement was "continuing its consultations with the mediators".</p>

<p>"Hamas really wants an end to the war and a ceasefire agreement on the basis of the (Biden) plan," another Hamas official said.</p>

<p>Netanyahu's office on Tuesday detailed its conditions for a truce, including "a veto on certain prisoners" being released from its jails.</p>

<p>So far, there has been only one, week-long truce in the Gaza fighting, in November, when dozens of hostages in Gaza were released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.</p>

<p>The talks come after Iran and its allies blamed Israel for the July 31 killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran during a visit for the inauguration of President Masoud Pezeshkian.</p>

<p>Hamas named Yahya Sinwar -- the alleged mastermind of the October 7 attack on Israel that sparked the war -- as its new leader, raising concerns the tortuous negotiations have become even more difficult.</p>

<p>US officials have said on several occasions in recent weeks that a deal is close, while urging both Israel and Hamas to accept the current proposal which would lead to an initial six-week truce.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French 400-meter runner Muhammad Abdallah Kounta, who took part in the Paris Olympics, has been suspended by the French Athletics Federation after an X account dug up hate speech posted by the athlete, the sports minister said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"The Federation's president confirmed he has suspended the athlete and referred the matter both to the public prosecutor and to the Federation's disciplinary committee," Amelie Oudea-Castera said on X.</p>

<p>X account Sword of Solomon on Tuesday highlighted some tweets posted by Kounta between 2021 and 2024 in which, among other things, he professes hatred for Israel.</p>

<p>After the revelations, the athlete posted a picture of himself wrapped in a French flag on his social media accounts, saying he was sorry if he had offended people.</p>

<p>"I'm against genocides and all forms of racism or injustice and I don't think I need to prove how much I love my country. People who were there in the Stade de France (where the athletic events took place) can attest that fact," Kounta said.</p>

<p>The Paris Olympics have been widely considered a dazzling summertime success that reaffirmed French national pride.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>M&amp;M's and Snickers maker Mars said Wednesday that it would acquire snack food business Kellanova, marking a multibillion dollar agreement set to result in a new industry giant.</p>

<p>The all-cash transaction would value Kellanova -- which is behind snacks such as Pringles and Pop-Tarts -- at $35.9 billion, including debt.</p>

<p>"In welcoming Kellanova's portfolio of growing global brands, we have a substantial opportunity for Mars to further develop a sustainable snacking business that is fit for the future," said Mars chief executive Poul Weihrauch in a statement.</p>

<p>The announcement comes at a time when consumers feel the squeeze from rising costs of living, putting pressure on companies to rein in their price hikes.</p>

<p>The move could, however, attract scrutiny from US regulators who have taken a tough stance on consolidations.</p>

<p>The acquisition for $83.50 per share in cash "accelerates ambition to double Mars Snacking in the next decade, in alignment with global consumer demand trends," Mars said.</p>

<p>This would bring two new billion-dollar brands, Pringles and Cheez-It, into its business.</p>

<p>Already, the company said it has 15 billion-dollar brands.</p>

<p>"Snacking is a large, attractive and durable category that continues to grow in importance with consumers," Mars added.</p>

<p>Kellanova had net sales in 2023 of around $13 billion, and it is present in 180 markets with some 23,000 employees.</p>

<p>Shares of Kellanova were up by 7.3 percent in US pre-market trading.</p>

<p>The Mars statement added that most of Kellanova's snack brands outperform competitors, especially among Gen Z and millennial buyers.</p>

<p>The combined portfolio would also be suited to meet demand in fast-growing markets such as Africa and Latin America, given their supply chains and local operations, the company said.</p>

<p>The plan, according to Mars, is to grow Kellanova's brands further.</p>

<p>The deal, which is anticipated to close in the first half of 2025, will need the green light from Kellanova shareholders and also require regulatory approvals.</p>

<p>Mars plans to fully finance the acquisition via a combination of cash-on-hand and new debt, it said, adding that commitments have been secured.</p>

<p>Family-owned business Mars said it employs about 150,000 workers and has over $50 billion in annual sales.</p>

<p>Besides snacking and food products, the company is also involved in the pet care sector.</p>

<p>In 2022, Mars said it reached a deal to buy whole-fruit snacking brand Tru Fru. And two years before that, it announced its acquisition of Kind North America -- which specializes in healthier snacks.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

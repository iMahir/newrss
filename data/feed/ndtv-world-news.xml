       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four Indians were charred to death in a massive car crash in Texas, US, on Friday. The victims, who were carpooling to Arkansas, were identified as Aryan Raghunath Orampati, Farooq Shaik, Lokesh Palacharla and Dharshini Vasudevan.</p>

<p>A speeding truck rear-ended the SUV they were travelling in, causing it to explode and burst into flames. The authorities are relying on DNA testing to confirm their identities.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Aryan Raghunath Orampati</strong></h3>

<p>Aryan Raghunath Orampati, a resident of Hyderabad, loved music, travelling, and sports, and had an "unbending fascination" for Finance. He had a degree in Electrical, Electronics, and Communications Engineering from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Tamil Nadu and a Master's in Finance from the University of Texas at Dallas. His father Subhash Chandra Reddy owns a Hyderabad-based firm named Max Agri Genetics Private Limited.</p>

<p>Mr Orampati worked as an Accounting Intern at Max Agri-Genetics Pvt Ltd. in India before he earned a full-time position at the company for over a year. He was returning from visiting his cousin in Dallas when the tragedy struck.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Farooq Shaik</strong></h3>

<p>Farooq Shaik, also a Hyderabad resident, was travelling to Bentonville to meet his friend when he met with the fatal car accident. He had gone to the US three years ago to pursue his MS degree, which he completed recently, revealed his father. His father, Masthan Vali is a retired private employee.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Lokesh Palacharla</strong></h3>

<p>Lokesh Palacharla, from Andhra Pradesh, was a banker in the Bank of America in Allen, Texas. He was travelling to Bentonville to meet his wife.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Palacharla held a Master's degree in Informatics from Northeastern University. He worked at Tech Mahindra in Hyderabad. Before that, he worked at BrainVita Pvt Ltd in Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh.</p>

<h3><strong>Dharshini Vasudevan</strong></h3>

<p>Dharshini Vasudevan completed her Master's degree from the University of Texas and was working in the US. She was on her way to visit her uncle in Bentonville, Arkansas, when the car she was travelling in got rear-ended. Ms Vasudevan's father sought help locating her through an X post, tagging External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, after she became unreachable following the accident.</p>

<p>In his emotional post, he shared details about his daughter's stay in the US, mentioning her Indian passport number, address in Frisco, Texas, and her activities on the day of the accident. He explained that Ms Vasudevan had taken a carpool ride with three others around 3 pm and was actively messaging until 4 pm, after which all contact was lost with her.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The DOJ, which had previously delivered questionnaires to companies, is now sending legally binding requests that oblige recipients to provide information]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Justice Department sent subpoenas to Nvidia Corp. and other companies as it seeks evidence that the chipmaker violated antitrust laws, an escalation of its investigation into the dominant provider of AI processors.</p>

<p>The DOJ, which had previously delivered questionnaires to companies, is now sending legally binding requests that oblige recipients to provide information, according to people familiar with the investigation. That takes the government a step closer to launching a formal complaint.</p>

<p>Antitrust officials are concerned that Nvidia is making it harder to switch to other suppliers and penalizes buyers that don't exclusively use its artificial intelligence chips, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.</p>

<p>Nvidia shares, which suffered a record-setting $279 billion rout on Tuesday, fell further in late trading after Bloomberg reported on the subpoenas. Still, the stock has more than doubled this year - fueled by explosive sales growth at the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker.</p>

<p>As part of the probe, which Bloomberg previously reported in June, investigators have been contacting other technology companies to gather information. The DOJ's San Francisco office is taking the lead running the inquiry, the people said. A representative for the DOJ declined to comment.</p>

<p>In response to questions about the probe, Nvidia said that its market dominance stems from the quality of its products, which deliver faster performance.</p>

<p>"Nvidia wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, who can choose whatever solution is best for them," the company said in an emailed statement.</p>

<p>Nvidia has drawn regulatory scrutiny since becoming the world's most valuable chipmaker and a key beneficiary of the AI spending boom. Sales have been more than doubling each quarter, and it's eclipsed onetime chip leaders such as Intel Corp.</p>

<p>In the DOJ probe, regulators have been investigating Nvidia's acquisition of RunAI, a deal announced in April. That company makes software for managing AI computing, and there are concerns that the tie-up will make it more difficult for customers to switch away from Nvidia chips. Regulators also are inquiring whether Nvidia gives preferential supply and pricing to customers who use its technology exclusively or buy its complete systems, according to the people.</p>

<p>Nvidia, founded in 1993, made its name by selling graphics cards to computer gamers. But its approach to chipmaking ultimately proved useful for building AI models, a process that involves bombarding the software with data. The company also has rapidly expanded its lineup with a range of software, servers, networking and services - all aimed, Nvidia argues, at speeding up the deployment of AI.</p>

<p>Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said he prioritizes customers who can make use of his products in ready-to-go data centers as soon as he provides them, a policy designed to prevent stockpiling and speed up the broader adoption of AI.</p>

<p>The success of its products - along with struggles by rivals to field alternative chips - has made Nvidia a crucial part of the supply chain for some of the biggest companies in the world. Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc., for example, spend more than 40% of their budget for hardware on the chipmaker's gear. During the peak of shortages of Nvidia's H100 accelerator, individual components were retailing for as much as $90,000 each.</p>

<p>Analysts project that Nvidia will chalk up $120.8 billion of revenue in calendar 2024, up from $16 billion in 2020, with most of that money coming from its data center unit. In fact, Nvidia is set to bring in more profit this year than the total sales of its nearest rival, Advanced Micro Devices Inc.</p>

<p>There also are broader regulatory questions about Nvidia's practices. Access to AI capabilities has become a key focus for governments around the world, with the technology becoming increasingly vital to economic strength and national security.</p>

<p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is expected to visit India in October for Nvidia AI Summit at the Jio World Convention Centre in Mumbai.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Sultan Of Brunei's car collection boasts more than 7,000 vehicles and is worth an estimated $5 billion.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi is currently on a diplomatic visit to Brunei and Singapore, aiming to strengthen India's relationships with the Southeast Asian countries. His first stop was Brunei, where he held a meeting with the country's monarch, Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah, at his lavish palace.</p>

<p>The Sultan of Brunei, the second-longest reigning monarch in history, is known for his extravagant lifestyle. One of his most notable possessions is the world's largest private car collection. Valued at $5 billion, his collection features over 7,000 luxury cars, reported Fox News.</p>

<p>The collection was put together with the help of Hassanal's brother, Jefri Bolkiah (also known as Prince Jefri), and other members of the royal family. Since it's impossible to talk about every car he owns, we'll focus on a select few luxury vehicles.</p>

<h3><strong>The Bentleys</strong></h3>

<p>Sultan's car collection includes approximately $80 million worth of classic Bentleys from the 1980s and 1990s, mostly Azure and Continental models. The Bentley Dominator SUV is among the most unique among the selection. Other Bentley cars in the collection include the Continental R Superfast, the Buccaneer GT coupe, and the Java, which has a twin-turbo V8 engine.</p>

<h3><strong>The Ferraris</strong></h3>

<p>There's no shortage of Italian exotica in the largest vehicle collection in the world. He owns a rare Ferrari F50, two 250 GTOs, an F40, several Ferrari 456s, a Ferrari FX and a Testarossa F90 Speciale.</p>

<h3><strong>The Porsches</strong></h3>

<p>The Sultan's collection also includes 55 Porsche 928s, 32 of which are S4 variants. This demonstrates how Porsche has successfully branched out from its classic 911 model. The monarch also got a Porsche 959s, a Daur 962 Le Mans and a Carrera GT as well.</p>

<h3><strong>The Rolls-Royces</strong></h3>

<p>In 2011, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah broke the record for having the world's largest private Rolls-Royce collection. Though the precise number is unknown, estimations indicate that there are more than 600 distinct models.</p>

<h3><strong>The Aston Martins</strong></h3>

<p>The Sultan is no stranger to ordering custom Aston Martin vehicles. The unique AM3, a one-of-a-kind grand tourer inspired by the Vantage and created in association with Pininfarina, is one noteworthy example.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Sultan's opulent collection features several McLaren, Bugatti, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Brabus, Jaguar and a Koenigsegg CCXR.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US lenders to Byju's were removed from an influential creditors committee by a court-appointed arbitrator in India, a potential boon for the struggling online-education company seeking to avert bankruptcy.</p>

<p>The decision by the official, who is overseeing an insolvency case against Byju's, means that the lenders won't get a say on who should run the startup and steer a restructuring plan.</p>

<p>The removal is a setback for the lenders, represented by investment firm Glas Trust, and their effort to collect more than $1.2 billion from the troubled startup. Glas Trust has been the most vocal opponent of a settlement agreement Byju's struck with an Indian creditor - the country's cricket governing body - to escape insolvency. The investment firm has filed a petition to void the agreement with the cricket body, arguing that it deserves to be paid first - the arbitrator's decision means technically that the court may allow the settlement to proceed.</p>

<p>The lenders said they didn't get a chance to vote on who should run Byju's while a plan to repay creditors is put together. The lenders accused the official - Byju's Interim Resolution Professional Pankaj Srivastava - of "secretly plotting to reject" their claims and of manipulating the creditor's vote by excluding them.</p>

<p>Before the US lenders even learned that they had been removed, Srivastava held a meeting of the creditors committee and was selected as a "permanent resolution professional," the lenders alleged in an emailed statement. Srivastava didn't respond to an email sent after business hours in India.</p>

<p>"Pankaj Srivastava's actions are unprecedented and entirely illegitimate as no interim resolution professional in the history of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code of India has ever attempted to unlawfully strip financial creditors of claims of this magnitude," the lenders said.</p>

<p>Lenders have been trying to force Byju's into an insolvency proceeding in a court in India for months but with limited success. One part of that court fight is now before India's Supreme Court.</p>

<p>In the US, the lenders have been trying to track down $533 million that Byju's founder, Byju Raveendran, allegedly said was so well hidden, that no one would ever find it, according to court documents.</p>

<p>Byju's faces a fraudulent transfer lawsuit in a US bankruptcy court. That case involves Byju's Alpha, a shell company created by Byju's in order to tap US capital markets. After Byju's defaulted, lenders seized control of the shell company, put it under court protection and sued to get $533 million they claim should go to them.</p>

<p>In India, Byju's had a deal to end the main insolvency case against it, filed by the cricket governing body. The lenders have asked the Supreme Court of India to block that deal, arguing money that should go to them was wrongly being used to pay off the cricket board instead. The court hasn't yet ruled on that appeal.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A year after the man who designed the Nigerian flag died at 87, his family has decided to bury his body. The family had been waiting for the government to fulfill its promise to arranging a state burial for him, but the promise never materialised.</p>

<p>Pa Taiwo Michael Akinkunmi, who died on August 29, 2023, designed the green and white flag while studying in London in the late 1950s. In his design, he evoked Nigeria's agricultural wealth and the peace and unity among its diverse ethnic groups.</p>

<p>The design won a national competition and the new flag unveiled on Nigeria's Independence Day on October 1. Despite his significant contribution, very few people knew about his work and Mr Akinkunmi lived a relatively quiet life, working for the Ministry of Agriculture.</p>

<p>Recognition came later in life, when he was given the Officer of the Order of the Federal Republic (OFR) award in 2014, one of the highest civilian awards in Nigeria.</p>

<p>After his death, a motion was proposed to give him a state burial, but no plans were made, leaving his family to pay for his body to be kept in a mortuary for over a year.</p>

<p>Despite public outcry and a directive from the Ministry of Art, Culture, and the Creative Economy for the National Institute for Cultural Orientation (NICO) to ensure he received a state funeral, there was little follow-through.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately, the Oyo state government stepped in to support the family to give him a befitting burial in early September, just after the one-year anniversary of his passing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In July, severe rainfall triggered landslides and flooding in North Korea, affecting over 4,000 homes and leaving 15,000 residents displaced.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several South Korean media reports suggest that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered the execution of up to 30 officials, allegedly due to their failure to prevent devastating flooding and landslides.&nbsp;The disasters reportedly resulted in approximately 1,000 deaths. According to a report by South Korea's <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://news.tvchosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2024/09/03/2024090390229.html" rel="nofollow, noindex">Chosun TV</a></em>, citing a North Korean official, Kim Jong Un called for ''strict punishment'' to be meted out to those deemed responsible for the ''unacceptable loss'' of life caused by the recent flooding.&nbsp;Officials were also charged with corruption and dereliction of duty.&nbsp;The executions reportedly took place late last month.</p>

<p>''It has been determined that 20 to 30 cadres in the flood-stricken area were executed at the same time late last month,'' the official was quoted as saying.</p>

<p>Although the identities of the executed officials remain undisclosed, the North Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported that Kang Bong-hoon, the secretary of the Chagang Province Provincial Party Committee since 2019, was among the leaders removed from their positions by Kim Jong-un.</p>

<p>In July, severe rainfall triggered landslides and flooding in North Korea, affecting over 4,000 homes and leaving 15,000 residents displaced. Kim Jong Un himself visited the affected areas and stated that it would take several months to rebuild and restore the neighbourhoods that were completely inundated by the floods. The government also provided shelter in Pyongyang facilities for 15,400 people, including vulnerable groups such as mothers, children, the elderly, and disabled soldiers.</p>

<p>However, the North Korean leader denied reports of a high death toll from the flooding, dismissing the claims as "false rumours." He accused South Korea of spreading these rumours as part of a deliberate "smear campaign" designed to damage North Korea's international reputation.</p>

<p>Lee Il-gyu, a former North Korean diplomat at the International Korean Peninsula Forum remarked, "Even though there was recent flood damage, they were dismissed for social security reasons, and the executives themselves are so anxious that they don't know when their necks will fall off."</p>

<p>According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2024/09/103_361356.html" rel="nofollow, noindex">Korea Times</a></em>, North Korea's public executions have surged dramatically since the COVID-19 pandemic. Before the pandemic, the country typically saw around 10 public executions per year. However, that number has skyrocketed to approximately 100 annual public executions, representing a tenfold increase.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Turkish authorities have arrested Liridon Rexhepi, the head of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency's financial network in Turkey, according to a report by state media.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkish authorities have arrested Liridon Rexhepi, the head of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency's financial network in Turkey, according to a report by state media.</p>

<p>On August 30, Istanbul police detained Rexhepi in connection with the allegations of transferring money on behalf of Mossad during an operation, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Rexhepi was formally arrested after a court hearing, during which he admitted to the charges, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported.</p>

<p>The Turkish intelligence agency, MIT, had been monitoring Rexhepi since his entry into the country on August 25.</p>

<p>MIT's investigation revealed that Rexhepi managed financial operations for Mossad and transferred significant amounts of money repeatedly via Western Union to field agents in Turkey.</p>

<p>Rexhepi was also found to have conducted drone surveillance and psychological operations targeting Palestinian politicians.</p>

<p>MIT discovered that Mossad was transferring funds to its field agents in Turkey, primarily from Kosovo and other Eastern European countries, according to Anadolu.</p>

<p>The financial tracking revealed that the funds from Kosovo were being transferred by Mossad's field agents in Turkey to sources in Syria via Western Union and cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Since January, Turkish authorities have detained dozens of people, among them private investigators, on charges of collecting data on individuals, for Israeli intelligence.</p>

<p>Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, sparked by the terror group's slaughter of 1,200 people and kidnapping of 251 in southern Israel on October 7, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been one of the strongest critics of the Jewish state. He has also praised the Hamas terror group as a liberation group.</p>

<p>Turkish police arrested a suspect last week believed to have been transferring money to operatives of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, Turkish security sources said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>In December, the head of Israel's Shin Bet security agency said that his organisation was prepared to target Hamas anywhere, including in Lebanon, Turkey and Qatar.</p>

<p>Turkey warned Israel of "serious consequences" if it tries to hunt down members of the terror group living outside Palestinian territories, including in Turkey.</p>

<p>Since then, Turkish authorities have detained dozens of people, among them private investigators, on charges of collecting data on individuals, mostly Palestinians residing in Turkey, for Israeli intelligence.</p>

<p>In January, Turkey arrested 33 individuals suspected of spying for Israel, according to the country's Interior Minister. The suspects were arrested in eight provinces across the country in what Ankara called Operation Mole.</p>

<p>In February, Turkish police arrested seven suspects on suspicion of selling information to Mossad through private detectives, the state-run Anadolu news agency said. Seven more people, including a private detective, were arrested in March - also for selling information to Mossad. Another two were arrested in April.</p>

<p>Israel has not commented on the arrests.</p>

<p>In May, Turkey halted all trade with Israel, and in August, it filed a request with a UN court to join South Africa's lawsuit accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza.</p>

<p>Erdogan has accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, called for it to be punished in international courts and criticised Western nations for backing Israel. He has compared Israel to Nazi Germany, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before learning of the multi-level car crash that killed his daughter Dharshini Vasudevan, a desperate father had tagged External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar in a social media post, requesting the government's help in locating her.</p>

<p>In the post, Chennai-based Mr Vasudevan said his daughter had been in the US for the past three years and lived at Frisco in Texas. She completed her MS studies a year back and was working for the past year, he wrote.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Dharshini Vasudevan is among four Indian nationals killed in a multi-car crash in Texas. The four, also comprising Aryan Raghunath Orampati, Farooq Shaik and Lokesh Palacharla had connected through a carpooling app and were travelling to Bentonville in Arkansas. While Dharshini was on her way to meet her uncle, Orampati and Shaik were returning from Texas to their homes in Bentonville. Lokesh Palacharla was going to Bentonville to meet his wife. The authorities managed to identify them through the carpooling app they had used.</p>

<p>According to reports, a speeding truck rear-ended the SUV the victims were in. The car burst into flames and all the occupants burnt to death. The authorities are now relying on DNA fingerprinting and teeth and bone remains to confirm the identities. "DNA fingerprinting will be done to identify the bodies, and the samples will be matched with the parents," a local authority said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During her final years of high school, Chinese teenager Xu Yunting found an unusual way to make some pocket money -- transforming herself into male video game characters and taking their female devotees on dates.</p>

<p>The trend, called "cos commissioning", has gained traction in China recently, with social media posts garnering millions of views as an increasing number of young women use their purchasing power to engineer a meeting with their dream man in real life.</p>

<p>One early morning in Shanghai last month, Xu carefully inserted contacts to enlarge her irises and adjusted a tangerine wig to transform into "Jesse", a character from the romance quest mobile game "Light and Night".&nbsp;</p>

<p>A tall and sensitive musician, he is one of five characters that woo players throughout the game -- and for client Feng Xinyu, a vivacious 19-year-old, the ideal partner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I don't have a boyfriend because I'm not interested in 3D men," Feng told AFP, using a term for real-life men as opposed to those on the page or screen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I like anime characters a little bit more, they're more appealing to me."</p>

<p>"Light and Night", made by tech giant Tencent and aimed squarely at young women, promises a "brand-new interactive experience of highly immersive love".</p>

<p>Players like Feng, who form strong emotional connections with characters in such games, are known as "dream girls" -- and cos commissioning takes the immersion to the next level by dragging those 2D beaus off the screen and into the real world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Feng has commissioned Xu twice before, for a fee of around $70.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last month, she spent $2,800 on a multi-day trip with another Jesse cosplayer to a different province.</p>

<p>But she decided she preferred Xu's portrayal and hired her for a third date.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We really click," Feng said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"She's just like the character from the game, it feels like we were meant to be together."</p>

<p><strong>'Reconstructing gender rules'</strong></p>

<p>Feng was waiting for Xu at a metro station, and grinned in unabashed delight when she spotted her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two appeared relaxed, holding hands and chatting happily as they headed to their first activity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Their date -- all planned and paid for entirely by Feng -- lasted all day, beginning with tea and ending with a hotpot meal and a romantic stroll.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At both a doll-painting workshop and cake-decorating class they attended, they were one of many cos commission pairs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Staff at the latter business told AFP they had noticed more and more couples coming in over the past year -- sometimes dozens on busy days.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Part of the appeal, experts studying the phenomenon say, is that it gives young women a way to perform an idealised heteronormative relationship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Conservative social attitudes towards women remain widespread in China, often reinforced by state media and popular culture.</p>

<p>Aside from assuaging safety concerns, hiring a female cosplayer ensures a level of equality and understanding not necessarily guaranteed in a real-life relationship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I don't think it's important what gender the person being commissioned is," Fudan University's Tian Qian told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"What is important is that (the cosplayer) is a vessel, because the client needs a vehicle for their emotions."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another academic, Zhou Zixing, wrote that cos commissioning allows women "to gain a voice that is fully respected by the opposite sex... responding to, breaking, and reconstructing the gender rules of the real world".</p>

<p><strong>'Low-quality guys'</strong></p>

<p>At the cake-decorating class, Feng leaned over the table, fondly watching Xu pipe generous amounts of icing onto a sponge cake.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Afterwards, Xu gently helped Feng remove her apron, modelling Jesse's gentlemanly behaviour. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"The guys in the games are all quality guys," said Xu.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I think (clients) will be able to improve their requirements in real life in terms of what they want from a man, so that they don't settle for low-quality guys."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her mother Fang Xiuqing admitted her initial reaction when she learned what Xu was doing was: "How could this happen to my daughter?"&nbsp;</p>

<p>But she has since come around to the idea.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I don't think it's a profession, it's a hobby," said Fang.</p>

<p>"She gets enjoyment from it, and she also brings joy to others."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fudan University's Tian said cos commissions can act as "emotional sustenance".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Although this is a paid interaction, it still gives a sense of being seen, which has a certain healing effect to it."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Vladimir Putin has ordered Russian scientists to fast-track the development of a revolutionary anti-ageing treatment,&nbsp;that could help tackle the country's declining life expectancy.&nbsp;The health ministry's June directive, which came to light through investigative reporting by <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2024/09/03/who-wants-to-live-forever">Meduza</a></em> and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.currenttime.tv/a/prichudy-politbyuro-systema/33102242.html" rel="nofollow, noindex">Sistema</a>, has taken leading medical researchers by surprise. The outlets reported that the Russian Health Ministry sent&nbsp;a letter to research institutes, asking doctors to urgently develop and submit proposals aimed at preserving and promoting the health and well-being of Russian citizens. The goal is to "save 175,000 lives" by 2030, according to the investigation.</p>

<p>At the '<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2024/07/09/a-future-alternative">Rossiya' exhibition</a> in Moscow, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova unveiled the government's plan to invest in cutting-edge technologies&nbsp;aimed at promoting longevity and healthy ageing.&nbsp;Physicians were then requested to submit 'development proposals' focusing on several key areas, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mitigating the effects of cellular ageing</li>
	<li>Innovative technologies to prevent cognitive decline and sensory impairment</li>
	<li>Methods for modulating and correcting the immune system</li>
	<li>4Cutting-edge medical technologies leveraging bioprinting</li>
</ul>

<p>A Russian doctor who received the letter in June expressed surprise at the sudden urgency with which physicians were asked to develop proposals, saying it was unusual to be given such a tight deadline for a project of this scope.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''They asked us to fast-track all of our proposals —&nbsp;it felt like the letter had just arrived today and the deadline was yesterday. To be honest, it was the first time I'd seen anything like it —&nbsp;usually, any national project or federal program is preceded by several meetings involving various specialists and some sort of public discussion'', he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''When we got this letter, honestly, I was stunned. The whole premise baffled me. Oh sure, let's work on restoring the health of these old fogies —&nbsp;it's not like there's anyone else who needs our attention. Right in the middle of the war, we're just supposed to drop everything. The level of cynicism is bewildering,'' another researcher said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other researchers and experts are also concerned about the high costs of the research. A source close to the Kremlin stated, ''All the modern research discussed in the national project is quite expensive—developing new drugs costs billions. No single national project can handle that, especially now. I don't think they will be able to put together anything meaningful quickly''</p>

<p>Mikhail Kovalchuk, a close associate of President Putin and director of the prestigious Kurchatov Institute, Russia's premier nuclear research facility, has been actively lobbying for the initiative.&nbsp;He "raves about eternal life and the 'Russian genome,' a Kremlin source said.</p>

<p>According to data released by the Federal State Statistics Service of Russia (Rosstat) in July, the country's average life expectancy experienced a decline between July 2023 and June 2024, dropping to 73.24 years.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 19-year-old bodybuilder from Brazil was found dead at his home on Sunday afternoon, allegedly due to a heart attack, according to various reports.</p>

<p>Matheus Pavlak had transformed his body in just five years after taking up the sport to overcome obesity. He was a regular competitor and a rising star in the bodybuilding community, particularly in the southern Brazilian state of Santa Catarina, where he lived. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/09/03/bodybuilder-matheus-pavlak-dead/" rel="No follow, No index ">TMZ</a>, he recently placed fourth and sixth in regional competitions and won the U23 contest in 2023, becoming "Mr. Blumenau" in his hometown.</p>

<p>Pavlak's untimely death has sparked speculation about the role of anabolic steroids in triggering health issues. Critics on social media have highlighted his impressive physique at such a young age, suggesting that the use of performance-enhancing drugs may have contributed to his heart attack.</p>

<p>One acquaintance of Pavlak responded to these accusations on social media, stating, "How can human beings exist who are capable of offending the memory of a boy who is no longer here to defend himself!!"</p>

<p>Pavlak had previously posted pictures of his incredible body transformation, accompanied by the caption, "No matter how difficult or impossible your dream is, if you really want it, you will get there. I DID."</p>

<p>Pavlak's former trainer, Lucas Chegatti, expressed his grief over the loss of his protégé. On Instagram, Chegatti wrote, "Today ends in a sad day with the loss of a great friend, a spectacular young man who leaves us far too soon, a tragedy that has taken us by surprise. He had a brilliant future ahead of him as a respected athlete. God has his plans, but it's hard to understand; I don't have the words to explain the weight I feel in my heart."</p>

<p>Chegatti continued, "I was Matheus' first coach, and I'm very proud to have had the opportunity to care for him like a son. I promised him that one day he would beat me, and said and done, the first time we competed against each other, he ended up winning." Chegatti met Pavlak in 2022.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Pakistan government has issued an order barring all government employees from using social media without permission to stop disclosure of official information and documents, The News International reported.</p>

<p>According to an office memorandum issued by the Establishment Division, government employees have been asked to adhere to the instruction under the Government Servants (Conduct) Rules, 1964. As per the order, the government employees will not be allowed to use any social media platform without permission, The News International reported.</p>

<p>The memorandum stated, "Government employees cannot express opinions or facts that affect the reputation of the government," adding that employees are not permitted to speak against government policy, decisions, national sovereignty and dignity.</p>

<p>It further stated that public servants cannot share their opinions or rhetoric on social media platforms without permission. Strict action would be taken against government employees for violating the directives issued in the order, according to The News International report.</p>

<p>According to the memorandum, a government employee cannot share official documents and information with unrelated persons. It stated that employees cannot speak to the media in a way that impacts Pakistan's ties with other nations.</p>

<p>The memorandum stated, "Civil servants have often been seen debating on social media. The guidelines are not intended to ban the positive use of social media." According to the memorandum, institutions have been asked to monitor their social media platforms to remove objectionable content.</p>

<p>The memorandum stated, "Government servants of all services and groups are bound to follow the instructions. Violation may lead to misconduct proceedings against the employees concerned," according to the report. It asked federal secretaries, additional secretaries, heads of departments, and chief secretaries to execute the memorandum.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Brazilian influencer, who has spent over $1 million on cosmetic procedures to resemble Kim Kardashian, is now warning others about the dangers of&nbsp;butt fillers. Jennifer Pamplona, a self-proclaimed ''surgery addict'', revealed that polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), a common cosmetic material used in butt lift fillers took away her chances of having children. Although her infertility is not directly attributed to PMMA, her complications are believed to be linked to either improper application or an adverse reaction, the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/29/lifestyle/woman-says-butt-lift-filler-left-her-infertile-in-constant-agony-my-limitations-are-severe/" rel="nofollow, noindex">New York Post </a></em>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, PMMA can migrate from the injection site to other areas, including the pelvic region, potentially affecting reproductive organ function. Ms Pamplona claims to have experienced such an adverse reaction a decade ago, when PMMA spread from her buttocks to her reproductive organs during a bioplasty procedure, leading to her current fertility issues.</p>

<p>''I always dreamed of being a mother. Unfortunately, I now find myself unable to fulfil this dream due to the complications caused by PMMA,'' she told&nbsp;<em>Need To Know.</em></p>

<p>Her surgeon, Dr. Carlos Rios said that medical mishap became a “matter of life or death.”</p>

<p>''The symptoms she exhibited were a direct consequence of this procedure. She was hanging by a thread. The suffering is immense, and the pain of not being able to create life is something I never imagined facing,'' he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fortunately, her health has been improving, thanks to a holistic approach that includes meditation, a balanced diet, targeted supplementation, and medication.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The social media influencer, who has 1 million followers on Instagram, began her plastic surgery journey at just 17 years old, with over 30 procedures on her body and face. However, it wasn't until her 2022 diagnosis with body dysmorphia that she decided to stop the surgeries. While she may consider one final reconstructive surgery to address some of the lingering issues, Ms Pamplona is currently dealing with the adverse effects of her previous surgeries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''I like to say that if everyone paid attention to their emotional health, procedures would be less frequent,'' she said.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four Indians, including a woman, have died in a massive crash involving five vehicles in Texas. The victims had connected through a carpooling app and were on their way to Bentonville in Arkansas on Friday when the tragedy struck. The crash led to a fire in the SUV they were in, and their bodies were charred. Authorities are relying on DNA testing to confirm their identities.</p>

<p>The victims are Aryan Raghunath Orampati, Farooq Shaik, Lokesh Palacharla, and Dharshini Vasudevan. Orampati and his friend Shaik were returning after visiting his cousin in Dallas. Lokesh Palacharla was traveling to Bentonville to meet his wife. Dharshini Vasudevan, who had finished her Master's from the University of Texas and had been working in the US, was going to visit her uncle in Bentonville. They connected through a carpooling app and this helped authorities identify them.</p>

<p>According to reports, a speeding truck rear-ended the SUV the victims were in. The car burst into flames and all the occupants burnt to death. The authorities are relying on DNA fingerprinting and teeth and bone remains to confirm the identities. "DNA fingerprinting will be done to identify the bodies, and the samples will be matched with the parents," a local authority said.</p>

<p>A long weekend in the US has delayed the identification process, prolonging the suffering of the victims' families.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During a live circus performance, Russian trainer Sergei Prichinich narrowly escaped death when a female brown bear named Donut, weighing over 490 pounds, suddenly attacked him. The horrified audience, filled with parents and children, watched in terror as the bear, who was riding a hoverboard as part of her act, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/peta/status/1829184288254001297">viciously attacked Mr Prichinich</a>, pinning him to the ground for approximately half a minute, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/03/world-news/angry-bear-attacks-circus-trainer-in-front-of-terrified-crowd/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>New York Post</em> </a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he desperately tried to defend himself, holding a bar between the bear's jaws and his body. Just as the situation seemed dire, a worker outside the cage intervened, jabbing at the bear and distracting her long enough for Prichinich to break free. The bear backed off, giving Prichinich a narrow escape from the terrifying ordeal.</p>

<p>Nikita Mikhailov, director of the Moretti Circus, confirmed that the show resumed without further incident after the horrific episode.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''Towards the end of the act, the bear snapped at Sergei and wrestled with him. Their performance continued,'' he said. He noted that the tamer ''waited for the bear to calm down, got up, continued the routine with her, sealed it with a kiss, and that was it.''&nbsp;</p>

<p>He also praised Mr Prichinich for his quick thinking and professional handling of the situation.&nbsp;''This is an animal, and they can behave differently, they may not like something, but they can express their emotions this way. Every trainer understands this,'' Mr Mikhailov added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While everyone was relieved that the trainer escaped unhurt, Russian animal rights activist Yuri Koretskikh renewed his calls for a complete ban on live animal performances, citing the inherent risks and dangers posed to humans and animals in such shows.</p>

<p>''While modern world circus art is rapidly moving towards humanity, banning the use of animals in circuses, the Russian circus lobby is actively resisting progress, defending its commercial interests,” Mr Koretskikh said.</p>

<p>In Russia, animal rights have been a pressing concern, prompting President Vladimir Putin to sign a bill outlawing animal cruelty in 2018. Although the legislation doesn't address animal performance, activists have continued to focus on this issue. Last year, the Russian Duma proposed a bill to prohibit the use of animals in circuses nationwide. The bill is set to be presented to the lower chamber in October.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia's air safety investigators have recommended reforms after a Brisbane air traffic controller was found asleep at his desk while covering an early-morning shift. According to a report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), the staffer was managing the Cairns Terminal Control Unit (TCU) from Airservices Australia's Brisbane office when he was discovered asleep by the oncoming air traffic controller who was working the day shift. The incident took place in December 2022. In its report, released Tuesday, the ATSB blamed multiple consecutive night shifts and an ineffective fatigue risk management system for the incident.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.atsb.gov.au/media/news-items/2024/fatigue-management-improvements-underway-after-brisbane-centre-controller-found-asleep-end-their-night-shift" rel="noindex, nofollow">ATSB</a>, the staffer was found lying across two chairs and under a blanket at the end of a night shift. The employee had worked their seventh night shift in nine days as an approach controller for Cairns airport from the Brisbane control centre, with the shift starting at 10 pm and running until 6 am. The staffer had completed 10 night shifts in 12 days. The report stated that there were no planes in the area at the time and ATSB was unable to determine when the employee went to sleep.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sharing the investigation report details on X, ATSB wrote, "A Brisbane Centre air traffic controller who was found asleep at their workstation towards the end of their shift had worked multiple consecutive night shifts resulting in sleep debt, an ATSB investigation report details."&nbsp;</p>

— ATSB (@atsbgovau) <a href="https://twitter.com/atsbgovau/status/1830791268907278639?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>According to the press note, ATSB Chief Commissioner Angus Mitchell said there were several factors contributing to the staffer falling asleep on the job but stressed the staffer's fatigue was a key component as they had worked 10-night shifts in the previous 12 days.</p>

<p>"The controller had also been working multiple night shifts with reduced extended rest periods, which likely reduced their ability to obtain restorative sleep," Mr Mitchell said.</p>

<p>Alongside the staffer's fatigue, the ATSB noted the time of day the controller was working, the low workload in a night shift, the employee not undertaking mental alertness activities and lying down on two chairs under a blanket. It also said that the controller may have experienced "sleep inertia" after waking up, impacting their ability to communicate and make decisions during an instance where traffic infringes on their airspace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There were no negative consequences from this occurrence, but it does highlight areas for improvement in work scheduling and fatigue risk management," said Mr Mitchell.</p>

<p>The ATSB report further criticised an "over-reliance" on short-term changes to manage the airport roster "likely due to an underlying lack of resources within Airservices Australia". "As a result, cumulative fatigue was not being effectively managed strategically, and an over-reliance on tactical principles did not identify or manage fatigue risks arising from the work schedule," it added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, after the incident, Airservices upped its overall number of air traffic controllers, the Guardian reported. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also announced changes to its fatigue risk management system requirement and is working alongside Airservices to bolster its approach to staffer fatigue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Mitchell called on other sectors of the transport industry to put the spotlight on fatigue as a danger in the workplace. "Fatigue remains one of the most relevant ongoing concerns for safe transport, despite increased awareness across the transport sector," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Commerce Department said Tuesday it plans to award $50 million to HP to support the expansion and modernization of an existing company facility in Oregon that will boost key semiconductor technologies.</p>

<p>The proposed funding will support technologies that serve life sciences instrumentation and technology hardware used in artificial intelligence applications and other projects, the department said.</p>

<p>Congress in August 2022 approved a $39 billion subsidy program for U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and related components along with $75 billion in government lending authority and a 25% investment tax credit worth an estimated $24 billion.</p>

<p>The projects build on HP's expertise in microfluidics and microelectromechanical systems with funding set to support manufacturing of silicon devices critical in life sciences lab equipment used in drug discovery, singlecell research, and cell line development.</p>

<p>Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the proposed $50 million funding for the Corvallis, Oregon, HP campus "shows how we are investing in every part of the semiconductor supply chain and how important semiconductor technology is to innovation in drug discovery and critical life science equipment."</p>

<p>The department said the technology will boost partner institutions including Harvard Medical School, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Merck.</p>

<p>HP CEO Enrique Lores said the funding "provides HP with an opportunity to modernize and expand our facility to further invest in our microfluidics technology."</p>

<p>The department has announced term sheets with 17 companies offering more than $32 billion in grants and up to $29 billion in loans.</p>

<p>It also made other major planned awards including $6.4 billion to South Korea's Samsung to expand chip production in Texas.</p>

<p>Intel won $8.5 billion in grants in March while Taiwan's TSMC clinched $6.6 billion to build out its American production and memory chip maker Micron Technology won $6.1 billion to help fund domestic chip factory projects.</p>

<p>All the awards have yet to be finalized and amounts could change after the Commerce Department conducts due diligence.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Henry, the crocodile, got his name from the famous hunter, Sir Henry Neumann, who was once appointed to kill him. ]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An enormous 16ft beast weighing 700 kg and fathering thousands of hatchlings is now recognised as the world's oldest crocodile. Meet Henry, the man-eating Nile crocodile, who at 123 years old has sired over 10,000 babies with his six ‘wives,' according to the zoo where he lives.<br />
<br />
Henry's journey began in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, where he was born on December 16, 1900, as per the Sun. Renowned for his terrifying fang-like teeth and massive frame, Henry is now believed to be the largest living crocodile, with a length that almost matches a minibus. However, his past is far from ordinary.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In the early 1900s, Henry developed a notorious reputation among the local tribes in Botswana, where he allegedly preyed on human children. The tribes, desperate to end his bloodthirsty reign, sought the help of a famed hunter, Sir Henry Neumann, after whom the crocodile was named. Rather than killing the beast, Mr Neumann captured Henry, sentencing him to a lifetime of captivity.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For the past three decades, Henry has lived at the Crocworld Conservation Centre in Scottburgh, South Africa. There, he continues to awe visitors with his size and age, making him one of the oldest crocodiles in captivity. His dark, man-eating past is a stark contrast to his current life as a zoo attraction, where he is admired from a safe distance.<br />
<br />
Henry is a Nile crocodile, a species found in 26 countries across Sub-Saharan Africa. These apex predators, known for their fierce nature, are responsible for hundreds of deaths in the region each year.<br />
<br />
While Henry is the oldest crocodile, the largest belongs to Cassius, a 16 ft saltwater crocodile living in Australia. Cassius, captured in 1984, has become a star attraction at the Marineland Melanesia Crocodile Habitat on Green Island, off the coast of Queensland.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mayor of Chilpancingo, the capital of Mexico's violence-plagued state of Guerrero, traveled alone to an out-of-town meeting before he was killed, Mexico's security minister said on Tuesday about a murder which has shocked the country.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/mexican-mayor-alejandro-arcos-decapitated-days-after-taking-office-head-found-on-truck-6738781">Alejandro Arcos</a>, of Mexico's main opposition alliance, had only taken office six days earlier. Photos circulated on Sunday via WhatsApp and in Mexican media outlets depicting a severed head on top of a pick-up truck, appearing to be that of Arcos.</p>

<p>The gruesome act happened just days before new President Claudia Sheinbaum unveiled her security strategy aimed at combating violent crime.</p>

<p>Security Minister Omar Garcia Harfuch said in a news conference that an investigation had determined Arcos left Chilpancingo in his pickup truck without a driver or escort heading toward the nearby town of Petaquillas.</p>

<p>Arcos had not requested security protection from the federal government, Garcia Harfuch said.</p>

<p>"We know that he was going to a specific meeting, that he was not accompanied by someone. Communication was lost in a community, and... hours later the mayor's body was found," Garcia Harfuch said.</p>

<p>Asked by a reporter whom Arcos was meeting with, the minister declined to give details, saying it was an open investigation.</p>

<p>"There is a lot of information on this subject that we must guard for the sake of the investigation," Harfuch said.</p>

<p>Mexican newspaper Reforma, citing federal government sources, reported that Arcos had met with members of Los Ardillos, a criminal group active in Guerrero state, hours before his death.</p>

<p>A funeral for Arcos was held on Monday, with mourners lining the streets and throwing rose petals as his casket was driven through the town.</p>

<p>Similar grisly murders involving decapitations have plagued Guerrero - including Chilpancingo - in the past as a way cartel members use to send messages of threats and control.</p>

<p>As recently as 2023, violence from warring gang factions paralyzed public transportation and shuttered businesses in Chilpancingo. After Arcos' killing, classes were suspended for local schools.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The announcement comes as Hollywood has been wrestling with how to harness generative AI video technology this year, after Microsoft-backed OpenAI in February first showed off how its product Sora could create feature film-like videos.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook owner Meta announced on Friday it had built a new AI model called Movie Gen that can create realistic-seeming video and audio clips in response to user prompts, claiming it can rival tools from leading media generation startups like OpenAI and ElevenLabs.</p>

<p>Samples of Movie Gen's creations provided by Meta showed videos of animals swimming and surfing, as well as videos using people's real photos to depict them performing actions like painting on a canvas.</p>

<p>Movie Gen also can generate background music and sound effects synced to the content of the videos, Meta said in a blog post, and use the tool to edit existing videos.</p>

<p>In one such video, Meta had the tool insert pom-poms into the hands of a man running by himself in the desert, while in another it changed a parking lot where a man was skateboarding from dry ground into one covered by a splashing puddle.</p>

<p>Videos created by Movie Gen can be up to 16 seconds long, while audio can be up to 45 seconds long, Meta said. It shared data showing blind tests indicating that the model performs favorably compared with offerings from startups including Runway, OpenAI, ElevenLabs and Kling.</p>

<p>The announcement comes as Hollywood has been wrestling with how to harness generative AI video technology this year, after Microsoft-backed OpenAI in February first showed off how its product Sora could create feature film-like videos in response to text prompts.</p>

<p>Technologists in the entertainment industry are eager to use such tools to enhance and expedite filmmaking, while others worry about embracing systems that appear to have been trained on copyright works without permission.</p>

<p>Lawmakers also have highlighted concerns about how AI-generated fakes, or deepfakes, are being used in elections around the world, including in the U.S., Pakistan, India and Indonesia.</p>

<p>Meta spokespeople said the company was unlikely to release Movie Gen for open use by developers, as it has with its Llama series of large-language models, saying it considers the risks individually for each model. They declined to comment on Meta's assessment for Movie Gen specifically.</p>

<p>Instead, they said, Meta was working directly with the entertainment community and other content creators on uses of Movie Gen and would incorporate it into Meta's own products sometime next year.</p>

<p>According to the blog post and a research paper about the tool released by Meta, the company used a mix of licensed and publicly available datasets to build Movie Gen.</p>

<p>OpenAI has been meeting with Hollywood executives and agents this year to discuss possible partnerships involving Sora, although no deals have been reported to have come out of those talks yet. Anxieties over the company's approach increased in May when actor Scarlett Johansson accused the ChatGPT maker of imitating her voice without permission for its chatbot.</p>

<p>Lions Gate Entertainment, the company behind "The Hunger Games" and "Twilight," announced in September that it was giving AI startup Runway access to its film and television library to train an AI model. In return, it said, the studio and its filmmakers can use the model to augment their work.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[By dissolving parliament now, Shigeru Ishiba wants to put his party to the test before his "honeymoon" period ends, a political science professor said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba dissolved parliament on Wednesday ahead of the October 27 snap elections, banking on his political honeymoon and a fragmented opposition to lead his scandal-tainted party to victory.</p>

<p>Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has governed Japan almost uninterrupted for decades -- albeit with frequent leader changes -- and is almost certain to be re-elected.&nbsp;But Ishiba, named prime minister just last week, wants to shore up his mandate to push through policies that include beefing up spending on defence as well as on poorer regions hit hard by Japan's demographic crisis.</p>

<p>"We want to face this election fairly and sincerely, so as for this government to obtain (public) trust," Ishiba told reporters on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Later the speaker of parliament read out a letter from the prime minister with the emperor's seal, formally dissolving parliament as lawmakers shouted the traditional rallying cry of "banzai".</p>

<p>The three-year government of Ishiba's predecessor Fumio Kishida suffered record-low approval ratings due to a slush fund scandal and voter discontent over rising prices.</p>

<p>Polls last week gave Ishiba's cabinet approval ratings of 45-50 percent, compared with 20-30 percent for the Kishida administration's final month.</p>

<p>Ishiba's backers hope the self-confessed defence "geek" and outspoken critic of the LDP establishment will boost the party's popularity, including by persuading young people to vote.</p>

<p>By dissolving parliament now, the 67-year-old wants to put his party to the test before his "honeymoon" period ends, said Yu Uchiyama, a political science professor at the University of Tokyo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It makes sense that he wanted to call a snap election as soon as the 'face' of the party changed, while the momentum is still there", he told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Uchiyama added that Ishiba also wanted to catch opposition forces flat-footed, as the LDP's foes remain undecided about how to coordinate with each other in the election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the prime minister's decision to call a snap election this early was also criticised for contradicting his previous vows to prioritise facing the opposition in parliament.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some voters saw it as a disappointing sign that he had "yielded to the pressure within his party" to dissolve parliament for political gain, Uchiyama said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the weekend, Ishiba announced that the LDP would not endorse some disgraced party members implicated in the political funding scandal in the election.</p>

<p>The announcement reflected his desire to demonstrate to the public that he can be "strict" and "likely regained public trust in him a bit", Uchiyama said.</p>

<h3><strong>Fresh promises</strong></h3>

<p>To counter China, Ishiba has backed the creation of a regional military alliance along the lines of NATO, although he admitted on Monday it would "not happen overnight".</p>

<p>Analyst Yee Kuang Heng of the University of Tokyo's Graduate School of Public Policy, told AFP the idea sounded like a "blast from the past" recalling the now-defunct SEATO (Southeast Asia Treaty Organization).</p>

<p>Ishiba said the security environment in Asia was "the most severe since the end of World War II", and warned in his first policy speech Friday that "today's Ukraine could be tomorrow's East Asia".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Japan is also facing a looming demographic crisis as its population ages and the birth rate stays stubbornly low -- a situation Ishiba called a "quiet emergency" on Friday.</p>

<p>He said his government would promote measures to support families such as flexible working hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ishiba has also pledged to "ensure Japan's economy emerges from deflation", and wants to boost incomes through a new stimulus package as well as support for local governments and low-income households.</p>

<p>The main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, meanwhile, seeks to differentiate itself from the LDP on a range of diversity issues, including vowing to legalise same-sex marriages.</p>

<p>It also pledges to allow married couples to maintain separate surnames.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Kremlin on Wednesday denied reports by American journalist Bob Woodward that former US President Donald Trump spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin as many as seven times after leaving office, the RBC daily reported.</p>

<p>When asked by RBC if <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/trump-sent-covid-kits-to-putin-called-him-7-times-since-2021-claims-book-by-bob-woodward-6746806#pfrom=home-ndtv_topstories">Putin and Trump had spoken on the phone</a>, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: "No, that's not true."</p>

<p>In his book "War", Woodward said Trump ordered an aide away from his office at his Florida residence at Mar-a-Lago in early 2024 so he could conduct a private phone call with Putin, according to The Washington Post's summary of the book.</p>

<p>The Post said on Wednesday the book does not describe what the two men discussed, and it quotes a Trump campaign official casting doubt on the supposed contact.</p>

<p>The book also cited an unnamed Trump aide as indicating that Trump may have spoken to Putin as many as seven times since Trump left the White House in 2021.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign dismissed Woodward's book and said the book's content was "made-up", the New York Times reported.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Nima Rinji Sherpa, who already holds multiple records from his ascents of dozens of peaks, started high-altitude climbing at the age of 16, by climbing Mount Manaslu in August 2022.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An 18-year-old Nepali mountaineer on Wednesday broke the record for the youngest person to summit all 14 of the world's 8,000-metre peaks, his team said.</p>

<p>Nima Rinji Sherpa reached the summit of Tibet's 8,027-metre-high (26,335 feet) Shisha Pangma on Wednesday morning, completing his mission to stand on the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/mount-chimborazo-surpasses-mount-everest-as-worlds-highest-peak-in-unusual-way-6749120">world's highest peaks</a>.</p>

<p>"He reached the summit this morning. He had trained well and I was confident he would do it," his father Tashi Sherpa told AFP.</p>

<p>Summiting all 14 "eight-thousanders" is considered the peak of mountaineering aspirations. Climbers cross "death zones" where there is not enough oxygen in the air to sustain human life for long periods.</p>

<p>"This summit is not just the culmination of my personal journey, but a tribute to every Sherpa who has ever dared to dream beyond the traditional boundaries set for us," Sherpa said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Mountaineering is more than labour, it is a testament to our strength, resilience and passion."</p>

<p>Sherpa is no stranger to the mountains, hailing from a family of record-holding mountaineers, who also now run Nepal's largest mountaineering expedition company.</p>

<p>The record was previously held by another Nepali climber, Mingma Gyabu 'David' Sherpa. He achieved it in 2019, at the age of 30.</p>

<p><strong>'Proud moment'</strong></p>

<p>Nima Rinji Sherpa, who already holds multiple records from his ascents of dozens of peaks, started high-altitude climbing at the age of 16, by climbing Mount Manaslu in August 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By June this year, he had climbed his 13th mountain, Kanchenjunga, the world's third highest. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is a proud moment for our country," Nima Nuru Sherpa, president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association, told AFP. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"Nima broke all the stereotypes, and his success has given a message that nothing is impossible if you have a strong determination."</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/5-russian-mountaineers-killed-while-climbing-dhaulagiri-in-nepal-6742934">Nepali climbers</a> -- usually ethnic Sherpas from the valleys around Everest -- are considered the backbone of the climbing industry in the Himalayas.</p>

<p>They carry the majority of equipment and food, fixing ropes and repairing ladders.</p>

<p>Long in the shadows as supporters of foreign climbers, they are slowly being recognised in their own right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2021, a team of Nepali climbers made the first winter ascent of K2, the world's second-highest peak -- the notoriously challenging 8,611-metre (28,251-feet) "savage mountain" of Pakistan.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Climate finance is money spent in a manner "consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development", as per phrasing used in the Paris agreement.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rich countries will be under pressure at next month's UN COP29 conference to increase by hundreds of billions of dollars how much money they give to poorer countries as "climate finance".</p>

<p>But there is deep disagreement over how much is needed, who should pay and what should be covered, ensuring that climate finance will top the agenda at COP29 in Baku.</p>

<p><strong>What is climate finance?</strong></p>

<p>It is the buzzword in this year's negotiations, which run from November 11-22, but there is not one agreed definition of climate finance.</p>

<p>In general terms, it is money spent in a manner "consistent with a pathway towards low <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ocean-heat-behind-hurricane-helene-made-500-times-more-likely-by-climate-change-6750094">greenhouse gas emissions</a> and climate-resilient development", as per phrasing used in the Paris agreement.</p>

<p>That includes government or private money in clean energy like solar and wind, technology like electric vehicles, or adaptation measures like dykes to hold back rising seas.</p>

<p>But could a subsidy for a new water-efficient hotel, for example, be counted? It's not something the annual UN-sponsored climate summits have addressed directly.</p>

<p>At the UN negotiations, climate finance has come to refer to the difficulties the developing world faces getting the money it needs to prepare for <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/this-is-the-second-warmest-september-on-record-says-climate-watchdog-6743182">global warming</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Who pays?</strong></p>

<p>Under a 1992 UN accord, a handful of rich countries most responsible for global warming were obligated to provide finance.</p>

<p>In 2009, the United States, the European Union, Japan, Britain, Canada, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, New Zealand and Australia agreed to pay $100 billion per year by 2020.</p>

<p>They only achieved this for the first time in 2022. The delay eroded trust and fuelled accusations that rich countries were shirking their responsibility.</p>

<p>At COP29, nearly 200 nations are expected to agree on a new finance goal beyond 2025.</p>

<p>India has called for $1 trillion a year and some other proposals go higher, but countries on the hook want other major economies to chip in.</p>

<p>They argue times have changed and the big industrialised nations of the early 1990s represent just 30 percent of historic greenhouse gas emissions today.</p>

<p>In particular, there is a push for China -- the world's largest polluter today -- and the Gulf countries to pay. They do not accept this proposal.</p>

<p><strong>What's being negotiated?</strong></p>

<p>Experts commissioned by the UN estimate that developing countries, excluding China, will need $2.4 trillion per year by 2030.</p>

<p>But the line between climate finance, foreign aid and private capital is often blurred and campaigners are pushing for clearer terms that specify where money comes from, and in what form.</p>

<p>In a letter to governments, seen by AFP, a coalition of dozens of activist, environment and scientific organisations in October called on rich nations to pay developing countries $1 trillion a year into three clear categories.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some $300 billion would be government money for reducing <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/climate-change-causes-issues-in-coastal-areas-during-cyclones-weather-chief-6705242">planet-heating emissions</a>, $300 billion for adaptation measures and $400 billion for disaster relief known as "loss and damage".</p>

<p>The signatories said all the money should be grants, seeking to redress the provision of loans as climate finance that poorer countries say compounds their debt problems.</p>

<p>Developed countries do not want money for "loss and damage" included under any new climate finance pact reached at <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/cop29-leaders-announce-new-climate-funding-and-energy-storage-goals-6583245">COP29</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Where will they find the money?</strong></p>

<p>Today, most climate finance aid goes through development banks or funds co-managed with the countries concerned, such as the Green Climate Fund and the Global Environment Facility.</p>

<p>Campaigners are very critical of the $100 billion pledge because two-thirds of the money was given as loans, not grants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even revised upwards, it is likely any new pledge from governments will fall well short of what is needed.</p>

<p>But this commitment is viewed as highly symbolic nonetheless, and crucial to unlocking other sources of money, namely private capital.</p>

<p>Financial diplomacy also plays out at the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the G20, where hosts Brazil want to craft a global tax on billionaires.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The idea of new global taxes, for example on aviation or maritime transport, is also supported by France, Kenya and Barbados, with the backing of UN chief Antonio Guterres.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Redirecting fossil fuel subsidies towards clean energy or wiping the debt of poor countries in exchange for climate investments are also among the options.&nbsp;</p>

<p>COP29 host Azerbaijan, meanwhile, has asked fossil fuel producers to contribute to a new fund that would channel money to developing countries.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nestled amongst the hills of Kullu in Naggar is a gravestone with these words on it: "Here on December 15, 1947, the body of Maharishi Nicholas Roerich - a great Russian friend of India - was committed to fire. Let there be peace."&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are few instances when the simplest of words convey such meaning. Nicholas Roerich, who was born on this day 150 years ago, was, first and foremost, an Indophile, someone who perhaps can be said to have laid the foundation of Indo-Russian friendship. But, to know Roerich and his work - whether on canvas or paper - one has to encounter India.</p>

<h2><strong>Roerich's Time At Ishwara</strong></h2>

<p>Roerich was a painter, traveller, writer, philosopher, and, as many in his native country consider, a mystic. His extraordinary life is the stuff books and films are made of, but with a touch of the sublime and mystical. Roerich's abiding love for mountains was partly instrumental in his engagement with India and why he later made Naggar his home. Early in life, his family spent time at an estate near St. Petersburg named "Ishwara". The previous owner had hung a picture on the wall of what Roerich later realised was Kanchenjunga. As a child, he loved looking at it. Later, it was his wife Elena who introduced him to Indian thought, especially Buddhism, to which she had been introduced by Elena Blavatskaya, one of the founders of the Theosophical Society. Blavtaskaya had been to India and had converted to Buddhism.</p>

<h2><strong>When Roerichs Met Tagore</strong></h2>

<p>Hailing from an upper-middle-class family, Roerich grew up in a milieu where his family often entertained the city's cultural elites. It was also a time when, fatigued by constant conflict and wars, the Western world was increasingly looking towards the East for spiritual succour to "reorient" itself. At the beginning of the 20th century, Roerich's native Russia plunged into revolution and civil war. Recuperating in Finland when the Bolshevik Revolution gripped Russia, the Roerichs travelled to Europe, never to return. In England, they met Rabindranath Tagore and were greatly influenced by him. They then travelled to the US, where, already engaging with Indian philosophical traditions, they established the Agni Yoga Society in New York and an art institute. As we understand now, the society had less to do with yoga and was more focused on promoting religious harmony and the brotherhood of nations; the art institute went on to become the Nicholas Roerich Museum in 1949.</p>

<p>From the US, they finally landed in India in 1923. They toured India extensively, interacted with its cultural and political elites and civilians, and studied its ancient culture, traditions and religions, all of which found expression in Roerich's paintings and writings. It was from India that Roerich embarked on his famed Central Asian expedition from 1923-1928 through Sikkim, Tibet, Kashmir, Ladakh, Siberia, Altai and Mongolia. But the mountains kept beckoning to him and he finally settled down in Naggar in Kullu. There, he founded the Urusvati Himalayan Research Institute in 1928.</p>

<h2><strong>The Love For Himalayas</strong></h2>

<p>Of the 7,000-odd paintings that he left behind, at least 2,000 are dedicated to the Himalayas, which for Roerich symbolised man's spiritual longing and spiritual transcendence. This is how he described the Himalayas: ".....Here was the Abode of Rishis. Here resounded the sacred Flute of Krishna. Here thundered the Blessed Gautama. Here originated all the Vedas. Here lived Pandavas. Here was Gessar Khan. Here was Aryavarta. Here is Shambala. The Himalayas are the Jewel of India. The Himalayas are the Treasure of the World. The Himalayas are the sacred symbol of Ascent."<br />
Much later, Roerich was declared a National Treasure Artist of India, along with other eight masters like Tagore, Jamini Roy, etc.</p>

<p>Similarly, many of Roerich's writings have an Indian theme. He was greatly influenced by the Hindu concept of the cyclical nature of time, as also by old Slavonic spirituality and Russian Orthodoxy. He tried to promote a synthesis of Indian and Russian spirituality. Many of his writings depict the struggle between the shadow and light, with the latter always emerging triumphant - a search for the pristine "Shambala".</p>

<h2><strong><em>Dhammapada </em>In An Atheist State</strong></h2>

<p>Roerich was not alone in his endeavour to acquaint Russia, or the world for that matter, with Indian spirituality. Along with his wife, his sons also made their individual contributions to furthering Indo-Russian friendship and understanding. The elder son, George (Yuri) can be credited with promoting Indology in the Soviet Union. In 1957, he went to the then-USSR and lived there for three years, before his tragic untimely death. Russian Indologists consider him and his contribution a key to the second flowering of Buddhist and Indian studies in the Soviet Union; the first occurred during the Tsarist period. He was a scholar who championed the publication of the Russian translation of the <em>Dhammapada </em>[Buddhist holy text] by Vladimir Toporov. This was unheard of then. And given that the state then officially denounced religion, this was a revolutionary step. Later, the writings of both Roerich and Elena helped spread Indian mysticism in the Soviet Union and later in the Russian Federation, with a number of Roerich Societies springing up in different parts of the country.</p>

<p>The younger son, Svetoslav, often more famous as the husband of Devika Rani, the First Lady of Indian cinema, also did his bit through his numerous paintings. He remained in India all his life. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
There's another legacy Roerich has left behind: the Roerich Pact, or the Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments. An international legal document, the pact is aimed at ensuring the unconditional protection of cultural property. The pact has never been more significant than today as the world witnesses the wilful destruction of ancient and cultural heritage in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>There Is No Future Without The Past</strong></h2>

<p>For Roerich, knowledge and beauty epitomised life itself. This sentiment is beautifully portrayed in his drama <em>Mercy </em>('Miloserdiye') which this writer has been privileged to have translated from Russian to English.</p>

<p>Roerich passed away on December 15, 1947. In keeping with indic tradition, Nicholas, his wife and later son Svetoslav, were all cremated and samadhis erected over their ashes. His&nbsp;demise put an end to the work of the Urusvati Centre; it is now a museum of the International Roerich Memorial Trust, which houses a number of paintings by both Roerich and son Svetoslav. Yet, his rich legacy remains almost obscure in India, restricted to niche circles. This Russian friend of India deserves far more. As Roerich said: there is no future without the past.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Milton's rapid power surge appears to be the latest example of a worrying trend, scientists said, with climate change not only fuelling more powerful storms, but doing so more quickly.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year's warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico helped Milton swiftly become a powerful hurricane, with the US National Hurricane Center calling it the third-fastest intensifying Atlantic storm on record.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hurricane-milton-nears-florida-biden-warns-of-worst-natural-disaster-in-a-century-6749394">Milton's rapid power surge</a> appears to be the latest example of a worrying trend, scientists said, with climate change not only fuelling more powerful storms, but doing so more quickly.</p>

<p>Here is what you need to know:</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT IS BEHIND A STORM'S STRENGTH?</strong></h3>

<p>As storm winds organize into a hurricane, they pull energy from the heat in surface waters. The warmer the water, the more fuel for a hurricane.</p>

<p>Thanks to climate change, water temperatures are rising. In the last four decades, the ocean has absorbed about 90% of the warming from greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>This year has seen especially warm waters due to climate change, with 2024 on track to have the warmest average global air temperature on record.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The past 12 months have seen global warming at 1.62 degrees Celsius (2.92 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service said on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A storm's strength is defined by its sustained wind speeds, with a Category 1 hurricane carrying wind speeds of 74-95 mph (119-153 kph), while a dangerous Category 5 storm has wind speeds of 157 mph (252 kph) or higher.</p>

<h3><strong>HOW IS STRENGTH DIFFERENT FROM INTENSIFICATION?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>When a storm powers up quickly, scientists refer to its "rapid intensification."</p>

<p>When a storm rapidly intensifies, sustained wind speeds increase by at least 35 mph (56 kph) within 24 hours, which can see a storm jump by two categories.</p>

<p>On Monday, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/category-5-hurricane-milton-approaches-florida-2nd-major-storm-in-weeks-6740696">Milton became the third-most rapidly intensifying Atlantic storm</a> as its wind speeds increased by more than double the criteria for rapid intensification, shifting from a tropical storm to a Category 5 storm in less than a day.</p>

<p>The Gulf's warm water, along with air conditions, made Milton's rapid intensification "a near-certainty," said physical oceanographer Gregory Foltz with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>

<p>A study last year suggested that storms originating in the Atlantic Ocean are now more than twice as likely to strengthen from Category 1 to Category 3 in just 36 hours, based on data from 2001-2020 compared with 1971-1990.</p>

<p>That study, published in Scientific Reports, estimated that Atlantic storms overall are 29% more likely to undergo rapid intensification. While the study suggested this effect might be less pronounced for Gulf storms, the lead author told Reuters that unusually warm waters fuel storms wherever conditions are right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gulf of Mexico surface waters reached record-high temperatures around 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) during the past two summers, according to NOAA data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In mid-September, just weeks ahead of Milton's formation, the Gulf was the warmest for that time of year on record.</p>

<p>"Watching Milton's strengthening unfold in real time yesterday was still staggering," said lead author Andra Garner of Rowan University in New Jersey.</p>

<p>Her calculations, shared with Reuters, suggest that Milton's maximum 12-hour and 24-hour intensification rates on Monday ranked in the 99th percentile of all maximum intensification rates observed in the Atlantic.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>WHY IS RAPID INTENSIFICATION A CONCERN?</strong></h3>

<p>Hurricanes can be deadly. They also cause some of the world's costliest disasters, with the 10 costliest for the United States all occurring since 1989.</p>

<p>While Milton's power-up was stunning, it occurred while the storm was still days from making landfall, giving <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/milton-hurricane-update-if-you-stay-you-will-die-us-state-florida-braces-for-hurricane-milton-6745540">Florida</a> communities a chance to evacuate on Tuesday.</p>

<p>When a storm intensifies rapidly close to shore, it can leave communities scrambling to prepare or get out of harm's way.</p>

<p>Mexico was surprised last year when a weak tropical storm in the Pacific suddenly became a powerful Category 5 storm called Hurricane Otis, just hours before it slammed into western Mexico and killed dozens of people in the Acapulco metropolitan area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most rapidly intensifying Atlantic hurricane on record is Wilma, a Category 5 storm when it hit the Yucatan Peninsula in October 2005, followed by Hurricane Felix in 2007.</p>

<p>One 2022 study in Geophysical Research Letters said that the intensification rate of near-shore Atlantic hurricanes had "increased significantly" during the 1979-2018 period. But like the 2023 study, it did not find a significant change in intensification speeds in Gulf storms.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Climate change intensified Hurricane Helene's rainfall and winds, amplifying its devastation, a new rapid analysis found.</p>

<p>The Gulf of Mexico has been abnormally warm, which helped turn Helene into the deadliest hurricane to hit the US mainland in nearly two decades. Burning fossil fuels made that extra ocean heat up to 500 times more likely, according to the analysis published by the World Weather Attribution group that studies extreme weather for evidence of climate change. In addition, Helene brought 10% more rain and saw its winds at landfall ramped up by 11% due to the influence of a hotter atmosphere.</p>

<p>Helene traversed the Gulf before making landfall in Florida roughly two weeks ago. The storm moved inland where it dumped record rainfall, creating an ongoing humanitarian crisis in North Carolina. The extreme flooding Helene unleashed destroyed critical infrastructure, hampering disaster response.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The economic losses could be as high as $250 billion, according to AccuWeather, and insurance losses are expected to reach $6.4 billion. The report's authors warn that climate change boosted the damage and loss of life caused by Helene. With Hurricane Milton set to make landfall in Florida on Wednesday after strengthening explosively over the Gulf of Mexico, the US is slated to see billions more in losses.</p>

<p>"The heat that human activities are adding to the atmosphere and oceans is like steroids for hurricanes," Bernadette Woods Placky, the chief meteorologist at Climate Central and one of 21 researchers who conducted the study, said in a statement. "If humans keep heating the climate, we will keep seeing storms rapidly morph into monster hurricanes, leading to more destruction."</p>

<p>Hurricanes as intense as Helene are likely to hit the Southeast US more frequently, too. In a pre-industrial climate, a storm like Helene had one-in-130-year odds of occurring in a given year. Now, warming temperatures have made it so that a storm of that magnitude will make landfall about every half century on average, according to the WWA analysis. The report isn't peer reviewed, though it relied on methods that are to reach its conclusions.</p>

<p>In recent decades, storms have strengthened more rapidly due to oceans warmed in part by climate change. Though the added heat hasn't made hurricanes more frequent, the ones that strike are likely to do so with more intensity, said Suzana Camargo, a climate scientist at Columbia University.</p>

<p>"What's happened is exactly what we have been talking about, at this point, for decades: to expect in a warmer world to have these more intense hurricanes," Camargo said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea's army said Wednesday it was moving to "permanently shut off and block the southern border" with Seoul and had informed the US military to prevent an accidental clash.</p>

<p>In a statement, Pyongyang said it would "cut off roads and railways" that might have someday facilitated travel between the two Koreas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/search?searchtext=North-Korea">North Korea</a> on Wednesday described the move as a "major military step", an analyst suggested it was likely the continuation of a process long under way.</p>

<p>Inter-Korean relations are at one of their lowest points in years, with Pyongyang shuttering agencies dedicated to reunification and declaring <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/search?searchtext=South-Korea">South Korea</a> its "principal enemy".</p>

<p>The nuclear-armed country had been expected to scrap a landmark inter-Korean agreement signed in 1991 at a key parliamentary meeting that ended Tuesday, part of leader <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/search?searchtext=Kim-Jong-Un">Kim Jong Un</a>'s drive to officially define the South as an enemy state.</p>

<p>But in a Wednesday report that revealed the naming of a new defence chief, official state media made no mention of the pact being ended.</p>

<p>Hours later, however, the army said it planned "a substantial military step" that would "completely cut off roads and railways connected to the ROK (South Korea) and fortify the relevant areas of our side with strong defence structures."</p>

<p>It added it had sent a telephone message to US forces Wednesday morning to "prevent any misjudgment and accidental conflict over the fortification project to be launched in the acute southern border area".</p>

<p>While the border is one of the most heavily militarised in the world, it failed to prevent a North Korean from crossing it to the South in August. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Seoul said in July that Pyongyang had spent months laying landmines and erecting barriers while turning the area into a wasteland along the heavily fortified border.</p>

<p>In June, the South Korean military said North Korean soldiers tasked with reinforcing the border had suffered "multiple casualties" from landmine explosion incidents.</p>

<p>That same month, Seoul's spy agency said it had detected signs that North Korea was demolishing sections of a railway line connecting the two Koreas.</p>

<p>"North Korea has already been demolishing parts of the Donghae Line railway, seemingly with the intention of completely severing its connection to the South," Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, told AFP, calling its latest statement "official confirmation".</p>

<p>The North Korean army said Wednesday its decision was a "self-defensive measure" in response to South Korean "war exercises" and visits by US strategic nuclear assets.</p>

<p>While no constitutional revisions involving Seoul were reported at this week's meeting, Hong Min, a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, said North Korea could be waiting for the results of next month's US election before making a move.</p>

<p>Pyongyang on Wednesday also named No Kwang Chol as its new defence minister, replacing Kang Sun Nam.</p>

<p>The announcement of No's appointment comes a day after Seoul's defence chief said North Korean soldiers were likely fighting in Ukraine alongside Russian troops, with some believed to have already been killed and more expected to be deployed.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Nirmeen Noufl allegedly murdered her husband and dismembered his body over a suspected love triangle]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Australian woman has been arrested for allegedly killing her husband, chopping his body into pieces with an electric saw and dumping it in public bins across the area, police said. Nirmeen Noufl, who is from Sydney, suspected her husband was having an affair with an Egyptian woman, who also received money from him,&nbsp;<a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://News.com.au&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1728536375818000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1KF18AEbdJQs4a1AwJdkHO" href="http://news.com.au/" target="_blank">News.com.au</a>&nbsp;quoted police as saying. She was taken into custody last week while her picture was revealed for the first time recently.</p>

<p>The incident took place when Noufl got into a heated argument with her husband, Mamdouh, at her residence in Greenacre locality.</p>

<p>After killing Mamdouh, she allegedly used an electric saw to cut his body into pieces and disposed of it in public bins across Sydney's southwestern suburbs. Noufl used cleaning chemicals to erase the traces.</p>

<p>During the initial investigation, Mamdouh's death was looked into as a missing person case. However, in a joint investigation by NSW Police and the NSW Crime Commission under Strike Force Tannerie, new evidence came to light against Noufl and she was arrested.</p>

<p>The brutal murder has sent shockwaves across Sydney, leaving people, who knew Noufl, stunned.</p>

<p>A local business worker, who last saw Noufl a few months ago, said she was a "nice, friendly" person.</p>

<p>"I honestly have no idea what her business was," said the woman, adding she only saw Noufl and her daughter and not her husband Mamdouh.</p>

<p>Danny Doherty, Homicide Squad Commander, has described Noufl as a woman who “manipulates people and manipulates the truth”.</p>

<p>Noufl even used her husband's social media accounts to get in touch with his "girlfriend in Egypt" and asked her to send all the money she received from her husband, police said. This happened after Noufl killed Mamdouh.</p>

<p>A close friend of the victim has identified him as a “decent" person, stating he was quiet and focused on his family and business.</p>

<p>“We are shocked. But what can we do? We don't have any power or any information,” the friend said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If Kamala Harris wins the US election she has made clear one change sure to come to the White House: the first president in eight years who actually enjoys a beer.&nbsp;In contrast to teetotalers Donald Trump and Joe Biden, Harris revealed on late night TV Tuesday that she likes the occasional brew.</p>

<p>The Democrat cracked open a can of Miller High Life at the prompting of host Stephen Colbert.</p>

<p>"Elections, I think, are won on vibes because one of the old saws is they just want somebody they can have a beer with," he said.</p>

<p>"So, would you like to have a beer with me so I can tell people what that's like?"</p>

<p>The comic revealed that showrunners had checked ahead of time what they should serve up "because we can't just be giving a drink to the vice president of the United States."</p>

<p>As she took the can of Miller High Life -- a 4.6 percent beer whose makers say its "easy-drinking flavor is the epitome of the American lager category" -- Harris revealed she had most recently supped booze with her husband, Doug Emhoff.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">While having a beer with Stephen Colbert, Kamala Harris says, "He lost millions of jobs. He lost manufacturing. You lost automotive plants, you lost the election.

<p>"OK, the last time I had a beer was at a baseball game with Doug," she said as she cracked the can, adding: "Cheers."</p>

<p>"There you go. It's cold. From the beautiful city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin," said Colbert, referring to one of the seven swing states that could decide the 2024 presidential election.</p>

<p>"The champagne of beers," Harris replied, quoting the drink's marketing tagline.</p>

<p>The appearance was part of a media blitz that has also seen Harris sit with the hosts of "The View" and do a lengthy interview with Howard Stern on SiriusXM.</p>

<p>Like those outlets, "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" was a friendly environment that was never going to involve probing questions.</p>

<p>And Colbert's frequent mockery of Trump boosted Harris' message.</p>

<p>When he asked her about Trump's loss in 2020 -- which the billionaire still refuses to accept -- she jumped on the opportunity to taunt her opponent.</p>

<p>"You know, when you lost millions of jobs, you lost manufacturing, you lost automotive plants, you lost the election, what does that make you? A loser," she said.</p>

<p>"This is what happens when I drink beer," she laughed.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Milton is the second huge hurricane in as many weeks to rumble toward Florida's west coast.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Storm-battered Florida braced for a direct hit from Hurricane Milton which strengthened back to a Category 5 storm Tuesday, as US President Joe Biden begged residents to flee what he warned could be the worst natural disaster to hit the state in a century. As the second huge hurricane in as many weeks rumbled toward Florida's west coast, a sense of looming catastrophe spread as people raced to board up homes and flee.</p>

<p>"It's a matter of life and death, and that's not hyperbole," Biden said from the White House, urging those under orders to leave to "evacuate now, now, now."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I urge everyone in Hurricane Milton's path to listen to local officials and follow all safety instructions.<br />
<br />
If you are under evacuation orders you should evacuate now while it is still safe to do so.<br />
<br />
It is a matter of life and death.</p>
— President Biden (@POTUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1843696607981670523?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Thousands of federal personnel are on the ground across the Southeast delivering needed resources as fast as possible.<br />
<br />
And my priority is to increase the size and presence of our effort as we prepare for another potentially catastrophic storm making landfall in Florida.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Biden's warning came amid a bitter pre-election quarrel, with his Democratic vice president Kamala Harris castigating her rival Donald Trump for peddling false claims that recovery efforts after the first storm, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/after-helene-florida-orders-evacuations-as-hurricane-milton-strengthens-6736892">Hurricane Helene</a>, were diverted away from Republicans.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Folks in Hurricane Milton's path:<br />
<br />
Listen to local authorities.<br />

<p>As of Tuesday, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/milton-hurricane-update-if-you-stay-you-will-die-us-state-florida-braces-for-hurricane-milton-6745540">Milton</a> returned to the maximum Category 5 designation, generating maximum sustained winds of 165 mph (270 kph), the National Hurricane Center said.</p>

<p>"Fluctuations in intensity are likely while Milton moves across the eastern Gulf of Mexico, but Milton is expected to be a dangerous major hurricane when it reaches the west-central coast of Florida Wednesday night," the NHC said.</p>

<p>Governor Ron DeSantis, at a news conference, ticked off town after town and county after county that are in danger.</p>

<p>"Basically the entire peninsula portion of Florida is under some type of either a watch or a warning," he said.</p>

<p>Airlines put on extra flights out of Tampa, Orlando, Fort Myers and Sarasota, as highways clogged up with escaping traffic and gas stations sold out of fuel.</p>

<h3><strong>Walls of water</strong></h3>

<p>Hurricane expert Michael Lowry warned that in the Tampa area, home to some three million people, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/category-5-hurricane-milton-approaches-florida-2nd-major-storm-in-weeks-6740696">Milton's storm</a> surge "could double the storm surge levels observed two weeks ago during Helene," which brought massive flooding.</p>

<p>Biden postponed a major trip to Germany and Angola to oversee the federal response, as storm relief efforts have emerged as a political battleground ahead of the presidential election on November 5.</p>

<p>Trump has tapped into frustration about the emergency response after Hurricane Helene and fueled it with disinformation, falsely claiming that disaster money had been spent instead on migrants.</p>

<p>Biden on Tuesday slammed Trump's comments as "un-American," while presidential hopeful Harris warned about the danger that misinformation posed to the federal response.</p>

<p>"It's crude. Have you no empathy, man, for the suffering of other people? Have you have no sense of purpose if you purport to be a leader?" she said, challenging Trump directly, during an with late night talk show host Stephen Colbert due to be aired later Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a scene of frantic preparation repeated all over Florida, dozens of cars lined up at a sports facility in Tampa to pick up sandbags to protect their homes from flooding.</p>

<p>John Gomez, 75, ignored official advice and traveled all the way from Chicago to try to save a second house he has in Florida.</p>

<p>"I think it's better to be here in case something happens," Gomez said as he waited in line.</p>

<h3><strong>Global warming a factor</strong></h3>

<p>Scientists say global warming has a role in intense storms as warmer ocean surfaces release more water vapor, providing additional energy for storms, which exacerbates their winds.</p>

<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Tuesday released footage from a specialist plane called "Miss Piggy" as it flew into the hurricane to collect data.</p>

<p>Paperwork, equipment and personal items were sent flying as the plane was shaken by wind and rain.</p>

<p>On the ground, communities hit by the deadly Hurricane Helene, which slammed Florida late last month, have rushed to remove debris that could become dangerous projectiles as Milton approaches.</p>

<p>In Mexico's Yucatan, strong winds toppled trees and pylons, and heavy rain caused flooding, but the peninsula avoided major damage or casualties as the storm barreled offshore.</p>

<p>Across the southeastern United States, emergency workers are still struggling to provide relief after Helene, which killed at least 230 people across several states.</p>

<p>It hit the Florida coastline on September 26 as a major Category 4 hurricane, causing massive flooding in remote inland towns in states further north, including North Carolina and Tennessee.</p>

<p>Helene was the deadliest natural disaster to hit the US mainland since 2005's Hurricane Katrina, with the death count still rising.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The lawyer claimed her client began feeling increasingly weak after the lubricant was applied.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs is facing new, disturbing allegations of sexual assault involving drug use and violence, according to the accuser's attorney. The unnamed victim claims that Combs, 54, his bodyguard and another man, assaulted her after she was forcibly drugged.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Attorney Ariel Mitchell-Kidd revealed shocking details in an interview with <a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/banfield/diddy-accusers-lawyer-combs-used-oil-knife/ ">NewsNation</a>, alleging that Combs doused her client with a lubricant laced with Rohypnol, commonly referred to as the date rape drug. The victim was reportedly forced to remove her clothes after Combs threatened her with a knife. Mitchell-Kidd claims her client began feeling increasingly weak after the lubricant was applied.<br />
<br />
“She noticed herself becoming more and more limp,” Mitchell-Kidd said, adding the use of oil can allow drugs like Rohypnol or GHB to be absorbed through the skin. “It seems to me that there were some types of drugs mixed into the oil, which is why he was dousing her in that oil prior, not only to make it easier to assault her, but that was what was lowering her defences.”<br />
<br />
After being incapacitated, the victim alleges that Combs, his bodyguard, and a third person sexually assaulted her. The attorney said her client plans to file a complaint later this week, explaining, “The details are graphic, and the complaint lays out all of the details. She was finally able to get away after the gruesome attack.”<br />
<br />
It is unclear whether the woman in this case is the same individual who previously accused Combs of luring her to his home and raping her in 2018. The earlier victim also filed a police report, claiming similar violent and drug-fuelled behaviour from the artist.<br />
<br />
Sean “Diddy” Combs has been in custody since September 16, following his arrest in New York City on multiple charges, including racketeering, sex trafficking by force, and transporting individuals for prostitution. Federal documents accuse him of using drugs to manipulate and control his victims during prolonged, often violent, sexual encounters.<br />
<br />
In the past weeks, <a href="http://https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/over-100-people-to-sue-us-rapper-sean-diddy-combs-in-sex-assault-case-6698693">over 120 individuals</a> have come forward with allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation against the Bad Boy Records founder. These claims, spanning over three decades, include accusations from both men and women, with at least 25 minors among the victims, according to attorney Tony Buzbee. One of the minors was as young as 9 years old.<br />
<br />
Buzbee also indicated that these accusations implicate several high-profile figures in the entertainment industry, some of whom are reportedly being offered the opportunity to settle before their cases go public.<br />
<br />
Despite the flood of accusations, Combs and his legal team have repeatedly denied the claims against him.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Russia and Iran had turned to employing criminals and private intelligence officers to do their work on British soil, the chief of Britain's domestic intelligence service said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia's intelligence service has been intent on causing "mayhem" in the UK because of London's support for Ukraine, the chief of Britain's domestic intelligence service said on Tuesday. Ken McCallum also said MI5 had responded to 20 Iran-backed plots since January 2022 that presented potentially lethal threats to British citizens and UK residents.</p>

<p>Russia and Iran had turned to employing criminals and private intelligence officers to do their work on British soil, he said.</p>

<p>From Russia, Britain should "expect to see continued acts of aggression here at home" with its military intelligence agency the GRU on "sustained missions to generate mayhem" on the country's streets, McCallum said.</p>

<p>"We've seen arson, sabotage and more," he added.</p>

<p>On Iran, he said there had been an "unprecedented pace and scale" of plots over the past two years.</p>

<p>As events unfold in the Middle East, MI5 was giving its "fullest attention" to the risk of a rise in Iranian-state backed aggression in the UK, he added.</p>

<p>Overall, MI5 and the police have disrupted 43 late-stage attack plots since March 2017, saving "numerous lives", he said, adding: "Some of those plotters were trying to get hold of firearms and explosives, in the final days of planning mass murder."</p>

<p>In a wide-ranging speech, McCallum also blamed extreme right-wing ideologies for a "staggering" rise in the number of children being investigated for terrorism.</p>

<p>Under-18s represent 13 percent of people being investigated by the spy agency for possible involvement in terror activities, he said.</p>

<p>He told reporters at MI5's Counter Terrorism Operations Centre in London that the number marked "a threefold increase in the last three years".</p>

<p>McCallum said the internet was the "biggest factor" driving the rise, describing how easily youngsters can access "inspirational and instructional material" from their bedrooms.</p>

<p>He said the intelligence service was seeing "far too many cases where very young people are being drawn into poisonous online extremism", singling out "canny" internet memes.</p>

<p>"Extreme right-wing terrorism in particular skews heavily towards young people, driven by propaganda that shows a canny understanding of online culture," he added.</p>

<p>"It's not really a consistent single ideology on the extreme right-wing side and that is what has skewed the numbers most heavily."</p>

<p>The UK terrorist threat level remains at "substantial" -- the third highest out of five -- meaning an attack is likely.</p>

<p>McCallum added that the Islamic State group had "resumed efforts to export terrorism" and that in the last year inquiries into plots by hostile states had surged by 48 percent.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday issued a stark warning to Lebanon, claiming the country could face a similar fate to Gaza if it continues to allow Hezbollah to operate within its borders. His statement came as the Israeli military intensified its offensive against Hezbollah along Lebanon's southern coastline, deploying additional troops and advising civilians to evacuate the region.</p>

<p>In a direct video address to the Lebanese people, Netanyahu urged them to free their country from Hezbollah's grip to avoid further destruction. "You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will lead to destruction and suffering like we see in Gaza," he said. The warning was clear: unless Hezbollah is dealt with, Lebanon risks enduring the same fate as Gaza, which has seen widespread devastation due to ongoing conflict.</p>

<p>"I say to you, the people of Lebanon: Free your country from Hezbollah so that this war can end," Netanyahu said.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

— Benjamin Netanyahu - בנימין נתניהו (@netanyahu) <a href="https://twitter.com/netanyahu/status/1843731646274773213?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2024</a></blockquote>

<h2><strong>Hezbollah Fires Back</strong></h2>

<p>The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah escalated after the group claimed responsibility for firing rockets at the Israeli port city of Haifa. This attack came after the Israeli military reported that 85 projectiles had crossed the border from Lebanon into Israel. Hezbollah, which has shown no signs of letting up, threatened to continue firing on Israeli cities and towns if Israeli strikes on Lebanese population centres persisted.</p>

<p>The conflict has been simmering since October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a devastating attack on Israel, killing over a thousand civilians. Since then, Hezbollah, a key ally of Hamas, has engaged in sporadic exchanges of fire with Israeli forces. Israel, meanwhile, has vowed to secure its northern border and protect its citizens from Hezbollah's rocket attacks.</p>

<h2><strong>Hezbollah's Leadership in Crisis</strong></h2>

<p>Hezbollah's leadership has faced major setbacks in recent weeks. In late September, Israel killed its leader Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike on Beirut. Nasrallah had led Hezbollah since 1992 and was widely considered one of the most powerful figures in Lebanon. His death marked a blow to the group, but Israeli strikes did not stop there. In October, Israel launched another bombing campaign in Beirut, targeting Hashem Safieddine, a senior Hezbollah figure widely believed to be Nasrallah's successor.</p>

<p>While Hezbollah has not confirmed Safieddine's death, Netanyahu seemed to suggest in his video address that both Nasrallah and Safieddine had been killed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Netanyahu in his address said Israel has "degraded Hezbollah's capabilities; we took out thousands of terrorists, including [longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah himself, and Nasrallah's replacement, and his replacement's replacement."</p>

<p>"We struck Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters in Beirut... this is the headquarters of the head of the intelligence division, Abu Abdullah Mortada," IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said. "With him, we know that Hashem Safieddine was there. The results of this strike are still being looked into, Hezbollah is trying to hide the details. When we know, we will update the public."</p>

<h2><strong>Israel's Strategy</strong></h2>

<p>Having already targeted strongholds in southern and eastern Lebanon, Israel's latest moves signal a shift towards the coastal areas, with civilians being urged to evacuate. On its Telegram channel, the Israeli military confirmed that the 146th Division had begun "localised, targeted operational activities" in southwestern Lebanon, directly aimed at Hezbollah infrastructure.</p>

<p>The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have not spared Beirut, with strikes targeting Hezbollah's stronghold in the southern suburbs of the city. This area is a key base of operations for Hezbollah. Israel has since dismantled Hezbollah tunnels leading into Israeli territory.</p>

<p>Hezbollah Remains Defiant</p>

<p>Despite these losses, Hezbollah remains defiant. Its deputy leader Naim Qassem declared that the group's military capabilities were intact and that they were prepared for a protracted conflict. Qassem's statement came even as Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant described Hezbollah as a "broken organisation," whose leadership had been decimated following the elimination of Nasrallah.</p>

<p>Gallant said the impact of Israel's strikes, claiming that Hezbollah's command structure was in disarray and that the group lacked leadership following the death of Nasrallah and other key figures. He also described Hezbollah's firepower capabilities as significantly diminished, thanks to Israel's focused military campaign. However, Hezbollah continues to maintain its presence along the Lebanese border.</p>

<h2><strong>The Shadow of Iran</strong></h2>

<p>This conflict is not limited to Israel and Hezbollah. The group is widely believed to be backed by Iran, which supplies it with weapons, funding, and political support. Israeli forces have clashed with Iran-backed militias across the region, including in Syria and Yemen. Just this week, an Israeli airstrike in Damascus targeted a building used by Iran's Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollah, killing seven civilians, according to Syrian government reports.</p>

<p>Israel has also accused Hezbollah of using civilian areas as shields for their military operations, a tactic that has drawn widespread condemnation. Hezbollah, in turn, has pointed to the heavy civilian toll in Gaza as evidence of Israel's indiscriminate use of force. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is dire, with nearly all of its 2.4 million residents displaced at least once due to the ongoing Israeli bombardment.</p>

<p>Tehran has long been a key backer of Hezbollah. In recent weeks, however, there have been reports that Iran may be seeking a ceasefire in Lebanon, possibly as a result of Hezbollah's mounting losses.</p>

<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi visited Beirut on Friday, voicing support for a ceasefire, but insisted that any agreement would have to be backed by Hezbollah.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Matthew Richardson, 36, faces five to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine when he's sentenced on Dec. 19. The plea agreement was reached in August.</p>

<p>Richardson's attorney and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of New York, which prosecuted the case, declined to comment until after sentencing.</p>

<p>Richardson's case was cited in a Reuters investigation in July about complaints to police that child sex abuse material was featured on OnlyFans.</p>

<p>Richardson was arrested at a highway rest stop in Ohio in Dec. 2022 after running off with the New York teen. The two had met at a grocery store and began a sexual relationship. Soon after, Richardson recorded himself having sex with the girl. On Nov. 9, 2022, he posted the child sexual abuse video on his OnlyFans account under the pseudonym Skylar Ravenwood, according to plea documents filed in the case.</p>

<p>"It was a nightmare," a relative of the girl told Reuters, which is withholding the person's name to protect the teen's identity. "She's still not doing good."</p>

<p>The Reuters investigation identified 30 complaints in U.S. police and court records that child sexual abuse material appeared on OnlyFans between December 2019 and June 2024. The investigation cited more than 200 explicit videos and images of kids on the site, including some adults having oral sex with toddlers.</p>

<p>OnlyFans did not comment on Richardson's case. His OnlyFans account remained available on the platform for more than a year and a half after he posted the underage sex video. As of mid-June, the video featuring the girl appeared to have been removed. The account was shut down after Reuters asked OnlyFans about the case.</p>

<p>OnlyFans says no children are allowed on its website and that it vets all content and swiftly removes and reports any child sexual abuse material. The company also says it can deactivate accounts that violate its rules.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris has taken a slim lead over Donald Trump in the US presidential race, a new poll showed Tuesday, as the Democrat slammed her rival for "weakness" during a media blitz four weeks before the election.</p>

<p>Vice President Harris and Republican former president Trump -- who was doing a three-hit airwaves blitz of his own Tuesday -- are deadlocked as they scramble to get out the vote and reach the sliver of Americans who remain undecided.</p>

<p>The national poll conducted by Siena College and The New York Times found Harris ahead by 49 percent to 46 percent, with registered voters crediting her more than Trump with representing change and caring about people like themselves, but giving the edge to Trump on who is the stronger leader.</p>

<p>The rivals were tied at 47 percent in a mid-September Times/Siena poll shortly after the two clashed in their presidential debate.</p>

<p>The overall result is largely in line with an aggregate of national polling collated by RealClearPolitics.com, which has Harris ahead by two percentage points.</p>

<p>In the seven battleground states seen as likely to determine the election outcome, the race is even tighter.</p>

<p><strong>- Losing sleep -</strong></p>

<p>With Trump critics warning the election is nothing less than a referendum on American democracy, Harris conceded the knife-edge race is keeping her up at night.</p>

<p>"I literally lose sleep -- and have been -- over what is at stake in this election," she told radio icon Howard Stern in a 70-minute live interview Tuesday.</p>

<p>"This is an election that is about strength versus weakness, and weakness as projected by someone who puts himself in front of the American people and does not have the strength to stand in defense of their needs, their dreams, their desires."</p>

<p>Harris, the new poll showed, has begun making inroads with the rival party, with nine percent of Republicans saying they planned to support her, up from five percent last month.</p>

<p>She touched on the issue during a Tuesday appearance on popular ABC television show "The View," where she talked about campaigning recently with Republican former congresswoman Liz Cheney.</p>

<p>There are more than 200 former officials from past Republican presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush, as well as officials tied to Republican heavyweights John McCain and Mitt Romney, who have endorsed her, Harris said.</p>

<p>"We really are building a coalition around some very fundamental issues, including that we love our country and that we have to put country before party," she said.</p>

<p>The Democrat, who turns 60 next week, also accused Trump of "full-time perpetuating lies and misinformation," and said voters have grown "exhausted" with the strategy.</p>

<p>Trump meanwhile maintained his aggressive posture, attacking Harris as a "very low intelligence person" and claiming she has been "missing in action" over the federal response to Hurricane Helene -- even though Harris traveled to the disaster zone last week.</p>

<p>And the 78-year-old Republican insisted on conservative influencer Ben Shapiro's podcast that he has the stamina to finish strong on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>"I've worked about 28 days in a row, I have about 29 days left" before the election, he said, "and I'm not taking any days off."</p>

<p>In addition to the poll, Harris got another potential boost Tuesday after a pro-Palestinian group threatening to draw votes from her in swing state Michigan came out strongly against Trump.</p>

<p>The Uncommitted movement stopped short of explicitly endorsing Harris, but warned in a video that "it can get worse" under Trump.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon is "on the verge of an all-out war", but there is still time to stop, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said.</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters at the UN headquarters in New York, Guterres said on Tuesday that the Middle East "is a powder keg with many parties holding the match".</p>

<p>"I have warned for months of the risks of the conflict spreading," said the UN chief, adding that the situation in the occupied West Bank is "boiling over," and attacks in Lebanon are threatening the entire region.</p>

<p>He said that over the last few days, exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and others in Lebanon and the Israel Defense Forces have intensified across the Blue Line, in total disregard of Security Council resolutions 1701 and 1559, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Guterres noted that large-scale Israeli strikes deep into Lebanon, including Beirut, have killed more than 2,000 people over the last year -- and 1,500 in just the past two weeks alone, and attacks by Hezbollah and others south of the Blue Line have killed at least 49 people over the last year. In addition, Lebanese authorities report over 1 million people have been displaced in Lebanon, and 300,000 people have fled into Syria, while over 60,000 people remain displaced from northern Israel.</p>

<p>"We are on the verge of an all-out war in Lebanon, with already devastating consequences. But there is still time to stop," he said.</p>

<p>"The sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected," he stressed.</p>

<p>The secretary-general commended the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, for continuing "to carry out their mandates to the extent possible," and called on all actors to ensure their safety and security.</p>

<p>Guterres said the past year "has been a year of crises -- humanitarian crisis, political crisis, diplomatic crisis, and a moral crisis," and "the nightmare in Gaza is now entering an atrocious, abominable second year."</p>

<p>Over the last year, following the attacks by Hamas on October 7, 2023, "Gaza has become ground zero to a level of human suffering that is hard to fathom," with over 41,000 Palestinians reportedly killed, mostly women and children, and thousands more missing, he said.</p>

<p>"Virtually the entire population has been displaced -- and no part of Gaza has been spared," said Guterres. "No place is safe in Gaza and no one is safe."</p>

<p>He underscored that international law is unambiguous: "Civilians everywhere must be respected and protected, and their essential needs must be met, including through humanitarian assistance," and strongly condemned all violations of international humanitarian law in Gaza.</p>

<p>The UN chief reiterated the calls for an immediate ceasefire both in Gaza and Lebanon, the immediate and unconditional release of hostages, and immediate lifesaving aid to all those who desperately need it, and the calls for irreversible action for a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Afghan man was arrested in Oklahoma for allegedly plotting an election day "terrorist attack," the U.S. Department of Justice said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The man, Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, living in Oklahoma City after entering the U.S. in 2021 on a special immigrant visa, was plotting the attack in the name of Islamic State, according to the indictment.</p>

<p>Tawhedi searched online for information on how to access cameras in the capital, Washington, D.C., and for states that did not require a license to get a firearm, according to the indictment. He also visited the White House and Washington Monument webcameras.</p>

<p>Tawhedi and an underage co-conspirator were arrested on Monday after they met with FBI assets to buy two AK-47 rifles and ammunition. In his post-arrest interview, Tawhedi said the attack planned to target large gatherings of people, during which he and his co-conspirator expected to die as martyrs.</p>

<p>"We will continue to combat the ongoing threat that ISIS and its supporters pose to America's national security, and we will identify, investigate, and prosecute the individuals who seek to terrorize the American people," U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.</p>

<p>Last week, in a "homeland threat assessment," the Department of Homeland Security said the U.S. threat environment was expected to remain high in the coming year due to factors like the 2024 election cycle and the Israel's war in Gaza.</p>

<p>"Lone offenders and small groups continue to pose the greatest threat. Meanwhile, foreign terrorist organizations, including the Islamic State and al Qaeda maintain their enduring intent to conduct or inspire attacks in the Homeland," the department said in an assessment released on Oct. 2.</p>

<p>The Islamic State militant organization killed and executed thousands of people in the name of its extreme religious interpretation before it was territorially defeated in Iraq in 2017 and Syria in 2019.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

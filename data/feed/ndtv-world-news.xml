       <description><![CDATA[An American Airlines flight from Buenos Aires to New York was forced to return after a strange "banging noise" at 30,000 feet, sparking fears of a possible person trapped in the cargo hold.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Armed police boarded an American Airlines flight after a strange "banging noise" was heard at 30,000 feet, forcing an unexpected return to Buenos Aires, according to <em>AviationSource News.</em> Flight 954 had taken off from Ezeiza International Airport in Buenos Aires at 9:15 pm Thursday, headed to New York with an estimated arrival of 6:50 am Friday. But while flying over Cordoba, the plane suddenly turned back to Buenos Aires for an emergency landing.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://avsn.co.uk/police-swarm-american-airlines-flight-after-noises-reported-from-cargo-hold/"><em>news reports,</em></a> passengers and crew heard sounds that resembled someone knocking from inside the cargo hold, raising concerns that someone might be trapped there. Initially, the pilot told passengers the plane was returning due to a technical issue but later suggested it was possible a person was in the cargo area, which is typically sealed and not meant for live cargo.</p>

The operation also involved personnel from the National Civil Aviation Administration, PFA firefighters, and medical support teams.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Muslim American voters in New York, like their counterparts nationwide, are increasingly prioritising the Gaza crisis in their voting decisions for the upcoming presidential election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the Islamic Cultural Centre located on Riverside Drive in New York City, hundreds of Muslims from in and around the neighbourhood join the Friday prayers. One of the main 'dua' made after the prayer is for the people of Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ali, a corporate professional, is a regular worshipper here, particularly on Fridays. He says the international issues are overshadowing the domestic concerns of the community in the November 5 presidential elections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There are plenty of issues, but I don't think anything comes close to what we are seeing in Gaza. There is a large part of the Muslim community that isn't feeling comfortable with the words and the actions of the candidates," he said.</p>

<p>"The mainstream position in the Democratic Party seems to be words and actions that are in fear of upsetting the pro-Israel side. That lack of compassion and empathy is very disheartening, I must say," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this presidential election, Muslims in New York grapple with a complex political landscape. The community seems to be weighing their concerns on both domestic and international issues.</p>

<p>The situation in Gaza is among the top issues that the members of this influential voting bloc have been concerned with. Several of them clearly voice their disappointment on how the democratic government has dealt with the West Asia situation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"For us, the Gaza situation is very important. The war must end, and we don't see the current dispensation doing much around it. There are other issues like abortion rights and even LGBTQ that concern, but Gaza is right now the most concerning," says Waqas, a resident of Long Island in New York.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A recent survey conducted in three swing states (Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Michigan) by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU) found that the war on Gaza is a top policy concern for the majority of Muslim voters (61 per cent). It also noted this to be the top issue for Muslims across all genders, ages, races, and partisan lines.</p>

<p>Muslim American voters in New York, like their counterparts nationwide, are increasingly prioritising the Gaza crisis in their voting decisions for the upcoming presidential election. It would not be very far-fetched to say the devastating conflict has become a defining issue and has the potential to reshape traditional voting patterns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Council on American-Islamic Relations said in a recent post on X that American Muslims will make a "substantial impact" on the elections. "Our community is engaged. Now is the time to show the strength of American Muslim voices in this crucial election," the post said.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Biden slammed Harris' rival, former Republican President Donald Trump, and his supporters on policy issues during a speech in Scranton.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden returned to his birthplace in Pennsylvania, making a final campaign stop Saturday for Vice President Kamala Harris and again let loose - offering the kind of unfiltered political sentiments that have become fairly common in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Biden slammed Harris' rival, former Republican President Donald Trump, and his supporters on policy issues during a speech in Scranton, but then suggested that he'd hit back - literally - on faux "macho guys."</p>

<p>"There's one more thing Trump and his Republican friends want to do. They want to have a giant tax cut for the wealthy," Biden told the local chapter of the carpenters union. Then, apparently referencing people backing Trump, he added, "Now, I know some of you guys are tempted to think it's macho guys."</p>

<p>"I tell you what, man, when I was in Scranton, we used to have a little trouble going down the plot once in a while," Biden continued. "These are the kind of guys you'd like to smack in the ass."</p>

<p>During a rally later Saturday night in North Carolina, Trump poked fun at Biden, asking the crowd, "I don't even know, is he still around?"</p>

<p>Biden's comment in Scranton drew laughs from the crowd. But it was another moment of his veering off political script, something that's now happening frequently with the president - even though he has played a decidedly limited role in promoting Harris, making few campaign stops for his onetime running mate.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Biden sparked an uproar by responding to racist comments at a recent Trump rally made by the comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who referred to the U.S. island territory of Puerto Rico as a "floating island of garbage."</p>

<p>"The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters," Biden said in response.</p>

<p>White House press officials altered the official transcript of Biden's remarks, drawing objections from federal workers who transcribe what the president says for posterity, according to two U.S. government officials and an internal email obtained by The Associated Press.</p>

<p>And the reference to "garbage" followed Biden - during a recent stop at a campaign office in New Hampshire - saying of Trump, "We've got to lock him up" before quickly amending his comments to note he meant that Democrats need to "politically lock him up."</p>

<p>Biden's Saturday remarks come at a moment when gender issues and diverging partisan loyalties between men and women have emerged as a top feature of the campaign.</p>

<p>Trump has pushed masculine tropes in a bid to garner more male voters throughout his campaign. He's supported a return to traditional gender roles and leaned into themes like " protecting women " whether they "like it or not" in the campaign's closing days.</p>

<p>Harris has taken a far different approach, pledging to protect access to abortion and increase government spending to help families cover the costs of housing and childcare.</p>

<p>Though he spent decades as a senator from Delaware, Biden spent his early childhood in Scranton and Saturday's event was a homecoming for the sidelined president in several ways. He spoke at the same union hall he visited on Election Day in 2020</p>

<p>"Let them know how important this election is," Biden told the crowd of about 200 enthusiastic supporters. When he noted, "I'm nothing special," one audience member shouted back, "Sure you are," sparking chants of "Thank you, Joe."</p>

<p>The president exhorted attendees to vote "for yourself and your families, people you grew up with, the people you come from."</p>

<p>"Don't forget where you come from," Biden thundered to shouts and applause. "Don't leave behind the people you grew up with."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taiwan said it detected 37 Chinese fighter jets, drones and other aircraft near the self-ruled island on Sunday as Beijing carried out "long-distance" training flights.</p>

<p>China has ramped up military activity around Taiwan in recent years as Beijing pressures Taipei to accept its claims of sovereignty over the island.</p>

<p>The Chinese aircraft were spotted from 9:00 am (0100 GMT) and 35 of them crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait, which separates mainland China and Taiwan, and entered Taiwanese airspace on their way to the Western Pacific Ocean, the defence ministry said.</p>

<p>Taiwan's military responded by deploying aircraft, naval vessels and shore-based missile systems, the ministry said.</p>

<p>The exercise came a day after Taiwan said it had detected a Chinese military "joint combat readiness patrol" around the island involving fighter jets and warships.</p>

<p>Taiwan spotted 27 Chinese aircraft and six warships in the 24 hours to 6:00 am on Sunday, the ministry said earlier.</p>

<p>China considers Taiwan part of its territory and has refused to rule out the use of force to bring the democratic island under its control.</p>

<p>Beijing held large-scale military drills around Taiwan last month, which were condemned by Taipei and its key backer the United States.</p>

<p>The Chinese military conducted long-distance training flights in late September, the ministry said previously, when Beijing also fired an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Makhija said it is very important that the next US president understands that India is a very crucial partner for the US in many ways.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The India-US partnership is the most important engagement globally and the cooperation will flourish further if Kamala Harris becomes the US president as she recognises the significance of the relationship, prominent Indian-origin Democratic leader Neil Makhija has said.</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview with PTI, the young leader, considered to be close to Harris, also came down very hard on former president Donald Trump for his immigration policy that has triggered some concerns among immigrant communities in the US, including Indian-Americans.</p>

<p>On the India-US partnership, Makhija said it is the most important relationship for the future.</p>

<p>"When you think about the competition the US has been having with China, when you think about the actions that Russia is taking which are at odds with the interests of the US and its allies, India is really the most important country for the US to continue to build the relationship in terms of its sheer size, economic activities," he said.</p>

<p>Makhija said it is very important that the next US president understands that India is a very crucial partner for the US in many ways.</p>

<p>"When it comes to global priorities like our defence, tackling global issues like climate change. The US and India can lead the way if they work together. So we need a president who recognises that and Kamala Harris is that person," he said.</p>

<p>Makhija called Trump a threat to democracy.</p>

<p>"He is engaging in the same kind of behaviour we have seen in some of the darkest moments in world history where leaders have scapegoated those individuals and communities that do not even have the right to vote," he said.</p>

<p>Makhija is presently serving as Montgomery County Commissioner and Chair of the Board of Elections. He is the first Indian American Commissioner elected in the history of Pennsylvania and many Democrats believe that the young leader could be in Harris' cabinet if she wins the election.</p>

<p>"You can see that he (Trump) is blaming all of the country's problems on immigrants and it is not real, it is not realistic, it is simply aimed at inflaming tensions and driving divisions among people who live here in the US," he said.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately history does repeat itself. Hopefully, the people of our country recognise what happened in the past and we avoid a similar fate in the future," he added.</p>

<p>In his campaign speeches, Trump promised a radical shift to tighten Washington's immigration policy and vowed to stage the "largest deportation operation in American history" if he is reelected.</p>

<p>The Republican leader has even resolved to end birthright citizenship for the children of immigrants living in the US illegally, triggering concerns among various diaspora communities including from Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.</p>

<p>Makhija also appeared to hold the Republican Party responsible for not increasing the cap on H1B visas for Indians.</p>

<p>"Kamala Harris was the sponsor of a bill to fix that issue of H1B backlog when she was the senator. The problem was that the Republicans did not support it and they used to say that they were in favour of legal immigration," he said.</p>

<p>"But now it is clear that they do not want any immigration and they do not support immigration reform. They do not support any of the bills that would give people who live here, work here and pay taxes a real pathway to citizenship," Makhija added.</p>

<p>Describing the November 5 presidential election as very significant for the US, he said the country is at the crossroads.</p>

<p>"On the one hand, we have a candidate who is protecting democracy and fundamental freedoms. Then we have a candidate who represents the past and wants to turn back the clock to a time before anyone from our community was here in the US. Who wants to turn back the clock on fundamental rights," he said.</p>

<p>"Their (Trump camp's) belief is that the country is supposed to be a specific demographic region. We think America is an idea, we think America is an idea that anyone can succeed no matter who you are," Makhija said.</p>

<p>"This is the decision that we are making which is -- do we have a country which is pluralistic, that is welcoming, that is inclusive or do we think it should be exclusive and really meant to serve a particular demography?" he said.</p>

<p>"I think Kamala Harris represents the future that is more inclusive, that will be welcoming and lives up to the ideals that our country truly was founded on," Makhija added.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/justin-trudeau" target="_blank">Justin Trudeau </a>has shared clips of his Diwali celebrations on Sunday amid ongoing diplomatic tensions between India and the North American nation.</p>

<p>“Happy Diwali! So many special moments shared celebrating with the community this week,” Trudeau wrote in a post on X. In a video shared online, Trudeau is seen getting religious threads tied on his wrist, gifted from three Hindu temples in Canada.</p>

<p>“I got these bracelets when I was in three different Hindu temples over the past few months. They are good luck,” he remarked, adding that the threads would provide him with “protection.”</p>

<p>“I'm not taking them off till they fall off,” the Canadian Prime Minister wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was also offered a plate of jalebis, which he joked saying he would “save for the team.”&nbsp;</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Earlier, on October 31, Trudeau had extended Diwali greetings to Canadians.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Today, we join millions of people in Canada and around the world to celebrate Diwali,” he said in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/statements/2024/10/31/statement-prime-minister-justin-trudeau-diwali " rel="nofollow,noindex">statement</a>. He acknowledged the contributions of the Indo-Canadian community, saying, “Diwali in Canada would not be possible without our incredible Indo-Canadian community. Indo-Canadians represent the best of Canada – as artists and entrepreneurs, as doctors and teachers, as leaders in business, community, and culture. On Diwali, we celebrate them and the light they carry across Canada's communities.” Trudeau further noted the significance of Diwali to Hindu Canadians, highlighting that it is one of Canada's largest and most diverse diasporas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amid these festive sentiments, the <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/wanted-canada-to-extradite-bishnoi-gang-members-india-on-diplomatic-row-6810487 ">diplomatic tensions between India and Canada</a> continue to escalate. Since September 2023, relations have deteriorated following Prime Minister Trudeau's public accusation that India was involved in Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing, a claim India has vehemently denied. Indian officials have reiterated that there is “no shred of evidence” linking the Indian government to the incident. In light of these ongoing tensions, India withdrew six of its diplomats from Canada due to safety concerns, leading to Canada responding in kind.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli naval commandos have seized a trainee mariner a military official described as a "senior operative" of Hezbollah in a raid in Lebanon and brought him to Israel for questioning.</p>

<p>Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati instructed the foreign ministry to submit a complaint to the UN Security Council over the raid on the coastal town of Batroun, his office said on Saturday.</p>

<p>The Lebanese army and UN peacekeeping force UNIFIL are both conducting investigations into the raid, Mikati's office said, adding that he had called for "expedited" results.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First reported by Lebanese sources before an Israeli military official confirmed the military's involvement, the raid was the first of its kind since the Israel-Hezbollah war erupted in September.</p>

<p>"A senior operative of Hezbollah, who serves as an expert in his field, was apprehended," the Israeli military official said. "The operative has been transferred to Israeli territory and is currently being investigated."</p>

<p>Lebanon's state-run National News agency said an "unidentified military force" carried out a "sea landing" on the shore of Batroun, south of Tripoli, at dawn on Friday.</p>

<p>The force "went with all its weapons and equipment to a chalet near the beach, kidnapping a Lebanese man... and sailing away into the open sea on a speedboat".</p>

<p>An acquaintance of the abductee identified him as a student at the state-run Maritime Sciences and Technology Institute (MARSATI) in Batroun, Lebanon's primary training college for the shipping industry.</p>

<p>He was taken from student housing near the institute, but was a resident of the Shiite-majority town of Qmatiyeh further south, said the acquaintance, who spoke on condition of anonymity for security concerns.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Celebrity squirrel Peanut, who had been a beloved companion to owner Mark Longo for seven years, was recently euthanised along with a raccoon found in Mr Longo's care. The decision by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) was made after a government worker was bitten by Peanut, leading to concerns over potential rabies exposure. As we remember Peanut, it's a fitting time to celebrate other beloved celebrity animals that have captured our hearts over the years, from Kabosu, the bitcoin dog, to Moo Deng the Hippo.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korean state media released a white paper on Sunday accusing South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol of exposing his country to the danger of nuclear war through his policies toward the North.</p>

<p>The document, compiled by North Korea's Institute of Enemy State Studies and released by state news agency KCNA, criticized Yoon's "reckless remarks" about war, abandoning elements of an inter-Korean agreement, engaging in nuclear war planning with the United States, and seeking closer ties with Japan and NATO.</p>

<p>"Its ever-worsening military moves resulted only in the paradoxical consequences of pushing (North Korea) to stockpile its nuclear weapons at an exponential rate and further develop its nuclear attack capability," the paper said.</p>

<p>Yoon, a conservative, has taken a hard line on North Korea, which has forged ahead with developing its arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions.</p>

<p>His administration blames North Korea for raising tensions with weapons tests and providing military aid and troops to aid Russia's war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Pyongyang has been taking steps to sever inter-Korean ties, redefining the South as a separate, hostile enemy state, since Kim Jong Un declared it a "primary foe" early this year and said unification was no longer possible.</p>

<p>North Korea blew up sections of inter-Korean roads and rail lines on its side of the heavily fortified border between the two Koreas last month, and satellite imagery shows it has since built large trenches across the former crossings.</p>

<p>The two Koreas are still technically at war after their 1950-53 war ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.</p>

<p>The two Koreas have also clashed over balloons of trash floated since May from North Korea. Pyongyang has said the launches are a response to balloons sent by anti-regime activists in the South.</p>

<p>Sunday's white paper also listed Yoon's domestic political woes, including scandals involving his wife, which have driven his approval ratings to record lows.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Pakistan-based company has issued an apology after mistakenly advertising a non-existent Halloween parade in Dublin, Ireland. According to <em>The Guardian</em>, the error, attributed to a "human mistake", led to thousands of people turning up on the Irish capital's main street on Thursday, awaiting the event. A viral video showed throngs of people lining both sides of O'Connell Street for a supposed procession of giant Halloween puppets made by one of Ireland's best-known theatre groups, the Galway performance company Macnas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sharing the video on X, filmmaker Bertie Brosnan said, "The SCAM Halloween Parade in Dublin City Centre (everyone was ghosted ) Definitely thousands, potentially into 10's of thousands, showed up. This happened on the 31st of October from 7pm at the top of O'Connell Street in Dublin City."</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/02/pakistan-firm-apologises-for-directing-dubliners-to-nonexistent-halloween-event#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20are%20highly%20embarrassed%20and,to%20be%20based%20in%20Pakistan." rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>The Guardian</em></a>, the crowds had turned up to see the event which was listed on the My Spirit Halloween website. It falsely advertised that the Macnas parade would take place between 7pm and 9pm on Thursday. However, when the crowds reached the location, Dublin police started to disperse then saying that no such event was taking place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The company behind the website later clarified that it was a simple human error. It explained that a member of their team had mistakenly copied the notice for last year's event and inserted it into this year's calendar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The website aggregates content all over the world. The misleading information had gone viral on social media and even ranked highly in Google searches ahead of Halloween.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>The Guardian</em> reported that the Pakistan-based man behind the site has since apologised saying he was "depressed" and "embarrassed". "We are highly embarrassed and highly depressed, and very sorry," Nazir Ali said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It was our mistake and we should have doubled checked it to make sure it was happening. But newspapers are reporting that we posted it intentionally and this is very, very wrong," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The error, however, has sparked a discussion about the dangers of misinformation and AI deepfakes. On social media, one user said that she laughed at the "ake parade story, however, she added that it showed "how easy it is to spread misinformation".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is just halloween, now think of how many people are fed with misinformation online on other issues," said another user.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"That was quite funny, but all of a sudden when that becomes something a little bit more serious and people are putting out AI images of me, for example, saying something that I would never say contrary to my own values, that's something that's not too far off the horizon," said Gary Gannon, who is a member of parliament.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Trump has targeted cities like Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Atlanta, referring to them as “cesspools of blood, as per a New York Times report.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the United States Presidential election just two days away, Republican candidate Donald Trump's rhetoric has taken a sharp turn, focussing on what he sees as the decline of urban areas, particularly those with large immigrant populations.</p>

<p>As per a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/02/us/politics/trump-places-quotes.html " rel="nofollow,noindex">New York Times</a> report, Trump has targeted cities like Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Atlanta, referring to them as “cesspools of blood.” He also characterised urban centres as “war zones” and “killing fields.”</p>

<p>The NY Times looked at public statements made by Trump from November 15, 2022, to October 29, 2024, using transcripts from CQ Roll Call's Factbase, which tracks statements from President Joe Biden and other presidential candidates.</p>

<p>The former President's list of critiques extends to multiple Californian cities, which he has described as “war zones and ganglands.” Specific cities like San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland and Los Angeles have been labelled as “war zones,” while others like Baltimore have been referred to as “dangerous.”</p>

<p>Trump's statements about cities in the Northeast, Midwest, and South reflect a similar tone. He has described New Orleans as a “war zone,” Washington, D.C., as a “hellhole,” and Chicago as a “war zone,” among others. His remarks about Minneapolis were equally harsh, saying it resembled “a fire pit.”</p>

<p>In stark contrast, Trump praised areas that align with his political base, especially in red states. He referred to states like Indiana, Iowa, and Idaho as “states that you don't even hear too much of because they're so good and so well run.” His admiration extended to Montana, which he described as “the land of cowboys and cattle hands ... one of the most beautiful places in all of God's creation,” and Alaska, which he called “an incredible place and beautiful state.”</p>

<p>Trump is often seen reminiscing about the beauty of places that he feels have deteriorated. For instance, he remarked on Aurora, Colorado, and Springfield, Ohio, saying, “These were two beautiful, successful towns, idyllic. And they're in trouble, big trouble.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>He expressed similar sentiments about Detroit, labelling it as a “once great city,” and described New York City as a “city in decline.”&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a follow-up tweet, Musk posted an AI generated image of Peanut as <em>Star Wars</em> character Obi-Wan Kenobi, holding a lightsaber. “If you strike me down, I will become more powerful than you could possibly imagine,” he tweeted, adding, “Obi PNut Kenobi.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/new-york-authorities-euthanise-instagram-squirrel-star-6927159 ">Peanut the squirrel</a>, who lived with New Yorker Mark Longo for seven years, charmed fans worldwide with his endearing antics, often captured in videos and photos on his Instagram account, @peanut_the_squirrel12.</p>

<p>Peanut's journey to social media stardom began after Mr Longo rescued him as a baby, finding him after his mother had been struck by a car. Mr Longo bottle-fed Peanut and initially attempted to release him into the wild. But the squirrel returned and stayed with Mr Longo, eventually becoming a social media sensation with fans across the globe who followed his waffle-eating, costume-wearing escapades.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) and Chemung County Health Department reported that both Peanut and a raccoon found in Mark Longo's care were euthanised to test for rabies after a government worker was bitten by Peanut. The DEC indicated that both animals were illegally possessed and cited the risk of human rabies exposure as the reason for the euthanasia.</p>

<p>In an emotional post on Instagram, Mr Longo blamed the authorities and certain individuals who, he claimed, reported Peanut out of spite. “Internet, you WON,” Mr Longo wrote. “To the group of people who called (the DEC), there's a special place in hell for you.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Here are key moments from the US election campaigns as candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris edge toward election day on Tuesday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Courts, bullets and two dramatic debates have made their mark on this year's US election campaign -- one of the most extraordinary in the nation's history.</p>

<p>Here are key moments as candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris edge towards Election Day on Tuesday.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump the felon</strong></h3>

<p>"Trump Guilty," is splashed across the world's front pages. On May 30 the Republican becomes the first former US president to be convicted of felony crimes -- 34 counts to be exact.</p>

<p>He is found to have falsified business records to hide a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels on the eve of his 2016 election win, so that she would not publicize their alleged sexual encounter.</p>

<p>In the explosive six-week trial, Daniels shares excruciating details about their apparent one-night stand, including the sex position and Trump's silky pajamas.</p>

<p>The ordeal pulls him from the campaign trail, but huge media attention ensures he keeps the spotlight -- even if it is on his criminality.</p>

<p>Nothing in US law prevents Trump from running for the White House after the guilty verdict, and Republicans double down their unwavering support for the party standard-bearer, who still faces three other criminal cases.</p>

<h3><strong>Debate drama</strong></h3>

<p>Democratic hopes appear shattered after President Joe Biden, the party's presumptive nominee, delivers a disastrous debate performance against Trump on June 27.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old fumbles his words and often appears to forget what he is saying, bolstering fears that he is not fit to run again for president.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biden brushes it off as a "bad night" but dissenters say otherwise, with donors threatening to pull funding if he does not step aside.</p>

<p>Post-debate polling shows Trump pulling away from Biden but the White House insists there is zero chance he will withdraw.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Assassination attempt</strong></h3>

<p>A sun-baked Trump rally in Pennsylvania on July 13 provides the election campaign's most shocking moment yet.</p>

<p>Popping sounds ring out, Trump touches his ear, sees blood, and drops to the stage floor. Secret Service officers surround him as screams ring out in the crowd.</p>

<p>Within seconds Trump is helped back to his feet. "Fight, fight, fight!" he mouths to a now cheering audience, raising his fist to create one of the most iconic images in US political history.</p>

<p>The gunman, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, is shot dead at the scene by the Secret Service, and Trump survives with a minor graze to his right ear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump's base is galvanized. "I took a bullet for democracy," he tells his supporters at a later rally.</p>

<h3><strong>Biden says 'bye'</strong></h3>

<p>At 1:46 pm on Sunday, July 21, Biden announces in a tweet that he will not seek reelection.</p>

<p>It makes him the first sitting president since 1968 not to seek reelection, and upends the White House race.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris, the first female, Black and Asian-American to serve as US vice president, gains Biden's endorsement to replace him in the campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Within two weeks she formally secures the Democratic nomination, making her the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris re-energizes Democrats and delivers immediate results in opinion polls by clawing back Trump's gains, including in the election-deciding swing states.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Trump's second scare</strong></h3>

<p>Trump's weekend round of golf in Florida on September 15 is shattered by the sound of gunshots -- this time fired by a Secret Service agent foiling what the FBI calls an apparent assassination attempt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Republican nominee is unharmed in the second such scare in two months.</p>

<p>Investigators say the gunman, Ryan Routh, did not shoot at Trump but instead fled when a security agent opened fire after seeing his rifle pointing through a tree line at the golf course.</p>

<h3><strong>The Harris surge</strong></h3>

<p>Within a few weeks, Harris hurtles from being a relatively unknown and unpopular vice president into a surging candidate on an unprecedentedly tight deadline.</p>

<p>A key moment in her campaign is her one and only debate with Trump on September 10. She is widely credited with besting Trump.</p>

<p>Their intense duel climaxes a week ahead of Election Day with big rallies.</p>

<p>For Trump, it's a packed crowd in New York's famed Madison Square Garden arena on October 27, an event quickly criticized for racist jokes, including one speaker's reference to Hispanic-majority Puerto Rico as "garbage."</p>

<p>Harris follows up on October 29 with the biggest crowd of her campaign -- tens of thousands of people -- on the National Mall outside the White House.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Francis Thomas Bacon invented the hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell a clean, high-efficiency power source that helped propel Apollo 11s historic moon landing in 1969.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly seven decades after revolutionising clean energy, British engineer Francis Thomas Bacon's groundbreaking work is set to be recognised with a blue plaque at his former residence in Little Shelford, Cambridgeshire. Mr Bacon, an Essex-born innovator, invented the hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell - a clean, high-efficiency power source - that helped propel Apollo 11's historic moon landing in 1969 and transformed energy research.</p>

<p>Mr Bacon's fuel cells, later named “Bacon Cells” by NASA, were instrumental in the Apollo missions, supplying secondary power that enabled astronauts to communicate, operate equipment, and even drink water generated by the cells. In a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/ws/av-embeds/articles/cjl31dzp43jo/p07h6gng/en-gb " rel="nofollow,noindex">1969 BBC interview</a>, Mr Bacon explained the device's significance: “Normally, in the course of time, a battery runs down and you've got to recharge it. Now, [with] this device, as long as you go on feeding hydrogen and oxygen into it, and you remove the water formed, it will go on generating power indefinitely – and the astronauts drink the water.”</p>

<p>His work earned high praise, with then-President Richard Nixon reportedly telling him, "Without you, Tom, we wouldn't have gotten to the moon."</p>

<p>The Cambridge-based charity Cambridge Past, Present &amp; Future is championing the plaque as a tribute to Mr Bacon's contributions, which continue to inspire sustainable energy research today.</p>

<p>Professor Sam Stranks of Cambridge University, an expert in energy materials and optoelectronics, emphasised the importance of Mr Bacon's vision. "He was a pioneer," said Mr Stranks, as per the Guardian. "Fuel cell technology was extremely important to the space program because as long as you can continuously supply the gases, you can keep producing electricity."</p>

<p>This efficient, adaptable power source was ideal for remote environments like outer space and has since influenced renewable energy innovations across sectors.</p>

<p>Fuel cells are experiencing renewed interest as a potential green energy source. Mr Stranks pointed out their relevance in modern applications, particularly in powering long-haul trucks, ships and remote facilities where conventional batteries would be impractically large and heavy.</p>

<p>Reflecting Mr Bacon's vision, he added, "I always hoped it would be used for driving vehicles about," and anticipated that "in a modified form, it is going to come."</p>

<p>Mr Bacon's interest in fuel cells began in 1932 after his studies in mechanical sciences at Cambridge. Inspired by the theoretical work of physicist William Grove, who explored the concept of fuel cells in 1839, Mr Bacon began his own experiments. He soon faced an ultimatum from his employer - either abandon the risky research or leave. Choosing the latter, Mr Bacon pursued his work at Cambridge University and then Marshall, a local engineering firm.</p>

<p>For years, he struggled to fund the project until, in 1962, NASA adopted his alkaline fuel cell for the Apollo program. A US company invested $100 million, a major breakthrough for Mr Bacon's once-overlooked invention.</p>

<p>Despite this success, Mr Bacon remained largely unknown outside the scientific community. Professor Clemens Kaminski of Cambridge University said, "British engineers have some of the most brilliant ideas, but turning those ideas into commercial successes is what then often fails, and Bacon faced this. Yet he persevered."</p>

<p>In recognition of his contributions, Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins personally thanked Mr Bacon, gifting him a signed photograph of Mr Armstrong's famous moonwalk.</p>

<p>Though Tom Bacon died in 1992, his legacy continues to inspire. Professor Stranks described him as "a visionary and an unsung hero," believing Mr Bacon's pioneering work on fuel cells still foreshadows today's clean energy efforts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Over 10,000 recordings showed that 95% of animals reacted more strongly to human sounds than lion roars, challenging the belief that animals would habituate to humans in non-hunting environments.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite lions' power, speed, and capacity for pack hunting, a recent study found that animals on the African savanna are more afraid of people than lions. Lions should be the most feared since they are the largest land predators and hunt in packs, according to conservation biologist Michael Clinchy of Western University in Canada.</p>

<p>"Normally, if you're a mammal, you're not going to die of disease or hunger. The thing that actually ends your life is going to be a predator, and the bigger you are, the bigger the predator that finishes you off," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1003161?">says co-author Michael Clinchy</a>, also a conservation biologist at Western University. "Lions are the biggest group-hunting land predator on the planet and thus ought to be the scariest, and so we're comparing the fear of humans versus lions to find out if humans are scarier than the scariest non-human predator."</p>

<p>But after studying more than 10,000 wildlife reaction recordings, scientists discovered that 95% of the animals were more afraid of human noises than lion roars. The idea that animals would grow acclimated to people if they weren't killed is refuted by this widespread and deeply ingrained fear of humans.</p>

<p>The research team from Western University played recordings of various sounds to animals at waterholes in South Africa's Greater Kruger National Park. Even in a protected area known for its large lion population, animals reacted more strongly to human sounds, showing humans are seen as a significant threat.</p>

<p>"We put the camera in a bear box, not because there are bears out in South Africa, but because of the hyenas and leopards that like to chew on them," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1003161?">says first author Liana Y Zanette</a>, a conservation biologist at Western University in Canada. "One night, the lion recording made this elephant so angry that it charged and just smashed the whole thing."</p>

<p>"I think the pervasiveness of the fear throughout the Savannah mammal community is a real testament to the environmental impact that humans have," says Zanette. "Not just through habitat loss and climate change and species extinction, which is all important stuff. But just having us out there on that landscape is enough of a danger signal that they respond really strongly. They are scared to death of humans, way more than any other predator."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>President Kamala Harris, who is the Democratic presidential candidate, in an op-ed on Saturday, recollected her frequent visit to India as a child, and her mother's mission to cure cancer.</p>

<p>"Growing up, my mother raised my sister and me to appreciate and honor our heritage. Nearly every other year, we would go to India for Diwali. We would spend time with our grandparents, our uncles, and our chitthis," Harris said in the op-ed for The Jaggernaut, an online South Asian publication.</p>

<p>"And as Vice President, it has been my honor to host Diwali celebrations in my home - the Vice President's Residence. Not only to celebrate the holiday, but to celebrate the rich history, culture, and heritage of the South Asian American diaspora, which is bound together by a shared sense of possibility and belief in the promise of America," she said.</p>

<p>In her op-ed published three days before the November 5th general elections, Harris wrote that as a 19-year-old, her mother Shyamala Harris crossed the world alone, traveling from India to the United States. "My mother had two goals in her life: to raise her two daughters, my sister Maya and me, and to cure breast cancer," she wrote.</p>

<p>"When I was little, when we traveled to India, we would also visit my grandfather, P.V. Gopalan, in what was then called Madras. My grandfather was a retired civil servant. His morning routine consisted of taking long walks on the beach with his retired buddies. I would join him on those walks and listen to stories about the importance of fighting for democracy and civil rights," she wrote.</p>

<p>"Throughout these walks, I recall my grandfather teaching me lessons about not just what it means to have a democracy but to keep a democracy. Those lessons first inspired my interest in public service. And they continue to guide me today - as Vice President and as a candidate for President of the United States," Harris said.</p>

<p>She said she believes Americans want a president who works for all the American people. "And that has been the story of my entire career," he said.</p>

<p>"South Asian Americans are often overlooked by our healthcare system, especially when it comes to heart health and diabetes. I worked with President Joe Biden to cap insulin prices for seniors at $35, and reduce drug costs. I will protect the Affordable Care Act and expand Medicare to cover home care for seniors. This is personal for me. When my mother had cancer, I helped take care of her and did everything I could to make her comfortable. I understand the burdens of caregiving and will work to ease them for your families," she wrote.</p>

<p>"With respect to fixing our broken immigration system, I reject the false choice between securing our border and creating a system of immigration that is orderly and humane. We can and must do both. The bipartisan border security bill I support does that. It will reduce illegal border crossings through strict enforcement, so that South Asian lives aren't endangered. I will partner with Democrats, Republicans, and independents to ensure we live up to our proud heritage as a nation of immigrants," she said.</p>

<p>"Our role in the world is also at stake in this election, and I will ensure that we strengthen, not abdicate, our global leadership. As Vice President, I have expanded our relationships with key South Asian partners, including India. And unlike Trump, who cozies up to tyrants and whose own national security officials have deemed 'dangerous' and 'unfit', I will never waver in defending America's security and ideals," she wrote.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump is an unserious man, but the consequences of him ever getting back into the White House are brutally serious. Trump and his extremist allies will cut Social Security and Medicare. His economic policies will drive inflation higher, and cause a recession by mid-2025. He intends to impose what I call a 'Trump sales tax' which is at least a 20% tax, if not more, on everyday necessities. Economists have estimated this will cost the American family an additional $4,000 a year," Harris wrote.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A 15-year-old boy in the UK who fatally stabbed a teenager in Birmingham city centre has been sentenced to life.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 15-year-old boy in the UK who fatally stabbed a teenager in Birmingham city centre has been sentenced to life. According to the <em>BBC</em>, 17-year-old Muhammad Hassam Ali died in hospital in January this year, hours after he and his friend were followed by two masked 15-year-old boys before he was attacked in Victoria Square. The youth, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was found guilty of murder and possessing a knife, and on Friday was given a minimum sentence of 13 years. The second 15-year-old, who was standing nearby, was found guilty of manslaughter and possessing a knife and was sentenced to five years' detention in secure accommodation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two boys didn't show any emotion as they were sentenced by Judge Mr Justice Garnham. Sentencing the pair, Mr Garnham said 17-year-old Ali's murder was "yet another illustration of the appalling consequences of carrying knives in public places". "It is perfectly clear to me (Ali) was a much-loved son and brother and his family have been left utterly devastated by his death," he said, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c704w1j0ezdo" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>BBC</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Separately, in a statement, Ali's family said, "We as a family still can't even bear to think about how he died, even writing the word murdered destroys a little bit of us again. The loss of Muhammad, or any child, is devastating and life-destroying, but the fact that someone has so brutally taken his life in such a horrific way will always haunt us."</p>

<p>The family continued that the teachers had commented on Ali's kindness towards others, while fellow classmates described him as chatty and friendly. "He dreamt of becoming an engineer and his passion was to work hard to achieve his goal. This dream will no longer come true, not for wanting to work hard but at the hands of another," they said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a trial earlier this year heard that the 17-year-old and his friend were simply sitting down, chatting about cricket over a hot chocolate and using their phones when they were approached by the two masked boys. The youths had followed them from Grand Central Shopping Centre before confronting Ali and his friend at Victoria Square.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The defendants wearing Covid-style masks had asked the pair if they knew who had "jumped a mate" of theirs a week before. This prompted a dispute, with Ali telling the pair he did not know what they were talking about. It was then that one of them pulled out a large knife and stabbed Ali in the chest before fleeing from the scene.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his evidence, the 15-year-old told the court that he only wanted to "scare" Ali and his friend and that he did not intend to seriously harm or kill anyone. He stated that he carried a knife when he went to busy places for protection as he had been attacked several times before and that he felt "regretful and upset" when he learned he had killed Ali.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other youth told the cops that he had been "shocked and crying" after the incident. He claimed that he did not know his friend had a knife on him until he produced it. He also said that he had never seen Ali r his friend before and only went along with the killer in case he "got battered".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Michael Ivers KC, representing the defendant, said he was remorseful and prays for Ali and his family regularly. He isn't a man who is in any sense proud of what happened. He truly, truly regrets what happened. If he could turn the clock back, not for his own sake but because of the impact it has had on others, he would," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has promised a "tooth-breaking" response to ongoing Israeli military actions.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has promised a "tooth-breaking" response to ongoing Israeli military actions. This statement follows a dramatic escalation, including an Israeli commando raid in Lebanon, and comes days before the US presidential election, with Washington as Israel's primary military supporter.</p>

<p>"The enemies, both the USA and the Zionist regime, should know that they will definitely receive a tooth-breaking response," he declared, referring to Iran-aligned groups across the Middle East, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and factions in Yemen and Syria.</p>

<p>Adding to these tensions, Kamal Kharrazi, a top advisor to Khamenei, alluded to Iran's nuclear potential, suggesting Iran may reconsider its nuclear policy if faced with an existential threat. "If an existential threat arises, Iran will modify its nuclear doctrine, we have the capability to build weapons and have no issue in this regard," Kharrazi told Lebanese media.</p>

<p>The latest confrontations began with an October 1 missile strike from Iran, which Israel answered with an October 26 bombing campaign targeting Iranian military installations, reportedly killing four Iranian soldiers. Israel claims the airstrikes inflicted significant damage on Iran's missile and air defence capacities, while Iran has vowed reprisal.</p>

<h2><strong>Commandos Target Hezbollah In Lebanon</strong></h2>

<p>In a separate operation, Israeli naval commandos seized a Hezbollah operative in Batroun, Lebanon. The captive, reportedly a senior operative undergoing maritime training, is now in Israeli custody.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A senior operative of Hezbollah, who serves as an expert in his field, was apprehended," the Israeli military said, as quoted by news agency AFP. "The operative has been transferred to Israeli territory and is currently being investigated."</p>

<p>Lebanese authorities, including Prime Minister Najib Mikati, have decried the raid, with Mikati instructing the foreign ministry to file a complaint with the United Nations. Both Lebanon's army and UN peacekeepers have launched investigations into the incident.</p>

<h2><strong>Humanitarian Crisis Intensifies In Gaza</strong></h2>

<p>As violence expands, conditions in Gaza deteriorate. The World Health Organisation (WHO) reported that a missile strike on a polio vaccination centre in north Gaza injured six people, including four children. WHO's Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, condemned the attack on Sheikh Radwan health centre as "extremely concerning."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel's military reported the deaths of dozens of militants in the Jabalia area as their operations persisted. Civilian casualties continue to mount, with Gaza's health ministry reporting over 43,000 deaths since hostilities resumed, though these figures are contested by Israeli sources.</p>

<h2><strong>Escalation On Israel's Northern Border</strong></h2>

<p>In Lebanon, Israeli airstrikes have intensified, killing nearly 2,000 people and displacing thousands, as Hezbollah retaliates with rocket fire into Israeli territory, including attacks on military sites near Haifa and Tel Aviv. In response, the US deployed B-52 bombers to the region, hoping to dissuade further escalation from Iran.</p>

<p>A US official warned Tehran that Washington might not be able to restrain Israel in the event of another Iranian strike. "We told the Iranians: We won't be able to hold Israel back," the official reportedly stated.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A significant scientific discovery has challenged the long-held notion that lifestyle variables such as diet and alcohol usage are the main causes of gout. The development of gout is significantly influenced by genetics, according to research from the University of Otago. They discovered particular genes that raise the risk of developing gout by examining the DNA of millions of people. This ground-breaking discovery casts doubt on the conventional wisdom of gout and creates new opportunities for creating more potent remedies and prophylactics.</p>

<p>The research that has been published in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-01921-5"><em>Nature Genetics</em></a> found inherited genetics is an important part of why some people get gout and most others don't.</p>

<p>Senior author Professor Tony Merriman, of Otago's Department of Microbiology and Immunology, hopes the findings will remove some of the stigma around gout.</p>

<p>"Gout is a chronic disease with a genetic basis and is not the fault of the sufferer-the myth that gout is caused by lifestyle or diet needs to be busted," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/news/newsroom/study-busts-myths-about-cause-of-gout">he said.</a></p>

<p>"This widespread myth causes shame in people with gout, making some people more likely to suffer in silence and not go and see the doctor to get a preventive drug that lowers urate in the blood and will prevent their pain.</p>

<p>"People need to understand that while specific dietary factors, such as eating red meat, can trigger gout attacks, the fundamental cause is high urate levels, crystals in the joints, and an immune system primed to 'attack' the crystals-genetics plays an important role in all of these processes."</p>

<p>The research identified a large number of immune genes and immune pathways that provide new targets and approaches for preventing gout attacks.</p>

<p><strong>What is gout?</strong></p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.footankleinstitute.com/conditions/arthritis/gout">Foot Ankle Institute,</a> gout is a type of arthritis that affects the musculoskeletal system, better known as your bones, joints, and muscles. It results from a buildup of uric acid in the joints. When there's an excess of uric acid in the blood, it crystalizes in the joints, usually the big toes. The most common gout symptoms include redness, tenderness, swelling, and pain.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian authorities announced a manhunt on Saturday after six convicts escaped their correctional facility through a secret tunnel.</p>

<p>Prison guards in the western Lipetsk region were alerted to their disappearance after carrying out a routine inspection.</p>

<p>"In general regime penal colony No. 2, an underground tunnel was discovered during a patrol of the premises," the prison service of the Lipetsk region said.</p>

<p>"Immediately a count of convicts got underway, which revealed the absence of six inmates," it added.</p>

<p>It did not reveal their identities, but said in a statement the suspects were "from Central Asia".</p>

<p>Temporary search posts have been set up, while local law enforcement have been alerted and are in hot pursuit.</p>

<p>"Measures are currently being taken to track down the persons who have escaped. The perpetrators will be brought to justice," it added.</p>

<p>The Lipetsk region is about 300 kilometres (190 miles) south of Moscow.</p>

<p>Russia has one of the highest prison populations in the world, but numbers have decreased as convicts are sent to fight in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Escapes are relatively rare in Russia and those that manage to break out are often caught within days.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sp_only-ul-ol sp_only-ul-ol-2">
<ol>
	<li>Today's Israeli airstrikes on Iran have parallels to a June 1981 airstrike on Iraq, called Operation Opera - simply on the distance covered and the level of risk. NDTV <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/operation-opera-daring-1981-airstrike-on-nuclear-reactor-in-focus-as-israel-faces-multi-front-war-4471744">reported last year</a> that Israel would not hesitate to carry out a similar strike on Iran if it found itself cornered.</li>
	<li>Just like today's airstrikes, which according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/article-826126" rel="nofollow,noindex"><em>The Jerusalem Post</em></a> involved over 100 aircraft including the US-made stealth fighter jet F-35 flying a roundtrip of 2,000 km, a concern in 1981's Operation Opera was about selecting the flight path as there were several constraints - a great distance to target (1,100 km), several hostile countries on the way, and limited amount of fuel.</li>
	<li>The Jerusalem Post reported today's massive air operation likely began with initial waves attacking radar and air defence systems, which set the airspace safe and clear for subsequent strikes on military bases in Iran.</li>
	<li>In Operation Opera, on June 7, 1981 at 4 pm, 14 fighter jets took off from Etzion airport in Israel. At approximately 5.30 pm, they struck and destroyed the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq, successfully completing their mission with no loss of any Israeli aircraft.</li>
	<li>Israel used F-16As in the strike on Iraq in 1981, with F-15As providing escort. The jets carried a massive amount of fuel in external tanks and flew extremely low for a long distance. However, with improvement in technology - modern versions of F-15 and F-16 are still in service - Israel likely did not have to face the kind of stress it did back in 1981, though the risk would still be high due to a parallel improvement in air defence technology.</li>

       <description><![CDATA[Seoul authorities, while announcing the $327 million initiative this week, stated that they want to "create a city where no one is lonely."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities in South Korea's capital city Seoul plan to spend 451.3 billion won (around $327 million) in the next five years to tackle "lonely deaths" - a crisis that sees thousands of its citizens, mostly middle-aged men, dying alone every year after getting unnoticed by their family and friends.</p>

<p>Known as 'godoksa' in Korea, these deaths are part of a larger problem of loneliness and isolation in the country, as the government is making all possible efforts to fight it. Sometimes, it takes days and even weeks for the authorities to find these bodies, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/24/asia/south-korea-loneliness-deaths-intl-hnk/index.html">CNN</a> reported.</p>

<p>Seoul authorities, while announcing the $327 million initiative this week, stated that they want to "create a city where no one is lonely."</p>

<p>Apart from this, they will provide loneliness counsellors on a 24/7 hotline and an online platform for similar counselling, besides other follow-up measures like in-person visits and consultations.</p>

<p>In an official release, Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon said the city authorities will mobilise all its municipal capacity to help the people feeling lonely to heal and "return to society". "Loneliness and isolation are not just individual problems, but tasks that society must solve together," Oh Se-hoon said.</p>

<p>The city also plans to introduce several other measures like expanded psychological services, green spaces, nutritional meal plans for middle-aged and elderly people as well as a dedicated "search system" for identifying the isolated residents who are seeking help.</p>

<p>Also, there will be activities carried out to encourage people to venture outside and connect with others. Among these are sports, gardening, book clubs and more, the CNN report said.</p>

<p>As per the latest figures by South Korea's Ministry of Health and Welfare, the number of "lonely deaths" reached 3,661 last year, significantly higher from 3,559 in 2022 and 3,378 in 2021.</p>

<p>However, part of that increase might be due to the broader definition of "lonely death" by the ministry concerned. To qualify as a 'lonely death,' a body had to be found only after a certain amount of time earlier, but the term now is applied to any individual, who stays in social isolation, away from family and relatives and dies by suicide or illness.</p>

<p>South Korea's demographic crisis could be another factor behind this rise. A downtrend in the birth rate and ageing population shows that there have been consistently more deaths in the country than births in recent years. The overall death rate in South Korea, including "lonely deaths," is rising. Also, men in their 50s and 60s made up over half the total group.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US hired a chartered flight to deport Indian nationals who were staying in the country illegally, the Department of Homeland Security has said, noting that this has been done in cooperation with the Indian government.</p>

<p>The charter flight was sent to India on October 22, the department said on Friday. "Indian nationals without a legal basis to remain in the United States are subject to swift removal, and intending migrants should not fall for the lies of smugglers who proclaim otherwise," said Kristie A. Canegallo, a senior official performing the duties of Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security.</p>

<p>The statement said the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) continues to enforce <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indians-form-third-largest-illegal-immigrant-population-in-us-study-4595873">US immigration</a> laws and deliver tough consequences for those who enter unlawfully and encourages the use of lawful pathways.</p>

<p>Since June 2024, when the Securing the Border Presidential Proclamation and accompanying Interim Final Rule went into effect, encounters between ports of entry along the southwest border of the US have decreased by 55 per cent.</p>

<p>In fiscal year 2024, the DHS removed or returned over 160,000 individuals and operated more than 495 international repatriation flights to more than 145 countries, including India, the statement said.</p>

<p>It said the department regularly engaged with foreign governments throughout the hemisphere and around the world to accept repatriations of their nationals without a legal basis to remain in the US.</p>

<p>This was one tool among many that the US used to reduce irregular migration, promote the use of safe, lawful and orderly pathways, and hold transnational criminal networks accountable for smuggling and exploitation of vulnerable people, it said.</p>

<p>Over the last year, DHS has removed individuals from a range of countries worldwide, including Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Egypt, Mauritania, Senegal, Uzbekistan, China, and India.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Russian actors were behind a viral video falsely showing mail-in ballots for Donald Trump being destroyed in the swing state of Pennsylvania, US officials said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian actors were behind a viral video falsely showing mail-in ballots for Donald Trump being destroyed in the swing state of Pennsylvania, US officials said Friday, amid heightened alert over foreign influence operations targeting the upcoming election.</p>

<p>The video, which garnered millions of views on platforms such as the Elon Musk-owned X, purports to show a man sorting through mail-in ballots from the state's Bucks County and ripping up those cast for Trump.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the Bucks County Board of Elections declared the video as "fake," saying that the envelope and other materials depicted in the footage are "clearly not authentic materials" belonging to or distributed by them.</p>

<p>In a joint statement on Friday, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said the video was part of a Russian disinformation operation.</p>

<p>"Russian actors manufactured and amplified a recent video that falsely depicted an individual ripping up ballots in Pennsylvania," the statement said.</p>

<p>"This Russian activity is part of Moscow's broader effort to raise unfounded questions about the integrity of the US election and stoke divisions among Americans," it added.</p>

<p>The statement said Russia was expected to create and release more such content in an attempt to "undermine trust" in the integrity of the November 5 elections.</p>

<p>The video surfaced as American authorities brace for a surge in disinformation in the final days of a nail-biting election between Republican nominee Trump and the Democratic candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>The video, also debunked by AFP's fact-checkers, was connected to a Kremlin-aligned disinformation network known as Storm-1516, according to researchers including Darren Linvill, co-director of Clemson University's Media Forensics Hub.</p>

<p>Linvill, who has closely studied the network, said the account on X -- previously called Twitter -- that distributed the video has regularly amplified other narratives from this network.</p>

<p>Storm-1516 has previously produced fake videos to discredit the campaign of Harris and her running mate Tim Walz, according to disinformation researchers.</p>

<p>Last month, the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center said Russian operatives are ramping up disinformation operations to malign Harris's campaign by disseminating conspiracy-laden videos.</p>

<p>Aside from Russia, Iran and China are also fanning "divisive narratives to divide Americans and undermine Americans' confidence in the US democratic system," the ODNI warned in a memo earlier this week.</p>

<p>"Foreign influence efforts will intensify in the lead-up to Election Day, especially through social media posts -- some of which are likely to be AI generated or enhanced," the report said.</p>

<p>"These actors probably perceive that undermining confidence in the elections weakens the legitimacy of our democracy and consequently makes the United States less capable of effectively pursuing policies that are counter to their interests," it added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From hitjobs to sabotages and cyberattacks, Israel has either been blamed for or has itself claimed a variety of attacks against Iran.</p>

<p>In Israel's sights are Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Tehran's nuclear programme.</p>

<p>As Israel launched a series of air strikes Saturday, which it said were aimed at Iran's military infrastructure, AFP looks at the other attempts over the years.</p>

<h3><strong>Revolutionary Guard</strong></h3>

<p>Israel has been blamed for targeting top members of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, mostly in attempts outside their country's borders.</p>

<p>Latest victims include a general killed on September 27 by the side of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli strike in the suburbs of Beirut.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An air strike blamed on Israel on Iran's consular annex building in Damascus on April 1, 2024 killed, according to Tehran, seven members of the Revolutionary Guards, including two of top rank.</p>

<p>The recent killings are only the latest in a long list.</p>

<p>In December 2023, a commander died in Syria in an attack blamed on Israel, a year after a colonel was killed, also in Syria.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In May 2022, Sayyad Khodaei, a member of the Quds Force, the unit in charge of the Guards' external operations, was gunned down by two motorcyclists on his way home in Tehran. According to the New York Times, Israel told the United States that it was responsible for the hitjob.&nbsp;</p>

<p>General Hassan Moghadam, responsible for armament programmes, was killed in an explosion at a munitions depot in November 2011 close to Tehran, in an operation blamed on the United States and Israel.</p>

<h3><strong>Iran's nuclear programme</strong></h3>

<p>Israel has also been accused of carrying out targeted assassinations against several high-ranking Iranian physicists, often linked to Tehran's nuclear programme.</p>

<p>Among them are nuclear physicist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, killed in November 2020 and presented after his death as a vice minister of defence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scientist Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, who was working on the Natanz nuclear site, and Majid Shahriari, the founder of Iran's nuclear society, as well as particle physics professor Massoud Ali Mohammadi were others killed over the years.</p>

<p>Israel has also been accused of sabotaging Iranian nuclear installations, mainly the Natanz complex to the south of Tehran.</p>

<p>On April 11, 2021, the site saw a small explosion, according to Iran's atomic energy agency.</p>

<p>The New York Times reported that Israel played a part in the "strong blast" that apparently took out the internal electric system supplying uranium enrichment centrifuges.</p>

<p>Another "accident" also hit Natanz in July 2020, in what Iran's atomic agency had said was a "sabotage".</p>

<p>In September 2010, a cyberattack using the Stuxnet virus took out the enrichment centrifuges at Natanz.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Iran accused Israel and the United States, while information security experts also pointed the finger at Washington.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Iran's allies</strong></h3>

<p>Iran's allies too have found that Tehran is not always safe shelter.</p>

<p>Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh was killed on July 31 in Iran's capital in an attack blamed on Israel. He was in Tehran to attend the inauguration ceremony of Iran's new president Masoud Pezeshkian.</p>

<h3><strong>Iranian petrol</strong></h3>

<p>In March 2021, the Wall Street Journal, citing US and Middle East officials, reported that Israel had in 2019 targeted at least a dozen vessels travelling to Syria and in most cases, transporting Iranian petrol.</p>

<p>The report said Israel had deployed underwater mines in the assault.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The radar antenna reflector for the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission arrived at the spacecraft integration and test facility of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in Bengaluru this week.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The radar antenna reflector for the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission arrived at the spacecraft integration and test facility of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in Bengaluru this week.</p>

<p>After its arrival in Bengaluru on Tuesday aboard a NASA C-130 cargo plane, the reflector was transported to the ISRO Spacecraft Integration and Test Establishment for its further reintegration with the NISAR spacecraft to prepare for testing, NASA said.</p>

<p>The satellite, a collaborative effort between NASA and ISRO to observe the Earth, is scheduled for launch from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Andhra Pradesh's Sriharikota in early 2025. The leading space agencies will be coordinating to determine an official launch readiness date for the same.</p>

<p><strong>Radar Antenna Reflector's Role</strong></p>

<p>The drum-shaped radar antenna reflector, measuring about 39 feet (12 meters) across, is among NASA's contributions to the joint mission. It has been specially designed to help focus the transmitted and received microwave signals to and from the surface of the Earth. This will enable NISAR to scan roughly all of the Earth's land and ice surfaces twice every 12 days to collect scientific data.</p>

<p>This reflector was earlier stationed at the specialised facility in California as engineers applied reflective tape to it, besides taking other precautionary measures to mitigate temperature increases.</p>

<p><strong>NISAR mission</strong></p>

<p>The objectives of the joint NISAR mission are aimed at revolutionising understanding of the planet.</p>

<p>Key observations from NISAR will help researchers worldwide get unprecedented insights into the changes in the Earth's surface, including the ice sheets, sea ice and glaciers.</p>

<p>Additionally, it will monitor changes in the forest and wetland ecosystems, besides tracking the movement and deformation of the crust like landslides, earthquakes as well as volcanic activities.</p>

<p>The rapid coverage from NISAR is aimed at providing multiple opportunities for disaster response. It will produce data to assist in mitigating and assessing the damage, providing observations before and after disasters in short time frames.</p>

<p>For the mission, NASA provided the L-Band SAR payload system, while ISRO supplied the S-Band SAR payload. Both of these SAR systems will help make use of a large size common unfurl able reflector antenna, the Indian Space Agency earlier said.</p>

<p>Besides this, NASA is also providing engineering payloads for the mission.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Archaeologists have disclosed the origin of the famous "holy grail" cup, which was found with 12 human skeletons at the spot in Jordan where the 1989 film Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade was filmed.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Archaeologists have disclosed the origin of the famous “holy grail” cup, which was found with 12 human skeletons at the spot in Jordan where the 1989 film Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade was filmed.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Contrary to popular belief, the chalice is not an ancient vessel for an elixir of immortality. Instead, it is actually a common drinking cup used by the Nabateans, a highly developed civilisation that thrived in the ancient city of Petra thousands of years ago.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“It's a humble jug, not a cup offering the drinker eternal life,” wrote UK archaeologist Claire Isabella Gilmour in <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-12-ancient-skeletons-discovered-in-a-mysterious-tomb-in-petra-could-tell-us-about-the-ancient-city-241850">The Conversation</a>, adding that Nabataean pottery is extremely fine — often only 1.5 mm thick — and is best suited for ceremonial uses or local use.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The ceramic object was excavated in August, alongside the skeletons and various other artefacts. The tomb included well-preserved skeleton bones and artefacts thought to be over 2,000 years old, in contrast to other tombs previously discovered in Petra that were mostly empty.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The findings were spearheaded by Dr. Pearce Paul Creasman, the executive director of the American Center of Research (ACOR), in partnership with Josh Gates from Discovery Channel's ‘Expedition Unknown,' as reported by <a href="https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/petra-tomb-discovery-0021567">Ancient Origins.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">Upon the discovery of the so-called “grail,” it was clasped in the hands of one of the 12 skeletons, reminiscent of the chalice that Jesus is believed to have used during the Last Supper.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This ancient tableware is typically very delicate, often measuring only 1.5 mm in thickness, indicating its suitability for ceremonial and local use rather than long-distance transport, unlike its sturdier Roman counterparts.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Adding to the intrigue, the chalice was unearthed in the same location made famous by Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade, with the artefact bearing a striking resemblance to the Spartan-like prop used in the movie.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Despite the similarities, archaeologist Gilmour wrote that this is not a case of art imitating life, noting that the resemblances arise from extensive research into Nabataean pottery conducted by Deborah Fine, a former director of archives at Lucasfilm Ltd.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The discovery of the skeletons, buried in separate sarcophagi, suggests they may have belonged to members of the Nabatean elite.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has appealed to the public to stop donating to the internet 'encyclopaedia' Wikipedia for allegedly letting itself be misused as a platform "controlled by far-Left activists." This is not the first time the Tesla and SpaceX founder has attacked Wikipedia for allegedly running Left narratives.</p>

<p>Mr Musk's latest post on X, the microblogging platform owned by him, referred to a report by the US-based news website Pirate Wires that alleged "a coordinated campaign led by around 40 Wikipedia editors has worked to delegitimize Israel, present radical Islamist groups in a favourable light, and position fringe academic views on the Israel-Palestine conflict as mainstream over past years, intensifying after the October 7 attack."</p>

<p>Mr Musk, who is also a strong supporter of Republican presidential candidate and former US President Donal Trump, in the post on X said, "Wikipedia is controlled by far-Left activists. People should stop donating to them."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>In the report, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/how-wikipedia-s-pro-hamas-editors-hijacked-the-israel-palestine-narrative" rel="nofollow,noindex">Pirate Wires said</a> six weeks after October 7 (Hamas' terror attack on Israel), one of the Wikipedia editors successfully removed the mention of Hamas' 1988 charter, which called for the killing of Jews and the destruction of Israel, from the entry on Hamas.</p>

<p>The group also appeared to attempt to promote the interests of the Iranian government across a number of articles, including deleting huge amounts of documented human rights crimes by [Islamic Republic Party] officials, the US news website that reports at the intersection of technology, politics, and culture said.</p>

<p>In India too, Wikipedia has been accused of being misused by 'super editors' - longtime users who can lock topics on the website to prevent more edits - to run certain narratives.</p>

<p>Asian News International (ANI), one of the largest news agencies in South Asia, last month filed a Rs 2 crore defamation case against Wikipedia's parent foundation for allowing certain malicious edits to a page with information about the news agency.</p>

<p>The Delhi High Court then issued contempt notice to Wikipedia over withholding information about edits to an entry on ANI, after the news agency said Wikipedia did not reveal details about three accounts that made the edits. Wikipedia eventually removed the entry over which ANI filed the defamation case.</p>

<p>The Delhi High Court on October 25 raised concerns over Wikipedia's open-edit platform model, with Justice Subramonium Prasad calling it "dangerous" due to its public editing access, legal news website <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.barandbench.com/news/delhi-high-court-flags-wikipedia-model-dangerous" rel="nofollow,noindex">Bar and Bench reported</a>.</p>

<p>Wikipedia has also become a narrative battleground over the Manipur crisis, with allegations that far-Left editors attribute their content only to sources created and influenced directly or indirectly by them. Malicious edits made by 'super editors' and locked by them on Wikipedia are seen as a huge problem.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The skeletal remains of the man, believed to be in his 30s or 40s, were uncovered at the castle near Trondheim in central Norway in 1938]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Skeletal remains, which were discovered in a well at Norway's Sverresborg Castle, have been linked to a centuries-old Norse story by researchers.</p>

<p>In the 800-year-old Sverris saga that follows the story of real-life King Sverre Sigurdsson, the author recounted the tale of tossing the corpse of a man -- later known as "well-man" -- into a well during a central Norway military raid in 1197.</p>

<p>As per the text, the raiders threw the body into the well to poison the main water source of an under-siege castle for locals. Though there was no mention of the identity of the man.</p>

<p>The skeleton of the man, believed to be in his 30s or 40s, was uncovered at the castle near Trondheim in central Norway in 1938, The Telegraph UK reported. Scientists at that time were only able to carry out a visual analysis.</p>

<p>With multiple analytical techniques now available including genetic sequencing and radiocarbon dating, the researchers have now been able to link the skeletal remains to the saga, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/25/science/well-man-bones-norse-saga/index.html" rel="no follow, no index">according to CNN</a>.</p>

<p>A study in this regard was published in the Cell Press journal iScience on Friday, revealing major insights into the appearance of the "Well-man" based on in-depth research on samples of his teeth.</p>

<p>The co-author of the study, Michael D Martin said in a statement that this was the first time when a person "described in these historical texts has actually been found".</p>

<p>Mr Martin is a professor in the department of natural history at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology's University Museum in Trondheim.</p>

<p>"There are a lot of these mediaeval and ancient remains all around Europe, and they're increasingly being studied using genomic methods," Mr Martin added.</p>

<p>The radiocarbon dating analysis helped the researchers determine that the skeletal remains were around 800 years old, aligning with the timeline of the Sverris saga.</p>

<p>Mr Martin said that they initially hoped to sequence the body's genome from its bones, considering that they appeared to be in good condition, but the DNA was poorly preserved inside them. So, they used samples of a tooth for genome sequencing. The result showed that the man likely had a medium skin tone along with blue eyes, and light-brown hair.</p>

<p>Then they compared the genome of "Well-man" with the genomes of anonymous modern Norwegians that are stored in reference databases at deCODE Genetics in Iceland.</p>

<p>As a result, it came out that the "well-man" was closely related to the natives of southern Norway.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Elon Musk, world's richest man and an important figure in Donald Trump's US presidential election campaign.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Elon Musk, the world's richest man and an important figure in Donald Trump's US presidential election campaign, has maintained consistent contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the past two years, according to a new report.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/musk-putin-secret-conversations-37e1c187?mod=hp_lead_pos7">The Wall Street Journal</a> reported that discussions between Elon Musk and Vladimir Putin have covered topics from personal matters to key geopolitical issues. Citing insights from current and former officials across the US, Europe and Russia, the report states that the Russian President allegedly requested Elon Musk to refrain from activating his Starlink satellite internet service over Taiwan — reportedly at the behest of Chinese President and close Putin ally, Xi Jinping.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The implications of this undisclosed channel of communication are substantial. Mr Musk's involvement in critical sectors such as space and communication places him at the centre of US security interests. His company SpaceX, for instance, is responsible for launching satellites crucial to US national security, and his Starlink communications system plays a major role in the ongoing war in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Elon Musk also owns social media platform X (formerly Twitter), that has reportedly been exploited for Russian disinformation efforts, claimed a report in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/25/elon-musk-has-been-in-regular-contact-with-putin-for-two-years-say-reports">The Guardian.</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">The tech billionaire's influence on the US administration could deepen if Donald Trump wins the presidential election. With substantial financial contributions to Trump's campaign and regular appearances at rallies, Elon Musk's role in a future administration may include heading a government commission on efficiency — a suggestion previously floated by the Republican candidate.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“This is a story about oligarch capture of the US,” said Fiona Hill, former senior director for European and Russian affairs in the Trump administration, adding. “If people like Musk get Trump re-elected, they'll expect all kinds of regulatory gifts in their favour.”&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">She also said that “loads of militaries around the world” heavily rely on Elon Musk's systems.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Wall Street Journal report stated that the scale of Elon Musk's contacts with Vladimir Putin has been a closely guarded secret, with even senior members of the Joe Biden administration being unaware of it. Musk is yet to respond to these revelations.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin's only direct communication with Elon Musk was a single conversation with Vladimir Putin, touching on space and current and future technologies. Peskov denied any regular contact between Elon Musk and Russian officials.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel strikes back. Iranian military bases in the capital Tehran and other cities were struck by missiles earlier today. The attack is a 'response' to Iran's air strikes on October 1 when over 200 rockets and ballistic missiles rained down on Israel to avenge the killing of ally Hezbollah's chief, Hassan Nasrallah.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-iran-war-israel-conducts-precise-strikes-on-iran-explosions-heard-around-tehran-6876065">The early morning strikes "caused limited damage"</a>, says Iran but Israel claims that it now has "wider freedom" to open in skies over Iran. The aftermath of the strikes resulted in a complete lockdown of the airspace in Iran, Syria and Iraq.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per FlightRadar24, an open-source flight tracking website, no aircraft is flying over the three countries. However, Iran has now announced that it will resume flights after the attacks.</p>

<p>Syria said Israel launched air strikes from the occupied Golan Heights and Lebanon on the capital Damascus, prompting them to activate air defence systems. Syria is part of the Iran-led 'Axis of Resistance', a group of Shia militias and political groups, against Israel and the US in the region.</p>

<p>Iraq said it is preserving the safety of civil aviation in its airspace and decided to lockdown the skies after the attacks. Prohibiting airspace after attacks is part of standard operation procedures of states for security reasons to prevent intrusion of enemy aircraft in the territory and make it easy for air defence systems to identify friendly aircraft in the airspace.</p>

<h2><strong>'Will Face Proportional Reaction'</strong></h2>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/live-updates-israel-will-face-proportional-reaction-says-iran-after-strikes-report-6876417">The tensions never simmered in the region</a> and now Iran says it is ready to respond to the 'act of aggression'.</p>

<p>Iran is prepared to respond to any Israeli "aggression," Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency reported, citing sources. "There is no doubt that Israel will face a proportional reaction for any action it takes," Tasnim quotes the sources as saying.</p>

<p>The Israeli army has warned Iran that it will "pay a heavy price" if it begins a new round of escalation. Iran said the attack caused "limited damage".</p>

<p>The United States confirmed it was informed of the impending strike, although no US personnel or assets were involved in the operation. Sean Savett, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, termed Israel's actions as "an exercise of self-defence and in response to Iran's ballistic missile attack against Israel."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We urge Iran to cease its attacks on Israel so that this cycle of fighting can end without further escalation," said US National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The student accused the English faculty of having "not acted in good faith"]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">An Indian PhD student has accused the University of Oxford of transferring her to a master's course against her will, describing the experience as “betrayal.”&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Lakshmi Balakrishnan, who hails from Tamil Nadu, invested nearly £100,000 (around Rs 1.09 crore) in her education and living expenses at the institution, where she aimed to pursue her doctoral studies in English literature, reported the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy898dzknzgo">BBC</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Ms Balakrishnan said that the English faculty has “not acted in good faith” after initially accepting her thesis proposal at both the application stage and during her first year. Later, the faculty rejected her research idea in her fourth year, she claimed.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“They forcibly removed me from the PhD program and moved me to a masters level course without my consent. I feel a sense of betrayal and I feel like I have been let down by an institution that I held in high regard. I already have two masters degrees from India and I paid £100,000 at Oxford to get my PhD, not another masters course,” the BBC quoted Balakrishnan as saying.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Raised in south India by her father after losing her mother at a young age, Lakshmi Balakrishnan said she was the first member of her family to study abroad, overcoming significant challenges to enrol at Oxford. “I hail from an underprivileged background, I made immense sacrifices to come and study at Oxford,” she said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">During her fourth year, Ms Balakrishnan underwent an assessment where two different assessors deemed her Shakespeare research insufficient for PhD-level study. She contested the faculty's decision and entered an appeals process but reported that her efforts were unsuccessful. “I believe that the university's strategy is to force me to wade through endless appeals and complaints procedures in the hope that I will eventually give up and go,” she claimed.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The appeals process has now concluded, with Oxford University stating that, “To achieve Confirmation of Status, progress must sufficiently demonstrate a strong likelihood of successful completion of a doctoral thesis.”</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States urged Iran on Saturday to stop attacking Israel to break the cycle of violence after Israel launched strikes against the Islamic republic in retaliation for a missile barrage.</p>

<p>"We urge Iran to cease its attacks on Israel so that this cycle of fighting can end without further escalation," US National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett told reporters.</p>

<p>The Israeli military conducted air strikes against Iran on Saturday, hitting military bases and missile sites, and other systems in several regions.</p>

<p>"Their response was an exercise in self-defense and specifically avoided populated areas and focused solely on military targets, contrary to Iran's attack against Israel that targeted Israel's most populous city," he added.</p>

<p>Stressing that the United States did not participate in the operation, he said "it is our aim to accelerate diplomacy and de-escalate tensions in the Middle East region".</p>

<p>A senior administration official said President Joe Biden and his national security team have worked with the "Israelis over recent weeks to encourage Israel to conduct a response that was targeted and proportional with low risk of civilian harm".</p>

<p>"And that appears to have been precisely what transpired this evening," the official told reporters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Biden had encouraged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu "to design a response that served to deter further attacks against Israel while reducing risks of further escalation, and that is our objective".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aggrey Rwetsiba, a Ugandan delegate to the UN's biodiversity summit in Colombia, finds himself in unusual accommodations: a motel normally destined for trysts, with rooms featuring sex swings and stripper poles.</p>

<p>Like other visitors to the Colombian city, his hotel booking fell through, and Rwetsiba had to make last-minute arrangements.</p>

<p>With traditional hotels bursting at the seams, hourly rate motels came to the rescue of stranded delegates like himself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Showing AFP around his room in the Motel Deseos (Desires), the delegate points to the big double bed, walk-in shower and an unusual feature: a ceiling mirror.</p>

<p>Some of his clothes are draped on hangers from the shower screen, others are folded up in a small cubicle with one door inside the room and another that opens on the hallway.</p>

<p>Usually rented out for a few hours at a time, there are no wardrobes in the rooms. And the double-doored cubicle is for staff to pass drinks to guests seeking seclusion.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure whether I've got the full understanding of what a motel should be, but I have seen some unique features... Like the mirror on the ceiling. I have never seen (that) in a hotel," Rwetsiba told AFP.</p>

<p>He also pointed to the lone wall socket next to the bed, rather than by the table where he needs to power his laptop.</p>

<p>"So the setup is quite different," he said. "I have never seen a hotel with each room having a parking yard," each enclosed, with a private door leading straight into the room.</p>

<h3><strong>Bursting at the seams</strong></h3>

<p>Motel Deseos manager Diana Echeverry proudly showed AFP around the facility, with 40 rooms spread over two floors, and one wing set aside for a dozen COP16 delegates.</p>

<p>In the rest of the building, rooms feature such amenities as Jacuzzis, "kama sutra" loungers and dance poles.</p>

<p>"We have adapted our establishment a little in order to be able to host the guests of COP16 and foreigners," Echeverry told AFP.</p>

<p>Contacted at short notice by local authorities, she said, the motel quickly worked out a daily rate -- 150,000 Colombian pesos (about $35) per night -- and introduced a breakfast service.</p>

<p>Room prices usually range from 65,000 to 100,000 pesos for three hours.</p>

<p>Staff also "took out the love swings, 'love machines,' Kama Sutra chairs and left the rooms without those kinds of items," said Echeverry.</p>

<p>The biodiversity summit has been good for business, she added.</p>

<p>"It has ensured that the (delegates') rooms are occupied during those days and... the remaining rooms now rotate much more to meet the demands of our usual guests."</p>

<p>Cali Mayor Alejandro Eder told reporters this week the city's hotels were "100 percent" full, with Airbnbs, houses and apartments also rented out.</p>

<p>Initial expectations had been for between 12,000 and 15,000 people to attend the COP16, but in the end, there were closer to 23,000 registered delegates, said Eder.</p>

<p>According to Cali's Chamber of Commerce, there are 166 registered motels in the city -- more than anywhere else in Colombia.</p>

<p>Like elsewhere in Latin America, motels are generally places go to for a few private hours with a lover.</p>

<p>In Cali, they boast names such as "Kama Sutra," "Cupido" and "Extasis."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Delighted with the amenities at Motel Deseos, Rwetsiba said he informed other colleagues, and there were now five Ugandan delegates in rooms "more comfortable" than many traditional hotels.</p>

<p>"It's... spacious. That's why we are here. We are not complaining," he said with a big smile.</p>

<p>"We are all happy."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Mukaab’s design and features are part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s ‘Saudi Vision 2030’]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saudi Arabia has begun work on a monumental $50-billion megastructure in Riyadh, aiming to construct what could be the largest building in the world.&nbsp;The megastructure, called ‘The Mukaab,' is a proposed cubical structure set to rise 1,300 feet high and span 1,200 feet wide upon completion — capable of fitting 20 Empire State Buildings within its boundaries, according to a report in <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/tech/12742902/worlds-biggest-building-saudi-arabia/">The Sun</a>.</p>

<p>Envisioned as a futuristic city within a single building, the Mukaab will span 2 million square metres of floor space and is part of Saudi Arabia's expansive development drive to reshape its urban landscape. It will house residential units, hotels, office spaces and a variety of retail, dining and leisure facilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Mukaab's design and features are part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's ‘Saudi Vision 2030' – an ambitious programme aimed at reducing the Kingdom's dependence on oil by boosting non-oil GDP by $51 billion and creating 3.34 lakh jobs.</p>

<p>The project's developers also plan to implement immersive, AI-driven technology to enhance visitor experiences. This will include massive screens around the building's exterior, similar to the Las Vegas Sphere.</p>

<p>The Mukaab's architectural inspiration is drawn from Saudi Arabia's traditional and natural heritage. The exterior's cube shape pays homage to the Najdi architectural style, characterised by mud-brick structures and geometric window designs, while the surrounding area will replicate the look of desert wadis — dry riverbeds common in the region.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A video released by Saudi authorities offers a preview of the cityscape where the tower will be constructed. The modern district is planned to include over 1.04 lakh residential units, 9,000 hotel rooms, high-end retail outlets, office spaces as well as dedicated areas for leisure activities and community facilities.</p>

<p>The report also stated that the project has sparked controversy, with some critics noting its resemblance to the Kaaba in Mecca, Islam's most sacred site. In addition, human rights organisations have voiced concerns, highlighting the potential for migrant labour exploitation and the possibility of displacement for local residents due to the scale of the construction.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four weeks after Iran attacked Israel with a barrage of ballistic missiles to avenge the strikes on ally Hezbollah, the Jewish state responded at the time of its choosing. The tensions never simmered in the region and now Iran says it is ready to respond to the 'act of aggression'.</p>

<p>Iran is prepared to respond to any Israeli "aggression," Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency reported, citing sources. "There is no doubt that Israel will face a proportional reaction for any action it takes," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2024/10/26/3185861/iran-ready-for-retaliation-against-israel-source" rel="no follow, no index">Tasnim </a>quotes the sources as saying.</p>

<p>The Israeli army has warned Iran that it will "pay a heavy price" if it begins a new round of escalation. Iran said the attack caused "limited damage".</p>

<p><strong>Israel Strikes Back</strong></p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-iran-war-israel-conducts-precise-strikes-on-iran-explosions-heard-around-tehran-6876065">Iranian state TV reported "strong explosions"</a> around Tehran on Saturday morning, without specifying their cause. The semi-official Tasnim News Agency noted that no rockets or aircraft were reported in the skies over Tehran at the time of the explosions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Iranian state TV claimed that the blasts heard around Tehran were due to the "activation of the air defence system." "The loud blasts heard around Tehran were related to the activation of the air defence system against the actions of Zionist regime which attacked three locations outside of Tehran city," state TV reported.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-iran-live-updates-israel-begins-strikes-on-military-targets-in-iran-6875837">Israel-Iran Live Updates: Israel Begins Strikes On Military Targets In Iran</a></p>

<p>Iranian authorities suggested the noises could be related to defensive measures, hinting at the possibility that Iran's air defence systems had been activated.</p>

<p>In addition to Tehran, residents in the nearby city of Karaj reported hearing blasts. Iranian authorities say that operations at critical sites such as the Imam Khomeini International Airport, Mehrabad Airport, and a prominent oil refinery south of Tehran were "normal" and unaffected by the strikes. However, several military bases near Tehran were reportedly targeted by Israeli forces, according to Iran's Fars News Agency.</p>

<p>Israeli officials said the attacks are justified as measures of self-defence. IDF's spokesperson Daniel Hagari also urged Israeli citizens to "remain alert and vigilant."</p>

<p>Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials are assessing the security situation after the strikes. Meanwhile, Iran has suspended all flights until further notice.</p>

<p><strong>What Happened On October 1</strong></p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/video-israels-air-defence-system-in-action-to-intercept-iranian-missiles-6695307">A few hours before midnight</a>, Iran attacked Israel with missiles and rockets after tensions escalated in West Asia following artillery and air strikes on Lebanon to target Hezbollah, a Shia militant outfit and a strong ally of Iran.</p>

<p>Iran's Revolutionary Guards said the attack was in response to the killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah.</p>

<p>Videos show the night sky lighting up with explosions after air raid sirens echoed across the country.</p>

<p>The missiles were raining down on Israel and the Iron Dome and Arrow air defence system were in action to intercept and neutralise the targets. Iran fired over 100 missiles, Israeli media reported and several videos showed intercepted missile debris falling over Israeli cities.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

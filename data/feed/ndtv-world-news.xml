       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US had never approved Kyiv to use long-range missiles in Russia, until now.</p>

<p>The Biden administration has made a significant policy change, allowing Ukraine to use US-made ATACMS missiles to strike targets inside Russia for the first time.</p>

<p>This decision comes just two months before President Joe Biden hands over power to Donald Trump, who has expressed scepticism about US military aid to Ukraine.</p>

<p>Ukraine has been using ATACMS missiles against Russian targets in occupied Ukrainian territory for over a year, but the US had previously prohibited their use inside Russia due to concerns about escalating the conflict.</p>

<p>"It would substantially change the very essence, the nature of the conflict. This will mean that Nato countries, the USA and European states, are fighting with Russia", Putin had said in September.</p>

<p>However, the recent deployment of North Korean troops to support Russia in the Kursk border region has prompted the policy change.</p>

<p>The Lockheed Martin ballistic missiles are some of the most powerful missiles provided to Ukraine, with a range of up to 300km (186 miles), and will likely be used to defend against Russian and North Korean troops in the Kursk region, targeting military bases, infrastructure, and ammunition storage.</p>

<p>Officials from both the countries - Ukraine and US expect a counter-offensive by Russia and North Korea to regain the Kursk territory.</p>

<p>While the supply of missiles may not be enough to turn the tide of the war, they could grant Ukraine an advantage at a time when Russian troops are gaining ground in the country's east.</p>

<p>Western diplomats have welcomed the decision as an "overdue symbolic move" to demonstrate military support for Ukraine, but caution that it may not be decisive.</p>

<p>"The West has decided on such a level of escalation that it could end with the Ukrainian statehood in complete ruins by morning," Andrei Klishas, a Senator of the Russian Federation said.</p>

<p>Vladimir Dzhabarov, also a Senator of the Russian Federation, has said that this is a "very big step" towards World War Three.</p>

<p>Donald Trump's stance on the issue remains unclear, with some of his officials advocating for continued aid to Ukraine while others suggest cutting off support.</p>

<p>His son, Donald Trump Jr, wrote this on social media, "The military industrial complex seems to want to make sure they get World War Three going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives."</p>

<p>National Security Adviser Michael Waltz says that Trump might accelerate the delivery of weapons to Ukraine to get Russia to negotiate. Since the president-elect had a goal of resolving the conflict within a day, this might support his plan.</p>

<p>However, JD Vance, Vice President elect said "we've done more than our fair share" during a speech in May. "I do not think that it is in America's interest to continue to fund an effectively never-ending war in Ukraine," he added.</p>

<p>According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German research organisation, the US has allocated 56.799 billion euros as military help as of October 2024 and stands as the greatest supplier of arms to Ukraine.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's ties with China will remain unchanged despite the election of Donald Trump as US president, an adviser to Iran's supreme leader said in remarks carried by ISNA news agency.</p>

<p>Ali Akbar Velayati said Trump's return to the White House in January would not "impact" Iran's foreign policy, "particularly its ties with China", according to ISNA.</p>

<p>"Iran and China have long-standing, close and cordial cultural and historical relations and they have had many positive effects on each other," he was quoted as saying.</p>

<p>The comments were made during a meeting with Cong Peiwu, the Chinese ambassador to Tehran, the news agency said in its report on Sunday night.</p>

<p>Velayati, who served as foreign minister for 16 years until 1997, currently advises Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>

<p>China is Iran's largest trading partner and a major buyer of its sanctioned oil.</p>

<p>Iranian Oil Minister Mohsen Paknejad said last week that the Islamic republic had no "serious concerns" regarding oil sales following Trump's election.</p>

<p>Trump, who implemented a "maximum pressure" policy against Iran during his first term, has named Marco Rubio, a politician known for his hostility toward both China and Iran, as his secretary of state.</p>

<p>This policy involved the imposition of both old and new sanctions on Tehran, complicating Beijing's efforts to engage Iran in its extensive Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.</p>

<p>In 2021, China and Iran signed a 25-year strategic agreement that encompasses various areas, including energy, security, infrastructure and communications.</p>

<p>In September, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi reassured Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian that China would "support" Iran, regardless of how the international and regional situation evolves.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A quietly growing belief in Silicon Valley could have immense implications: the breakthroughs from large AI models -- the ones expected to bring human-level artificial intelligence in the near future -- may be slowing down.</p>

<p>Since the frenzied launch of ChatGPT two years ago, AI believers have maintained that improvements in generative AI would accelerate exponentially as tech giants kept adding fuel to the fire in the form of data for training and computing muscle.</p>

<p>The reasoning was that delivering on the technology's promise was simply a matter of resources -- pour in enough computing power and data, and artificial general intelligence (AGI) would emerge, capable of matching or exceeding human-level performance.</p>

<p>Progress was advancing at such a rapid pace that leading industry figures, including Elon Musk, called for a moratorium on AI research.</p>

<p>Yet the major tech companies, including Musk's own, pressed forward, spending tens of billions of dollars to avoid falling behind.&nbsp;</p>

<p>OpenAI, ChatGPT's Microsoft-backed creator, recently raised $6.6 billion to fund further advances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>xAI, Musk's AI company, is in the process of raising $6 billion, according to CNBC, to buy 100,000 Nvidia chips, the cutting-edge electronic components that power the big models.</p>

<p>However, there appear to be problems on the road to AGI.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Industry insiders are beginning to acknowledge that large language models (LLMs) aren't scaling endlessly higher at breakneck speed when pumped with more power and data.</p>

<p>Despite the massive investments, performance improvements are showing signs of plateauing.</p>

<p>"Sky-high valuations of companies like OpenAI and Microsoft are largely based on the notion that LLMs will, with continued scaling, become artificial general intelligence," said AI expert and frequent critic Gary Marcus. "As I have always warned, that's just a fantasy."</p>

<h3><strong>'No wall'</strong></h3>

<p>One fundamental challenge is the finite amount of language-based data available for AI training.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Scott Stevenson, CEO of AI legal tasks firm Spellbook, who works with OpenAI and other providers, relying on language data alone for scaling is destined to hit a wall.</p>

<p>"Some of the labs out there were way too focused on just feeding in more language, thinking it's just going to keep getting smarter," Stevenson explained.</p>

<p>Sasha Luccioni, researcher and AI lead at startup Hugging Face, argues a stall in progress was predictable given companies' focus on size rather than purpose in model development.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The pursuit of AGI has always been unrealistic, and the 'bigger is better' approach to AI was bound to hit a limit eventually -- and I think this is what we're seeing here," she told AFP.</p>

<p>The AI industry contests these interpretations, maintaining that progress toward human-level AI is unpredictable.</p>

<p>"There is no wall," OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted Thursday on X, without elaboration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anthropic's CEO Dario Amodei, whose company develops the Claude chatbot in partnership with Amazon, remains bullish: "If you just eyeball the rate at which these capabilities are increasing, it does make you think that we'll get there by 2026 or 2027."</p>

<h3><strong>Time to think</strong></h3>

<p>Nevertheless, OpenAI has delayed the release of the awaited successor to GPT-4, the model that powers ChatGPT, because its increase in capability is below expectations, according to sources quoted by The Information.</p>

<p>Now, the company is focusing on using its existing capabilities more efficiently.</p>

<p>This shift in strategy is reflected in their recent o1 model, designed to provide more accurate answers through improved reasoning rather than increased training data.</p>

<p>Stevenson said an OpenAI shift to teaching its model to "spend more time thinking rather than responding" has led to "radical improvements".&nbsp;</p>

<p>He likened the AI advent to the discovery of fire. Rather than tossing on more fuel in the form of data and computer power, it is time to harness the breakthrough for specific tasks.</p>

<p>Stanford University professor Walter De Brouwer likens advanced LLMs to students transitioning from high school to university: "The AI baby was a chatbot which did a lot of improv'" and was prone to mistakes, he noted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The homo sapiens approach of thinking before leaping is coming," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2016-08/cpec_650x400_51472448483.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>

<p>Are Beijing-Islamabad ties under strain? Last month's bombing near Karachi airport, which killed two Chinese engineers and wounded a third, may well be a turning point. These bombings, claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), were the latest in a string of attacks on Beijing's interests in Pakistan, which began in 2016. They have angered China, which has pushed Pakistan to begin formal negotiations for a joint security management system.</p>

<p>Last Monday, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said that Beijing “will continue supporting Pakistan's counterterrorism effort[s] and socioeconomic development”. Pakistani officials who have direct knowledge of the previously unreported negotiations told Reuters that the Chinese want to bring in their own security, something that Pakistan is not in support of. Beijing has sent Islamabad a written proposal to “allow the dispatch of security agencies and military forces into each other's territory to assist in counterterrorism missions and conduct joint strikes”.</p>

<p>Pakistan, for its part, was amenable to setting up a joint security management system wherein Chinese officials could attend security meetings. It had also requested Beijing for greater help in improving its intelligence capabilities instead of direct involvement. But, it remains averse to having Chinese security and military forces on its territory.</p>

<h2><strong>Why China Is Frustrated</strong></h2>

<p>China does not seem to be in the mood to be placated—and not without reason. Two major deadly attacks have occurred this year—one was in October last month in Karachi, and another in March in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). The latter attack, on a Chinese envoy, was carried out by affiliates of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and resulted in the deaths of five Chinese nationals working on the Dasu dam project.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the October bombings, the Chinese response was unusually blunt. It has been pushing for a thorough probe and investigation into the attacks as well as for a large-scale counterterrorism operation. The Chinese embassy, strongly condemning the “terrorist attack”, recently requested Pakistan to “thoroughly investigate the attack, severely punish the perpetrators, and take all necessary measures to protect the safety of Chinese citizens, institutions and projects in Pakistan”, and asked “Chinese citizens, enterprises and projects in Pakistan to be vigilant, pay close attention to the security situation, strengthen security measures, and make every effort to take safety precautions”. This is not surprising because these two attacks are certainly not the only ones targeting Chinese interests and personnel in Pakistan.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Balochistan Conflict</strong></h2>

<p>The roots of these tensions go back to Baloch dissatisfaction. However, the other broad underlying factor is Pakistan's inability to assimilate all its ethnic groups and provinces into a cohesive national identity, both culturally and economically. The narrative of Pakistani Balochistan follows a familiar trajectory. It has been seen earlier in the history of East Pakistan (which ultimately decided its destiny as Bangladesh), of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, and of the Northwest Frontier Province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). The steady depletion of natural resources of these provinces, the dispossession of their populaces, the erosion of local autonomy, negligence towards development, the suppression of ethnic identity and culture, demographic changes and the brutal crushing of any dissent or opposition are all-too-familiar patterns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Balochistan is a resource-rich province with natural gas and mineral deposits, including coal, chromites, barytes, sulphur, marble, iron ore, quartzite, uranium, limestone and 95% of the world's asbestos. Nevertheless, the province continues to languish under neglect, with the Baloch people alleging internal colonisation by Pakistan's dominant Punjab province. The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) continues to press ahead with its demands for secessionism, with Pakistan launching large-scale anti-insurgency operations to crush the agitation. Hundreds of Baloch have lost their lives and many more "disappeared" under these operations.</p>

<h2><strong>Why CPEC Has Become A Bone Of Contention</strong></h2>

<p>The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the flagship programme of China's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), passes majorly through Balochistan and is meant to bring in all the fruits of development. But the project has added to Baloch anxiety. The CPEC, a network of road, rail, power grid and cable connections, links China's Xinjiang to the Gwadar Port in Balochistan Province. The Baloch allege dissatisfaction with and exploitation by the CPEC, whereby thousands have been displaced on their own land without adequate compensation or employment opportunities. There are charges of corruption and ambiguity, with many believing that only Pakistani elites and China would benefit from the project. The result has been a string of attacks on Chinese personnel and interests, interrupting the implementation of the CPEC. For instance, in 2018, the BLA attacked the Chinese consulate in Karachi. Two years later, it attacked the Pakistan Stock Exchange, where the Chinese are major investors. In 2022, a female Baloch suicide bomber targeted Karachi University, killing three Chinese teachers. Last year, the BLA set six Chinese mobile towers on fire.</p>

<p>These tensions have considerably slowed down the progress of the CPEC, with many projects having been stalled. The Chinese, who have invested almost $64 billion into the corridor, are visibly upset. In 2021, a Pakistan Senate panel expressed concern over the slow progress of the CPEC and the Chinese dissatisfaction, given that around 135 Chinese companies are engaged in the CPEC. The Chinese Ambassador in Islamabad had also complained that Pakistan had "destroyed CPEC”.</p>

<h2><strong>A Breakdown Of Ties?</strong></h2>

<p>Along with the stalled projects and lost profits, body bags containing the remains of Chinese workers returning to the country have added to China's frustrations. This has led to pressure on Islamabad to launch a full-blown counterinsurgency operation in Balochistan. It has also contributed to the erosion of confidence and a possible devaluation of bilateral ties with Pakistan. Analysts have pointed out that in the last few joint statements—most notable being the latest one released during the visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to China—Pakistan is no longer mentioned as a “highest priority” country for China, a tag that featured in previous joint statements. Also, the idea of extending the CPEC to Afghanistan—mooted during a trilateral meeting in 2023 between then-Pakistani foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, Chinese foreign minister Qin Gang, and acting Afghan foreign minister Malawi Amir Khan Muttaqi—is no longer being discussed.</p>

<p>Pakistan neither wants to engage in another massive counterterrorism operation nor does it want Chinese security forces to guard CPEC projects. Yet, $30 billion of its $126-billion total external foreign debt is owed to China. It is also seeking another $7 billion from the International Monetary Fund. Not a pretty picture: not for Pakistan, not for China, and certainly not for the CPEC.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China reiterated calls Monday for a peaceful settlement to the war in Ukraine, after Washington cleared Kyiv to use long-range American missiles against military targets inside Russia.</p>

<p>"An early ceasefire and a political solution serve the interests of all parties," foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a regular briefing, when asked about the US decision.</p>

<p>"The most urgent thing is to promote the cooling down of the situation as soon as possible," he said.</p>

<p>China presents itself as a neutral party in the Ukraine war and says it is not sending lethal assistance to either side, unlike the United States and other Western nations.</p>

<p>But it remains a close political and economic ally of Russia and NATO members have branded Beijing a "decisive enabler" of the war, which it has never condemned.</p>

<p>On Monday, Lin said: "China has always encouraged and supported all efforts conducive to a peaceful resolution of the crisis."</p>

<p>Beijing, he added, "is willing to continue to play a constructive role in the political resolution of the Ukraine crisis in its own way".</p>

<p>Lin also rebuffed reports that EU officials had obtained proof that Russian drones being used in the war were being manufactured in China.</p>

<p>Beijing "has never provided lethal weapons to parties in the conflict, and has from the beginning strictly controlled military and dual-use drones in accordance with laws and regulations", he said.</p>

<p>"It is hoped that relevant countries and persons will not make wild speculations or smear and slander China without factual basis."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian lawmaker Maria Butina said on Monday that the administration of President Joe Biden was risking World War Three if it had allowed Ukraine to use US-made weapons to strike deep into Russia.</p>

<p>"These guys, Biden's administration, is trying to escalate the situation to the maximum while they still have power and are still in office," Ms Butina told Reuters.</p>

<p>"I have a great hope that (Donald) Trump will overcome this decision if this has been made because they are seriously risking the start of World War Three which is not in anybody's interest."</p>

<p>Reuters, citing two US officials and a source familiar with the decision, reported on Sunday that Biden's administration has made the decision to allow Ukraine to make the strikes with US weapons deep into Russia.</p>

<p>The New York Times also reported that Joe Biden's administration had made the decision. The Kremlin has yet to comment on the reports.</p>

<p>"The West has decided on such a level of escalation that it could end with the Ukrainian statehood in complete ruins by morning," Andrei Klishas, a senior member of the Federation Council, Russia's upper chamber of parliament, said on the Telegram messaging app.</p>

<p>Vladimir Dzhabarov, first deputy head of the Russian upper house's international affairs committee, said that Moscow's response will be immediate. "This is a very big step towards the start of World War Three," the TASS state news agency quoted Dzhabarov as saying.</p>

<p>Russia would be forced to take what Putin called "appropriate decisions" based on the new threats.</p>

<p>Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the State Duma lower house's foreign affairs committee, said that US authorisation of strikes by Kyiv on Russia with US ATACMS tactical missiles would lead to the toughest response, Russian news agencies reported.</p>

<p>"Strikes with US missiles deep into Russian regions will inevitably entail a serious escalation, which threatens to lead to much more serious consequences," TASS news agency quoted Slutsky as saying.</p>

<p>President Vladimir Putin said on September 12 that Western approval for such a step would mean "the direct involvement of NATO countries, the United States and European countries in the war in Ukraine" because NATO military infrastructure and personnel would have to be involved in the targeting and firing of the missiles.</p>

<p>In late October, Putin said that Russia's defence ministry was working on different ways to respond if the United States and its NATO allies help Ukraine to strike deep into Russia with long-range Western missiles.</p>

<p>"I guess there are some people in the United States who have nothing to lose for whatever reason or who are completely off the grid so much that they simply do not care," said Ms Butina, who spent 15 months in US prison for acting as an unregistered Russian agent and is now a lawmaker for the ruling United Russia party.</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin had also updated its nuclear doctrine to say that if Moscow came under direct attack from the West, Russia may even consider a nuclear response. Joe Biden's decision for allowing Ukraine to use western missiles to target Moscow is a step that risks such a response.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A private video of Pakistani TV host and influencer Mathira Mohammad was leaked on social media recently, adding to the series of similar controversies involving Pakistan TikTok star Imsha Rehman and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/indonesian-celeb-lydia-onics-alleged-private-video-leaked-after-imsha-rehman-and-minahil-malik-7023908">Indonesian e-sports star </a>Lydia Onic. Several explicit clips, allegedly showing Mathira in a compromising position, have been doing rounds. However, the videos could not be verified.</p>

<p>The 32-year-old influencer, reacting to this, said that people are misusing her name and photoshoot pictures and creating fake photos.</p>

<p>"People are misusing my name and my photoshoot pictures and adding fake stuff in please have shame ! Keep me out of this trashy nonsense." she wrote on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

Keep me out of this trashy nonsence ..</p>
— Mathira (@IamMathira) <a href="https://twitter.com/IamMathira/status/1856695359373718007?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Mathira, apart from a TV host, is also a model, dancer, singer, and actor. She has over two million followers on Instagram and around 59,000 followers on X.</p>

<p>The recent incident has yet again sparked a discussion on deepfake videos and data breaches.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, a private video of Pakistan TikTok star <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-imsha-rehman-pakistani-tiktok-star-caught-in-video-leak-scandal-7030925">Imsha Rehman</a> went viral, showing her in an intimate position. She faced a lot of backlash from social media users, who accused her of intentionally making the video public to gain attention. Shortly after this, Rehman called the negative comments "overwhelming" and deactivated her social media accounts.</p>

<p>Before this, an alleged intimate video of another Pakistani social media personality Minahil Malik with her boyfriend was circulated online, forcing her as well to deactivate her accounts. She also claimed that the video was "fake" and lodged a complaint with the&nbsp;Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).</p>

<p>On November 15, another explicit video purportedly showing Indonesian e-sports star Lydia Onic was leaked online. It is not yet confirmed if it was the&nbsp;content creator in the clip.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indian-origin CEO has claimed that he received death threats after his social media post about the company's 84-hour workweek with “no work-life balance” went viral. Daksh Gupta, the CEO of AI startup Greptile, sparked a wave of controversy with a post detailing his company's demanding work culture.</p>

<p>Following the backlash, he mentioned that his inbox was a mix of "20 per cent death threats and 80 per cent job applications." The barrage of criticism came after Mr Gupta shared that employees at Greptile typically worked from 9 am to 11 pm or later, adding Saturdays were regular workdays and there was occasional work on Sundays too. He explained the company's “environment is high stress, and there is no tolerance for poor work.”</p>

<p>Mr Gupta now tells potential candidates during the first interview that “Greptile offers no work-life balance."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">now that this is on the front page of reddit and my inbox is 20% death threats and 80% job applications, here's a follow up<br />

— Daksh Gupta (@dakshgup) <a href="https://twitter.com/dakshgup/status/1855670370659111242?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>In his follow-up post, he was sympathetic to employees who feel overworked and underpaid, particularly in software jobs outside the US. Mr Gupta clarified the intense work culture was not meant to be permanent, adding it was part of the early growth phase of a startup.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“This way of working isn't supposed to be forever because it isn't sustainable. It's the first year or two of a startup which is like reaching escape velocity. Like people said in the comments, as we mature we'll hire older, more experienced people who have families and can't work 100 hours a week, and naturally we would adapt like any good organisation,” he explained.</p>

<p>Mr Gupta's first post came under intense scrutiny, with many lambasting his approach and calling it a promotion of a “toxic work environment” and a “terrible mindset.” Some praised his transparency but warned that such conditions, unless accompanied by fair compensation, bordered on modern-day slavery.</p>

<p>In response to critics who suggested his approach was influenced by his Indian background, Mr Gupta clarified that his management style was shaped more by his experience in San Francisco's fast-paced startup culture than any cultural factors. "This is NOT meant to be prescriptive. Many other startups started the way we are starting," he added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will seek to build a "pragmatic" relationship with China that is "rooted in the UK's national interests" when he meets President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Brazil on Monday.</p>

<p>The meeting is the first to take place between a British prime minister and Xi since 2018, as Starmer's Labour government seeks to reset ties with China following years of tensions over human rights, Hong Kong, and allegations of Chinese espionage.</p>

<p>Relations between London and Beijing deteriorated in the last decade as Britain grew concerned that an open door to Chinese investment could pose national security risks, and that China's military and economic assertiveness may be acting against its interests.</p>

<p>But Starmer appears to be prioritising the need to boost trade to grow the economy, a task that may become more difficult if US President-elect Donald Trump follows through on his threat to impose tariffs on all imports and as Britain's economy continues to adapt to life outside the European Union.</p>

<p>"Close cooperation with the world's leading economies is vital to secure investment into the UK, and create the jobs needed to catalyse growth," Starmer said in a statement.</p>

<p>China is Britain's sixth-largest trading partner, accounting for 5% of goods and services trade worth 86.5 billion pounds ($112 billion), while Britain has a 1.2% market share of Chinese trade.</p>

<p>Xi and Starmer spoke for the first time in August, with the British prime minister stating that the two countries must be able to talk frankly about their disagreements while pursuing closer economic ties. Xi responded that he hoped Britain would treat China "objectively and rationally."</p>

<p>The Labour administration, which took power in July, has commissioned an audit of the UK-China relationship, and a more pro-business approach will draw fierce criticism from the opposition Conservative party which remains wary of Beijing.</p>

<p>British Foreign Secretary David Lammy visited China last month and finance minister Rachel Reeves is considering travelling to Beijing in early 2025.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two masked men broke into Britain's royal Windsor Castle estate last month and stole two vehicles from a barn, the Sun newspaper reported on Monday.</p>

<p>King Charles and his wife Camilla were not in the estate at the time of the incident but Prince William and his family were believed to be at Adelaide Cottage, part of the Windsor Castle estate, the Sun reported.</p>

<p>The men used a stolen truck to break through a security gate at night and then scaled a six-foot fence, the paper said.</p>

<p>Local police said officers were called to a report of a burglary on Crown Estate land in Windsor, west of London, just before midnight on Oct. 13.</p>

<p>"Offenders entered a farm building and made off with a black Isuzu pick-up and a red quad bike. They then made off towards the Old Windsor/Datchet area," Thames Valley Police told the newspaper. "No arrests have been made at this stage and an investigation is ongoing."</p>

<p>Windsor Castle previously faced a security scare in 2021 when authorities arrested a man with a crossbow in the grounds of the castle who said he had wanted to kill Queen Elizabeth.<br />

A video of Hana-Rawhiti Kareariki Maipi-Clarke soon took social media by storm on Thursday, with many appreciating the 22-year-old Te Pati Maori MP's bold statement.<br />
<br />
Ms Maipi-Clarke was joined by other MPs and spectators in the gallery. Moments later, speaker Gerry Brownlee briefly suspended the session.<br />
<br />
<strong>Who is Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>At 22, Hana-Rawhiti Kareariki Maipi-Clarke is the youngest sitting Member of Parliament in New Zealand in nearly two centuries. She represents Te Pati Maori in New Zealand's Parliament.</li>
	<li>Ms Maipi-Clarke studied at Te Wharekura o Rākaumangamanga in Huntly, New Zealand.</li>
	<li>She made headlines after being elected in the 2023 New Zealand elections. She performed the traditional haka during her maiden speech as well.</li>
	<li>Ms Maipi-Clarke gained attention in a local poll, where she was listed among the top five “preferred Prime Minister” candidates after Luxon's popularity dropped due to controversial policies. Both she and her father were considered candidates to represent Te Pati Maori in the 2023 elections. Ms Maipi-Clarke was ultimately chosen for her “youthful perspective.”</li>
	<li>She has been a vocal critic of Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and his conservative government, accusing them of undermining Maori rights.</li>
	<li>At 17, she <a href="http:// https://www.teaonews.co.nz/2020/07/03/17-year-old-launches-book-about-maramataka-maori/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">published a book</a> called <em>Maahina,</em> focusing on maramataka, the Maori lunar calendar. She was inspired to explore this topic after attending a lecture by Rangi Matamua on Matariki.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Last year, she led a training course for the New Zealand Warriors about maramataka and Matariki.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Developing countries are more vulnerable to antimicrobial resistance -- a global health concern affecting the effectiveness of life-saving medicines and the management of infectious diseases worldwide, said Saima Wazed, World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for South-East Asia on Monday.</p>

<p>World Antimicrobial Awareness Week (WAAW), celebrated every year from November 18-24, aims to increase awareness of global antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and to encourage best practices. This year's theme, “Educate. Advocate. Act now”, reflects the urgency and commitment needed to combat AMR at every level.</p>

<p>As per the WHO, an estimated 1.27 million global deaths in 2019 were directly the result of bacterial AMR, and it also contributed to 4.95 million deaths.</p>

<p>Wazed cited increased population, limited access to healthcare, and misuse of antimicrobials as major risk factors for raising the risks for AMR in developing nations.</p>

<p>“The urgency of addressing AMR is clear. High population density, restricted healthcare access, and the misuse of antimicrobials amplify the risks and impacts of AMR,” the Regional Director said.</p>

<p>She stated that this year, WAAW comes after the landmark approval of the 2024 Political Declaration on AMR at the 79th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) High-Level Meeting on AMR, and the 4th Global High-Level Ministerial Conference, in Jeddah.</p>

<p>“This significant declaration sets ambitious targets while also establishing sustainable financing for AMR action, including the target of at least 60 per cent of countries implementing funded national action plans by 2030,” Wazed said.</p>

<p>To address the threat of AMR, she urged the global community to take immediate and decisive action “by educating all stakeholders on AMR, advocating for bold political and financial commitments, and ensuring concrete actions are taken”.</p>

<p>“The choices we make today will impact the health of future generations. Your commitment and leadership are key to transforming declarations and commitments into outcomes and impact,” Wazed said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A funeral home in Japan has introduced a unique "coffin cafe", allowing visitors to lie in caskets and reflect on life and death. The 120-year-old Kajiya Honten funeral home transformed its first floor into a surreal space for this experience. Visitors can step into one of three intricately designed coffins – gold, green, or yellow – each having floral motifs.</p>

<p>It was launched in September by Kajiya Honten in Futtsu, Chiba Prefecture, The South China Morning Post reported.<br />
<iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="709" scrolling="no" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fwasoukukankajiya%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0dPHvkHHkQ84wjBetD5uMtmKL6pvFD7HuzHkTcf7nMCc8T8aTBDNFhwGQA5zWF39ql&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=500" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" width="500"></iframe><br />
The “coffin-lying” experience costs 2,200 yen (approximately Rs 2,000) and provides individuals or couples the opportunity to lie in a casket and contemplate their lives. For some, this has even turned into a photo opportunity.</p>

<p>The inspiration for the cafe comes from a deeply personal place for Kajiya Honten's president, Kiyotaka Hirano. He lost his father unexpectedly at the age of 24 – an event that profoundly shaped his views on life and death.</p>

<p>“Some people may want to close the coffin lid for a few minutes to consider how they want to live before their time comes,” Mr Hirano said, as per <a href="https://theindependent.sg/coffin-cafe-japans-funeral-homes-let-young-people-lie-in-death-to-reflect-on-life/ " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">The Independent</a>.</p>

<p>He describes the activity as a symbolic “rebirth.” Mr Hirano added, “Coming out of the coffin can symbolise a reset – a chance to begin anew. We hope people leave feeling revitalised and ready to live their lives more fully.”</p>

<p>Kajiya Honten also offers services such as personalised coffin designs, floral arrangements, and even memorial urns. Mr Hirano sees the cafe as part of this evolution.</p>

<p>Japan's funeral industry has faced declining demand due to demographic and cultural shifts. A 2023 survey by Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry revealed a 16 per cent drop in funeral costs over the past decade. The concept has garnered attention both locally and abroad, including from Chinese social media users.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Work from Home (WFH) is beneficial in terms of saving on rentals, reduced commuting stress and increased efficiency for employees and but it is detrimental to effective communication and Teamwork says a report.</p>

<p>The report by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the Faculty of Management Studies (FMS) reveals that while work-from-home (WFH) has brought substantial benefits, it also presents significant challenges for both employers and employees.</p>

<p>The study highlighted that WFH has led to considerable cost savings for organizations and employees. It said ". In terms of cost savings, remote working has enabled a very significant reduction in employee commuting time and costs and provided them with the flexibility to live in more affordable areas".</p>

<p>This has not only improved their energy levels but also enhanced their flexibility in choosing affordable residential locations.</p>

<p>However, the study also highlights some downsides of remote working. A key concern is the negative impact on effective communication and teamwork. The absence of physical interactions has hindered collaboration among employees, which is essential for building trust and solving complex problems.</p>

<p>For organizations, the report noted that remote and hybrid working models have allowed moderate savings on office rental costs and costs associated with client meetings.</p>

<p>Additionally, the reduction in employee commuting and accommodation costs has enabled limited adjustments in employee compensation structures. These cost savings collectively contribute to better financial efficiency for both employers and employees.</p>

<p>Moreover, the study warns that WFH may pose challenges to developing and sustaining an organization's culture. Over time, this could affect the formation of social, emotional, and human capital, which are vital for long-term organizational success.</p>

<p>The report emphasized that while remote working offers tangible short-term benefits, organizations and employees must remain cautious about the potential intangible losses it may bring in the future.</p>

<p>Balancing flexibility with opportunities for collaboration and interaction could be the way forward to make remote working sustainable in the long run.</p>

<p>It said "These losses may be intangible in nature, relating to the formation and sustenance of social, emotional, and human capital".</p>

<p>The findings provide food for thought for organizations seeking to optimize their work models in a rapidly changing professional environment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An alligator was found in a creek in Rockland County, New York, sparking widespread confusion and curiosity about how it ended up there. On November 14, the Haverstraw Police Department shared on social media that a juvenile alligator was pulled from the Minisceongo Creek.</p>

<p>In a post on Facebook, the Haverstraw Police Department said their “personnel assisted in successfully removing the alligator from the water,” and added, “the Hudson Valley Humane Society of Pomona responded to the scene to take possession and care of the alligator.”</p>

<p>The discovery immediately caught the attention of locals, many of whom voiced their surprise and confusion online. “Had to be a pet. Illegally I'm sure,” one Facebook user commented, while another suggested, “People need to stop getting them as pets,” speculating that the alligator might have been a pet abandoned in the cold water.<br />
<iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="524" scrolling="no" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhaverstrawpolice.org%2Fposts%2Fpfbid029kxgmWvFvnqfQfxqCS4cdpzgmbvyeJAyFfsWApn7PVz4UVFoYWsrs9CBRN4e7Amdl&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=500" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" width="500"></iframe><br />
In response to the situation, the Hudson Valley Humane Society praised the quick actions of the Haverstraw police. “Many thanks to the incredible response from the Haverstraw Police Department today regarding an alligator in the Minisceongo Creek (Garnerville, NY) who needed rescue. Their quick-thinking and professionalism helped to get this juvenile alligator to safety at the Hudson Valley Humane Society. Currently, this gator is warming up from the cold water,” the organisation wrote on Facebook.</p>

<p>The alligator was safely handed over to the Humane Society staff for care. A Bronx Zoo herpetologist later confirmed the alligator was a male and in good health despite its ordeal.</p>

<p>The big question remains — how did the alligator, which is not native to upstate New York, end up in the creek?</p>

<p>By November 15, the Hudson Valley Humane Society shared an update, saying the alligator, named Philippe, had been moved to Reptile Encounters, a reptile rescue centre in Saugerties, New York, run by Mark Perpetua.</p>

<p>It is illegal to own an alligator in New York but authorities have noted that many people purchase young alligators as pets and later abandon them once the animals grow too large.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA["Then the moment they got an opportunity, with AI, to increase shareholder returns... every single one of them slammed the red button," climate activist Sage Lenier said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology firms are ceaselessly promoting new AI products, but climate activist Sage Lenier says AI is useless, unsustainable and has given the industry an existential problem.</p>

<p>"AI has no benefit to society," she told AFP on the sidelines of the Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon.</p>

<p>The CEOs who have become enraptured by a "useless" product class have smashed the idea of tech as an essential utility.</p>

<p>"And now they have an existential problem," she said.</p>

<p>Lenier first garnered attention as a 19-year-old student in 2018 when she founded and led a course at the University of California, Berkeley, titled "Solutions for a Sustainable &amp; Just Future".</p>

<p>She has said students like her were sick of the kind of climate education that offered no hope -- she wanted to focus on the solutions not just the problems.</p>

<p>Hundreds joined the course at Berkeley over the years and eventually hundreds more online, and Lenier has since built a nonprofit around it and now hopes to launch a documentary series.</p>

<p>The California native, who now lives in New York, said she was largely positive about tech.</p>

<p>But her climate focus makes her an outsider at the Web Summit -- "I'll keep coming if they want me to shout at them," she said.</p>

<p>Last year, she told the crowd: "Some of you could be considered directly responsible for architecting the ecological crisis."</p>

<p>She implored tech bosses to embrace the circular economy, which relies on reusing and recycling rather than creating products that end up being junked.</p>

<p>But one year on, Microsoft, Google and others have unleashed an endless stream of energy-gobbling AI products.</p>

<p>They have rushed to reopen nuclear plants, pledged to build many more data centres -- and crashed through their climate targets.</p>

<h3><strong>'Waste of emissions'</strong>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Yet AI, Lenier said, "has a million negatives".</p>

<p>"It is terrible for the planet. It's terrible for every community that you're running data centres in. And it's useless. I think it's just a waste of emissions," she said.</p>

<p>She points out that it was not always this way in the tech sector.</p>

<p>"It was the only industry, at least in America, where for years and years they tried to portray themselves as clean, green and pro-future," she said.</p>

<p>"Bill Gates has written multiple books on climate change."</p>

<p>The CEOs really want the image, and succeeded in dodging the kind of scrutiny put on the fashion and automotive industries.</p>

<p>"Then the moment they got an opportunity, with AI, to increase shareholder returns... every single one of them slammed the red button," she said.</p>

<h3><strong>'So bad so fast'</strong>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Although Lenier came to prominence by focusing attention on the solutions to the climate crisis, she sees a bleak future coming within a generation.</p>

<p>"Shit is going to get so bad so fast. The food chain is going to break. We will see mass malnourishment if not mass starvation," she said.</p>

<p>The power grid, too, will break down.</p>

<p>Against this background, products like cars and new clothes are superfluous.</p>

<p>"You can't have cars in the long term. It doesn't matter if they're electric or not. They're unsustainable," she said.</p>

<p>"We can't be producing 80 billion garments of clothing a year in a low carbon future."</p>

<p>A year ago, she said she might have argued that tech was something different.</p>

<p>"It's a piece of our infrastructure, we built our societies around it," she said.</p>

<p>But with AI, "they've given themselves their own little fast fashion".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The viral footage, captured by American paragliding enthusiast Alex Lang and shared online by his friend Marshall Mosher, showed Apollo - the dog - fearlessly climbing the 136-metre monument.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beneath the blazing Egyptian sun, crowds at the Giza Pyramids gazed up at the ancient wonders, but some had their eyes peeled for a new attraction.</p>

<p>"There he is," one Polish tourist told his wife as they spotted a scrappy dog perched on one of the stones.</p>

<p>They were talking about Apollo, a stray who became an overnight sensation last month after being filmed scaling the Great Pyramid of Khafre, one of the seven wonders of the world.</p>

<p>The viral footage, captured by American paragliding enthusiast Alex Lang and shared online by his friend Marshall Mosher, showed Apollo fearlessly climbing the 136-metre monument, barking at birds from the summit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"He was acting like a king," Lang told AFP.</p>

<p>As news of Apollo's daring climb spread worldwide, interest grew in the dogs who have long made their homes among the ancient stones.</p>

<p>"He is climbing over there," said Arkadiusz Jurys, a tourist from Poland, craning his neck for a better view.</p>

<p>"It is unusual," he added, describing Apollo as surveying the picture-snapping crowd from above.</p>

<p>Another visitor, Diego Vega from Argentina, felt a special bond with the dogs.</p>

<p>"Connecting with them feels like connecting with the pharaohs," he said, while petting a member of Apollo's pack.</p>

<h3><strong>Sales up</strong></h3>

<p>Apollo's newfound fame has even inspired local guides to include him and his pack in their stories for tourists.</p>

<p>"This is Anubis," one tour guide told two American tourists, comparing Apollo, now known as the "pyramid puppy", with the ancient Egyptian god of the dead, often depicted as a man with a jackal's head.</p>

<p>"He and his pack are now part of our tour conversations," said Sobhi Fakhry, another tour guide.</p>

<p>Businesses around the Giza plateau are also seeing a boost.</p>

<p>Umm Basma, a 43-year-old woman selling souvenirs near the Khafre pyramid, reported an increase in sales thanks to the influx of tourists eager to meet the so-called pyramid dogs.</p>

<p>"We've always seen these dogs climbing the pyramids, but we never thought they would become a blessing for us," she said.</p>

<p>One pyramid guard, who preferred to remain anonymous, also said that some celebrities had paid for permits to have their own dogs photographed with Apollo.</p>

<p>Apollo, a three-year-old Baladi dog, is part of a pack of about eight that has made their home among the ancient ruins.</p>

<p>The dogs, a local breed, are known for their resilience, intelligence and ability to survive in Egypt's harsh climate.</p>

<p>Ibrahim el-Bendary, co-founder of the American Cairo Animal Rescue Foundation, which monitors the pyramid dogs, described Apollo as the pack's "alpha male".</p>

<p>"He is the bravest and strongest in his pack," he said.</p>

<p>Apollo was born in a rocky crevice within the Khafre pyramid where his mother, Laika, found shelter. Sadly, some of Apollo's siblings did not survive the site's perilous heights.</p>

<p>A sympathetic guard eventually relocated Laika to a safer spot where Apollo now stands out with his distinctive curled tail and confident nature.</p>

<h3><strong>Dog adoptions</strong></h3>

<p>The initial focus of Lang and Marshall was the daring canine climber, but their visit led to a deeper connection with Cairo's stray dogs.</p>

<p>Intrigued by the challenges they face, Mosher decided to adopt a puppy from the pack: Anubi, who is Apollo's daughter.</p>

<p>Anubi will join Marshall in the US after she receives the dedicated care she needs in Egypt to grow up healthy.</p>

<p>At the pyramids, local animal care groups are now working with the government in order to set up food and water stations for the strays, as well as for other animals including camels and horses.</p>

<p>A permanent veterinary centre will be established at the pyramids with staff set to receive animal care training, said Egypt's tourism minister.</p>

<p>Vicki Michelle Brown, the other co-founder of the American Cairo Animal Rescue Foundation, believes that Apollo's story can make a difference.</p>

<p>"It sheds so much light on the dogs and cats that are here," Brown said.</p>

<p>"I definitely believe him (Apollo) climbing the pyramids can help all of the dogs in Egypt to have a better life."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The A321XLR, standing for "Xtra Long Range," is the longest-range commercial aircraft in its class, capable of flying up to 8,700 km.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An advanced single-aisle aircraft, designed for long-haul routes, made its inaugural flight on Thursday, flying from Madrid to Boston. The sleek, fuel-efficient Airbus A321XLR, equipped with a third fuel tank for extended range, completed its maiden journey with Iberia Airlines.</p>

<p>The A321XLR, standing for "Xtra Long Range," is the longest-range commercial aircraft in its class, capable of flying up to about 8,700 km. This is slightly more than the distance from New York to Istanbul. Airbus claims the A321XLR uses 30 per cent less fuel per seat compared to previous aircraft models, making it an economical choice for airlines and a more sustainable option for long-distance flights.<br />
<br />
With its impressive range, the A321XLR opens up new possibilities for airlines to operate routes previously considered impractical with larger, less efficient planes. Irish airline Aer Lingus plans to use the aircraft for new long-haul services, including routes from Dublin to Nashville and Indianapolis, next year.<br />
<br />
Aviation expert Miquel Ros, who previewed the A321XLR on the ground, focussed on the cabin's balance between space and efficiency. He described the business class seats as “slightly narrower than the ones on the airline's twin-aisle aircraft, but they still offer a clearly differentiated premium experience as well as the ability to sleep flat,” <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/16/travel/travel-news-airbus-a321xlr-single-aisle/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">CNN</a>&nbsp;reported.<br />
<br />
Mr Ros also said the “economy class offers a pitch similar to that found on larger aircraft types as well as the same inflight entertainment system.” He praised the two “state-of-the-art” food galleys, designed to accommodate the aircraft's smaller cabin.<br />
<br />
The A321XLR's ability to access lesser-known destinations could help ease the pressure on some of the world's most visited tourist spots, which are struggling with overcrowding.<br />
<br />
The launch of the A321XLR is not the only exciting news in the aviation industry. Singapore Airlines is retrofitting its Airbus A350-900s, which operate the world's longest nonstop flights between Singapore and New York. The retrofit will include first-class seats on select aircraft.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[G20 leaders gather in Brazil on Monday to discuss fighting poverty, boosting climate financing and other multilateral initiatives that could yet be upended by Donald Trump's impending return to the White House.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>G20 leaders gather in Brazil on Monday to discuss fighting poverty, boosting climate financing and other multilateral initiatives that could yet be upended by Donald Trump's impending return to the White House.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden will attend his last summit of the world's leading economies but only as a lame duck whom other leaders are already looking beyond.</p>

<p>The main star of the show is expected to be Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has cast himself as a global statesman and protector of free trade in the face of Trump's "America First" agenda.</p>

<p>Brazil's left-wing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will be using his hosting duties to highlight his championing of Global South issues and the fight against climate change.</p>

<p>The summit venue is Rio de Janeiro's stunning bayside museum of modern art.</p>

<p>Security is tight for the gathering, which comes days after a failed bomb attack on Brazil's Supreme Court in Brasilia by a suspected far-right extremist, who killed himself in the process.</p>

<p>The summit will cap a farewell diplomatic tour by Biden which took him to Lima for a meeting of Asia-Pacific trading partners, and then to the Amazon in the first such visit for a sitting US president.</p>

<p>Biden, who has looked to burnish his legacy as time runs down on his presidency, has insisted his climate record would survive another Trump mandate.</p>

<h3><strong>Spotlight on climate</strong></h3>

<p>The G20 meet is happening at the same time as the COP29 climate conference in Azerbaijan, which has stalled on the issue of greater climate finance for developing countries.</p>

<p>All eyes have turned to Rio for a breakthrough.</p>

<p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for G20 members, who account for 80 percent of global emissions, to show "leadership and compromise" to facilitate a deal.</p>

<p>A Brazilian diplomatic source said fast-developing nations like China were refusing pressure by rich countries to join them in funding global climate projects but added that he was hopeful of progress at the summit.</p>

<p>The meeting comes in a year marked by another grim litany of extreme weather events, including Brazil's worst wildfire season in over a decade, fuelled by a record drought blamed at least partly on climate change.</p>

<p>At the last G20 in India, leaders called for a tripling of renewable energy sources by the end of the decade, but without explicitly calling for an end to the use of fossil fuels.</p>

<p>One invited leader who declined to come to Rio is Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose arrest is sought by the International Criminal Court and who said his presence would "wreck" the gathering.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lula, 79, told Brazil's GloboNews channel on Sunday that the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East would be kept off the summit agenda to focus on the poor.</p>

<p>"Because if not, we will not discuss other things which are more important for people that are not at war, who are poor people and invisible to the world," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>Taxing billionaires</strong></h3>

<p>The summit will open on Monday with Lula, a former steelworker who grew up in poverty, launching a "Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty."</p>

<p>"What I want to say to the 733 million people who are hungry in the world, children who go to sleep and wake up not being sure if they will have any food to put in their mouths, is: today there isn't any, but tomorrow there will be," Lula said on the weekend.</p>

<p>Brazil is also pushing for higher taxes on billionaires.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lula had faced resistance to parts of his agenda from Argentina but on Sunday a Brazilian diplomatic source said negotiators from all G20 members had agreed on a draft final statement to be put to their respective leaders.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/4nh8gds_pm-modi-nigeria_625x300_17_November_24.jpeg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>

<p>It was a moment of great pride for India when the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, conferred Nigeria's highest civilian award, the 'Grand Commander of the Order of Niger', on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This honour recognised Modi's statesmanship and significant contributions to fostering ties between the two countries through his visionary leadership.</p>

<p>Two aspects of this recognition stand out. Firstly, Modi is the first foreign leader to receive this award since 1969. Secondly, this accolade underscores India's emergence as a global powerhouse, highlighting the trust and recognition Modi has gained for his commitment to the Global South. The only other foreign dignitary to receive this honour was Queen Elizabeth, shortly after Nigeria gained independence.</p>

<h2><strong>The G20 Invitation</strong></h2>

<p>One of the most cherished moments during India's hosting of the G20 summit in September last year was Prime Minister Modi's invitation for the African Union, represented by Chairperson Azali Assoumani, to join the G20 as a permanent member. The African Union, comprising 55 member states, now holds the same status as the European Union—the only other regional bloc with full membership. This move symbolised India's dedication to fostering inclusive global governance and amplifying Africa's voice on the world stage.</p>

<p>India's relationship with African nations has deep roots, but despite decades of diplomatic rhetoric, these ties often remained lukewarm. To Modi's credit, he has revitalised India-Africa relations, making them a priority and pursuing multi-dimensional partnerships. Many view this as India's strategic response to China's growing influence in the region.</p>

<p>Modi has ushered in a new era of multilateralism by bringing the concerns of the Global South into the mainstream international discourse. His approach reflects a commitment to ensuring that developing nations have a say in shaping the global narrative. To an external observer, it appears that Modi has personalised diplomacy while keeping India's national interests paramount.</p>

<h2><strong>An Old Association</strong></h2>

<p>Modi's interest in Africa predates his tenure as Prime Minister. Before 2014, as Chief Minister of Gujarat, Modi initiated efforts to engage with African nations. While the Gujarati community has long-standing ties with Africa, official engagement between Gujarat and African countries had been minimal. In 2009, Modi visited Uganda to invite investors to the Vibrant Gujarat Global Investors Summit. In 2011, he hosted Rwanda's Prime Minister, Bernard Makuza, at the summit, fostering investment alliances that laid the groundwork for deeper bilateral relations. These connections have strengthened further during Modi's time as Prime Minister as his government expanded its foreign policy initiatives.</p>

<p>Consider the following milestones that have bolstered India's relations with Africa under Modi's leadership:</p>

<ul>
	<li>In 2015, India hosted the 3rd India-Africa Forum Summit in New Delhi, which saw participation from African nations increase more than fourfold, signalling a shift towards deeper and more comprehensive engagement.</li>
	<li>During the COVID-19 pandemic, India's unwavering support reinforced its “first responder” philosophy, supplying vaccines and essential medical supplies to at least 25 African nations.</li>
	<li>In 2022, former Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga expressed his gratitude to Modi, sharing how Ayurveda restored his daughter's eyesight. Odinga even encouraged Modi to bring Ayurveda to Africa, suggesting it could harness indigenous plants for therapeutic use and benefit countless people.</li>
	<li>Over the past decade, India has significantly boosted its development partnership with Africa, investing over $12.37 billion in 206 infrastructure projects across 43 African countries.</li>
	<li>Nearly 40,000 Africans have received training in India through the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) program over the last 10 years.</li>
	<li>India launched the second phase of its tele-education and telemedicine project, and since 2019, more than 15,000 youth from 22 African countries have received scholarships for various technical degree and diploma courses.</li>
</ul>

<p>For many Indians, their understanding of Africa is rooted in its connection with Mahatma Gandhi. While Gandhi laid the philosophical foundation for India-Africa solidarity, some argue that Modi has transformed that vision into actionable, impactful policies, making it a cornerstone of India's global strategy.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris on Thursday slammed Donald Trump for "very offensive" remarks about women as she pressed her case that his misogyny has no place in 21st century America, just days ahead of a nail-biter election.</p>

<p>With each candidate seeking even the slightest of advantages, they took their knife-edge White House race to western battleground states, homing in on immigration and wooing Latinos five days before voting concludes November 5.</p>

<p>In one of three stops in the West, Trump painted a dark picture of immigration run amok as he addressed supporters in border state New Mexico, saying migrants are "unleashing a violent killing spree all across America."</p>

<p>There is no evidence of a migrant crime wave in the United States.</p>

<p>As the Democratic vice president and Republican former president chase one another through the seven swing states expected to decide the election, Harris is conveying a more upbeat message, with her final stop of the day at a star-studded rally in Las Vegas, where she was introduced by pop maven Jennifer Lopez.</p>

<p>Harris targeted Trump over his remarks when he told a Wednesday rally he wanted to "protect" American women "whether the women like it or not."</p>

<p>She branded the comments "offensive to everybody."&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>'Yes we can'</strong></h3>

<p>In Las Vegas, she slammed Trump as a man who "simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to be able to make decisions about their own lives."</p>

<p>"And we know if he were elected, he would ban abortion nationwide, restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and for states, listen to this, to monitor women's pregnancies."</p>

<p>Reproductive rights have served as a rallying cry for Democrats -- and an Achilles' heel of sorts for Trump -- since the conservative-dominated US Supreme Court ended the federal right to abortion in 2022.</p>

<p>Polling for this year's election shows a wide gender gap, with women voters tilting toward Harris, and Trump earning more support from men, so abortion could play a determining role in the outcome.</p>

<p>Trump's three stops were characterized by his now-usual stream of insults, including against Democrats Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Harris.</p>

<p>"She destroyed our economy," Trump said, referring to a period that, contrary to his criticism, is showing robust US growth, low unemployment and increasing consumer confidence, despite voter concerns about high prices.</p>

<p>In what was billed as an interview with right-wing provocateur Tucker Carlson, Trump got personal again, calling the vice president "a low IQ individual... dumb as a rock."</p>

<p>Carlson, who once texted a colleague that he hated Trump "passionately", had given the former president a fawning introduction, and said he would be proudly voting for him.</p>

<h3><strong>'I love Hispanics'</strong></h3>

<p>Trump is betting frustrations over the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policy will swing border state Arizona back in his favor after Biden beat Trump there in 2020.</p>

<p>His appearance in New Mexico was a head-scratcher, though, given that polls suggest Harris will carry the state. Nevertheless he courted Hispanic voters there.</p>

<p>"I love Hispanics. They are hard workers," said Trump, who faced backlash from Puerto Ricans earlier in the week after a racist comment by a warm-up speaker at a rally. "And they are warm -- sometimes they are too warm, if you want to know the truth."</p>

<p>On Thursday night, J Lo became the latest person of Puerto Rican heritage to lash Trump for the jibe.</p>

<p>"He reminded us who he really is and how he really feels," she told a cheering crowd.</p>

<p>"It wasn't just Puerto Ricans that were offended that day, okay? It was every Latino in this country, it was humanity and anyone of decent character."</p>

<p>Latinos traditionally have aligned more with Democrats, but recent polling shows a noticeable trend toward Republicans.</p>

<p>In Nevada, Trump also confirmed that he had sued US television network CBS for $10 billion over an interview given by Harris this month to its flagship news show, "60 Minutes."</p>

<p>According to the complaint, Harris gave a confusing answer to a question on the Biden administration's handling of Israel's war in Gaza, and CBS edited the answer to cover up "word salad."</p>

<p>Trump -- whose own rhetorical meanderings have at times been glossed over by the press in a practice some have dubbed "sanewashing" -- called it "election interference fraud." CBS has denied the accusation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The latest New York Times/Siena poll showed Harris with 52 percent support among Hispanic voters to Trump's 42 percent.</p>

<p>More cat-and-mouse campaigning occurs Friday in Wisconsin, where both candidates will hold rallies in Milwaukee.</p>

<p>Some 63.5 million Americans have cast their ballots early, more than 40 percent of the 2020 total vote.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese posted a few photos on his X handle of himself celebrating the Bandi Chhor Divas, a big day for the Sikh community, on Friday (November 1). It marks the release of 52 Hindu princes from the Gwalior fort with the help of the sixth Guru Hargobind Sahib on Diwali and hence is celebrated as the sacred day. On Bandi Chhor divas (Prisoner Liberation Day), Guru Hargobind returned to Amritsar along with 52 princes who were imprisoned by the Mughal emperor Jahangir in 1619.</p>

<p>Mr Albanese wished the Sikhs on Bandi Chhor Divas and visited a gurdwara in Glenwood.</p>

<p>"Happy Bandi Chhor Divas! Wonderful to celebrate at Gurdwara Sahib Glenwood today and open the newly expanded kitchen, serving thousands of people every week," he said on X.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The accompanying photos show the Australian Prime Minister smiling while wearing a turban, and posing with people at the gurdwara for selfies.</p>

<p>"You look smart Prime Minister Anthony Albanese," one X user said while commenting on the Australian leader's post. "Thanks for the warm wishes," said another.</p>

<p>According to non-profit Sikh Youth Australia, Sikhism is the fastest-growing religious group in Australia and ranks as the fifth-largest religious community in the country.</p>

<p>The state of Victoria hosts the largest Sikh population in Australia, followed by New South Wales and Queensland, where significant Sikh communities are also present.</p>

<h3><strong>The history of Bandi Chhor Divas</strong></h3>

<p>According to the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), to stop the Sikh faith from flourishing, Mughal emperor Jahangir imprisoned Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib at Gwalior Fort.</p>

<p>Jahangir fell ill and could not get well despite efforts. To get rid of his illness, Sufi Saint Sain Mian Mir advised Jahangir to release Guru Hargobind Sahib.</p>

<p>Guru Hargobind Singh refused to be released alone. Jahangir said whoever can come out holding a 'palla' (end portion of a robe) of imprisoned Guru, can be released. The Guru got a special robe stitched, holding which 52 imprisoned princes got released from jail.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Perseverance rover, currently roaming the red, rocky surface of Mars, captured a video of the partial eclipse in the atmosphere as Phobos crossed in front of the Sun, giving the illusion of what NASA referred to as 'googly eye'. The potato-shaped Martian moon was passing directly between the Sun and a point on the surface of Mars, obscuring a large part of the Sun's disc when it was clicked by Perseverance's Mastcam-Z camera on its 1,285th day (September 30) on the Red Planet.</p>

<p>"Ever feel like someone's watching you? That's how I felt when I observed this transit of the Martian moon Phobos! The pupil in this "googly eye" is the potato-shaped moon, and the iris is our Sun," the X (formerly Twitter) handle of Perseverance captioned the intriguing video.</p>

<p>Since landing at Mars' Jezero Crater in February 2021, Perseverance has captured several Phobos transits. Curiosity captured a video in 2019 while Opportunity captured an image in 2004.</p>

<h2><strong>About Phobos</strong></h2>

<p>Phobos was discovered in 1877 by Asaph Hall who named it based on the mythological sons of Ares, the Greek counterpart of the Roman god, Mars. Phobos means fear and is the brother of Deimos.</p>

<p>Phobos is larger than Deimos, measuring 27 by 22 by 18 kilometres in diameter. It orbits Mars three times a day and is so close to the planet's surface that in some locations on Mars it cannot always be seen.</p>

<p>Phobos' proximity to Mars means it is set on a collision course with the Red Planet. It is nearing Mars at a rate of six feet (1.8 meters) every hundred years which means it will either crash into Mars in 50 million years or break up into a ring.</p>

<h2><strong>Sign of life on Mars</strong></h2>

<p>In July this year, the rover discovered an intriguing rock sample, nicknamed "Cheyava Falls," which contains organic molecules and structures that could have been formed by microbial life.</p>

<p>''The rock exhibits chemical signatures and structures that could possibly have been formed by life billions of years ago when the area being explored by the rover contained running water,'' NASA said at the time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft Corp, which is struggling to bring data centers online fast enough to meet the demand for its artificial intelligence products, hired one of the engineering chiefs who kept Facebook's infrastructure humming.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jay Parikh will join the senior leadership team and report to Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive officer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There are very few leaders in our industry with Jay's experience in leading teams through the rapid growth and scale required to support today's largest internet businesses," Nadella said Thursday in an internal email, which the Redmond, Washington-based company also posted on its corporate blog.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parikh, who most recently ran cloud security startup Lacework, previously led engineering at Facebook, now Meta Platforms Inc. Nadella said the company would share details on Parikh's role in "the next few months."</p>

<p>A Microsoft spokesperson didn't immediately comment beyond the CEO's note.</p>

<p>Parikh joined Facebook in 2009 and spent more than a decade there, working on technical infrastructure and data center projects that helped the company grow into the world's largest social network.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meta broke ground on more than a dozen data centers around the world while Parikh was there. As many technology companies unplugged their own data centers in favor of rented computing power from Microsoft or Amazon.com Inc., Meta remained one of the few companies capable of building cutting-edge server farms at a massive scale.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parikh oversaw several other technical projects, including Meta's efforts in subsea cables and its ill-fated Aquila drone project intended to beam wireless internet down to rural places in the US.</p>

<p>Microsoft, which operates subsea cable and data center design projects of its own, is increasingly focused on infrastructure projects that can help it wring greater power and efficiency from its network. Thanks largely to its partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Microsoft is at the forefront of the effort to build tools that rely on generative artificial intelligence. The company is racing to build data centers and chips to back that effort.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Microsoft forecast slower growth in its critical Azure cloud business as the company struggles to get data centers up and running fast enough to meet demand.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan&nbsp;President Asif Ali Zardari has fractured his foot while deboarding an airplane upon his arrival at the Dubai International Airport.</p>

<p>The incident occurred on Wednesday night , but his office confirmed it only late on Thursday night.</p>

<p>According to a statement from the President House, he was immediately taken to a hospital for treatment following the fall. The doctor placed his foot in a cast after a check-up. "The cast will remain on his foot for four weeks," the statement read.</p>

<p>It added that President Zardari was sent home and advised complete rest.</p>

<p>The Dawn reported that the 69-year-old president has had multiple health issues in recent years.</p>

<p>In March 2023, he underwent an eye surgery in the United Arab Emirates.</p>

<p>In 2022, he was admitted to Karachi's Dr Ziauddin Hospital for a week for treatment of a chest infection. Amid rumours of ill health, his personal physician and close aide Dr Asim Hussain took to social media platform X, formerly Twitter, to confirm that he "is in good health".</p>

<p>He tested positive for Covid-19 in July 2022 with "mild symptoms:, according to his son and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.</p>

<p>A year prior to that, Zardari was admitted to a private hospital in Karachi due to "exertion and exhaustion”" caused by frequent travelling.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indonesia said it has banned sales of smartphones made by Alphabet's Google due to rules requiring the use of locally manufactured components, days after blocking sales of tech giant Apple's iPhone 16 for the same reason.</p>

<p>Indonesia blocked sales of Google Pixel phones because the company has not met the rules that necessitate certain smartphones sold domestically to contain at least 40% of parts manufactured locally.</p>

<p>"We are pushing these rules so that there's fairness for all investors in Indonesia," Febri Hendri Antoni Arief, industry ministry spokesperson, said on Thursday. "Google's products have not adhered to the scheme we set, so they can't be sold here."</p>

<p>Febri said consumers can buy Google Pixel phones overseas, so long as they pay the necessary taxes, adding the country would consider deactivating the phones that are illicitly sold.</p>

<p>Google did not immediately respond to a message and email requesting comment.</p>

<p>The block comes a week after Indonesia said it had blocked the sales of<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gadgets360.com/mobiles/news/apple-iphone-16-series-sales-in-indonesia-blocked-6891398"> iPhone 16</a> domestically, also for not meeting local content rules.</p>

<p>Companies usually increase the use of domestic components to meet such rules through partnerships with local suppliers or by sourcing parts domestically.</p>

<p>Google and Apple are not among the top smartphone makers in Indonesia. The top two smartphone makers in the first quarter of 2024 were Chinese firm OPPO and South Korean firm Samsung, research firm IDC said in May.</p>

<p>Indonesia has a huge, tech-savvy population, making the Southeast Asian nation a key target market for tech-related investment.</p>

<p>Bhima Yudhistira, director of the Center of Economic and Law Studies think tank, said the move was "pseudo" protectionism that hurts consumers and impacts investor confidence.</p>

<p>"This creates a negative sentiment for investors looking to enter Indonesia," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On a bright Sunday afternoon, two men walked door to door through a Forsyth County, Georgia, neighborhood on a mission to get out the vote for Democrats.</p>

<p>Just three decades ago, this area 40 miles north of Atlanta was part of an almost entirely White, Republican-dominated exurban district that sent Newt Gingrich to Congress. It was the scene of a 1987 civil rights march that drew hundreds of protesters, some wearing Ku Klux Klan robes. Now, after an influx of newcomers that's bolstered diversity, many of the large single-family homes sported traditional Diwali decorations. Hindu temples and Indian restaurants and markets lined a nearby commercial strip.</p>

<p>Sure enough, almost everyone who answered the door that day in mid-October was of South Asian descent. The two canvassers switched among English, Hindi, Gujarati and Tamil as they asked residents if they planned to vote. Many of the people they spoke to had already cast early ballots. Nearly all the others said they planned to back Vice President Kamala Harris, perhaps somewhat of a surprise given surveys showing growing support for the GOP among Indian Americans.</p>

<p>"These are doors that have never been touched" by Republican or Democrat campaigners, said one of the men, Shekar Narasimhan, the national chair of the AAPI Victory Fund, a political action committee that supports Democrats. They were targeting houses where data suggested occupants hadn't voted in the past, and they stressed to everyone they encountered that just a tiny number of votes in Georgia swung the last presidential election.</p>

<p>In the frenetic final days before what's likely to be another incredibly close contest, both parties are making last-ditch efforts to identify and mobilize potential supporters - Black women in Georgia, Latino men in Nevada or working class White people in Pennsylvania. People of Indian descent, now the biggest Asian-American group in the US, are a compelling target as the cohort takes on a more prominent role in politics. Harris's mother was from India, as are the parents of Usha Vance, the wife of Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance.</p>

<p>Narasimhan points out that in the seven so-called swing states that will decide the presidential contest, some 400,000 Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders have become new potential voters over the past four years via relocation, gaining citizenship or turning 18. There are particularly large concentrations in swing-state metro areas including Atlanta; Philadelphia; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Detroit, according to AAPI Data, a research institute.</p>

<p>Asian Americans now comprise 17% of Forsyth County's population and a quarter of its voters, with many drawn to the area by good schools, a relatively low cost of living and plentiful jobs. The county hasn't been won by a Democratic presidential candidate since Georgia's own Jimmy Carter sought re-election in 1980.</p>

<p>Indian Americans are by far the largest Asian ethnic group in Georgia and key to suburbs around the country that have swelled with urban sprawl, according to data compiled by AAPI Data and APIAVote. In Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, Asian Americans make up 10.5% of voters; they're 10.9% of voters in Oakland County, Michigan.</p>

<p>In Georgia, Narasimhan and other canvassers touted Harris's support for women's reproductive rights, in a state subject to a strict ban on abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. They talked about her record on gun safety, especially after the Apalachee High School shooting that took place about an hour away. Her multiracial heritage make her a better choice for an increasingly diverse public, they asserted.</p>

<p>Halfway across the country, Ramesh Kapur, a fundraiser for Democrats, spent a recent weekend rallying support from devotees at Hindu temples in the northern suburbs of Detroit, which has one of the US's biggest Arab-American populations. With the Middle East conflict raging, Kapur said it was crucial to mobilize Hindus in swing-state Michigan to help offset a drop in support from Muslim voters enraged by the Biden administration's handling of the crisis in Gaza.</p>

<p>"The Hindu vote is all the more important," said Kapur, who raised money for Harris when she ran for Senate in 2016 and the presidential ticket in 2020.</p>

<p>But some of the worshipers told Kapur they still didn't know enough about Harris. Others said they weren't convinced that she's strongly connected to her Indian background. Kapur said he told them that Harris, who is Christian, was brought up by a Hindu mother and had hosted Diwali celebrations at the White House.</p>

<p>Devesh Kapur, who studies the Indian diaspora as a professor at Johns Hopkins University, says that since the 1990s, companies desperate for technology workers have tapped talent from India. Indian Americans make up less than 2% of the US population, but because of the tech ties have been among the most successful ethnic groups over the past 50 years.</p>

<p>Most immigrants "come to the US and you gradually climb up the ladder," he said. "The Indians came and climbed up an escalator."</p>

<p>But a Bloomberg News analysis of campaign donations from the start of July to mid-October showed only about a dozen Indian American donors on a list of more than 1,000 people who gave $50,000 or more to either Harris or Republican candidate Donald Trump's main fundraising vehicles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There have been outliers. Billionaires Vinod and Neeru Khosla, who made their fortune in Silicon Valley, have given at least $3.8 million to Democratic candidates and committees since the start of 2023, according to federal election data. Sumir Chadha, who runs investment firm WestBridge Capital, has given at least half a million dollars, mostly to Democratic candidates and causes. Oil executive Harry Singh gave at least a quarter of a million dollars to a pro-Trump PAC this year.</p>

<p>A survey by Politico found that the number of small Democratic donors with common South Asian names quintupled after Harris became the nominee. Harris's mother, who came to the US to study at the University of California, Berkeley, was from the city now known as Chennai.</p>

<p>As of now, there are five Indian Americans in Congress, all Democrats, affectionately dubbed the "Samosa Caucus."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Republicans have encroached on Democrats' backing from Indian Americans since Trump's 2016 victory. About 27% of Indian Americans indicated they would vote for Trump this year, up from 17% in 2016, according to a survey released in late September by AAPI Data. Some 47% of Indian Americans identify as Democrats, down from 56% in 2020, according to an October report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Conservatives have long tried to argue that Indian Americans are a natural fit for the GOP: Older members of the group in particular are often religious and socially conservative; they're wealthier than average; and Trump and Republicans have cozied up to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has led India for more than a decade. In 2016, Trump appeared at a Bollywood-themed benefit in New Jersey weeks before the election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shalabh Kumar, a Midwest manufacturing businessman who runs the Republican Hindu Coalition, said he and his family have given about $500,000 to Trump's election effort over the past year. But in a recent interview, he bemoaned the lack of interest the campaign has shown in events he had wanted to organize for Indian Americans.</p>

<p>"The Trump campaign has been just totally silent," Kumar said, adding that Democrats had done more to mobilize voters. A spokeswoman from the Trump campaign didn't return messages seeking comment.</p>

<p>Still, Trump on Thursday showed some support to Hindus when he said in a post on X that Harris and President Joe Biden have "ignored Hindus across the world and in America."</p>

<p>Narasimhan, of the AAPI Victory Fund, points out that of the approximately 5 million people of Indian descent in the US, only about half are citizens eligible to vote. To encourage them to turn out at the ballot box, he planned to travel to Nevada and Michigan over coming days, while allies went to Pennsylvania and North Carolina.</p>

<p>He tells people he meets with that the Asian American vote swung the Senate race for Democrat Raphael Warnock in 2022, when an exit poll showed support at 78%.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The next generation understands one simple thing: They were born here, they live here, they're staying here," Narasimhan said. "This community has so much potential and growth and opportunity."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The US is the world's largest economy and the biggest military power. But it is also the lynchpin of many international strategic alliances.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to the United Nations, 2024 is “the biggest election year in human history” with half of the world's population – some <a href="https://www.undp.org/super-year-elections">3.7 billion people in 72 countries</a> – able to vote. Yet some elections are more consequential than others which is why the world is watching as the US goes to the polls.</p>

<p>The US is the world's <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/268173/countries-with-the-largest-gross-domestic-product-gdp/#:%7E:text=Global%20gross%20domestic%20product&amp;text=The%20U.S.%20has%20consistently%20had,margin%20going%20into%20the%202030s">largest economy</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/ranked-us-military-officially-most-powerful-2024-208664">biggest military power</a>. But it is also the lynchpin of many international strategic alliances, the economic and financial system and many of the world's liberal institutions.</p>

<p>These elections are a pivotal moment in US history which could have massive implications for how the country is governed and for the future of the post-war order that Washington has helped build.</p>

<p>Unlike any election since 1945, the basic tenets of US relations with the rest of the world are in contention. The choice is between Donald Trump's Republican party potentially offering a complete break from the US's role in the international community, compared to Kamala Harris's more international agenda under the Democrats. Under Harris, the US is likely to continue to play a significant role in NATO, for instance.</p>

<h2><strong>Tariffs on China</strong></h2>

<p>The most conspicuous assault on the US's foreign policy tradition is Trump's plans to impose a universal <a href="https://theconversation.com/donald-trump-is-planning-more-trade-barriers-if-he-becomes-president-but-they-didnt-work-last-time-240964">tariff of 20% on all foreign imports</a>. Tariffs on China could be much higher with threats from <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/09/27/how-trump-tariffs-china-imports-everything-else-would-work/">Trump of 60-200%</a>. As well as being inflationary and damaging to the American economy such moves are likely to result in retaliation, trade wars and <a href="https://theconversation.com/donald-trump-is-planning-more-trade-barriers-if-he-becomes-president-but-they-didnt-work-last-time-240964">dislocation with the world economy</a>. By limiting access to the world's largest national market, they would also hamper global efforts to transition to a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4681372">zero-carbon economy</a>.</p>

<p>Such matters are of little concern to Trump however, who plans to repeat his withdrawal of Washington from the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/28/trump-paris-climate-treaty-withdrawal-again-00165903">Paris agreement on climate change</a>, to repeal the environmental protection measures implemented by Joe Biden, and to authorise the unrestricted exploitation of US oil and gas deposits through <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/11/fracking-debate-explained-debate">deregulated fracking</a>. Trump's plans would add tonnes of extra carbon to the <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-trump-election-win-could-add-4bn-tonnes-to-us-emissions-by-2030/">atmosphere if executed</a> and would be likely to significantly undermine global work on climate change.</p>

<p>Also in contention in the 2024 election is the US commitment to defend its friends and allies from hostile states. As a member of NATO, the US is bound to come to the aid of the other members <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_17120.htm">under article 5</a>, if another country attacks them, and it also has similar treaties with <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3900255/joint-statement-of-the-15th-republic-of-korea-united-states-japan-defense-trila/">Japan and South Korea</a>. The Biden administration led NATO in supporting Ukraine with military and financial aid to prevent its total subjugation to Russian occupation.</p>

<p>By contrast, Trump has indicated that he would end this support and pressure Kyiv to accept peace on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/27/trump-zelenskyy-meet-high-stakes-ukraine-talks-new-york">Moscow's terms</a>. Rather than seeing a network of alliances as the basis of strength and influence, Trump sees these as a source of risk and a burden.</p>

<h2><strong>Defending friends</strong></h2>

<p>Many former officials, such as former national security advisor John Bolton, suspect that Trump would seek to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/04/john-bolton-trump-nato-2024">leave Nato in a second term</a> or weaken its effectiveness through tepid support. In Asia, Trump's <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-taiwan-chips-invasion-china-910e7a94b19248fc75e5d1ab6b0a34d8">recent comments</a> that “Taiwan should pay us for defence. You know, we're no different than an insurance company” suggest a weakening of US commitment to the island.</p>

<p>For many observers, these elections also matter because the US's ability to conduct a free, fair and undisputed election and the peaceful transfer of power is in question. From his first involvement in the Republican party primary process in 2016 Trump has never accepted the results of an <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/trump-cruz-stole-iowa-tweet-deleted-218674">election that he lost</a>.</p>

<p>What is more remarkable is that he has convinced a majority of Republican voters to side with him in asserting that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/02/jan-6-poll-post-trump/">the 2020 election was stolen</a>, only a third believe the election was legitimate. When faith in the electoral process is so undermined it is difficult to see how the US can come together to be governed after the election.</p>

<p>For the Trump camp, however, there is a ready answer to this question. If elected, <a href="https://theconversation.com/project-2025-what-is-it-and-why-does-trump-say-he-knows-nothing-about-it-237289">Project 2025</a>, a document of policies prepared by a right-leaning think tank, suggests that his administration would replace the top tier of Washington's bureaucracy with 50,000 officials who pledge loyalty to him over the constitution. It also suggests that a Trump administration would disband a myriad of federal agencies such as the departments of justice, energy, and education as well as the FBI and Federal Reserve and to use his newly claimed executive authority to impose his policy agenda.</p>

<p>Such measures are designed to enable Trump to introduce a raft of policies that many regard as authoritarian, such as the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-10-24/trump-says-hell-undertake-the-largest-deportation-in-u-s-history-is-that-possible">deportation of millions of </a> “illegal aliens”, using the National Guard and army, if necessary.</p>

<p>The US experiment with democracy has fascinated and inspired the world since its inception in 1776. Never before, however, has it seemed in such jeopardy. The US is deeply divided on many fundamental questions, from taxation, immigration, abortion, trade, energy and environmental policy, and its <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/11/13/america-is-exceptional-in-the-nature-of-its-political-divide/">role in the world</a>.</p>

<p>For the first time, these divisions seem more important to many electors than respect for their democratic institutions and traditions. More fundamentally, many US citizens seem unable to accept the result of the democratic process and the subsequent legitimacy of the winner. Who wins the election and how the US is governed as a result, matters more now, to more people, than ever.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

</div>

<p>The BRICS summit in Kazan chaired by Russia has drawn great international attention because it conveys many messages in the current geopolitical context and that of the future.</p>

<p>The West has tried to isolate Russia internationally, defeat it militarily, and, through an array of draconian sanctions, cause its economic collapse. None of these objectives have been met.</p>

<p>Russia's ties with China have deepened strategically. India has preserved its strategic ties with Moscow despite western pressure. Russia's ties with several African countries also have a new momentum. Moscow is strongly present in the West Asia region and has a close relationship with key Arab countries. Its partnership with some ASEAN countries is gathering steam too.</p>

<h2><strong>The Expansion Of BRICS</strong></h2>

<p>The expansion of BRICS in 2023, with Egypt, UAE, Iran, Ethiopia and Saudi Arabia, had already signalled how major countries in the Global South viewed Russia very differently from how the West saw it. The Global South sees Russia as a friendly country, not an adversary. That almost 40 countries have shown interest in joining BRICS, a forum in which Moscow plays a key role, signifies that for them, Russia is an attractive partner.</p>

<p>The countries of the Global South seek a reformed international system that would reflect the shifts in power equations away from the West, both economic and political, that have occurred over the years. They want more attention to be paid to their concerns and priorities.</p>

<p>The hypocrisy and double standards of the West's “values-based” policies, its military interventions and the use of various means to bring about regime changes, the use of sanctions as a policy tool, the weaponisation of the dollar and the global financial system by the US, have increasingly pushed non-Western countries to hedge themselves against western pressures by joining forums such as BRICS. If Russia earlier looked westwards, the West has turned its back on Russia, and now Russia is much more focused on its Eurasian identity and is looking eastwards.</p>

<p>Non-western countries cannot opt out of the existing international system or create one of their own. What they hope to do is to change the balance of power within the existing system and reform it to ensure more equality and equity in its functioning. The Global South countries, which also have close relations with the West, are being attracted to join BRICS or associate with it in order to increase their political, economic and security options.</p>

<p>With 24 world leaders having attended the Kazan summit, including those of five founding members and the four new permanent members, the West's already failing efforts to isolate President Putin and Russia have been strongly rebuffed.</p>

<h2><strong>More Members May Bring Complications</strong></h2>

<p>With so much interest in BRICS in the Global South, the question of expanding its membership and the criteria for that have posed difficulties. BRICS is a consensus-based forum. With the expansion, building a consensus on issues would become more difficult, and that would affect the working and credibility of the forum.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Already, the meeting of the BRICS Foreign Ministers in June 2024 at Nizhny Novgorod in Russia, also attended by the four new members, could not issue a joint communiqué because of differences on certain points.</p>

<p>President Putin has himself publicly recognised the downside to any further expansion when he noted that the existing members have now worked together for years and know how the forum functions, and that the process of absorbing the new members into the methods and spirit of the forum will be the immediate focus, not its expansion.</p>

<p>The decision, therefore, has been not to broaden the BRICS membership for the moment but to enlarge its base by accepting new countries as partners. Developing a consensus within BRICS on which countries should be admitted as partners was presumably not an easy exercise, as all the BRICS members, old and new, had effective veto rights. It had to be ensured that no member country was particularly advantaged by the choice of partners and that the final list reflected a balance between the preferences of the forum's members.</p>

<h2><strong>A Wide Spread</strong></h2>

<p>Thirteen new BRICS partners have been accepted at Kazan—Algeria, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Turkey, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. That four members of the ASEAN are also among these is significant. Algeria, much to its disappointment, could not become a member when BRICS was expanded last year, but has now obtained partner status. Two key Central Asia countries have become partners too. Other Central Asian countries could obviously not be included as that would have weighed too much in the favour of Russia's interests. Already, the inclusion of Belarus is a clear Russian preference. The geographical spread of the new partner countries is noteworthy.</p>

<p>Russia's obvious preference for Turkey has also been accommodated given the latter's geopolitical importance for Russia, even though giving a partner status to a NATO country might not seem to fit into any normal criteria for deciding BRICS partnerships. Should NATO get a foothold in BRICS? From the Russian point of view, this would be a welcome political development in NATO's eastern flank. The US, which sees BRICS as an organisation created to rival the West in the global system, would be obviously perturbed by Turkey's decision.</p>

<h2><strong>Why Pakistan Was Kept Away</strong></h2>

<p>It would seem that China has not exercised its own special geopolitical preferences too visibly. If it was interested in Pakistan's inclusion, as it could well have been—if one would recall, it had linked India's SCO membership with that of Pakistan—it would have run into India's strong opposition. In September 2024, the Russian Deputy Prime Minister, Alexey Overchuk, while visiting Pakistan, had supported its inclusion in BRICS while also stating that such a decision would have to be based on a consensus. India clearly scotched any move to reach out to Pakistan, to the point that Pakistan does not seem to have been invited to the summit.</p>

<p>India had reservations about Turkey becoming a partner because of its anti-Indian positions on Kashmir in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) and in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), as well as its role in blocking India's membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. Eventually, India did not stand in the way of Turkey becoming a BRICS partner.</p>

<p>The last BRICS summit had approved the membership of Saudi Arabia, but it has not formally conveyed its acceptance. It was represented at the Kazan summit by its Foreign Minister. The Saudi Crown Prince received US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Riyadh while the summit was being held in Kazan, which tells its own story.</p>

<h2><strong>Do Not Overestimate</strong></h2>

<p>The importance of BRICS' expanded partnerships across Asia, Africa and Latin America should not be underestimated. It shows dissatisfaction with the current international system. Non-western countries want an end to the West's hegemony. They suffer from the West's self-centred and arbitrary policies. Strengthened multilateralism reflected in multipolarity is seen as the key to change.</p>

<p>At the same time, the pace at which BRICS can bring about this change should not be exaggerated. The goals of BRICS in forging alternatives to the dollar-dominated financial system are not easy to achieve. Within the BRICS countries, there are rivalries and divisions. Their political systems differ. Some are deeply anti-West, while others have friendly ties with the West even when they seek more space for themselves in a West-dominated global system. The economic disparities within the group are large. The policies of some both help and hurt the interests of the Global South.</p>

<p>All said and done, BRICS expansion, with all its challenges, is a vehicle for a much-needed re-balancing within the global system, which India also seeks.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four Thais were killed in northern Israel by rocket fire from Lebanon, Thailand's foreign minister said Friday.</p>

<p>Maris Sangiampongsa, in a post on social media platform X, said he was "deeply saddened" by the deaths close to the town of Metula on Thursday, adding another Thai citizen was injured.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The head of the regional council in Metula said late Thursday that five people had been killed in the rocket strike from Lebanon, one local farmer and four foreign farm workers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>About 30,000 Thai nationals live in Israel, where salaries are much higher than in the Southeast Asian kingdom.</p>

<p>Thai nationals in Israel have been particularly hard hit since the start of the war with Hamas, with at least 39 killed as a result of the October 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel.</p>

<p>More than two dozen were believed to have been captured by militants during the attack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During a brief November truce, 23 Thais were released from captivity.</p>

<p>The Israeli army has said two Thai nationals died in captivity in Gaza in May.</p>

<p>After more than 11 months of cross-border clashes that displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border, the Israeli army intensified air strikes against Hezbollah in mid-September and later launched limited ground operations in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Maris added: "Thailand continues to strongly urge all parties to return to the path of peace, in the name of the innocent civilians gravely impacted by this prolonged and deepening conflict.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican Vice-Presidential nominee JD Vance recently triggered a row by making controversial remarks on transgender and nonbinary people, suggesting that some white children are incentivised to "become" trans to get college admissions into Ivy Leagues.</p>

<p>Mr Vance made the statement during an interview podcast with Joe Rogan.</p>

<p>"If you are a middle-class or upper-middle-class white parent, and the only thing that you care about is whether your child goes into Harvard or Yale, obviously that pathway has become a lot harder for a lot of upper-middle class kids...The one way that those people can participate in the DEI (Diversity, equity, and inclusion) bureaucracy in this country is to be trans," he told Mr Rogan.</p>

<p>Mr <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/jd-vance-says-donald-trump-did-not-lose-2020-us-election-6806849">Vance</a> also had some outrageous views on transgender rights and whether they should be allowed to play on sports teams that match their gender identity.</p>

<p>"I'm the father of a two-year-old daughter. I don't want her going into athletic competitions where I'm terrified she's gonna get bludgeoned to death because we're allowing a six-foot-one male to compete with her in sports," he said.</p>

<p>According to Mr Vance, Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump may get the "normal gay" vote.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
"I won't be surprised if Trump won the normal gay guy vote because again, they just wanted to be left alone," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>Abortion Rights</strong></h3>

<p>Mr Vance also touched upon abortion rights in the US and spoke dismissively of it. According to him, women are "publicly celebrating their abortions by baking birthday cakes and posting about it" - which Mr Rogan disagreed with.</p>

<p>"I think it's six weeks is a limit to when you can have an abortion, which a lot of people think then you can't even tell whether or not you are pregnant, and this puts a lot of women in very vulnerable positions. And then there is this thought that they could go to another state where it is legal and have an abortion, but they could be possibly prosecuted for that in their state. That's concerning to me," Mr Rogan said.</p>

<p>To this, Mr Vance said that he has "not heard of any women being arrested for traveling to have an abortion".</p>

<p>Mr Vance, in the three-hour episode of "The Joe Rogan Experience" podcast, also spoke on Mr Trump's assassination attempt and climate change. He also joked about recent US President Joe Biden's "garbage" comment against Mr Trump, saying that Mr Biden is helping the former US President win the election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former UK prime minister Rishi Sunak alongside his wife, Akshta Murthy celebrated Diwali on Thursday (Oct 31), a day after resigning as the Opposition leader. Sunak, who made history in 2022 by becoming the first British-Asian PM to celebrate Diwali at 10, Downing Street, seemed in festive spirit as the couple celebrated the festival of light in Leicester. Ms Murty took to Instagram to share pictures of the celebration, in which she and Rishi Sunak were seen serving prasadam to the revellers gathered for the Diwali festivities.</p>

<h2><strong>Sunak resigns as Opposition leader</strong></h2>

<p>On Wednesday (Oct 30), Mr Sunak resigned as the Opposition leader by making his final appearance at the House of Commons during Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs).</p>

<p>"I became leader of my party during Diwali, and I now stand down during that same festival," said Sunak in his parting speech.</p>

<p>"I am proud to have been the first British Asian Prime Minister, but I was even prouder that it was not that big a deal." Sunak added whilst extending wishes for a joyful Diwali to all celebrating in the UK and around the world.</p>

<p>In a display of mutual respect and admiration, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer also thanked his predecessor for his service and extended the best wishes to his family.</p>

<p>"I wish everyone celebrating in the UK and around the world a joyful Diwali a time to come together to celebrate and focus on the brighter future," said Starmer.</p>

<p>"Last Diwali the leader of the opposition and his family uh lit the doors outside 10 Downing Street it was a significant moment in our national story the first British Asian prime minister is a reminder that this is a country where people of every background could fulfill their dreams and it makes us all proud to be British leader of the opposition," he added.</p>

<p>Rishi Sunak has been serving as interim leader of Conservatives until a new Tory leader is elected. The voting for the new leader took place on Thursday with the winner expected to be announced on Saturday, almost four months after the crushing general election defeat faced by the Tories.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video has emerged purportedly showing several rounds being fired at Punjabi singer AP Dhillon's house in Canada. It also shows two vehicles set on fire during the September 2 incident in Vancouver. The singer, who lives on Victoria Island in Vancouver, was not injured in the shooting.</p>

<p>The notorious Lawrence Bishnoi gang, which is being probed for the high-profile murders of Sidhu Moose Wala and Baba Siddique, had then claimed they carried out the firing since the singer featured actor Salman Khan in a music video.</p>

<p>The video of the firing - which resembled the 'Call of Duty' gameplay - appeared to be shot by the gunman as he emptied his magazine.</p>

<p>Canadian cops have arrested a suspect named Abhijeet Kingra, an Indian, from Ontario and issued an arrest warrant for a second suspect, Vikram Sharma.</p>

<p>Kingra, 25, has been charged with arson and discharge of a firearm with intent, said the Canadian Police in a statement posted on its website. He will appear in the Ontario court today.</p>

<p>The cops said they don't have a photo of Sharma, 23, but described him as a South Asian male who is 5 feet and 9 inches tall with black hair and brown eyes. They suspect he's currently in India.</p>

<p>AP Dhillon, known for blending the 80s-style synth-pop with Punjabi music, has seen a meteoric rise in the global canvas with hits that include 'Brown Munde', 'Dil Nu', and 'Insane'.</p>

<p>After the shooting incident in September, the Bishnoi gang issued death threats to Mr Dhillon in a social media post. Gangster Rohit Godara, who claims to be associated with Lawrence Bishnoi, had also said it was behind the firing at a jeweller's house in Canada.</p>

<p>Mr Dhillon later shared on Instagram that he was safe and thanked his fans for reaching out to him.</p>

<p>The Bishnoi gang had also claimed responsibility for a shooting incident outside singer Gippy Grewal's house in Canada in November last year.</p>

<p>Shots were also fired outside actor Salman Khan's Mumbai&nbsp;apartment in April allegedly on instructions from Anmol Bishnoi, the Canada-based brother of Lawrence Bishnoi.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A BBC documentary in September revealed Al Fayed sexually abused female staff at his London department store Harrods.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 400 alleged victims have so far contacted the legal team working on a case against the late Egyptian billionaire Mohamed Al Fayed, who has been accused of sexual abuse and rape, lawyer Dean Armstrong said on Thursday.</p>

<p>A BBC documentary in September revealed Al Fayed, who died last year aged 94, sexually abused female staff at his London department store Harrods, forced them to have medical screenings and threatened consequences if they tried to complain.</p>

<p>"The sheer scale of abuse perpetrated by Al Fayed, and facilitated by those around him, sadly, continues to grow," Armstrong told a news conference in London.</p>

<p>Al Fayed always denied similar accusations raised by other reports before his death.</p>

<p>When asked for a response, Harrods pointed Reuters to its past statements on the allegations, in which it has apologised, said it was "appalled" by them and that it had launched a process for any current or former Harrods employees who wish to claim compensation.</p>

<p>Another lawyer, Bruce Drummond, said the more than 400 claims have been made by women from around the world, mostly from Britain but also from the United States, Australia, Malaysia, Spain, South Africa and other countries.</p>

<p>"That, in our opinion, is an industrial scale abuse," Drummond said, adding abuse took place "within the walls of Harrods" but also in other locations linked to Al Fayed's business empire, such as Fulham Football Club, the Ritz Paris and his estate in Surrey.</p>

<p>Victims include the daughter of a former U.S. ambassador to Britain and the daughter of a well-known soccer player, Drummond said, without giving any names.</p>

<p>The BBC documentary said Harrods had failed to intervene and helped to cover up abuse allegations during his ownership.</p>

<p>Lawyers have criticised the Harrods-run compensation scheme, saying some of the victims do not feel comfortable to reach out to Harrods directly for compensation as that is where the abuse unfolded.</p>

<p>Drummond said some senior members of staff from the Al Fayed era still worked at Harrods.</p>

<p>The Financial Times last week reported that four alleged victims had quit the Harrods compensation scheme due to their concerns over potential conflicts of interest and poor communication.</p>

<p>Several media organisations had reported allegations of sexual abuse against Al Fayed before the BBC documentary, including Vanity Fair in 1995, ITV in 1997 and Channel 4 in 2017. Lawyers said in September many of the women only felt able to speak publicly in the BBC report after he died last year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The unprecedented penalty targets YouTube, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, over the platform's decision to block Russian state-run media channels in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia issued a fine against Google, estimated at an astronomical $20 decillion - a 2 followed by 34 zeroes. The unprecedented penalty targets YouTube, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, over the platform's decision to block Russian state-run media channels in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This sum far exceeds any reasonable financial scale, surpassing the entire global economy many times over.</p>

<p>The penalty arose after a Russian court ruled that Google violated national broadcasting rules by barring channels from Russian state-backed media outlets on YouTube. The fine is compounded by an additional ruling that demands the restoration of these channels, with the fines doubling each day if the platform fails to comply within a nine-month period.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The issue traces back to March 2022, when YouTube announced a global ban on several Russian state-operated channels, including RT and Sputnik. The platform justified its decision by pointing to content policies prohibiting material that denies, minimises, or trivialises violent events. YouTube has enforced such policies against channels supporting Russia's narratives around the Ukraine conflict, removing over 1,000 channels and more than 15,000 videos globally. In Europe, restrictions on Russian state media accounts were imposed before the ban expanded worldwide. This action led to backlash from Russia, which views the move as censorship and suppression of its state-sponsored media.</p>

<p>Since 2020, Google has faced ongoing penalties, starting with a daily fine of 100,000 rubles (approximately $1,028) over blocked Russian channels from Tsargrad and RIA FAN, two prominent Russian state-affiliated media outlets.</p>

<p>According to reports, 17 Russian broadcasters have joined the legal fray, filing suits against Google and demanding the reinstatement of their channels on the platform.</p>

<p>Following the onset of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, Google significantly curtailed its operations within Russia but stopped short of a complete exit. Services like YouTube and Google Search remain accessible within Russian borders. Unlike some American tech companies that fully withdrew, Google's partial operations in Russia continue, although its Russia subsidiary filed for bankruptcy several months into the conflict after the Russian government seized its bank accounts.</p>

<p>The Kremlin has called the fine a largely symbolic measure intended to compel Google to reconsider its stance on Russian broadcasters. Dmitry Peskov, spokesperson for the Kremlin, told Russian media that the monumental fine amount is intended to attract attention to the seriousness with which Russia views the issue of YouTube's bans on Russian media. "I can't even pronounce this figure right," Peskov said.</p>

<p>Since its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has leveraged a range of penalties against foreign tech platforms for hosting content deemed anti-Russian or pro-Ukrainian. Although YouTube remains accessible within Russia, authorities have threatened to block the platform outright if it continues to restrict Russian media channels.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The death count from devastating flash floods in eastern Spain climbed to 158 on Thursday, with rescue teams still searching for those missing in what could become Europe's worst storm-related disaster in over five decades.</p>

<p>"There's a total of 158 people to which must be added dozens and dozens of missing," Angel Victor Torres, minister in charge of cooperation with Spain's regions, told a press conference.</p>

<p>A year's worth of rain fell in eight hours in parts of the Valencia region on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The tragedy is already Spain's worst flood-related disaster in modern history, and meteorologists say human-driven climate change is making such extreme weather events more frequent and destructive.</p>

<p>In 2021, at least 185 people died in heavy flooding in Germany. Prior to that, 209 people died in Romania in 1970 and floods in Portugal in 1967 killed nearly 500 people.</p>

<p>Rescue teams on Thursday discovered the bodies of eight people, including a local policeman, who had been trapped in a garage on the outskirts of the city of Valencia, Mayor Maria Jose Catala told reporters.</p>

<p>In the same neighbourhood of La Torre, she said, a 45-year-old woman was also found dead in her home.</p>

<p>Thousands of people carrying bags or pushing shopping trolleys could be seen on Thursday crossing a pedestrian bridge over the Turia River from La Torre into Valencia city centre to stock up on essential supplies such as toilet paper and water.</p>

<p>Opposition politicians accused the central government in Madrid of acting too slowly to warn residents and send in rescue teams, prompting the Interior Ministry to say regional authorities were responsible for civil protection measures.</p>

<p>"Those people wouldn't have died if they had been warned in time," Laura Villaescusa, a neighbour and manager of a local supermarket, told Reuters.</p>

<p>Maribel Albalat, mayor of the nearby town of Paiporta, said residents were not warned of the imminent danger of flooding. She said 62 people had died in her town.</p>

<p>"We found a lot of elderly people inside their homes and people who went to get their cars. It was a trap," she told TVE.</p>

<h3><strong>CLINGING TO PILLAR</strong></h3>

<p>In Godelleta, a town 37 km (23 miles) west of Valencia city, Antonio Molina, 52, described how he survived by clinging to a pillar on a neighbour's porch on Tuesday as water reached his neck.</p>

<p>Molina's home suffered two major floods in 2018 and 2020 and he blamed authorities for allowing construction of residential buildings in depressions where water accumulates.</p>

<p>"We don't want to live here anymore," he said, tearfully. "As soon as we get a couple of raindrops, we're already checking our phones."</p>

<p>The floods have battered Valencia's infrastructure, sweeping away bridges, roads and rail tracks, and submerged farmland in a region that produces about two-thirds of Spain's citrus crops like oranges, which the country exports globally.</p>

<p>About 80 km (50 miles) of roads in the eastern region were seriously damaged or impassable, said Transport Minister Oscar Puente. Many were blocked by abandoned cars.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately there are dead bodies in some vehicles," Puente told reporters, adding that it would take two to three weeks to re-establish the high-speed train connection between Valencia and Madrid.</p>

<p>Visiting a rescue coordination centre near Valencia city, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez urged people to stay at home due to the threat of more stormy weather.</p>

<p>"Right now the most important thing is to safeguard as many lives as possible," he told reporters.</p>

<p>In the hard-hit rural town of Utiel, some 85 km (53 miles) inland, the Magro River burst its banks, sending up to three metres (9.8 feet) of water into the mostly single-storey homes.</p>

<p>Utiel's mayor, Ricardo Gabaldon, said at least six people died in the town of about 12,000, most of them elderly or disabled people who were unable to clamber to safety.</p>

<p>Residents used water pumps carried on tractors as they started to clean up on Thursday, with children helping to sweep the sidewalks. Ruined household appliances and furniture were piled up in the middle of roads and elderly people struggled to walk in the slippery, mud-coated streets.</p>

<p>Pope Francis said he was praying for the people of the region. "I'm close to them in this moment of catastrophe," he said in a video posted on X.</p>

<p>Research group Climate Central said in a report on Thursday that a low-pressure system behind Spain's floods had tapped into an "atmospheric river" carrying excess moisture from the unusually warm Tropical Atlantic.</p>

<p>According to its Climate Shift Index: Ocean, human-caused climate change has made these elevated sea surface temperatures at least 50 to 300 times more likely.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US woman and her two children died after jumping off Niagara Falls on Monday night, the <em>Independent</em> reported. The woman, identified as 33-year-old Chianti Means climbed over a safety rail and intentionally went over the waterfall with her two children, a nine-year-old and a 5-month-old. Authorities reached the scene around 9 pm on Monday and determined that the family went over the rail on Luna Island, a popular sight-seeing point above the waterfall with a nearly 200-foot drop. Investigators also determined that the plunge was "intentional". "The circumstances remain under investigation," state troopers said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Investigation determined that three individuals, Chianti Means, 33 years old, Roman Rossman, 9 years old and Mecca Means, 5 months old all of Niagara Falls, NY crossed over safety guild rail and went over Niagara Falls on Luna Island (attached to Goat Island)," state police said in a news release, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/niagara-falls-death-chianti-means-b2638845.html" rel="noindex, nofollow">outlet</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The investigation has determined that this incident was intentional in nature, though the circumstances remain under investigation. New York State Park Police and State Police search/rescue efforts were conducted with negative results. This incident deems no public threat to safety," the department added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Chianti, a mother of two, was a resident of Niagara Falls, where she lived with her children. As of Wednesday, there is no news about the discovery of their bodies, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/30/us-news/new-york-mom-and-two-young-kids-including-5-month-old-baby-dead-after-jumping-off-niagara-falls/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>New York Post </em></a>reported.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old worked as a domestic violence counsellor, according to her LinkedIn profile, and graduated from school in nearby Buffalo. Shortly after the news of her death broke, tributes from friends and family started pouring in. "I have been speechless and crying and couldn't sleep at all," wrote friend Kayshawna Morgane on Facebook, adding, "My heart is broken. Mental health is no joke."</p>

<p>"I can't even bear to write a post about her and share memories.I am literally sick to my stomach and I can't even deal with the emotions I am feeling. Just know her and her children are dearly loved by me and my children," said friend Mich Molina. "You really never know what anybody is going through," said another, Niesha Eukeya.</p>

<p>An investigation is ongoing. Authorities are reportedly using unmanned aircraft and underwater units in the investigation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump, in a Diwali message on Thursday, condemned the atrocities faced by Hindus in Bangladesh, especially after the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government. He also vowed to protect the Hindu Americans against "anti-religion agendas" and fight for their freedom.</p>

<p>"I strongly condemn the barbaric violence against Hindus, Christians, and other minorities who are getting attacked and looted by mobs in Bangladesh, which remains in a total state of chaos. It would have never happened on my watch," Mr Trump wrote in a post on X.</p>

<p>This is the first time Mr Trump has spoken on the issue of Bangladesh.</p>

<p>The US Presidential candidate hit out at his Democratic rival Kamala Harris, saying that she and US President Joe Biden have "ignored" Hindus across the world as well as in America.</p>

<p>"Kamala and Joe have ignored Hindus across the world and in America. They have been a disaster from Israel to Ukraine to our own Southern Border, but we will Make America Strong Again and bring back Peace through Strength!," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Trump, who extended his Diwali wishes to Indians, also vowed to strengthen his country's partnership with India and his "good friend" <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/140-crore-indians-worried-about-safety-of-hindus-in-bangladesh-pm-modi-6341273">Prime Minister Narendra Modi</a>.</p>

<p>"Under my administration, we will also strengthen our great partnership with India and my good friend, Prime Minister Modi. Also, Happy Diwali to All. I hope the Festival of Lights leads to the Victory of Good over Evil," he wrote.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>On August 5, former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country, ending her 15-year rule as student protests against her government escalated. Following this, the minority Hindus in the country have been facing violence, and vandalism of temples and their businesses. According to the Bangladesh National Hindu Grand Alliance, attacks and threats against the minority community have taken place in over 200 locations across 48 districts. Hundreds of Hindus were also killed between July and August this year.</p>

<p>The minority Hindus constitute about eight percent of the population in Bangladesh.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The United States has an electoral system and calendar unlike no other country. The nation votes in November but the new President is inaugurated in January.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States has an electoral system and calendar unlike no other country. The nation votes in November but the new President is inaugurated in January. While many countries swiftly usher in new leaders, the US takes a more measured approach with an 11-week transition period. Although this duration may seem lengthy, it is, in fact, shorter than the four months that the Constitution originally permitted for the transfer of power from an incumbent president to their successor.</p>

<p><strong>Historical context</strong></p>

<p>Federal elections in the US are held on the first Tuesday in November. Initially, states had different election days, but in 1845, a law established a uniform election day nationwide. At the time, the US was predominantly agricultural, and early November proved advantageous for farmers. The harvest would be complete, yet the weather remained good for travel. Certain days were ruled out for voting. Sunday was universally recognised as a day of worship for devout Christians, while Wednesday served as a market day for farmers to sell their produce. In addition, reaching polling places often required travel, even up to a day for those living in rural areas without modern transport. With Sunday and Wednesday unavailable, Monday and Thursday were also eliminated as potential election days. As such, Tuesday emerged as the most suitable choice.<br />
<br />
<strong>From four months to under three months</strong><br />
<br />
The challenges faced during the Great Depression prompted leaders to expedite the swearing-in process for newly elected presidents, reducing the lengthy four-month “lame duck” period to under three months. A “lame duck” refers to an elected official whose successor has already been chosen, leaving them politically weakened.<br />
<br />
The 20th Amendment, ratified in 1933, officially moved the inauguration date to January 20, while presidential elections continue to occur in early November.<br />
<br />
<strong>Logistical considerations</strong><br />
<br />
One of the main reasons for this gap is the need for a seamless transition of power. After the election, the president-elect and their team require time to prepare for governance. This includes assembling a cabinet, developing policies and addressing national issues. The time between the election and inauguration allows the incoming administration to lay the groundwork for their agenda.<br />
<br />
The extended transition period can also be attributed to the Electoral College system, which determines the president weeks after the popular vote, as opposed to a parliamentary system where the winning party directly assumes power. While this delay means that presidents cannot take office immediately, the winner is granted access to transition funding and can receive essential briefings from the outgoing administration to facilitate a smooth handover.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the US presidential election nears, the two primary candidates &nbsp;-- Republican nominee Donald Trump and his Democratic counterpart Kamala Harris -- are making their last pitch to the voters at multiple rallies in a day. But there's another thing keeping the US electorate and political observers on their toes. What will unfold if Harris wins? The reason? Well, former President Donald Trump has routinely claimed that a loss for him will only be due to Democratic interference. This has raised concerns that he may again cast doubt on the results, as he did in 2020 when he sought to challenge Joe Biden's win.</p>

<p>During a Michigan rally in September, Trump said, “If I lose, I'll tell you what, it's possible. Because they cheat. That's the only way we're gonna lose because they cheat.”</p>

<p><strong>New safeguards for this election</strong></p>

<p>New safeguards introduced for this election aim to reduce the chances of any efforts to undermine the outcome from gaining traction.</p>

<p><strong>The new protections include:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>An electoral law enacted by Congress following the January 6 insurrection.</li>
	<li>Recent court rulings reinforcing electoral integrity.</li>
	<li>Increased vigilance from state election officials.</li>
	<li>More aggressive action by law enforcement agencies.</li>
</ul>

<p>These measures have been put in place to prevent any recurrence of the violent Capitol scenes from four years ago.</p>

<p><strong>What happened in 2020?</strong></p>

<p>After his 2020 loss, Trump and his allies sought to challenge the election outcome through numerous lawsuits, all of which failed to alter or delay the results. He also pressured Georgia officials to "find" additional votes in his favour, and his supporters stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent Vice President Mike Pence from certifying Biden's victory. This election, however, Trump no longer has access to the presidential powers he wielded in 2020 -- a significant change in circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Trump, allies may question Harris win</strong></p>

<p>Trump and his allies have been actively preparing to challenge the election outcome if he loses on November 5. In the event of a Harris win, he may pursue legal avenues or cast doubt on the legitimacy of her victory among his supporters, potentially leading to unforeseen reactions, reported Reuters.</p>

<p>Both Republicans and Democrats anticipate that counting could extend for several days post-election as mail-in and other ballots are processed and verified. If Trump appears to be trailing, the delay could prompt him to allege fraud and work to erode public confidence in election officials, potentially inciting protests.</p>

<p>He has also suggested punitive action against election workers and officials for “unscrupulous” behaviour, though he needs to secure a victory first to act on such threats.</p>]]></content:encoded>

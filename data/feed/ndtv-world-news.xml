       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Expressing condolences for the victims of a shooting incident at a school in Georgia, President Joe Biden has called on Republicans to work with Democrats in the US Congress to pass gun safety legislation to help prevent future gun violence in the United States.</p>

<p>At least four people, including two students, have been killed and nine others were injured when a fellow student opened fire in a high school in the US state of Georgia on Wednesday, CNN reported.</p>

<p>Biden described the shooting incident as "another horrific reminder of how gun violence continues to tear our communities apart."</p>

<p>"Jill (Biden) and I are mourning the deaths of those whose lives were cut short due to more senseless gun violence and thinking of all of the survivors whose lives are forever changed. What should have been a joyous back-to-school season in Winder, Georgia, has now turned into another horrific reminder of how gun violence continues to tear our communities apart," Biden said in a statement released by the White House.</p>

<p>The US president lamented that students across the country are "learning how to duck and cover instead of how to read and write."</p>

<p>"We cannot continue to accept this as normal. We are closely coordinating with officials at the federal, state and local levels and are grateful for the first responders who brought the suspect into custody and prevented further loss of life," Biden said.</p>

<p>Further, Biden reaffirmed his commitment to tackling the gun violence epidemic in the US and highlighted his efforts to address the issue, including the signing of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.</p>

<p>"Ending this gun violence epidemic is personal to me. It's why I signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act--the most meaningful gun safety bill in decades--and have announced dozens of gun safety executive actions. I also established the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, overseen by Vice President Harris. We've made significant progress, but this crisis requires even more," the US president said.</p>

<p>Biden called on Republicans to work with Democrats in Congress to pass gun safety legislation to help prevent future gun violence and stated that 'enough is enough.'</p>

<p>"After decades of inaction, Republicans in Congress must finally say 'enough is enough' and work with Democrats to pass common-sense gun safety legislation. We must ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines once again, require safe storage of firearms, enact universal background checks, and end immunity for gun manufacturers. These measures will not bring those who were tragically killed today back, but they will help prevent more tragic gun violence from ripping more families apart," Biden said.</p>

<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris also took to X and expressed condolences for the people who are impacted by this shooting and described it as a "senseless tragedy."</p>

<p>"Today, Doug and I are mourning the deaths of those whose lives were cut short by gun violence at Apalachee High School in Georgia. Our hearts are with the students, teachers, and families impacted by this shooting, and we are grateful to the first responders and law enforcement on the scene. This is a senseless tragedy -- and it does not have to be this way. We must end the epidemic of gun violence in our country once and for," said Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Georgia Governor Brian P Kemp also posted on X and stated "I have directed all available state resources to respond to the incident at Apalachee High School and urge all Georgians to join my family in praying for the safety of those in our classrooms, both in Barrow County and across the state."</p>

<p>"We will continue to work with local, state, and federal partners as we gather information and further respond to this situation," he added.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the suspected gunman is in custody and was identified as 14-year-old Colt Cray, a student of Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia, about an hour outside of Atlanta. Two of those killed were students and two were teachers. Law enforcement agencies are still investigating the shooting and the motive behind it.</p>

<p>The high school had received an earlier phone threat, multiple law enforcement officials told CNN.</p>

<p>The phone call Wednesday morning warned there would be shootings at five schools, and that Apalachee would be the first. It is not known who placed the call. Officials tell CNN they are investigating the call and where it originated.</p>

<p>The US has suffered at least 385 mass shootings so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which, like CNN, defines mass shootings as those in which four or more victims are shot. That's an average of more than 1.5 mass shootings every day.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A British hiker has been found dead and another is missing on the Spanish island of Mallorca after heavy rains swept over the popular tourist destination, emergency services said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Emergency services had been looking for the two hikers since Monday night in an area of mountains in Mallorca where the Torrent de Pareis canyon descends to the Mediterranean, a police spokeswoman told AFP.</p>

<p>The search was called off on Wednesday at around 1900 GMT as dusk fell, with emergency services saying it would resume on Thursday.</p>

<p>"The body found is that of a woman and the missing person is a man," police said in a statement, adding that the search for the man had been suspended because of poor weather but would resume when conditions improved.</p>

<p>Juan Carlos Rodriguez, the head of the Mountain Rescue Group brigade in the Balearic islands, told reporters they had rescued 10 people who were hiking in the canyon and "were surprised by the storm".</p>

<p>"They were the ones who told us that they had seen two people who had been swept away by the water," he said.</p>

<p>"When you don't look at the weather before, and you are in a foreign country doing sport tourism, or sun and beach tourism, that leads to people having accidents," he added.</p>

<p>Local authorities had called for people to be careful due to the "very intense storms" that were expected.</p>

<p>"Avoid outdoor activities (going to the beach, hiking, water sports)," the archipelago's emergency services warned on X.</p>

<p>Mallorca remained on alert on Wednesday for heavy rains and strong winds, with the national weather office Aemet warning that gusts of over 120 kilometres (75 miles) per hour were possible.</p>

<p>The Mediterranean island, known for its picturesque beaches and sunny weather, is one of Europe's most visited destinations. It is especially popular with German and British tourists.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first phase of a large-scale polio vaccination campaign in Gaza has concluded successfully, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday, providing nearly 200,000 children in the centre of the Palestinian territory with their initial dose.</p>

<p>With Gaza lying in ruins and the majority of its 2.4 million residents forced to flee their homes due to Israel's military assault -- often taking refuge in cramped and unsanitary conditions -- disease has spread.</p>

<p>After the first confirmed polio case in 25 years, a massive vaccination effort began on Sunday, aided by localised "humanitarian pauses" in fighting.</p>

<p>The campaign aims to fully vaccinate more than 640,000 children in the besieged territory, devastated by almost 11 months of war.</p>

<p>During the first phase of the campaign, conducted between September 1 and 3 in central Gaza, more than 187,000 children under the age of 10 were reached, the WHO said in a statement.</p>

<p>"We are grateful for the dedication of all the families, health workers and vaccinators who made this part of the campaign a success despite the dire conditions in the Gaza Strip," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X, formerly Twitter.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

Over 187,000 children under the age of ten were vaccinated, well over the target of 156,500. The numbers are being finalised.<br />

— Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros) <a href="https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1831251117935595998?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 4, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"We ask for the humanitarian pauses to continue to be respected. We continue to call for a ceasefire."</p>

<p>The WHO had estimated that vaccines would be needed for nearly 157,000 children below the age of 10 in central Gaza but acknowledged that that was an underestimate.</p>

<p>This it said was "due to population movement towards central Gaza, and expanded coverage in areas outside the humanitarian pause zone". &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>No child left behind&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>More than 500 teams, consisting of nearly 2,200 health and community outreach workers, took part in the campaign in central Gaza, with vaccinations provided at 143 fixed sites across the area.</p>

<p>In addition, mobile teams visited tents and hard-to-reach areas, including those outside the agreed humanitarian pause zone.</p>

<p>While the large-scale campaign in central Gaza is over, the WHO said that vaccinations would continue at four large health facilities there over the next few days "to ensure no child is missed in the area".</p>

<p>The main focus is meanwhile set to move to southern Gaza, where an estimated 340,000 children over the next four days will receive their first dose.</p>

<p>And finally, the campaign will be concentrated in northern Gaza between September 9 and 11, targeting around 150,000 children, the WHO said.</p>

<p>A fresh campaign to provide a needed second dose is due to begin in about four weeks time.</p>

<p>The WHO has stressed that it is vital to reach at least 90 per cent coverage to avoid the spread of the disease both within Gaza's borders and beyond.</p>

<p>"We want to ensure... there will be no other Gaza children who actually will suffer from polio," Rik Peeperkorn, the WHO's representative for the Palestinian territories, told reporters on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"But we also want to make sure that we prevent the spread of polio to neighbouring countries."</p>

<p>The October 7 Hamas attack that sparked the war resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians and including hostages killed in captivity, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's campaign against Hamas since October 7 has killed at least 40,861 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry. The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Japan, companies are cashing in on employees' hesitancy to call it quits and helping people leave their unsatisfying workplaces. According to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, a company named Exit is in the job of helping people resign from their jobs and is even offering half-off for returning clients. The firm, launched in 2017, overseas the resignations of around 10,000 people per year. For 20,000 yen (approximately Rs 11,600), the business makes a call to the client's company and informs them that they are quitting while spelling out other details. They also tell them about when their last day would be at the office and gather other information about how to return company-issued tech or uniforms and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ever since Exit's launch, similar services have cropped up across the country, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/workplace-dissatisfied-quitting-agencies-japan-5c5586d5?mod=lifestyle_lead_story" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>WSJ</em></a>. Its competitor Albatross calls clients' places of employment and declares they are quitting and specifies details, such as last day. Another firm called Momuri - which translates to "I can't do this anymore" - is also gaining popularity in Japan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To answer why workers are reaching out to such firms is quite simple. People in Japan find it difficult to quit jobs because they face immense opposition and stress while doing so. In most extreme cases, grumpy bosses rip up resignation letters and harass employees to force them to stay. "Japanese are not educated to debate and express opinions," Exit co-founder Toshiyuki Niino, 34, told the Wall Street Journal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Separately, Ayumi Sekine, who works at Albatross, said he also faced a similar situation with his previous job. He said that when he tried to resign from his job at a gas company, his former boss refused to acknowledge it and he had to beg him to go. Only after an immense crying was he allowed to leave the job.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yuta Sakamoto, another disgruntled employee, paid over $200 to a quitting agency to help him leave his job where his former boss warned him that he'd be ruining his career if he ever left. Then there are some who can't afford these services and pretend to be from a quitting agency when tendering a resignation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Albatross CEO Shinji Tanimoto says that most of the bosses are fine with a third party informing them about an employee going on notice. However, a few of them demand legal negotiations with a lawyer present.</p>

<p>The reason behind quitting is mostly because of difficult bosses, unpaid overtime, and a culture of not being able to use your paid time off.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, according to <em>WSJ</em>, many companies in Japan are also reaching out to quitting agencies for referrals for the newly unemployed.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China insisted Thursday it did not pose a threat to New Zealand's national security after the country's spy service singled out Beijing-backed groups as a "complex intelligence concern".</p>

<p>New Zealand's Security Intelligence Service levelled unusually candid criticisms at China in its annual threat report, released this week, saying ongoing foreign interference efforts were "complex and deceptive".</p>

<p>China's embassy in New Zealand hit back on Thursday, branding such claims "entirely baseless" and "a figment of imagination or sheer fabrication".</p>

<p>"There is no competition to speak of between the two countries, and China is not a threat to New Zealand," an embassy spokesperson said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beijing was accused of infiltrating local groups, replacing authentic community views with those approved by the ruling party.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In one example, a Chinese-language community news outlet was accused of regurgitating government talking points.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The report's blatant attempts to discredit the Chinese diaspora and students are nothing but an effort to sow discord, create fear, and foster division," replied China's embassy spokesperson.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is highly irresponsible, reckless, and deeply unfair to the Chinese community."&nbsp;</p>

<p>China's embassy suggested external forces -- likely a veiled reference to the United States -- had been meddling to undermine relations between the trading partners.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New Zealand's centre-right government has shifted the country's foreign policy closer to traditional Western allies such as the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This has come with an increased willingness to speak out against China.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In March, Wellington said a Chinese state-sponsored group was behind a 2021 malicious cyber attack that infiltrated sensitive government computer systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China remains New Zealand's biggest trading partner -- exporting dairy, meat and wood products that exceeded NZ$21.39 billion (US$13.2 billion), according to the most recent official data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New Zealand Prime Minister Christoper Luxon has warned that although China was "a country of undoubted influence", different values mean "there are issues on which we cannot and will not agree".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week, US President Joe Biden expressed his concerns about the safety of people in Bangladesh and the future of democratic institutions there, the White House has said.</p>

<p>During the call, President Biden and PM Modi “shared concerns” on the recent developments in Bangladesh, White House national security communications adviser John Kirby told a press conference on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"I mean, the president made clear his continued concerns about the safety and security of the people in Bangladesh and the future of their democratic institutions," he said in response to a question.</p>

<p>The statement issued by the White House after the August 26 call did not mention Bangladesh. However, a post on X by PM Modi and a statement issued by his office mentioned that Bangladesh was discussed during the telephonic conversation.</p>

<p>"The two leaders expressed their shared concern over the situation in Bangladesh. They emphasized restoration of law and order and ensuring safety and security of the minorities, particularly Hindus, in Bangladesh," the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) had said.</p>

<p>In his post on X, PM Modi had said,“We also discussed the situation in Bangladesh and stressed on the need for early restoration of normalcy, and ensuring the safety and security of minorities, especially Hindus, in Bangladesh."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In yet another endorsement of Republican candidate Donald Trump, tech billionaire Elon Musk said the former US president must win if the American people want to "preserve freedom and meritocracy".</p>

<p>"I have never been materially active in politics before, but this time I think civilization as we know it is on the line. If we want to preserve freedom and a meritocracy in America, then Trump must win," he wrote in a post on X.</p>

<p>Musk was responding to a post that praised him as the "one of the best in the world at synthesizing complex information". The post was responding to a X user accusing Musk of spreading misinformation and joining the "MAGA cult", a reference to Trump's campaign slogan Make America Great Again.</p>

<p>The Tesla CEO had first openly endorsed Trump after he was shot at during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery. Last time America had a candidate this tough was Theodore Roosevelt," he wrote on X while sharing a video of Trump raising his fist in the air after a bullet grazed the top of his ear during an assassination attempt.</p>

<p>Since then, Musk has not shied away from throwing his weight behind the former president's re-election bid. From wanting to work on Trump's cabinet to holding an exclusive interview with the Republican candidate on X, years after the platform banned him for "incitement of violence" after the January 6 violence.</p>

<p>Musk has also hit out at Trump's rival and US Vice President Kamala Harris. On Wednesday, he shared a shared an AI-generated image of Harris and said she "vows to be a communist dictator on day one".&nbsp;</p>

<p>This came after Harris attacked Trump for "vowing to be a dictator on day one" of his job if he is elected President of USA again.</p>

<p>In the past, Musk had backed Joe Biden in the 2020 US Presidential Election. He has said he worked closely with the Obama administration and he voted for Hilary Clinton in 2016 against Trump.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US welcomes any nation that is willing to try to help end the conflict in Ukraine, White House national security communications adviser John Kirby has said.</p>

<p>His remarks came after he was asked at a press conference on Wednesday about President Joe Biden's call to Prime Minister Narendra Modi after the latter's trip to Ukraine that was preceded by his visit to Moscow, and if he thought India could play a role in ending the war.</p>

<p>Kirby said, "Any nation that is willing to try to help end this war and do so in keeping with President Zelenskyy's prerogatives, the Ukrainian people's prerogatives, his plan for a just peace, we would certainly welcome a role like that." On whether he thought India could play a role in bringing peace, the White House official said, "Well, we certainly hope so."</p>

<p>In his call, President Biden commended PM Modi for his historic visits to Poland and Ukraine, the first by an Indian Prime Minister in decades, and for his message of peace and ongoing humanitarian support for Ukraine, including its energy sector.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that Israel will only agree to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza that guarantees the border area between southern Gaza and Egypt could never be used as a lifeline for the Islamist movement Hamas.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that Israel will only agree to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza that guarantees the border area between southern Gaza and Egypt could never be used as a lifeline for the Islamist movement Hamas.</p>

<p>"Until that happens, we're there," he told a news conference in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Netanyahu repeated his outright rejection of a withdrawal from the so-called Philadelphi corridor in the first phase of a deal, expected to last 42 days, saying international pressure would make it effectively impossible to return.</p>

<p>For a permanent ceasefire to be agreed upon after that, Israel would need guarantees that whoever ran postwar Gaza would be able to prevent the corridor from being used as a route for smuggling weapons and supplies for Hamas.</p>

<p>"Somebody has to be there," he said. "Bring me anyone who will actually show - not on paper, not in words, not on a slide - but day after day, week after week, month after month, that they can actually prevent a recurrence of what happened there before," he said, referring to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel.</p>

<p>"We're open to consider it, but I don't see that happening right now."</p>

<p>The Philadelphi corridor, along the southern edge of the Gaza Strip bordering Egypt, has been one of the main obstacles to a deal to halt the fighting in Gaza and bring Israeli hostages home in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<p>Netanyahu has insisted on retaining control of the corridor, where Israeli troops have uncovered dozens of tunnels that officials say have been used to supply Hamas with weapons and ammunition.</p>

<p>The prime minister has faced heavy criticism from many in Israel for holding out on the issue, including from many in his own security establishment who believe Israeli troops can make targeted interventions if needed to prevent any smuggling.</p>

<p>The families of many hostages, including some of the six whose bodies were recovered from a tunnel in southern Gaza on Sunday, have accused him of sacrificing their loved ones by insisting on keeping troops in the corridor.</p>

<p>But he said maintaining pressure on Hamas was the best way to return the 101 hostages still remaining in Gaza.</p>

<p>"You need to squeeze them, to put pressure on them to release the remaining hostages. So if you want to release the hostages, you've got to control the Philadelphi corridor," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas said on Thursday there was no need for new ceasefire proposals for Gaza and pressure should be put on Israel to agree to a U.S. plan that the Islamist group had already accepted.</p>

<p>The United States was expected to present a new truce proposal aimed at breaking an impasse between Hamas and Israel.</p>

<p>In a statement, Hamas said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sought to thwart an agreement by insisting that Israel will not withdraw from the Philadelphi corridor in southern Gaza.</p>

<p>"We warn against falling into Netanyahu's trap and tricks, as he uses negotiations to prolong the aggression against our people," the statement said.</p>

<p>Hamas said it accepted a July 2 proposal put forward by the U.S.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that Hamas had rejected all elements of a proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza that would help facilitate the release of hostages.</p>

<p>"Hamas has rejected everything... I hope that changes because I want those hostages out," Netanyahu told a news conference, casting doubt on the possibility of a breakthrough one day after the State Department said it was "time to finalise that deal".</p>

<p>"We're trying to find some area to begin the negotiations," Netanyahu said.</p>

<p>"They (Hamas) refuse to do that... (They said) there's nothing to talk about."</p>

<p>Netanyahu has come under added domestic and international pressure to seal a deal that would free Israeli hostages after authorities announced on Sunday the deaths of six whose bodies were recovered from a tunnel in southern Gaza.</p>

<p>On Monday, Netanyahu said Israeli forces would retain control over the Philadelphi Corridor along the Egypt-Gaza border, vowing "not to give in to pressure" over the issue.</p>

<p>Hamas, whose unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel started the war, is demanding a complete Israeli withdrawal from the area as part of the stalled talks mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt.</p>

<p>At Wednesday's news conference, Netanyahu reiterated his position on the Philadelphi Corridor, saying that ceding control would allow Hamas to smuggle weapons in and hostages and "terrorists" out.</p>

<p>"You need something to squeeze them, to prevent them, to put pressure on them to release the remaining hostages," he said.</p>

<p>"So if you want to release the hostages, you've got to control the Philadelphi Corridor."</p>

<p>State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters on Wednesday that Washington recognised "the very real needs that Israel has to ensuring that there can't be smuggling across the Philadelphi Corridor", but said "we think that there are ways to address" the issue.</p>

<p>Reaching a deal "is going to require flexibility from the government of Israel, just as it's going to require Hamas to finally find a way to get to yes," Miller said.</p>

<p>Netanyahu, for his part, said he was "flexible when I can be" and "firm when I have to be".</p>

<p><strong>- 'Whole thing' unresolved -</strong></p>

<p>He also stressed that the debate over the Philadelphi Corridor was not the sole sticking point.</p>

<p>Also unanswered, he said, were questions over how many Palestinian prisoners would be freed in exchange for hostages, whether Israel could veto the release of certain prisoners and where released prisoners should go.</p>

<p>"The whole thing has not been resolved," he said.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack by Hamas resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians including some hostages killed in captivity, according to official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Of 251 hostages seized by Palestinian militants during the attack, 97 remain in Gaza including 33 the Israeli military says are dead. Scores were released during a one-week truce in November -- the only one so far.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive in Gaza has so far killed at least 40,861 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.</p>

<p>Most of the dead are women and children, according to the UN rights office.</p>

<p>At protests in several Israeli cities this week, Netanyahu's critics have blamed him for hostages' deaths, saying he has refused to make necessary concessions for striking a ceasefire deal.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden said this week he did not think Netanyahu was working hard enough to free the hostages.</p>

<p>Also on Wednesday, an Israeli far-right minister stepped up pressure on Netanyahu to end negotiations for a Gaza ceasefire altogether.</p>

<p>"A country whose six hostages are murdered in cold blood does not negotiate with the killers, but ends the talks, stops the transfer of fuel and electricity, and crushes them until they collapse," National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir wrote on the social media platform X.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris on Wednesday implored Americans to bring a halt to the "epidemic of gun violence" plaguing the United States, after a mass shooting at a Georgia high school left four people dead.</p>

<p>The US vice president, speaking at a rally in New Hampshire, also reiterated her call for an assault-weapons ban -- a position widely opposed by Republicans -- and support for the further tightening of US gun safety laws.</p>

<p>"This is just a senseless tragedy, on top of so many senseless tragedies," Harris said of the shooting at Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia, the latest spasm of gun violence to impact a country that has already seen hundreds of mass shootings this year.</p>

<p>"And it's just outrageous that every day in our country, in the United States of America, that parents send their children to school worried about whether or not their child will come home alive," she added.</p>

<p>"We have to end this epidemic of gun violence in our country once and for all. It doesn't have to be this way," Harris, locked in a tight race with Republican former president Donald Trump, told the crowd before she started laying out elements of her economic plan.</p>

<p>Trump, seen by his party as a champion for gun rights, posted on social media that "our hearts are with the victims," and said "these cherished children were taken from us far too soon by a sick and deranged monster."</p>

<p>Harris, a onetime prosecutor and attorney general of California and former US senator, called on Congress to "finally" pass an assault weapons ban, similar to the one current President Joe Biden helped write as a senator and get passed into law in 1994.</p>

<p>That ban expired in 2004, and Congress did not renew it.</p>

<p>Harris also called for adopting universal background checks and implementing so-called red flag laws -- state protective orders aimed at preventing certain individuals seen as a threat from purchasing or possessing firearms.</p>

<p>"It is a false choice to say you're either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone's guns away," Harris said. "I'm in favor of the Second Amendment, and I know we need reasonable gun safety laws in our country."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK's Conservative Party leadership candidate Priti Patel has been eliminated from the contest after the first round of voting.</p>

<p>Ms Patel, who was the home secretary in former Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government, was running to succeed Rishi Sunak as the party's leader. Mr Sunak stepped down from the post after the Conservatives lost the general election in July.</p>

<p>Former immigration minister Robert Jenricks came out on top with 28 votes followed by Kemi Badenoch with 22 votes. James Cleverly was in the third position as he secured 21 votes and Tom Tugendhat won 17. Mel Stride was fifth with 16 and the last was Ms Patel with 14 votes.</p>

<p>The next vote will take place next Tuesday after which four candidates would remain before the party's annual conference at the end of September.</p>

<p>Multiple rounds of voting will take place after the conference from October 8. The voting will last three days until there are only two candidates left.</p>

<p>The MPs will then finally choose their leader, with the result announced on November 2.</p>

<p>During her term as home secretary, Ms Patel was known for her tough stance on immigration. She led the Conservative government's flagship scheme to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda.</p>

<p>In her Tory leadership campaign, she had promised to unite the party and get it ready for the next general election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian lawmaker Maria Butina said on Wednesday that reported US claims that Russia was trying to influence the 2024 election were nonsense and that Moscow felt that the only winner of the election would be the US military-industrial complex.</p>

<p>Butina was responding after CNN reported that the United States plans to accuse Russia later on Wednesday of a campaign to influence the presidential election using online platforms to target American voters with disinformation.</p>

<p>"The US claims were and are pure rubbish and a witch hunt," Butina, who spent 15 months in US prison for acting as an unregistered Russian agent and is now a lawmaker for the ruling United Russia party, told Reuters when asked about the CNN report.</p>

<p>"Russia thinks it does not matter who wins the US elections - the only winner is the US private military-industrial complex. That is what matters - and nothing else," Butina said.</p>

<p>The Kremlin and the Russian Foreign Ministry have repeatedly said that Moscow has not meddled in the US election, but is watching it closely.</p>

<p>The Kremlin in June dismissed as absurd US intelligence assertions that Russia was seeking to meddle in the presidential election and has said that US spies were intent on casting Russia as an enemy.</p>

<p>President Vladimir Putin had suggested in the past that, for Russia, Joe Biden would have been preferable to Donald Trump, though he spoke with irony about Biden.</p>

<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview published on Sunday that Russia saw US Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris as a more predictable opponent than Trump, but said there was no prospect of an improvement in relations with Washington anyway.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau suffered an unexpected blow on Wednesday when the small political party helping keep his minority Liberal government in power withdrew its support.</p>

<p>The announcement by Jagmeet Singh, leader of the left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP), does not mean Trudeau is in immediate danger of having to step down and call new elections.</p>

<p>However, he will have to find support from other opposition legislators in the House of Commons chamber if he is to pass budgets and survive confidence votes.</p>

<p>Jagmeet Singh said in a video that he was "ripping up" a deal the two men struck in 2022 and accused Justin Trudeau of not being able to take on the opposition Conservatives, who polls indicate are set to easily win an election that must be held by end-October 2025.</p>

<p>"The Liberals are too weak, too selfish and too devoted to corporate interests to fight for people. They cannot be the change - they cannot restore the hope," said Jagmeet Singh.</p>

<p>Under the 2022 deal, the NDP agreed to keep Justin Trudeau in power until mid-2025 in return for more social spending. Justin Trudeau first took office in November 2015 and polls suggest he is suffering from voter fatigue.</p>

<p>The same tiredness appears to have spread to the New Democratic Party, which despite successfully pushing the Liberals to introduce measures such as a national dental program are languishing in third place in polls.</p>

<p>A Justin Trudeau aide, speaking before the NDP announcement, said it "would be a shame if their own weakness and desperation causes them to walk away from a progressive agreement that is delivering for Canadians".</p>

<p>Jagmeet Singh is not due to speak to media until Thursday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Braving the constant threat of airstrikes and bombings, 15-year-old Youssef Saad, a Gazan oud player, rides his bicycle through the war-ravaged streets of northern Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp, his instrument strapped to his back.</p>

<p>Saad sings for children who have endured daily horrors in 11 months of conflict, trying to offer them a little joy or distraction.</p>

<p>"The homes in my city were once full of dreams," Saad said, gazing at the rubble of the decades-old urban refugee camp, which before the war was built-up and heavily populated.</p>

<p>"Now, they're gone," he says.</p>

<p>Saad was studying at the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music in nearby Gaza City before it was reduced to ruins in the war that has devastated much of the enclave.</p>

<p>Now, living with relatives after his own home was destroyed, he is one of five siblings whose futures have been upended.</p>

<p>His father, a government employee with the Palestinian Authority, always supported Saad's dream of becoming a musician.</p>

<p>But now, Saad's focus has shifted. He spends his days at a Jabalia day centre, playing his oud and singing for children traumatized by war.</p>

<p>The latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on October 7 when Palestinian Islamist group Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent assault on Hamas-governed Gaza has since killed more than 40,800 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, displaced almost the entire population and laid the besieged enclave to waste.</p>

<p>"Every house holds a tragedy," Saad said. "Some have lost their mother, others their father, their neighbour, or their friend."</p>

<p>Despite the danger, Saad is determined to continue his mission.</p>

<p>"We try to help improve their mental health, even if it means putting myself at risk," he said. "This is my duty to the children."</p>

<p>And he refuses to give up on his dreams for the future: "We, the children of Palestine, strive to stay resilient, even in the face of genocide."</p>

<p>Saad says he lives by a saying that carries him through the darkest days: "If you live, live free, or die standing like trees."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rome's ancient Arch of Constantine was hit by lightning during a heavy storm, causing some fragments to fall off, an official said Wednesday.</p>

<p>"All the fragments were recovered and made safe" following the strike on Tuesday afternoon, a spokeswoman for the Colosseum archaeological park told AFP.</p>

<p>"Damage assessments have already begun and analyses are continuing this morning with a works site already operational," she added.</p>

<p>The arch, built in 315 to celebrate the victory of Emperor Constantine in the battle of Ponte Milvio, was already undergoing maintenance work, which had begun on Monday.</p>

<p>Standing about 25 metres high, it is the largest of the three triumphal arches still preserved in Rome. It is located along the route followed by triumphal processions, near the Colosseum.</p>

<p>After a hot, dry summer, the centre of Rome was hit on Tuesday afternoon by a sudden storm, bringing heavy rain, high winds, thunder and lightning.</p>

<p>More than 80 millimetres (3.1 inches) of rain per square metre fell on the historic centre -- about the same amount that falls on average in a month in autumn, the municipality said.</p>

<p>The "downburst" caused floods and winds of up to 90 kilometres per hour (56mph) that brought down trees, it said.</p>

<p>Experts say climate change is shifting weather patterns and increasing the number of extreme weather events.</p>

<p>"It is increasingly evident that the issue of climate change and its impact on our lives is now unavoidable for everyone," said Rome mayor Roberto Gualtieri.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

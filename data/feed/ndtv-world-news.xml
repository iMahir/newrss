       <description><![CDATA[Hantavirus: According to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, this virus is a family of viruses spread mainly by rodents and can cause varied disease syndromes.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A health alert has been issued in the state of Arizona, in the United States, after a rodent-borne hantavirus killed four people. The virus spreads to humans through droplets from the urine, saliva, or faeces of the rats.</p>

<p>From January to July, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://ein.az.gov/emergency-information/emergency-bulletin/increase-hantavirus-activity-two-deaths-reported-coconino">Arizona Department of Health Services</a> documented seven instances of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome, a serious and occasionally lethal respiratory disease.</p>

<p>Two cases related to this deadly virus have also been found in California. The virus, primarily carried by deer mice in the Grand Canyon State, causes symptoms such as fever, headache, and muscle pain, which can rapidly progress to difficulty breathing. While hantavirus is not spread from person to person, it can occur in various regions and is not limited to a specific area.</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/about/index.html#:~:text=Hantaviruses%20can%20infect%20and%20cause,rodent%2C%20but%20this%20is%20rare.">US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, hantaviruses are a family of viruses spread mainly by rodents and can cause varied disease syndromes in people worldwide. This can cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), the CDC website says.</p>

<p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p>

<p>Hantavirus symptoms start with fatigue, fever, muscle aches, headaches, chills, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Late symptoms include coughing and shortness of breath, with a 38% mortality rate for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) symptoms appear 1-8 weeks post-exposure, causing headaches, pain, fever, chills, nausea, and blurred vision. Severe cases may lead to low blood pressure, shock, vascular leakage, and kidney failure. Recovery can take weeks or months.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment:</strong></p>

<p>The CDC says there is no specific treatment, cure, or vaccine for hantavirus infection. However, if the infected are recognised early on and are provided medical care in an intensive care unit, they may do better. In intensive care, patients are intubated and given oxygen therapy to help them through the period of severe respiratory distress.</p>

<p><strong>Prevention:</strong></p>

<p>According to the Centres for Disease Control, rodent control is the primary necessity to prevent hantavirus infections. Contact with rodent urine, droppings, saliva, and nesting materials should be avoided when cleaning rodent-infested areas.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Queen Mary of Denmark fell to the ground after being hit by an electric scooter during a royal engagement this week, as per a report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/25/entertainment/denmarks-queen-mary-left-shaken-after-electric-scooter-slams-into-her-during-royal-engagement/?utm_campaign=nypost&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social"><em>New York Post</em>.</a> The 52-year-old was interacting with fans and supporters in Nuuk, Greenland alongside her kids, Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine, when an elderly man drove into the gathering. Queen Mary was left terrified by the experience and she lost her balance and momentarily fell to the ground. Her security personnel immediately sprang into action and stopped the scooter from going any further as soon as she got back up.</p>

<p>Video footage of the incident, going viral on social media, shows the Queen being struck while her two children stood just a few feet away. The Danish royal communications office later announced that Queen Mary had not been injured.</p>

The police immediately barricaded and removed her from the situation. It must hurt to be hit at that speed. The police immediately barricaded and removed her from the situation."</p>

<p>Following the incident, the scooter driver claimed he was unsure of what caused the vehicle to lose control.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Queen Mary was born in Hobart, Tasmania on February 5, 1972. She was working as an advertising executive in Australia when she met the then 34-year-old Frederik while out with friends at Sydney's Slip Inn bar during the summer Olympics in 2000. As per a report in AFP, she only discovered later that he was the crown prince of Denmark and his group of friends was made up of other European royals -- including his younger brother Prince Joachim and cousin Prince Nikolaos of Greece and Denmark.</p>

<p>Following several covert meetings and a long-distance romance, the pair became engaged in October 2003 and were married in Copenhagen Cathedral on May 14, 2004. They are now parents to four children: Prince Christian, 18, who will one day succeed his father as king, Princess Isabella, 16, and twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine, 13.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nepalese authorities on Thursday recovered the black box of the aircraft that crashed here a day before and handed it over to a probe team formed to inquire into the tragic accident that killed 18 persons, including a child.</p>

<p>A Pokhra-bound Bombardier CRJ-200 aircraft of Saurya Airlines, carrying 19 people, crashed and caught fire shortly after taking off from the Tribhuvan International Airport here on Wednesday, killing 18 people aboard, and seriously injuring the pilot.</p>

<p>The killed people included two crew members, technical staff of the airline, and a family of three, including a four-year-old boy.</p>

<p>Hansa Raj Pandey, deputy director general of the Civil Aviation Authority, said the black box of the crashed aircraft has been recovered and handed over to a probe team for necessary action.</p>

<p>The probe team is headed by Ratish Chandra Lal, former director general of the Civil Aviation Authority, and includes four other experts. The team has to submit its probe report along with recommendations within 45 days.</p>

<p>The dead bodies are in the process of identification after conducting a post mortem and they will be handed over to the family members by Friday, Pandey said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Captain Manish Raj Shakya, the sole survivor of the Surya Airlines air crash, is undergoing treatment at the Kathmandu Medical College here and his condition is said to be still. "Though he is admitted to the ICU, he can speak," hospital sources said.</p>

<p>A local media report said Captain Shakya was saved after the cockpit of the aircraft was sheared off by a freight container seconds before the rest of the aircraft went up in flames.</p>

<p>The Saurya Airlines plane was flying to Pokhara for regular engine maintenance of the aircraft when the accident occurred.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yahya Al Ghotany, a 19-year-old taekwondo athlete from Syria, has been chosen to be the flag bearer for the Refugee Olympic Team (ROT) at the Paris 2024 Opening Ceremony on July 26.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Al Ghotany fled Syria with his family and is now training in Jordan. Despite all the challenges, he has become one of the youngest members of the ROT and one of the youngest flag bearers in the history of the Olympics.</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview with <a href="https://olympics.com/en/news/interview-refugee-athletes-yahya-al-ghotany-cindy-ngamba-paris-2024-opening-ceremony-flagbearers ">Olympics.com</a>, Al Ghotany shared his excitement and pride in being chosen as the flagbearer. "It is a very nice feeling, I had no idea that I was going to be the flagbearer," he said.</p>

<p>He also revealed that it felt amazing "to be the flagbearer for all the refugees around the world," and he is motivated to do better "because when I'll be competing, people will say 'he was a flag bearer'."</p>

<p>Al Ghotany got a black belt 2nd dan level in taekwondo just five years after starting the sport, a feat that typically takes seven years to accomplish. As one of the youngest members of the Paris 2024 Refugee Olympic Team and one of the youngest flag bearers at the Opening Ceremony, Al Ghotany is aware of his unique position.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When asked about it, he said it was "a bit abnormal", but he was happy. "I really think of the memories of everything that I've gone through and what really got me here," he said.</p>

<p>Yahya Al Ghotany's focus has been solely on the competition, as he feels more disciplined and concentrated on his career than ever before. This moment is a dream come true, one he has had since childhood. He is thrilled to be competing in the men's -68kg event on August 8, just a day before his 20th birthday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Al Ghotany recognises the significance of his presence in Paris, not only as a refugee but also as a young athlete. "I really look forward to learning a lot from this experience and with my age, I still have many years ahead of me," he said.</p>

<p>His goal is to become an improved version of himself, "the new Yahya", who fulfils all the passions, dreams and aspirations "that the young Yahya always dreamt of."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eighteen people were killed in Nepal when a small passenger plane crashed while taking off from the main airport in the capital Kathmandu, drawing attention once again to the Himalayan nation's poor record on air safety.</p>

<p>Here is a look at why Nepal, where more than 360 have died in airplane or helicopter crashes since 2000, is particularly susceptible.</p>

<h3><strong>TERRAIN</strong></h3>

<p>Wedged between India and China, landlocked Nepal is home to eight of the world's 14 highest peaks, and its planes often have to service small airports nestled in remote hills or near peaks blanketed in clouds.</p>

<p>Apart from the physical obstructions, the terrain can also experience sudden weather changes that affect wind speeds and intensity, making navigation tricky.</p>

<p>In a 2023 safety report, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) said collision with terrain or another obstacle was the main risk, accounting for 93% of deaths in air accidents in the prior decade.</p>

<h3><strong>TABLETOP RUNWAYS</strong></h3>

<p>Because of Nepal's scarcity of flat terrain, several areas have tabletop runways, built by excavating peaks to create a flat surface.</p>

<p>These have sheer drops at one or both ends, calling for greater skill in landing aircraft but also leading to massive injuries or fatalities if pilots overshoot on the approach.</p>

<h3><strong>AGEING FLEET</strong></h3>

<p>Among the world's poorer countries, Nepal has not invested sufficiently in upgrading or maintaining its planes.</p>

<p>Many are ageing, so that they lack some features and facilities common elsewhere, and tend to be poorly maintained, making mishaps more likely.</p>

<p>This is partly why the European Union, citing "safety concerns", banned air carriers certified in Nepal in 2013.</p>

<p>In its latest safety review in 2023, however, the EU recognised the aviation regulator's "proactive engagement" and efforts to boost oversight.</p>

<h3><strong>CREW MANAGEMENT AND TRAINING</strong></h3>

<p>Experts have called for better training for pilots in Nepal, with some crashes attributed to poor decision-making.</p>

<p>Nepal's worst crash in three decades killed 72 people in January 2023 and was blamed, for example, on the pilot's lack of awareness of standard operating procedures leading him to mistakenly cut the power to the plane, causing its crash.</p>

<p>This was the only fatal accident globally last year, snapping a years-long trend of positive safety in the Asia-Pacific region, the International Air Transport Association said in a report.</p>

<h3><strong>REGULATION AND OVERSIGHT</strong></h3>

<p>Aviation services and regulation are handled by separate agencies in most countries, but in Nepal, regulator CAAN both regulates airlines and manages airports.</p>

<p>Experts say this is a conflict of interest as the regulator polices its own operations, adding that it has led to corruption and mismanagement.</p>

<p>CAAN denies this contention, saying there is no direct link between the units functioning under one organisation.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two&nbsp;helicopters&nbsp;were reported to have collided&nbsp;in&nbsp;midair&nbsp;on Thursday&nbsp;in&nbsp;Western&nbsp;Australia, with&nbsp;injuries unknown at the current stage.</p>

<p>According to a statement by the Western&nbsp;Australia&nbsp;Police Force, the&nbsp;incident took place near Mount Anderson Station&nbsp;in&nbsp;Camballin, a small town&nbsp;in&nbsp;the state's&nbsp;Kimberley&nbsp;region, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Emergency services were notified of the crash at about 6:20 a.m. local time on Thursday morning.</p>

<p>"Early&nbsp;indications suggest&nbsp;two&nbsp;helicopters&nbsp;collided shortly after take-off. It is believed both&nbsp;helicopters&nbsp;were solely occupied by a pilot," police said.</p>

<p>Authorities also noted that at this time, details of those on board and the extent of their&nbsp;injuries are unknown.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The deleted accounts included a network of 2,500 profiles traced to a group of 20 people.</p>

<p>Some 1,300 Facebook accounts, 200 Facebook Pages and 5,700 Facebook Groups originating from the country were also removed for "providing tips for conducting scams".</p>

<p>Gangs run sextortion scams by pretending to be members of the opposite sex and persuading people to provide explicit images of themselves and then threatening to release them to the public unless their victims send them money.</p>

<p>"They targeted primarily adult men in the US and used fake accounts to mask their identities," Meta said in a statement.</p>

<p>It blamed "Yahoo Boys", a Nigerian slang for internet fraudsters, for the scam accounts.</p>

<p>The social media giant explained that while the majority of the attempts by scammers were unsuccessful and mostly focused on adult victims, they have also targeted minors.</p>

<p>A Homeland Security Investigation between October 2021 and March 2023 received 13,000 reports of financial sextortion involving 12,600 minors, mostly boys, in the United States.</p>

<p>The scams triggered at least 20 suicides, according to the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).</p>

<p>"Offenders who engage in financially motivated sextortion are often located outside the United States-primarily in west African countries such as Nigeria and Ivory Coast, or Southeast Asian countries such as the Philippines," FBI said in a statement in January.</p>

<p>To combat the rising spate of the crime, Meta announced in April that it was testing an AI-powered "nudity protection" feature in Instagram direct messages to protect teenagers.</p>

<p>Two men were arrested in Nigeria the same month for trying to extort an Australian teenager by threatening to release "personal photos of the boy" if he did not pay them 500 Australian dollars ($330).</p>

<p>Australian police said the boy had killed himself after being threatened by the suspects in the alleged "sextortion" scam.</p>

<p>Meta said it is also working with law enforcement agencies in the investigation and prosecution of the alleged crimes.</p>

<p>The clampdown on the scam accounts came days after Nigerian authorities fined the Facebook parent company for "multiple and repeated" data violations.</p>

<p>The country's Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) on Friday accused Meta of violating the country's data protection and consumer rights laws on Facebook and WhatsApp.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p><p><div class='table-div suicide'><table class='table'><thead><tr><th colspan='2'>Helplines</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vandrevala Foundation for Mental Health</td><td><a href='tel:+919999666555'>9999666555</a> or <a href='mailto:help@vandrevalafoundation.com'>help@vandrevalafoundation.com</a> </td></tr><tr><td>TISS iCall</td><td><a href='tel:+912225521111'>022-25521111</a> (Monday-Saturday: 8 am to 10 pm)</td></tr> <tr><td colspan='2'>(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian and Chinese bomber jets carried out a joint patrol over far eastern Russia and the Bering Sea near Alaska, Russia's defence ministry said Thursday.</p>

<p>It said "Russian space forces' Tu-95MS strategic missile carriers and the Chinese air force's Xian H-6 strategic bombers carried out an aerial patrol over the Chukchi and Bering Seas and the north Pacific Ocean".</p>

<p>The statement came after the joint US-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) said American and Canadian warplanes had intercepted two Russian and two Chinese bombers in international airspace near Alaska on Wednesday.</p>

<p>It said the bombers "remained in international airspace" and were "not seen as a threat".</p>

<p>Moscow also said the patrol observed international law and did not breach foreign airspace, adding that "at certain stages of the route, the aviation group was accompanied by fighter jets of foreign countries".</p>

<p>The patrol was part of "a plan of military cooperation for 2024 and not directed against third countries," Moscow said.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry posted images of planes taking off and landing as well as footage from the air.</p>

<p>The TU-95MS planes were developed in the Soviet era to carry long-range cruise missiles and are part of Russia's nuclear triad. The Xian H-6 planes are also nuclear-capable.</p>

<p>China and Russia have drawn closer in recent years and hold joint military exercises regularly.</p>

<p>Beijing has strengthened its diplomatic, economic and military ties with Moscow since the start of the Russian offensive in Ukraine in February 2022.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin visited China in May on his first trip abroad after re-election and met Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping again this month at a regional summit in Kazakhstan.</p>

<p>Russia said Sunday that it scrambled fighter jets to prevent two US strategic bomber planes from crossing its border over the Barents Sea in the Arctic.</p>

<p>The US military routinely carries out flights over international waters, operations that it says are conducted in neutral airspace, but Moscow has responded more aggressively in recent months.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Olympic Games, considered the pinnacle of sporting competition, got off to a grand start in Paris today. The Games also honours refugee athletes who have overcome incredible obstacles to pursue their dreams. One such athlete is Yusra Mardini, a Syrian refugee who fled her war-torn country as a teenager and went on to compete in the 2016 and 2020 Olympic Games.</p>

<p>Yusra was 16 years old when she escaped from a civil war in her home in Syria in August 2015.</p>

<p>Accompanied by her sister, the journey was grueling. They traveled by plane from Syria to Lebanon, then to Turkey, before boarding a boat bound for Greece.</p>

<p>The short 10-kilometer journey was supposed to take just 45 minutes, but the vessel, already in disrepair and overcrowded with 20 people, began to falter just 20 minutes in. Yusra, her sister, and two others were forced to abandon the ship and push the boat towards shore, a desperate effort that took over three hours.</p>

<p>"The whole time, you could hear all our prayers in one voice," the ambassador to the Olympic refugee team recounted in an interview.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mayne Pharma has filed a lawsuit against Sun Pharma over infringements of patents related to a certain product used for menopause-related vaginal pain, the Australian drugmaker said on Thursday.</p>

<p>In the lawsuit filed at the United States District Court for New Jersey, Mayne Pharma accused its rival of violating all 20 Orange Book-listed patents linked to IMVEXXY - a vaginal insert aimed at reducing pain during sexual intercourse after menopause.</p>

<p>Orange Book-listed patents are those approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and deemed safe to use.</p>

<p>The Australian drugmaker said it filed the lawsuit after a notification indicated Sun Pharma's submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) to the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of IMVEXXY.</p>

<p>The ANDA is a request filed to the health regulator for approval of an already licensed drug to manufacture the medication in the United States. These application processes do not warrant the applicant to go through a clinical trial.</p>

<p>Sun Pharma did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.</p>

<p>Mayne Pharma's complaint also indicated that Sun Pharma filed a Paragraph IV certification, suggesting the latter challenged the patent's (IMVEXXY) listing in the Orange Book as invalid or inapplicable.</p>

<p>This "formally initiates the litigation process under the Hatch-Waxman Act and triggers a 30-month stay of any potential FDA approval for Sun Pharma's ANDA," Mayne Pharma said in a statement.</p>

<p>IMVEXXY is distributed by TherapeuticsMD and had sealed the FDA's approval in 2018.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One of the greatest electoral races in the world, the election to the office of the President of the United States (POTUS), is about to begin. By the end of the fourth week of August, Democrats will finalise their candidate to take on former President and Republican nominee Donald Trump.</p>

<p>After the disastrous debate last month between Biden and Trump, Democrats are now struggling with the candidature of the incumbent POTUS after he recently announced that he will not seek re-election. His endorsement of Vice-President Kamala Harris has yet to secure final approval from party leaders. Naturally, time is short for the Democrats to mount an effective challenge.</p>

<p>The American political landscape changed drastically after Trump escaped an assassination attempt earlier this month. Though many argue that the election is not a done deal yet, the odds seem to favour the GOP heavily as of now. The party may wrest not only the White House but both Houses of the U.S. Congress, that is, the House of Representatives and the Senate.</p>

<h2><strong>The 'Transition Project'</strong></h2>

<p>Governments and administrations across the globe are trying to estimate what a second Trump administration might bring. Of course, unlike 2016, they now have the benefit of hindsight to draft a calibrated policy to engage with the United States. Here, besides previous experience, policy planners are dipping into a 900-odd page document, the 2025 Presidential Transition Project, in which domain experts have listed department-wise policy prescriptions and drawn a roadmap for the Conservatives to effect fundamental changes in the way the country is governed.</p>

<p>The Project, helmed by Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based think tank that reflects Republican views, is considered a key and expansive input given that Trump in his first administration had drawn heavily from the organisation's expertise. Trump may not have officially granted recognition to the document, but it is being read by policy planners with wide interest.</p>

<h2><strong>How India-US Relations May Evolve</strong></h2>

<p>Bilateral relations between the two democracies are characterised by India as a 'Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership'. One defining feature of that is the fact that New Delhi enjoys bipartisan support in Washington. Successive administrations, whether Democrat or Republican, have continued to engage with India. From deep sea to outer space, the partnership encompasses a wide range of subjects. By extension, members of the U.S. Congress have also shown a greater accommodative spirit over the last three decades.</p>

<p>As for multi-sector engagement, three key areas have been defence cooperation, strategic engagement and trade and investment. Going by his previous administration, these are likely to remain Trump's top priorities if he manages to return as President. He is riding on his 'Make America Great Again' pitch and aims to restore to the US shop floors across industrial units that shifted their jobs to off-shore facilities.</p>

<h2><strong>What's In For Trade Relations</strong></h2>

<p>Statistics for 2022 show that the India-US bilateral trade for merchandise and services stood at $191.43 billion. Of this, while India's exports accounted for $118.53 billion, US exports were around $72.90 billion. India enjoyed a balance of trade of over $100 billion in its favour.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A second Trump administration is expected to exert pressure towards expanding trade and services with all countries, including India. The section on trade in the Project 2025 report, quoting US government figures, states that of the $1,138 billion deficit that the US has with 14 major trading partners, India is in 11th position. Negotiators can expect hard bargaining, with each side insisting on securing the best deal for the country.</p>

<h2><strong>Defence And Strategic Ties</strong></h2>

<p>The ties in this sector continue to flourish, especially since the signing of the Framework for Defence Cooperation in 2005, which was renewed for another decade in 2015. Besides designating India as a 'Major Defence Partner', the pact moved up New Delhi to grant it licence exemption for Strategic Trade Authorisation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last year, both sides also finalised a Defence Industrial Cooperation Roadmap and launched a Defence Acceleration Ecosystem to build a network of universities, incubators, think tanks and private investments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sector will be watched with much interest given that India is working on a plan to build specialised industrial corridors to manufacture defence equipment in the country with technology transfers, something that American companies working with critical technologies are not particularly keen about. However, this contrasts with the decision on Capitol Hill to provide India with incentives to wean it away from Russian military hardware.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, India is part of the Quad and Indo-Pacific groupings, both of which got a boost during the previous Trump administration. While China, Iran and North Korea occupy a central place in the report's analysis, India's reference in the document appears in relation to Pakistan and tensions over Jammu and Kashmir, and suggests a 'Quad Plus' approach.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has been no spike in Covid cases in France as tourists surge in for the Paris Olympic Games, a minister said Thursday, adding that the government would remain "vigilant".</p>

<p>"Covid is still with us at a low level" but "we're not in a period with an explosion or strong return" of the virus, junior health minister Frederic Valletoux told broadcaster Franceinfo.</p>

<p>He added that authorities were not "for now" expecting to introduce mask requirements in venues.</p>

<p>"There's no kind of very strong alert signal at this stage," Valletoux said.</p>

<p>A few of the 10,500 athletes set to participate have tested positive for Covid since arriving.</p>

<p>"We knew there is no such thing as zero risk," Valletoux said.</p>

<p>Among the worst hit are Australia's female water polo team, with the delegation's head Anna Meares confirming five cases, while several Belgian competitors have also tested positive according to Olympic Committee doctors.</p>

<p>Some delegations have toughened up precautions in response.</p>

<p>For instance, France's rowing team insisted on masks at media events ahead of the competition.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video showing a British police officer kick and stamp on a man's head during an arrest at Manchester airport in northern England sparked a protest outside a police station late on Wednesday night.</p>

<p>Police said they had referred the actions to an independent complaints watchdog after the video, filmed by an onlooker, was posted on social media platforms and attracted immediate criticism.</p>

<p>It showed a chaotic scene in an airport car park in which several officers armed with tasers restrained two suspects. One man was kicked and stamped upon as he lay face down on the floor. The second man also appeared to be struck in the head by an officer.</p>

<p>A Greater Manchester Police (GMP) statement said the video showed "an event that is truly shocking, and that people are rightly extremely concerned about. The use of such force in an arrest is an unusual occurrence and one that we understand creates alarm."</p>

<p>It said police had been responding to reports of an assault, and that three officers were themselves assaulted during their response. The officers required hospital treatment, including one female officer who had a broken nose.</p>

<p>"One male officer has been removed from operational duties and we are making a voluntary referral of our policing response to the Independent Office of Police Conduct," the statement added.</p>

<p>The two men were arrested on suspicion of assault, assault of an emergency worker, affray, and obstructing police.</p>

<p>The incident sparked a protest outside a police station in a nearby town. One videos posted online showed the crowd of at least 100 people chanting "Shame on you GMP".</p>

<p>Police, who have not confirmed any details about the identity of those arrested at the airport, said the protest concluded safely and without incident.</p>

<p>"We have spent the evening listening to community feedback and will continue to engage with communities and elected members to maintain strong partnership links and understand local views," they said in a subsequent statement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Dozens of teachers and professors have been fighting on the front lines and one-fifth of the sector's facilities have been damaged or destroyed by Russian bombardments]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anton Yushyn spent four years studying Italian at university in Kyiv but the outbreak of war taught him the most valuable lesson of his student life: to prioritise what matters most.</p>

<p>When he enrolled at Kyiv National Linguistic University, Russia had not yet invaded, and his main concerns were socialising and passing exams to placate his parents.</p>

<p>"Maybe it's not my goals that have changed but my values," Yushyn, 22, told AFP on graduation day in Kyiv last month.</p>

<p>"It all used to be about parties and having fun. Now you need to spend more time with family and friends because they could be gone at any moment," he said.</p>

<p>Thousands of Ukrainians graduating from around 300 universities this summer are entering into a society transformed by war -- their futures in doubt with no end in sight to the fighting.</p>

<p>As Ukraine mobilises young men to replenish the army's stretched ranks, male graduates face the prospect of being called up once they turn 25.</p>

<p>Higher education has not been immune from the conflict.</p>

<p>Dozens of teachers and professors have been fighting on the front lines and one-fifth of the sector's facilities have been damaged or destroyed by Russian bombardments.</p>

<p>In December 2022, a missile landed just a few hundred metres from Yushyn's campus.</p>

<h3><strong>To stay, or leave</strong></h3>

<p>But on graduation day, the mood at Yushyn's alma mater was festive. Perfume hung in the hot summer air and staff congratulated joyful students for completing their studies in the face of historic turbulence.</p>

<p>Student life was barely back to normal after the Covid pandemic when Russia invaded in February 2022.</p>

<p>Universities suspended classes and Korean language student Nikoletta Shova was sent by her parents to stay with relatives in Italy.</p>

<p>The 22-year-old compared the "emotional" time abroad to being in a "stupor", left wondering if she would ever be able to return.</p>

<p>Teaching restarted at most universities just a few weeks later -- online or in person -- when Russian forces were still on Kyiv's outskirts.</p>

<p>Shova returned after three months away and was able to finish her degree in person while raising money for the war effort with classmates.</p>

<p>Now, with her diploma in hand, uncertainty had returned.</p>

<p>She was considering studying abroad -- possibly marketing in the United States -- but she was also open to finding a creative job at home.</p>

<p>Building a future in Ukraine despite the war was possible, she said, borrowing a popular phrase to underscore that it would take perseverance: "he who doesn't take risks never drinks champagne".</p>

<h3><strong>Jokes, memes</strong></h3>

<p>"So I'm being realistic but with a bit of positivity," she said of her future.</p>

<p>Daryna Dekhtiar, 22, also a graduate of Kyiv National Linguistic University, went numb when Russia invaded.</p>

<p>"I didn't cry at all. I just went into autopilot," she said, but her friends had helped lift her spirits too, she added.</p>

<p>"We created our own memes, our jokes, it made it all much easier," she recalled.</p>

<p>Dana Andriichuk, who already had secured an office job by graduation, was rushing to meet friends after the ceremony.</p>

<p>She didn't want to dwell on the relative comfort of her student years or spend too much thinking about the prospect of a long war.</p>

<p>"I'm trying to avoid being a pessimist stuck in the past. I want to live now and not in the future, because we don't know what will happen next," she said.</p>

<p>"If the government encourages young people to stay and do everything possible to build a better future even in a state of war -- and society becomes nationally conscious -- then we can consider staying in the country," she said.</p>

<h3><strong>- 'Don't run and hide' -</strong></h3>

<p>Like thousands of other male graduates, Yushyn does not have as much freedom to choose. Authorities have barred men aged between 18 and 60 from leaving Ukraine.</p>

<p>Thousands have left illegally and dozens have died trying.</p>

<p>But Yushyn was resigned to life at home.</p>

<p>"Real men don't run and hide. If the time comes and I get a summons, I won't run from it," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"I can wind myself up, cry, sit here trembling all I want, it won't change the trajectory of the rocket," he said.</p>

<p>Whatever the future holds, he said he was unlikely to use Italian, but was resolved to spending his time as best he could.</p>

<p>"I need to use it to the fullest."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Malaysia's digital minister, Gobind Singh Deo, has asked Microsoft and CrowdStrike to consider compensating companies that suffered losses during last week's global tech outage, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/malaysia-asks-microsoft-crowdstrike-consider-covering-losses-global-outage-2024-07-24/ ">Reuters</a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The outage, caused by a faulty CrowdStrike software update, affected computers powered by Microsoft's Windows operating system, disrupting internet services worldwide. In Malaysia, five government agencies and nine companies in aviation, banking and healthcare were affected.</p>

<p>Minister Deo, who met with representatives from Microsoft and cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, has requested a detailed report on the incident and urged the companies to take preventive measures to avoid future outages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He announced that he has also requested the companies to consider compensation claims from parties who have suffered damages or losses due to the recent global tech outage. However, the full extent of the losses has yet to be determined.</p>

<p>Tony Fernandes, CEO of Malaysia's Capital A, which operates budget airline AirAsia, also called for compensation, stating companies deserved reimbursement for losses incurred due to the tech failure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The global outage affected airports, pharmacies, banks, payment systems and train services, causing significant inconvenience to many. Even a terminal cancer patient's <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/terminal-cancer-patients-brain-surgery-delayed-by-microsoft-outage-6169686 ">brain surgery was delayed</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft and CrowdStrike collaborated to resolve the issue, releasing a recovery tool and providing guidance for affected customers. The recovery tool offered two options - "Recover from WinPE" and "Recover from safe mode", to help customers restore their systems.</p>

<p>Airports have advised passengers to continue checking for potential disruptions before travelling. Although systems are now back online, some journeys may still be impacted by delays and cancellations. Major airlines, including Ryanair, British Airways and EasyJet, were affected, with some flights cancelled due to software issues.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Australian judge on Thursday dismissed a class action lawsuit claiming Bayer's Roundup weedkiller can cause a type of blood cancer, a boost for the company which is grappling with a slew of similar cases in the United States.</p>

<p>Justice Michael Lee of Australia's Federal Court ruled that on the balance of probabilities, there was insufficient evidence to conclude that Roundup can cause non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL).</p>

<p>"It is not proven in this proceeding on a balance of probabilities... that throughout the relevant period use of, and or exposure to Roundup products increased an individual's risk of developing NHL," Lee said.</p>

<p>The German pharmaceutical and chemicals company has maintained that Roundup, a glyphosate-based herbicide, is safe. It says it "fully stands behind its glyphosate-based products, which have been used around the world for almost 50 years."</p>

<p>The Australian class action against Bayer subsidiaries united more than 1,000 claimants and is one of some 40 cases filed outside the United States, all in either Canada or Australia.</p>

<p>Lead claimant, 41-year-old Kelvin McNickle, said he used Roundup to spray weeds for over two decades on his family's property and while working for a vegetation management company. He developed non-Hodgkins lymphoma at age 35.</p>

<p>In the United States, Bayer has prevailed in 14 of the last 20 Roundup trials, but it also racked up a string of losses in late 2023 and early 2024, resulting in more than $4 billion in damages awarded in verdicts.</p>

<p>Some of those verdicts have seen the amounts awarded reduced but the string of wins for plaintiffs shattered investor and company hopes that the worst of the Roundup litigation was over.</p>

<p>The company still faces more than 50,000 outstanding claims in the United States. A request for an agreement to prevent future cases was denied by a U.S. court.</p>

<p>Roundup was originally produced by U.S. agrochemical company Monsanto, which Bayer acquired for $63 billion in 2018.</p>

<p>The company has replaced glyphosate with new active ingredients in its products for household use in the United States to reduce the risk of litigation as most claims have come from home users.</p>

<p>It continues to sell glyphosate-based weedkillers to farmers, who rely on it heavily.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Disturbing videos showing a British police officer kicking and stomping on a man's head at Manchester Airport on Tuesday night have sparked outrage on social media. In one of the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/doamuslims/status/1816111762057368046">clips</a>, the uniformed male officer is seen holding a Taser over the man, who is lying face down, before striking him twice while other officers shout at onlookers to stay back. The officer is also seen stomping his boots on the back of the man's head and slamming his knee into his back before sitting on top of him. Later in the same video, another man, whose hands were in the air while sitting nearby, is also taken to the ground after a police officer points a taser at him. Both men appeared to be handcuffed and taken into custody.</p>

<p>The second&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/doamuslims/status/1816206815404888228">video </a>shows another man being confronted, pepper-sprayed in the face and brought to the ground by a police officer who wrapped his arm around the man's neck as he wrestled him down. The clips appear to show the attacks taking place on the ground level of the airport outside of several elevators.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a statement on X (formerly Twitter), Greater Manchester Police (GMP) confirmed the incident, which took place in the airport's Terminal 2 on Tuesday. The cops said that footage on social media showed a confrontation that began after three officers were injured in a "violent assault", including one female officer who suffered a broken nose. However, they also added that the event seen in the videos was "truly shocking" and an "unusual occurrence". A male officer has been "removed from operational duties," the police said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We know that a film of an incident at Manchester Airport that is circulating widely shows an event that is truly shocking, and that people are rightly extremely concerned about," said Assistant Chief Constable Chaudhry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The use of such force in an arrest is an unusual occurrence and one that we understand creates alarm. One male officer has been removed from operational duties and we are making a voluntary referral of our policing response to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC)," Mr Chaudhry added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The IOPC said it would assess GMP's referral "and decide what further action is required".</p>

<p>In its post, the Greater Manchester Police also outlined what it said were the events that led up to the videos. Cops said that they were called to Terminal 2 of the airport on Tuesday evening following reports of an assault. When they confronted the male suspect, three officers were injured in a "violent assault, where they were punched to the ground," with one female officer ending up with a broken nose, the force said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Four men have been arrested for assaulting an emergency worker, the statement added.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on social media, the incident has sparked an outcry over whether violence used by police was proportionate or justified. According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7259wpl1x9o"><em>BBC</em></a>, protesters gathered outside the force's divisional headquarters in the town of Rochdale on Wednesday. Many British politicians also condemned the incident and called the videos "disturbing".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, called the videos "disturbing" in a post on X. UK Home Office Minister Diana Johnson said on X that she was "aware of the disturbing footage" and "understand(s) the public concern it has prompted. I have asked for a full update from Greater Manchester Police."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Heavy rain from Typhoon Gaemi has flooded the Philippine capital Manila and nearby cities, forcing authorities to shut schools, and offices and cancel flights on Wednesday and declare a state of calamity in a region that is home to 13 million people.</p>

<p>The storm, which is strengthening as it gusts towards Taiwan, did not make landfall in the Philippines but has intensified seasonal monsoon rains, causing landslides and flooding over the past few days.</p>

<p>At least 12 people have died and more than 600,000 are displaced due to the storm, known locally as Typhoon Carina, the national disaster agency said. Water in some areas is neck-high.</p>

<p>The Philippine Coastguard said 260 passengers and 16 vessels were stranded in ports while airlines cancelled 114 flights out of Manila on Wednesday, the airport authority said.</p>

<p>The financial markets were also closed.</p>

<p>President Ferdinand Marcos Jr told the disaster relief agencies to provide assistance and prepare supplies for isolated communities during a briefing on Wednesday, and the mayors of 16 cities in the Greater Manila region have asked for emergency funding, officials said.</p>

<p>In the riverside city of Marikina, emergency workers waded through waist-deep waters and used rubber dinghies to rescue residents from their inundated homes.</p>

<p>Some people were sheltered in churches, among the statues of Catholic saints.</p>

<p>"The flood reached the second floor of our house, all our things are ruined, everything got wet, nothing was saved," Ladylyn Bernas, an evacuee at a nearby church, told Reuters.</p>

<p>Social media posts showed several vehicles stuck in water or floating down streets and highways.</p>

<p>The Philippines sees an average of 20 tropical storms annually, causing floods and deadly landslides.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French authorities have launched a major operation to clean up computers infected by a cyber-espionage programme that has struck millions of users worldwide, a senior prosecutor said Thursday.</p>

<p>"On the eve of the Olympics, this operation demonstrates that different players in France and abroad are mobilised to fight against all forms of cybercrime," Paris chief prosecutor Laure Beccuau said in a statement.</p>

<p>She said investigators were targeting a network of bots suspected of infecting computers with PlugX malware and of stealing data from them "notably for purposes of espionage".</p>

<p>She said analysts and investigators had managed to take control of a server that was controlling millions of the infected computers and were administering a fix.</p>

<p>They launched the operation on July 18 and it is expected to last several months, having already aided victims in several European countries, the statement said.</p>

<p>It did not cite a specific threat to the Paris Olympics. But separately, the French government's cyber security agency warned last week that ransomware attacks will be "inevitable" during the Games, which officially open Friday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

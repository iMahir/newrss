       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia's census will ask citizens about their sexuality for the first time, the government said Friday, a policy U-turn aimed at quelling anger from LGBTQ groups.</p>

<p>Supporters have said questions about sexual identity would provide a more accurate snapshot of who Australians are and who they love.</p>

<p>Just a day after his ministers explained the census change had been scrapped to avoid a divisive debate, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Friday that a question about sexuality would in fact be included in the 2026 survey.</p>

<p>Australia's statistics bureau has developed a new question about sexual orientation, which will now be tested before it can be included in the survey, he said.</p>

<p>"We think that is a common sense position," Albanese told public broadcaster ABC.</p>

<p>It is compulsory to complete the census in Australia, with fines for those who fail to do so.</p>

<p>But people would have the option of answering the sexual orientation question or not, the prime minister said.</p>

<p>Asked why the government had backed down, Albanese said: "No, this is the first time I have been asked about it."</p>

<p>He made no mention of plans to include a question about gender identity, however, saying only that there would not be "massive changes" to the census.</p>

<p>Equality Australia, a rights advocacy group, said it was now unclear how the census would affect trans and gender-diverse people, as well as people with innate variations of sex characteristics.</p>

<p>"We welcome the inclusion of a sexual orientation question but the national snapshot of our nation must include all of us, not just some of us," said Equality Australia chief executive Anna Brown.</p>

<p>"The federal government shouldn't pick and choose those of us who are worthy of being counted."</p>

<p>Brown said including LGBTQ people in the census would bring Australia into line with other countries that already do so, including Britain, Canada and New Zealand.</p>

<p>"It would be a shame if the government doesn't trust the Australian public enough to accept that the census needs to gather basic data about our nation for it be meaningful and useful," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has confirmed that an F16 fighter jet crashed and its pilot died while combating Russian airstrikes.</p>

<p>The F16 fighters participating in the combat had destroyed four missiles, and one of the aircraft lost contact while approaching the next target, the General Staff said in a statement on Telegram.</p>

<p>"As it turned out later, the plane crashed, and the pilot died," the statement said, without specifying the date of the incident.</p>

<p>The special commission of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry is working on the scene to determine the cause of the crash, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, the Ukrainian Air Force said pilot Oleksii Mes was killed on August 26 while repelling a Russian attack on Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Air Force did not specify whether Mes was an F16 pilot.</p>

<p>In early August, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the first batch of F16s had arrived in Ukraine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Naming others is considered a marker of highly advanced cognition in social animals, previously observed only in humans, bottlenose dolphins and African elephants.</p>

<p>Marmoset monkeys have now joined this exclusive club, according to a new study published in Science on Thursday.</p>

<p>The diminutive primates use loud, high-pitched calls to assign each other "vocal labels," as shown in research conducted by a team at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>"We are very interested in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/education/iit-mandi-study-deploys-robots-to-unravel-homing-behaviour-in-animals-6421711" target="_blank">social behavior</a> because we think that social behavior is essentially what drove us humans to be so special compared to other animals," senior author David Omer told AFP.</p>

<p>"We don't run fast, we don't fly, we don't excel in anything else besides being social and all our achievements as a society are our societal achievements."</p>

<p>Marmosets are ideal subjects to study the evolution of social behavior and language in humans, he explained, because they exhibit similar traits, living in small monogamous family groups of six to eight individuals that cooperatively rear their young.</p>

<p>Led by graduate student Guy Oren, the researchers recorded natural conversations between pairs of marmosets separated by a visual barrier, as well as <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/iit-researchers-discover-how-animals-find-their-way-home-using-robots-6434736" target="_blank">interactions</a> between the monkeys and a computer system that played back pre-recorded calls.</p>

<p>They discovered that marmosets use "phee calls" -- very high-pitched vocalizations, as loud as power tools -- to address one another. Notably, the monkeys could recognize when such calls were directed at them and were more likely to respond when addressed by their name.</p>

<h3><strong>Machine learning advances</strong></h3>

<p>The ten marmosets they tested came from three separate families, and the research also revealed that members within a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/research-suggests-cats-mourn-the-death-of-companion-animals-even-dogs-6325308" target="_blank">family group</a> used similar sound features to code different names, akin to dialects or accents in humans. This held true even for adult marmosets that weren't related by blood, suggesting they learned from others within the family group.</p>

<p>Marmosets are relatively distant relatives of humans. We last shared a common ancestor around 35 million years ago, while the split between ourselves and chimpanzees could have happened 5-7 million years ago.</p>

<p>Rather than genetic proximity, Omer attributes the acquisition of vocal labels by marmosets to "convergent evolution," or the idea that they evolved similar traits in response to comparable environmental challenges.</p>

<p>For marmosets, vocal labeling may have been crucial for maintaining <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/can-hippos-fly-new-uk-research-reveals-bizarre-finding-6065938" target="_blank">social bonds</a> and group cohesion in the dense rainforests of South America, where visibility is often limited.</p>

<p>How and when humans first began talking is a matter of debate, but until recently many scientists had dismissed the idea we could look to other primates for clues. Omer stressed the latest research was yet another blow to that long-standing opinion.</p>

<p>"We can still learn a lot from non-human <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/webstories/feature/animals-experience-time-differently-from-humans-16566" target="_blank">primates</a> about the evolution of language in humans," he said.</p>

<p>The team's statistical analysis of the marmosets' calls was made possible by recent advancements in computational power and machine learning, he added. Looking ahead, one exciting avenue for future research could be leveraging AI to further decipher the content of marmoset conversations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. also have been in talks about participating in the financing that is led by Thrive Capital, which is investing about $1 billion]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nvidia Corp., the world's biggest chipmaker, has discussed joining a funding round for OpenAI that would value the artificial intelligence startup at more than $100 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. also have been in talks about participating in the financing, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. The round would be led by Thrive Capital, which is investing about $1 billion, Bloomberg reported earlier this week. Nvidia has discussed investing about $100 million, two of the people said.</p>

<p>If the discussions move forward, it would mean the three most valuable tech companies are all backing OpenAI, maker of the groundbreaking ChatGPT chatbot. Microsoft was already OpenAI's biggest funder, having invested roughly $13 billion.</p>

<p>Representatives for Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, OpenAI and Thrive all declined to comment.</p>

<p>Big Tech's influence over artificial intelligence has been drawing mounting scrutiny, with regulators in both the EU and US expressing concerns about Nvidia's dominance in AI chips and Microsoft's close relationship with OpenAI. Microsoft has tightly integrated OpenAI's services into its Windows and Copilot AI platforms - a bet that the capabilities will help drive growth.</p>

<p>Apple has existing ties with OpenAI as well. The iPhone maker is adding ChatGPT to its new suite of AI features, called Apple Intelligence. The company also was slated to take a board observer seat at OpenAI - alongside Microsoft - but those plans were dropped in July.</p>

<p>Nvidia, meanwhile, supplies the critical infrastructure needed to develop and run AI tools like ChatGPT. It's the biggest maker of so-called AI accelerators, sales of which have soared over the past two years.</p>

<p>In Nvidia's latest quarterly report, released on Wednesday, revenue more than doubled to $30 billion. It predicted even bigger sales in the current quarter, topping the average analysts estimates, though investors have grown so accustomed to blowout results that the shares still declined.</p>

<p>OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar told employees in a memo Wednesday that the company was seeking fresh capital, without giving details, according to people familiar with the matter. The company has been in discussions to raise funding at a valuation at or above $100 billion since at least December, Bloomberg has reported.</p>

<p>The financing would bolster one of the world's most valuable venture-backed startups. The runaway success of ChatGPT also has kicked off an arms race among tech companies, which are integrating AI technology across their products and funding other promising startups.</p>

<p>In her memo to employees, Friar said that OpenAI would use the financing to acquire more computing power and fund other operating expenses, the people said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Resumes of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, two of the most iconic figures in the world of technology, have resurfaced on social media. These vintage documents, created when they were 18, offer a rare glimpse into the early lives of two tech innovators who changed the world.</p>

<p>The 1973 resume of Steve Jobs underlines his focus on electronics and technology. Mr Jobs, who would go on to revolutionise the tech industry with Apple, listed "electronics" and "tech" as his special abilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bill Gates' resume, dated 1971, lists his experience with various programming languages, including FORTRAN, COBOL and BASIC, and computers, including PDP-10, PDP-8, and CDC-6400.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Gates put down his salary at the time as $35,000, a substantial amount for a young student in the 1970s. He also mentioned his ongoing partnership with Paul G Allen, with whom he would later co-found Microsoft.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs co-founded Apple Inc and Pixar Animation Studios. He introduced the Apple II, one of the first successful personal computers. He was forced out of Apple in 1985 but returned in 1997 and led the company's resurgence with products like the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. Under Mr Jobs' leadership, Apple became one of the most valuable companies in the world. He died on October 5, 2011.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bill Gates co-founded Microsoft Corporation, the world's largest software company, with Paul Allen in 1975. He showed a keen interest in computer programming at a young age and began writing his code when he was just 13. Mr Gates and Mr Allen developed the operating system MS-DOS, which became a huge success. In 1985, Microsoft released Windows, a graphical user interface for MS-DOS, which revolutionised personal computing.</p>

<p>Mr Gates is also known for his philanthropic efforts. He established the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000, which focuses on global health, education and poverty alleviation. Today, Mr Gates is no longer actively involved in Microsoft's day-to-day operations, but he remains the company's technology advisor.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Insurers of the Bayesian superyacht that sank this month, killing tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and six others, could be on the hook for at least $150 million, according to the first estimates by industry experts.</p>

<p>The British-flagged 56-metre-long (184-foot-long) yacht, which the experts estimated cost around $40 million, capsized and went down on August 19 within minutes of being hit by a pre-dawn storm while anchored off northern Sicily.</p>

<p>The superyacht's hull was insured against physical damage by yacht insurance provider OMAC and a consortium of insurers including Travelers Companies Inc, Navium Marine and Convex, Reuters reported last week.</p>

<p>Its protection and indemnity (P&amp;I) insurance, which typically covers third-party liability claims including for environmental damage, injury and death, was provided by British Marine.</p>

<p>The hull was likely insured for around $40 million, while the P&amp;I cover would be larger, insurance sources said.</p>

<p>"Our understanding is that the cost of the boat was between $40 and $50 million, so the limit of the hull &amp; machinery policy was probably around those values," said Marcos Alvarez, managing director of global financial institution ratings at Morningstar DBRS.</p>

<p>The P&amp;I policy would likely be "several multiples" of the hull policy, or $200-300 million, Alvarez added, noting it would also likely cover liability payments even if the captain or crew are found to be negligent.</p>

<p>Prosecutors in the town of Termini Imerese, near Palermo, are investigating the captain and two other crew members. An investigation does not imply guilt or mean formal charges will follow. Prosecutors have said the probe would take time and require salvaging the wreck.</p>

<p>Oscar Seikaly, CEO of broker NSI Insurance Group, that provides yacht insurance, estimated the hull value at $40-70 million, but said P&amp;I cover might not total more than $100 million.</p>

<p>P&amp;I insurance would also cover recovery of the Bayesian, said Francesco Dubbioso, country manager for Italy for insurer Alta Signa Europe, who estimated the superyacht's value at $30 million to $40 million.</p>

<p>Reuters is the first to report the potential insurance costs. OMAC, Travelers and Navium Marine did not immediately respond to Reuters' for comment. Convex declined to comment.</p>

<p>The Bayesian disaster, which has puzzled experts who said the boat would have been built to withstand a severe storm, adds to recent woes&nbsp;for yacht insurers, who have faced a raft of hurricane losses in the past few years.</p>

<p>Premium rates have risen by four to five times in the past couple of years in parts of the US and the Caribbean, and yacht insurers have cut the amount of cover they provide because of the risks, Seikaly said.</p>

<p>As a result, insurers have increased rates and re-evaluated their guidelines and risk appetite, according to industry experts.</p>

<p>As well as hurricanes, insured losses have mostly stemmed from severe storms, floods, and other weather events in North America, the Caribbean, and Europe, according to a report by broker Marsh.</p>

<p>Seikaly said four clients had last week been ready to buy boats but changed their minds because of the high cost of insurance.</p>

<p>Climate change was also likely to add to yacht insurers' worries, Seikaly added, as it throws up more unexpected events.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Managing abortion at home using pills is safe and may ease hospital burden, claimed a study published in The Lancet journal on Friday.</p>

<p>The randomised controlled trial of 435 women by Swedish researchers analysed women who took the first dose of misoprostol (a pill given as part of the procedure for medical abortions) at home or in the hospital.</p>

<p>Those who took the pill at home had a 71 per cent chance of completing their care in hospital within 9 hours with no overnight stay, compared to 46 per cent of women who took the first dose of misoprostol at the hospital.</p>

<p>Women in hospital settings are more likely to find abortion "stressful and isolating", compared to those at home.</p>

<p>In a medical abortion (also known as abortion with pills) women are typically prescribed two types of pills.</p>

<p>Mifepristone, which blocks the hormone progesterone therefore causing the lining of the uterus to break down, is usually prescribed in a clinic.</p>

<p>Misoprostol, which makes the womb contract, can be taken two days later. The medicine has to be taken every few hours until the abortion is complete.</p>

<p>"Offering the choice to take the first dose of misoprostol at home provides a safe and effective alternative to taking all misoprostol doses at the hospital and enables women to self-manage some of the process," said Johanna Rydelius, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Sweden.</p>

<p>This can also help women with "feelings of autonomy during a time where they can feel extremely vulnerable", Rydelius said.</p>

<p>Previous studies indicate that most medical abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy are completed within eight to 12 hours after the first misoprostol dose and require an average of two to three misoprostol doses, with some patients needing to stay overnight in the hospital.</p>

<p>Rydelius said that in the study, "1 per cent of the women who took misoprostol at home completed the abortion before attending hospital for the next dose."</p>

<p>The study, however, found no difference in the average pain score, types and number of side effects, or rates of admittance to hospital earlier than planned between the two groups.</p>

<p>The patients in the home treatment group (1 per cent ) had the abortion on the way to the hospital, between one to two hours after taking the first dose of misoprostol.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chatbot startup Character.AI laid off at least 5% of its staff, The Information reported on Thursday, citing a person briefed by company leaders.</p>

<p>The employees who were laid off mostly worked on marketing and recruiting for the startup, the report said.</p>

<p>"We are refocusing the company to ensure all roles align with our new direction to build personalized AI (artificial intelligence) products," a Character.AI spokesperson told Reuters.</p>

<p>"As a result, we have made a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/ai-job-cuts-coming-survey-shows-companies-plan-to-shrink-workforce-5385210" target="_blank">small reduction</a> in our workforce," the spokesperson said, without giving the numbers of the laid off employees.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Character.AI signed an agreement with Alphabet's Google that grants the search engine giant a non-exclusive license to the chatbot maker's large language model technology.</p>

<p>Character.AI will get more funding as part of the deal with Google, the startup had said in a blog, without disclosing the amount.</p>

<p>Character.AI previously raised $193 million in venture capital from investors including Andreessen Horowitz.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The condition of a Missouri teen, who contracted the West Nile virus just over two weeks ago, has left many concerned in the United States. The 18-year-old has been left paralysed and on a ventilator in the ICU, <a href="https://fox2now.com/news/missouri/hazelwood-teen-fights-west-nile-virus-for-over-two-weeks/">Fox News</a> reported. John Procter VI's case has also led to many asking what the virus is and how it spreads.</p>

<p>West Nile virus is one of the primary causes of mosquito-borne disease in the US. The virus spreads in the human body when an infected mosquito bites a person. According to the <a href="http://https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/index.html">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, West Nile cases occur throughout the mosquito season, from summer to autumn. Since its first report in 1999, there have been over 51,000 cases of West Nile in the United States, reported <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10939-west-nile-virus">Cleveland Clinic</a>.</p>

<p><strong>How it spreads</strong></p>

<p>Humans contract the West Nile virus when mosquitoes first feed on infected birds and then bite people, according to the CDC. Unlike birds, humans do not produce sufficient quantities of the virus in their bloodstream, making them dead-end hosts.</p>

<p><b>How birds get infected</b></p>

<p>Birds get infected with the West Nile virus when an infected mosquito bites them. Mosquitoes become carriers after feeding or biting an infected bird, forming a chain of sorts. Predators such as hawks and owls or scavengers -- crows -- may also get infected after eating other dead birds that already had the West Nile virus.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b></p>

<p>As per the CDC, eight of the 10 people who get infected with the West Nile virus do not show any symptoms.</p>

<p>Approximately one in five infected individuals experience a fever and additional symptoms such as joint pain, body aches, headache, diarrhoea, vomiting, rash, swollen lymph nodes, and sore throat. After the person recovers, weakness and fatigue may persist for weeks or months.</p>

<p>One out of 150 people may develop serious illness after contracting the West Nile virus. In some cases, it can affect the central nervous system, causing inflammation of the brain aka encephalitis, and inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord aka meningitis.</p>

<p>Some symptoms of severe illness include neck stiffness, high fever, disorientation, tremors, convulsions, vision loss, muscle weakness, paralysis, and coma. It can affect people of any age but those above 60 are more prone to it. People already dealing with chronic ailments like diabetes, cancer, hypertension, and kidney diseases are at a greater risk too.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b></p>

<p>No particular medicines are available to treat West Nile, says the CDC. Antibiotics are also of no use.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over-the-counter medications, plenty of sleep, and drinking fluids can alleviate the symptoms.</p>

<p>In case of severe symptoms, the patient should be hospitalised for treatment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two women in China have been accused of child abuse after they separated a crying child from her grandmother and locked her in the toilet of a plane to "educate her". According to the <em>BBC</em>, the incident took place on August 24 onboard a Juneyao Airlines flight from the southwestern city of Guiyang to Shanghai. The little girl, who was travelling with her grandmother, started crying during the flight, following which the two women passengers locked the distressed child in the toilet, saying that they trying to help others.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The incident went viral on the Chinese internet after one of the two women, identified as Gou Tingting, posted a video of herself carrying the girl inside the toilet. The clip also showed the other woman telling the child that she could only leave the bathroom if she stopped crying. They presented themselves as trying to help others on board, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2nj5l0gego" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>BBC</em></a>. However, many people on the internet accused the two of "bullying" the child and lacking empathy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The airline, on the other hand, said that the girl's grandmother had agreed to let two women take the girl to the toilet. It also added that it had also spoken to the child's mother, who was not on the flight, and who "expressed her understanding" of the women's behaviour, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/29/chinese-women-spark-anger-after-locking-crying-toddler-in-plane-toilet#:~:text=Two%20women%20in%20China%20have,of%20the%20locked%20lavatory%20door." rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>The Guardian </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But shortly after the video was posted online, many criticised the women for lacking "empathy" and "bullying" the child. Responding to the criticism, Ms Gou said she "prefers to take action rather than be a bystander". "I just wanted to calm the child down and let everyone rest," she wrote on Chinese social media platform Douyin. The woman also explained that some passengers had "moved to the back of the plane to escape the noise" while others stuffed tissue papers into their ears.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Ms Gou's explanation did little to quell the backlash, and her social media account has since been set to private. "Children cannot control their emotions when they are one or two years old. What's wrong with crying? Didn't you cry when you were young too?" one user wrote, per the <em>BBC</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another user, concerned about the psychological impact on the girl, said, "We should be thinking about how public spaces can better accept and accommodate young children."</p>

<p>But there were some who also defended the women, saying that their actions were justified as the girl's grandmother had given her consent. "To be honest, some children cannot do without some education," one user wrote.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An 18-year-old Missouri teen has been fighting for his life in a hospital for two weeks after contracting the West Nile virus. John Procter VI's nightmare began when he experienced what seemed to be routine symptoms such as headache and dizziness on August 8, but rapidly worsened, leaving him paralysed and on a ventilator in the ICU, reported <a href="https://fox2now.com/news/missouri/hazelwood-teen-fights-west-nile-virus-for-over-two-weeks/ ">Fox News</a>.</p>

<p>Initially, when he visited urgent care, he was diagnosed with a tension headache and sent home with over-the-counter medication. Soon, his condition worsened, leading to violent vomiting and a high fever that had him in and out of the hospital.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"They thought he had meningitis, so they did some tests for that," his father, John Procter V, shared with a local news station. "It came back negative."</p>

<p>The following day, he had stroke-like symptoms and pneumonia, his father recalled. "Unable to move, and his speech was real slurred," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rushed back to the hospital, the 18-year-old was admitted to the ICU and placed on a ventilator. Despite being treated at four different hospitals, it took over 20 doctors more than two weeks to identify the cause of his rapid decline - West Nile virus, a mosquito-borne illness.</p>

<p>The virus has taken a devastating toll on Mr Procter's body. According to his father, the teenager has restricted mobility, particularly on his left side. He requires assistance to support his weight and head.</p>

<p>Despite the grim situation, there have been some "small but vast" improvements, his father said. Mr Procter has undergone a tracheostomy to help with breathing and has begun physical therapy.</p>

<p>John Procter VI, who dreamt of becoming a diesel mechanic, now faces a long and challenging recovery. "Doctors say this will be a marathon to try and get him back to what he was before this virus almost killed him," his father wrote on a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-john-procter-vis-bbs-road-to-recovery?qid=2daa0f5bf32db46e90cbb4a958d1d683 ">GoFundMe</a> page set up to help cover the mounting medical expenses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most people infected with West Nile virus don't show symptoms, but rare cases can be severe, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/index.html">CDC</a>). About 1 in 150 people will develop serious illnesses like meningitis or encephalitis, which can cause fever, headache, paralysis and even coma. Recovery from a severe case can take weeks or months.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris vowed a tougher approach to migration along the U.S. southern border and said she would not withhold weapons to Israel, in her first interview with a major news organization since becoming the Democratic nominee for president.</p>

<p>In the interview with CNN anchor Dana Bash, Harris sought to show she is in command of the issues and give Americans a sense of her policy positions with little more than two months until Election Day on Nov. 5.</p>

<p>Harris said she would renew a push for comprehensive border legislation that would tighten migration into the United States, and vowed to "enforce our laws" against border crossings.</p>

<p>"We have laws that have to be followed and enforced, that address and deal with people who cross our border illegally, and there should be consequence," Harris said.</p>

<p>She also hewed closely to President Joe Biden's strong support of Israel and rejected calls from some in the Democratic Party that Washington should rethink sending weapons to Israel because of the heavy Palestinian death toll in Gaza.</p>

<p>She said she supports a strong Israel but "we must get a deal done" to get a ceasefire in the Gaza conflict.</p>

<p>"No, we have to get a (ceasefire and hostage) deal done," Harris said when asked if she would withhold weapons to Israel. She has been Biden's vice president since the start of his administration.</p>

<p>Abbas Alawieh, a co-founder of the Uncommitted National Movement that has protested against Biden's policy, expressed frustration over Harris' response on Gaza.</p>

<p>"If the vice president is interested in a ceasefire, she must support an immediate stop to sending the fire," Alawieh said.</p>

<p>Harris, joined by her vice presidential running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, also said she would like to add a Republican to her cabinet if she wins the election.</p>

<p>"I think it's important to have people at the table when some of the most important decisions are being made that have different views, different experiences. And I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my cabinet who was a Republican," she said.</p>

<h2><strong>SURGING IN POLLS</strong></h2>

<p>Since becoming the Democratic candidate for president last month, Harris has surged in the polls, brought in hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign donations, and had a series of forceful campaign speeches.</p>

<p>She leads Trump 45% to 41% in a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Thursday that showed the vice president sparking new enthusiasm among voters.</p>

<p>Some critics suggested she might be less polished in unscripted settings like a TV interview, but she appeared to make no major mistakes on Thursday.</p>

<p>Harris defended her and Biden's handling of inflation, saying they inherited a pandemic-ravaged economy that she said Trump had mismanaged. She said much work had been done to lower prices but that "prices are still too high."</p>

<p>Jeremi Suri, history and public affairs professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said Harris came across as knowledgeable and a "consensus builder" in the interview but she could have had "more concrete and specific answers" on what she would do on her first day as president.</p>

<p>Harris has moved more toward the center on some issues from the time she ran for president in 2020 until she took over from Biden last month as the Democrats' choice to face Republican former President Donald Trump in the election.</p>

<p>She has toughened her position on migration along the southern U.S. border with Mexico. She also no longer wants a ban on fracking, an energy production method that employs many people in Pennsylvania, one of a handful of swing states that could decide the election.</p>

<p>When asked about her policy shifts, Harris said: "My values have not changed."</p>

<p>Harris dismissed a comment from Trump in which he questioned whether she was a Black American. "Same old tired playbook," she said. "Next question, please."</p>

<p>Trump, in a post on Truth Social, responded to the interview by saying: "I look so forward to Debating Comrade Kamala Harris and exposing her for the fraud she is." Trump often falsely refers to Harris as a Marxist.</p>

<p>Though she has taken questions from journalists on the campaign trail and been interviewed on TikTok in recent days, she had, until Thursday, not done a one-on-one interview with a major network or print journalist since Biden ended his reelection campaign on July 21 and endorsed her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bash, who co-moderated the June 27 debate between Trump and Biden that ultimately led to the president's departure from the race, conducted the interview in Savannah, Georgia, as Harris and Walz were on a campaign bus tour.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Army on Thursday took aim at Donald Trump's staff over a visit by the Republican presidential candidate to the country's most hallowed resting place for its war dead.</p>

<p>The incident has mushroomed into an uncharacteristically public dispute between the military and a former US commander in chief, with Trump lashing out and accusing President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris of having "killed" American soldiers through "gross incompetence" in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Trump went to Arlington National Cemetery just outside Washington with family members of some of the 13 service members killed in a 2021 bombing during the last hours of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p>

<p>His campaign posted photos from the visit, including one showing him giving a thumbs-up gesture while standing with relatives at the grave of one of the US Marines killed.</p>

<p>The Army said an Arlington employee was "abruptly pushed aside" when she sought to ensure a law prohibiting political activity on cemetery grounds was followed.</p>

<p>"This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the (Arlington National Cemetery) employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked," an Army spokesperson said in a statement.</p>

<p>Going on the offensive, Trump's campaign co-manager Chris LaCivita has described the employee as a "despicable individual," while campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said she was "clearly suffering from a mental health episode."</p>

<p>Doubling down, LaCivita later reposted video of Trump's presence at Arlington and said he hoped it would "trigger the hacks" at the US Army secretary's office.</p>

<p>Trump has made criticism of Biden's handling of the retreat from Afghanistan a key note of his campaign ahead of November's election.</p>

<p>The US withdrawal was made as part of a peace deal signed by the Trump administration with the Taliban.</p>

<p>At a Thursday rally in Michigan, Trump defended his gravesite visit and savaged Biden and Harris, his 2024 White House rival, over Afghanistan.</p>

<p>"They asked me to go yesterday to Arlington and I did," Trump said of the families, adding that "bad people" accused him of inappropriate political activity.</p>

<p>"Joe Biden killed their children, by incompetence... Kamala killed their children -- just as though they had a gun in their hand -- by gross incompetence," Trump told supporters.</p>

<p>"Not one general or incompetent bureaucrat was fired," over the deadly pullout, he added. "And then they accuse me of having a picture taken at the tombstone with the family." &nbsp;</p>

<p>Uproar over the incident at Arlington on Monday is the latest controversy in Trump's troubled relationship with the military.</p>

<p>While often touting his support for the armed forces, he privately mocked the war dead while he was president and did not want to be seen near military amputees, according to his former chief of staff.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man convicted of murdering a college student and raping his sister while the siblings were on a camping trip was executed in the southern US state of Florida on Thursday, prison officials said.</p>

<p>Loran Cole, 57, was put to death by lethal injection at 6:15 pm (2215 GMT) at the Florida State Prison in Raiford, the Florida Department of Corrections said in a statement.</p>

<p>Cole was sentenced to death in December 1995 for the February 1994 murder of an 18-year-old Florida State University student, who was on a camping trip with his sister in the Ocala National Forest.</p>

<p>Cole was also convicted of sexually assaulting the murder victim's elder sister, who was tied to a tree but managed to escape the next day.</p>

<p>An accomplice, William Paul, was sentenced to life in prison.</p>

<p>The US Supreme Court denied Thursday afternoon -- without comment -- Cole's appeal to stay his execution on the grounds he had Parkinson's disease and the lethal injection would "very likely cause him needless pain and suffering."</p>

<p>There have been 13 executions in the United States this year.</p>

<p>The death penalty has been abolished in 23 US states, while six others -- Arizona, California, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Tennessee -- have moratoriums in place.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris defended her policy shifts on key issues Thursday, insisting in the first interview of her US presidential campaign that her "values have not changed."</p>

<p>The 59-year-old Democrat also said that she would name a Republican to her cabinet if she wins November's election, in her joint CNN sit-down with her running mate Tim Walz.</p>

<p>Rival Donald Trump branded the US vice president the "greatest flip-flopper" as he addressed a rally in the swing state of Michigan.</p>

<p>Harris said her positions had evolved on the issues of fracking, which she previously opposed, and illegal migration over the Mexican border, on which she has taken an increasingly tough stance.</p>

<p>"I think the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed," Harris said in an excerpt of the CNN interview. The full version is being screened at 9pm (0100 GMT Friday).</p>

<p>Republicans had criticized Harris for not giving any interviews since President Joe Biden dropped out of the White House race nearly six weeks ago.</p>

<p>Harris has enjoyed a honeymoon period with surging polls and record fundraising, but has also faced scrutiny for keeping many of her policies vague.</p>

<p>But in a gesture of unity she said it would be to the "benefit of the American public" to have a Republican in her cabinet if elected.</p>

<p>The first female, Black and South Asian vice president in US history meanwhile brushed aside Trump's recent comments questioning her racial identity. "Same old, tired playbook," she said.</p>

<p>Harris gave the interview while on a campaign bus tour of Georgia, one of the seven battleground states that are expected to decide the November 5 election.</p>

<h2>'Tight race'</h2>

<p>A number of polls out Thursday showed Harris ahead of Trump, if only marginally, with several of them finding increased support for Harris in battleground states.</p>

<p>A Bloomberg/Morning Consult poll found Harris leading in six out of the seven swing states while a Fox poll also showed increasing support in the battlegrounds.</p>

<p>At a rally in Savannah at the end of the two-day swing in Georgia, which Democrats flipped from Trump in 2020, she admitted it was "going to be a tight race until the very end."</p>

<p>Trump has himself been hitting the campaign trail hard in recent days, after a period where the 78-year-old former president appeared to struggle to find his footing against a new, younger, female candidate.</p>

<p>Speaking at an event in Potterville, Michigan on Thursday, Trump targeted Harris on her immigration policy shifts: "Now she's saying, 'Oh we want to build a strong border."</p>

<p>"Where has she been for three and a half years?"</p>

<p>Yet both Trump and Harris appear to be making gestures towards the center ground.</p>

<p>Trump said in an interview with NBC News Thursday that if elected, either the government or insurance companies would cover the cost of in vitro fertilization (IVF) for Americans.</p>

<p>Reproductive rights have been a major vulnerability for Trump since the Supreme Court gutted federal protections for abortion access in 2022, and an Alabama court ruled in February that frozen embryos created via IVF should be considered children.</p>

<p>Harris's speech meanwhile focused on the cost of living. She repeated her pledge to give tax cuts to families in the first year of a child's life "to help pay for that car seat, or the crib, or the baby clothes."</p>

<p>Her CNN interview is being closely watched in a year where big set-piece political events have shown their ability to produce surprises, like Biden's debate disaster on June 27 that led to him quitting the race.</p>

<p>Harris and Trump are set to face off in their pivotal first debate on September 10 in Philadelphia.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican Donald Trump on Friday slammed his rival Kamala Harris after the Democrat gave her first major interview since her dramatic entry into the US presidential election after Joe Biden's exit. Ms Harris, 59, spoke to CNN and described Mr Trump as "pushing an agenda and an environment that is about diminishing the character and the strength of who we are as Americans, really dividing our nation."</p>

<p>"I think people are ready to turn the page on that," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/americans-ready-to-turn-the-page-on-donald-trump-says-kamala-harris-6449417#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a> said. "People are ready for a new way forward."</p>

<p>Attacking Ms Harris, Mr Trump said she "rambled incoherently" in the interview, which came ahead of the US Election Day on November 5.</p>

<p>"I just saw Comrade Kamala Harris' answer to a very weakly-phrased question, a question that was put in more as a matter of defense than curiosity, but her answer rambled incoherently, and declared her "values haven't changed." On that I agree, her values haven't changed - The Border is going to remain open, not closed, there will be Free Healthcare for Illegal Aliens, Sanctuary Cities, No Cash Bail, Gun Confiscation, Zero Fracking, a Ban on Gasoline-Powered Cars, Private Healthcare will be abolished, a 70-80% tax rate will be put in place, and she will Defund the Police. America will become a WASTELAND," he said in a post on his Truth Social media platform.</p>

<p>He also branded the interview "BORING!!!".</p>

<p>In another post, he also said he "looks so forward" to debating <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/what-kamala-harris-was-doing-when-joe-biden-quit-us-presidential-race-6449446#pfrom=home-ndtv_topstories" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a> and "exposing her for the fraud she is".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Harris has changed every one of her long held positions, on everything. America will never allow an election WEAPONIZING MARXIST TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE US," he wrote.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By embarking aged 87 on the farthest journey of his papacy, Pope Francis is doing something some believed impossible -- and seeking to silence those who doubt his ability to fulfil his role.</p>

<p>The pontiff's 12-day trip to Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Singapore starting next week involves 43 hours of flight time and a distance of 32,000 kilometres (almost 20,000 miles).</p>

<p>It would be something of an odyssey for anyone, but particularly for someone who has been plagued in recent years by health issues, sparking speculation he might step down as head of the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>The trip was originally planned for 2020 but postponed due to the Covid pandemic, and now takes place just three months before his 88th birthday.</p>

<p>Weeks ago few observers thought Francis was capable of such a gruelling voyage, with the corridors of the Vatican buzzing with concerns over his health.</p>

<p>At Easter, the holiest week in the Christian calendar, Francis withdrew from several events, weakened by a lingering flu.</p>

<p>Months earlier, bronchitis caused him to cancel a trip to United Nations climate talks in Dubai in December.</p>

<p>In June 2023, he also underwent hernia surgery that left him hospitalised for 10 days.</p>

<p>Now some are wondering: is it reasonable for the octogenarian to keep up the frantic pace, with 16 speeches and countless meetings and ceremonies scheduled across four countries?</p>

<p>"The pope still believes that we need to push a little further," a senior Vatican diplomat told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"He feels capable of making this trip this year. Next year, it will be less certain."&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Thrives on contact</h2>

<p>Former pope Benedict XVI in 2013 became the first since the Middle Ages to step down, citing his declining physical and mental health -- and Francis has left the door open to following suit.</p>

<p>But the Argentine Jesuit has repeatedly stressed that he is not there yet and views travelling as particularly important, a cornerstone of his ministry that prioritises spreading the faith.</p>

<p>With this 45th trip abroad, Francis returns to his love as a pastor among his flock, far from the bureaucracy of the Vatican and close to ordinary people, who seem to give him energy and momentum.</p>

<p>The constraints linked to his health are nevertheless real.</p>

<p>The pope's mobility has visibly declined in recent years. Since 2022, he has relied on a wheelchair for knee pain and recurring sciatica, or nerve pain.</p>

<p>Now unable to climb a flight of stairs, Francis has to use an elevator to board his plane. He also now sits, rather than stands, during the press conferences he holds on the return flight of each voyage.</p>

<p>Although the pope always travels with his personal doctor and a nurse, no "new features" have been ordered for this particular trip, according to a Vatican source.</p>

<p>"His general condition is good, there were no concerns this summer," said the source.</p>

<p>The Vatican has provided no details on any precautions taken for the pope's health, such as possible arrangements made with local hospitals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During Francis' trip to Africa early in 2023, a fully equipped ambulance followed the pope everywhere, ready to intervene if necessary.</p>

<h2>'Strength of spirit'</h2>

<p>Within the Vatican, the pope's willingness to make the trip has aroused "admiration", a Vatican source told AFP.</p>

<p>At the same time, the source said, it has stirred "concern, and even a certain annoyance at the pope's relentlessness, which puts his health and security services on edge".</p>

<p>For Andrea Ungar, president of the Italian Society of Gerontology and Geriatrics, "this trip demonstrates once again the pope's strength of spirit and shows how, despite age, things can still be done."</p>

<p>"Strong motivation gives incredible energy," Ungar said, adding that the pope was a "great example" for older people to remain active.</p>

<p>"The more you stand still, the more you stay still," he said.</p>

<p>Little chance of standing still for Francis, who will have less than two weeks at home after his long journey before setting off again, this time for a four-day trip to Luxembourg and Belgium starting on September 26.</p>

<p>October will be devoted to the General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, to determine the future path and priorities of the global Catholic Church.</p>

<p>In December, Francis will kick off the 2025 Jubilee, a year-long pilgrimage event in which some 32 million faithful are expected in Rome.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump has been accused of deserting the anti-abortion movement as he seeks to negate attacks by Kamala Harris over one of the most polarizing issues of the US election.</p>

<p>The Republican nominee brags often about his role in overturning the constitutional right to abortion in the United States.</p>

<p>But -- under relentless fire from Harris and the Democratic Party, and with a majority of Americans supporting access to the procedure -- the former president is now risking the ire of his right-wing base by claiming to promote "reproductive rights."</p>

<p>"Trump's abandonment of Pro-Lifers is complete," said a headline in the conservative National Review last week.</p>

<p>Jeremy Boreing, the co-founder of right-wing website The Daily Wire, attacked the former president as "philosophically malleable."</p>

<p>"His first term was perhaps the most pro-life in actual effect of any administration in our history. That is his legacy -- if he will keep it," Boreing said on X.</p>

<p>The backlash came after Trump took to his Truth Social platform last week to target Democrats, who had for days been attacking him over abortion at their national convention in Chicago.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"My Administration will be great for women and their reproductive rights," he wrote, hours after Harris accused him and the Republican Party of being "out of their minds" as she used her convention speech to criticize their abortion stance.</p>

<p>Trump's post was "the worst statement Donald Trump has made" since he launched his campaign for president in 2015, Boreing said.</p>

<p>It was "hard to interpret in any other way than as an affirmatively pro-choice statement," wrote Philip Klein, editor of the National Review Online, referring to abortion rights.</p>

<p>"By the common usage of the term, if you support reproductive rights it means you want broader access to abortion."</p>

<h3><strong>'Beyond this Trump moment'</strong></h3>

<p>Conservatives -- along with everyone else -- have long grappled with how to understand Trump's stance on abortion, which has shifted often over the years.</p>

<p>His stacking of the Supreme Court with justices handpicked for their abortion views allowed it to overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling that had enshrined the procedure as a right.</p>

<p>That seismic move in 2022 made him a hero to many in the anti-abortion movement, which had driven conservative voters to the polls for decades.</p>

<p>"I was able to kill Roe v. Wade," he wrote in a Truth Social post last year. "Without me, the pro Life movement would have just kept losing."</p>

<p>But since then the issue has become an electoral problem for the Republican Party, firing up voters in many local, state and national elections to back Democrats, who have vowed to restore Roe.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the anti-abortion movement is pushing Trump to go further, with some decrying fertility treatments such as in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and others focused on demanding an unpopular national abortion ban.</p>

<p>Trump has appeared to want it both ways, dodging the question of a ban by insisting repeatedly that "everyone" wanted individual states to make their own decisions on abortion, even as he accuses Harris and the Democrats of "executing" babies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In another Truth Social post last week he also called the Republican Party a "leader" on IVF.</p>

<p>He announced Thursday -- without any details on funding -- that as president he would mandate free IVF treatments for any Americans who wanted it.</p>

<p>He also suggested in an interview with NBC that he would vote to overturn Florida's ban on abortions after six weeks' pregnancy, which was "too short." His campaign then quickly walked this back, saying Trump did not actually specify how he'd vote when the referendum takes place in his home state in November.</p>

<p>Trump will "further alienate pro-lifers and divide his own party while doing absolutely zero to win over anybody pro-choice," Klein wrote in the National Review.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That doesn't mean that conservatives will suddenly start voting for Harris, but for many on the right it appears to be time to move on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The cause is way bigger and younger than Donald Trump," Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, an anti-abortion non-profit, told AFP.</p>

<p>"It will shape the (Republican Party) beyond this Trump moment."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is offering a reward of up to USD 25,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Cindy Rodriguez Singh, wanted for allegedly killing her young son.</p>

<p>Notably, Rodriguez Singh has ties to India and Mexico. She is wanted for allegedly killing her 6-year-old son, who hasn't been seen alive since October 2022.</p>

<p>At the request of the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, Everman Police Department officers conducted a welfare check on behalf of the boy on March 20, 2023.</p>

<p>During the welfare check interview, Rodriguez Singh lied to officers when she explained that the boy was living with his biological father in Mexico, and had been there since November 2022, according to the official website of the FBI.</p>

<p>On March 22, 2023, Rodriguez Singh, her husband, and six other juvenile children boarded an international flight bound for India. It was determined that the missing child was not present, and did not board the flight.</p>

<p>On October 31, 2023, Cindy Rodriguez Singh was charged with capital murder in District Court of Tarrant County, Fort Worth, Texas. On November 2, 2023, a federal arrest warrant was issued for Rodriguez Singh in the United States District Court, Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth, Texas, after she was charged with Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution.</p>

<p>In making the announcement, Dallas FBI Special Agent in Charge Chad Yarbrough asked the media and public to help locate Rodriguez Singh.</p>

<p>"Cindy Rodriguez Singh is wanted for allegedly murdering her own young son," Yarbrough said. "I am confident that the combination of publicity, significant reward offering, and the team of experienced investigators assembled by the FBI Fort Worth Resident Agency violent crime squad, Everman Police Department, Tarrant County District Attorney's Office and Texas DPS-Texas Rangers will lead to her arrest."</p>

<p>The FBI on its official website further said that Rodriguez Singh's last confirmed sighting was on March 22, 2023, as she, her husband, and six juvenile children, boarded an international flight to India. She was born in Dallas, Texas, in 1985 and is 39 years old.</p>

<p>The fugitive is between 5 feet, 1 inch and 5 feet, 3 inches tall; 120- 140 pounds; has a medium complexion and tattoos on her back, both legs, right arm, right hand, and right calf. She has brown eyes and brown hair.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris on Friday described for the first time US President Joe Biden's phone call informing her he was planning to quit the race to the White House. Speaking to CNN, Ms Harris, who has replaced Mr Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate, said she was at home making pancakes and bacon for her nieces when her phone rang.</p>

<p>"My family was staying with us, and including my baby nieces, and we had just had pancakes," she recalled in an interview with CNN about the Sunday afternoon call in July.</p>

<p>Ms Harris and the children were chatting -- "Auntie, can I have more bacon?' 'Yes, I'll make you more bacon'" -- she said.</p>

<p>"And the phone rang, and it was Joe Biden," she added.</p>

<p>"It was Joe Biden, and he told me what he had decided to do. And I asked him, 'Are you sure?' And he said, 'Yes'."</p>

<p>"My first thought was not about me, to be honest with you. My first thought was about him," Ms Harris said in her first one-on-one interview with a major news network since Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign last month and endorsed her.</p>

<p>Mr Biden, 81, ended his second-term bid on July 21 after his disastrous June 27 debate performance against his Republican rival <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/americans-ready-to-turn-the-page-on-donald-trump-says-kamala-harris-6449417" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a> triggered a slow-burning Democrat revolt against him.</p>

<p>"He (Biden) has the intelligence, the commitment, and the judgment and disposition that I think the American people rightly deserve in their president," Ms Harris said in her joint CNN sit-down with her running mate Tim Walz.</p>

<p>She also said she is running for president because she believes that she is the "best person to do this job at this moment for all Americans, regardless of race and gender."</p>

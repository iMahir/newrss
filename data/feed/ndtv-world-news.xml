       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The award this week of Nobel prizes in chemistry and physics to a small number of artificial intelligence pioneers affiliated with Google has stirred debate over the company's research dominance and how breakthroughs in computer science ought to be recognised.</p>

<p>Google has been at the forefront of AI research, but has been forced on the defensive as it tackles competitive pressure from Microsoft-backed OpenAI and mounting regulatory scrutiny from the US Department of Justice.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Demis Hassabis - co-founder of Google's AI unit DeepMind - and colleague John Jumper were awarded the Nobel prize in chemistry, alongside US biochemist David Baker, for their work decoding the structures of microscopic proteins.</p>

<p>Former Google researcher Geoffrey Hinton, meanwhile, won the Nobel prize for physics on Tuesday, alongside US scientist John Hopfield, for earlier discoveries in machine learning that paved the way for the AI boom.</p>

<p>Professor Dame Wendy Hall, a computer scientist and advisor on AI to the United Nations, told Reuters that, while the recipients' work deserved recognition, the lack of a Nobel prize for mathematics or computer science had distorted the outcome.</p>

<p>"The Nobel prize committee doesn't want to miss out on this AI stuff, so it's very creative of them to push Geoffrey through the physics route," she said. "I would argue both are dubious, but nonetheless worthy of a Nobel prize in terms of the science they've done. So how else are you going to reward them?"</p>

<p>Noah Giansiracusa, an associate maths professor at Bentley University and author of "How Algorithms Create and Prevent Fake News", also argued that Hinton's win was questionable.</p>

<p>"What he did was phenomenal, but was it physics? I don't think so. Even if there's inspiration from physics, they're not developing a new theory in physics or solving a longstanding problem in physics."</p>

<p>The Nobel prize categories for achievements in medicine or physiology, physics, chemistry, literature and peace were laid down in the will of Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel, who died in 1895. The prize for economics is a later addition established with an endowment from the Swedish central bank in 1968.</p>

<h2><strong>Dominance</strong></h2>

<p>Regulators in the US are currently circling Google for a potential break-up, which could force it to divest parts of its business, such as its Chrome browser and Android operating system, which some argue allow it to maintain an illegal monopoly in online search.</p>

<p>The profits derived from its leading position have allowed Google and other Big Tech companies to outpace traditional academia in publishing groundbreaking AI research.</p>

<p>Hinton himself has expressed some regrets about his life's work, quitting Google last year so that he could speak freely about the dangers of AI, and warning that computers could become smarter than people far sooner than previously expected.</p>

<p>Speaking at a press conference Tuesday, he said: "I wish I had a sort of simple recipe that if you do this, everything's going to be okay, but I don't, in particular with respect to the existential threat of these things getting out of control and taking over."</p>

<p>When he quit Google in 2023 over his AI concerns, Hinton said the company itself acted very responsibly.</p>

<p>For some, this week's Nobel prize wins underscore how hard it is becoming for traditional academia to compete. Giansiracusa told Reuters there was a need for greater public investment in research.</p>

<p>"So much of Big Tech is not oriented towards the next deep-learning breakthrough, but making money by pushing chatbots or putting ads all over the internet," he said. "There are pockets of innovation, but much of it is very unscientific."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hurricane Milton marched across central Florida on Thursday after making landfall on the state's west coast hours earlier, whipping up deadly tornadoes, destroying homes and knocking out power to nearly 2 million customers.</p>

<p>The storm made landfall around 8:30 p.m. EDT (0030 GMT) on Wednesday as a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 120 miles per hour (195 kph) near Siesta Key, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.</p>

<p>By early Thursday, wind speeds reduced to a still dangerous 90 mph (150 kph), dropping Milton to a Category 1 hurricane, with heavy rains and damaging storm surges. The hurricane was located about 45 miles (75 km) west-southwest of Cape Canaveral, home to NASA's Space Force Station.</p>

<p>A flash flood emergency was in effect for the Tampa Bay area including the cities of Tampa, St. Petersburg and Clearwater, the hurricane center said, with St. Petersburg already receiving 16.6 inches (422 mm) of rain on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The eye of the storm made landfall in Siesta Key, a barrier island town of some 5,400 off Sarasota about 60 miles (100 km) south of the Tampa Bay metropolitan area, which is home to more than 3 million people.</p>

</div>

<p>Governor Ron DeSantis said he hoped Tampa Bay, once seen as the potential bull's eye, could dodge major damage and that the worst of the predicted storm surge could be avoided thanks to the landfall coming before the high tide. Forecasters said seawater could still rise as high as 13 feet (4 meters).</p>

<p>DeSantis reported Milton had also spawned at least 19 tornadoes caused damage in numerous counties, destroying around 125 homes, most of them mobile homes.</p>

<p>"At this point, it's too dangerous to evacuate safely, so you have to shelter in place and just hunker down," DeSantis said upon announcing the landfall.</p>

<p>At least two deaths were reported at a retirement community following a suspected tornado in Fort Pierce on the eastern coast of Florida, NBC News reported, citing St. Lucie County Sheriff Keith Pearson. His department did not immediately respond to a request for details.</p>

<p>Pearson estimated 100 homes were destroyed in the county where some 17 tornadoes touched down, NBC said.</p>

<p>More than 2 million homes and businesses in Florida were without power, according to PowerOutage.us.</p>

<p>The storm was expected to cross the Florida peninsula overnight and emerge into the Atlantic, still with hurricane force, on Thursday.</p>

<p>Milton is forecast to maintain hurricane intensity while crossing Florida later on Thursday morning but after moving into the Atlantic it is likely to gradually lose tropical characteristics and slowly weaken, the Hurricane Center added.</p>

</div>

<p>In a state already battered by Hurricane Helene two weeks ago, as many as two million people were ordered to evacuate, and millions more live in the projected path of the storm.</p>

<p>Much of the southern U.S. experienced the deadly force of Hurricane Helene as it cut a swath of devastation through Florida and several other states. Both storms are expected to cause billions of dollars in damage.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden was briefed by emergency authorities on the initial impacts of the hurricane, according to a White House statement.</p>

<p><strong>Zoo Animals Protected</strong></p>

<p>While human evacuees jammed the highways and created gasoline shortages, animals including African elephants, Caribbean flamingos and pygmy hippos were riding out the storm at Tampa's zoo.</p>

<p>Nearly a quarter of Florida's gasoline stations were out of fuel on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency had moved millions of liters (gallons) of water, millions of meals and other supplies and personnel into the area. None of the additional aid will detract from recovery efforts for Hurricane Helene, the agency's administrator, Deanne Criswell, said earlier on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Trucks have been running 24 hours a day to clear mounds of debris left behind by Helene before Milton potentially turned them into dangerous projectiles, DeSantis said.</p>

<p>About 9,000 National Guard personnel were deployed in Florida, ready to assist recovery efforts, as were 50,000 electricity grid workers in anticipating of widespread power outages, DeSantis said.</p>

<p>Search-and-rescue teams were prepared to head out as soon as the storm passes, working through the night if needed, DeSantis said.</p>

<p>"It's going to mean pretty much all the rescues are going to be done in the dark, in the middle of the night, but that's fine. They're going to do that," DeSantis said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[None of the activities that attempted to influence global elections drew viral engagement or sustainable audiences, OpenAI said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI has seen a number of attempts where its AI models have been used to generate fake content, including long-form articles and social media comments, aimed at influencing elections, the ChatGPT maker said in a report on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Cybercriminals are increasingly using AI tools, including ChatGPT, to aid in their malicious activities such as creating and debugging malware, and generating fake content for websites and social media platforms, the startup said.</p>

<p>So far this year it neutralized more than 20 such attempts, including a set of ChatGPT accounts in August that were used to produce articles on topics that included the U.S. elections, the company said.</p>

<p>It also banned a number of accounts from Rwanda in July that were used to generate comments about the elections in that country for posting on social media site X.</p>

<p>None of the activities that attempted to influence global elections drew viral engagement or sustainable audiences, OpenAI added.</p>

<p>There is increasing worry about the use of AI tools and social media sites to generate and propagate fake content related to elections, especially as the U.S. gears for presidential polls.</p>

<p>According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. sees a growing threat of Russia, Iran and China attempting to influence the Nov. 5 elections, including by using AI to disseminate fake or divisive information.</p>

<p>OpenAI cemented its position as one of the world's most valuable private companies last week after a $6.6 billion funding round.</p>

<p>ChatGPT has 250 million weekly active users since its launch in November 2022.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The tool uses computer-vision technology initially developed in Amazon warehouses to identify products without using barcode scanners]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon.com Inc. unveiled a new artificial intelligence tool designed to solve a major pain point in its quick delivery apparatus: drivers rummaging through cluttered vans at each stop searching for packages.</p>

<p>The technology projects a green circle on packages to be delivered at each stop and red Xs on those to be delivered later, Amazon said Wednesday at a Nashville media event focused on its logistics and online shopping initiatives.</p>

<p>Called Vision Assisted Package Retrieval and in development since 2020, the tool will be deployed in 1,000 Amazon vans next year and will shorten the typical delivery route by about 30 minutes, the company said.</p>

<p>The tool uses computer-vision technology initially developed in Amazon warehouses to identify products without using barcode scanners. The technology was adapted for vans' cramped cargo areas and integrated with delivery-route navigation software.</p>

<p>"Delivery drivers will no longer have to spend time organizing packages by stops, reading labels or manually checking key identifiers like a customer's name or address to ensure they have the right packages," Amazon said in a release. "They simply have to look for VAPR's green light, grab and go."</p>

<p>The announcement underscores Amazon's shifting priorities under Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy, who assumed the role from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021. Bezos wowed the media with grandiose announcements that looked far into the future, such as fleets of autonomous delivery drones - a project still in the testing phase more than a decade after he announced it.</p>

<p>Under Jassy, who steered the company through layoffs and shuttered dozens of moonshot projects, the focus is on near-term efforts to shave costs and make Amazon's low-margin e-commerce business more appealing to Wall Street investors prone to fret about slim profits.</p>

<p>The Seattle-based company relies on a network of small businesses that use 100,000 vans and employ 390,000 drivers to deliver packages. By reducing delivery times, Amazon can limit what it has to pay these delivery service partners, which typically hire drivers paid by the hour.</p>

<p>Amazon announced several other initiatives:</p>

<ul>
	<li>AI Shopping Guides designed to help customers research more than 100 product types, ranging from televisions and dog food to headphones and face moisturizers.</li>
	<li>A next-generation fulfilment center in Shreveport, Louisiana, that uses artificial intelligence and robotics to help workers pick and pack orders.</li>
	<li>An expansion of same-day prescription drug delivery that next year will bring the offering to almost half of the US</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hurricane Milton blasted ashore in Florida Wednesday night with furious winds, life-threatening rain and storm surge, as people who endured another hurricane just two weeks ago braced for a long, violent night.</p>

<p>The "extremely dangerous" Category 3 storm made landfall near Siesta Key, in a densely populated area on the state's western coast, the National Hurricane Center said in an 8:30 pm (0030 GMT Thursday) bulletin.</p>

<p>"So the storm is here. It's time for every one to hunker down," Governor Ron DeSantis told a press conference just before Milton's arrival.</p>

<p>Life-threatening storm surge, extreme winds and flash flooding were happening across the central Florida peninsula, the NHC said.</p>

<p>Tidal surges are expected to inundate western Florida's heavily populated and low-lying Gulf Coast amid fears of widespread chaos and possible fatalities.</p>

<p>Milton is later expected to rip through inland areas to the Atlantic Ocean, with tourist hub Orlando -- home to Walt Disney World -- in its path.</p>

<p>As it hit land Milton was packing sustained winds moving at 120 miles (205 kilometers) per hour, with potential for as much as 13 feet (four meters) of storm surge, the NHC said.</p>

<p>In cities up and down Florida's western coast, the wind howled furiously and torrential rain fell as frightened people took shelter wherever they could.</p>

<p>In the city of Sarasota, near Siesta Key, gusts of wind blew panes of glass from buildings on the waterfront. The streets were deserted. Trees swayed almost horizontal, barely able to withstand the wind. Businesses were shuttered and sandbagged.</p>

<p>On a wooden board fixed against a window of an old red brick building, someone wrote: "Be kind Milton."</p>

<p>Just before landfall DeSantis said it was too late and too dangerous to evacuate anyone so people had to stay put and weather the storm wherever they were.</p>

<p>"Stay inside and stay off the roads. Flood waters and rushing storm surge are very dangerous," the governor said.</p>

<p>The airports in Tampa and Sarasota were closed until further notice.</p>

<p><strong>'The other storm'</strong></p>

<p>Milton hit just two weeks after another major hurricane, Helene, hit Florida and other southeastern states with devastating and deadly effect.</p>

<p>"I am nervous. This is something we just went through with the other storm -- ground saturated, still recovering from that," Randy Prior, who owns a pool business, told AFP.</p>

<p>Prior, 36, says he plans to ride out the storm at home, after recently toughing out Hurricane Helene, which sparked flooding in Florida before wreaking havoc across remote areas further inland such as western North Carolina.</p>

<p>The Weather Channel reported "numerous tornadoes" touching down in central and southern Florida.</p>

<p>With the storm coming immediately after lethal Helene hit the US southeast, presidential candidate Donald Trump has sought political advantage by falsely saying aid is channeled away from residents, many of whom are supporters of his Republican Party, and toward migrants.</p>

<p>At the White House on Wednesday, President Joe Biden slammed the Republican former president and current candidate's "onslaught of lies."</p>

<p>"There's been a reckless, irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies," Biden said in angry remarks.</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, who is taking on Trump at the polls, echoed Biden's criticisms in a separate telephone interview with CNN.</p>

<p>"It is dangerous, it is unconscionable, frankly, that anyone who'd consider themselves a leader would mislead desperate people to the point that those desperate people would not receive the aid to which they are entitled," she said.</p>

<p>Across the southeastern United States, emergency workers are still struggling to provide relief after Helene, which killed at least 235 people.</p>

<p>Scientists say global warming has a role in intense storms as warmer ocean surfaces release more water vapor, providing additional energy for storms, which exacerbates their winds.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

He was 86 and was undergoing routine medical investigation due to his age.</p>

<p>Paying a tribute to Ratan Tata, his company Tata Sons today shared a remembrance note recalling his growing up years and his journey through the decades.</p>

<p>Ratan Tata, who became one of the most respected industrialists and philanthropists globally, was born to Naval and Soonoo Tata on December 28, 1937. He and his younger brother, Jimmy, were raised by their grandmother, Navajbai R Tata, in a baroque manor called Tata Palace in downtown Bombay (now Mumbai).</p>

<p>Navajbai, a formidable matriarch, instilled a strong set of values in her grandchildren. "She was very indulgent, but also quite strict in terms of discipline." Mr Tata would recall in one his interviews where he opened up about his growing-up years. "We were very protected and we didn't have many friends. I had to learn the piano and I played a lot of cricket," he said.</p>

<h2><strong>RATAN TATA - SCHOOL AND COLLEGE YEARS</strong></h2>

<p>Mr Tata was schooled at Campion and then at Cathedral and John Connon - both in Mumbai. He then pursued his higher education at Cornell - an Ivy league university in the United States.</p>

<p>At Cornell he studied architecture and structural engineering, and his years in America from 1955 to 1962 influenced Mr Tata tremendously. It was, in multiple ways, the making of him. He travelled across America and was so charmed by California and the West Coast lifestyle that he was ready to settle down in Los Angeles, as per details shared by Tata Sons.</p>

<h3><strong>THE JOB AT IBM</strong></h3>

<p>When Navajbai's health deteriorated. Mr Tata was forced to return to a life he thought he had left behind. "I was in Los Angeles and very happily so. And that was where I was when I left before I should have left," Mr Tata had said in a 2011 interview with CNN.</p>

<p>Once back in India, Mr Tata had a job offer from IBM. JRD Tata wasn't amused. "He called me one day and he said you can't be here in India and working for IBM. I was in [the IBM office] and I remember he asked me for a resume, which I didn't have. The office had electric typewriters so I sat one evening and typed out a resume on their typewriter and gave it to him."</p>

<h3><strong>RELATIONS WITH HIS FATHER</strong></h3>

<p>Unlike his eldest son, Naval Tata was a gregarious and outgoing personality, equally at home in the company of kings and commoners. He became a director of Tata Sons, an eminent figure in the International Labour Organisation and a well-regarded sports administrator. Between father and son, though, the difference in temperament showed. "We were close and we were not," Mr Tata would write in a special publication that celebrated the lives of Jamsetji Tata, JRD Tata and Naval Tata. "I left India when I was 15 for a decade. I would have to say that, as often happens between a father and a son, there was, perhaps, a divergence of views," Tata sons shared in remembrance of Mr Tata.</p>

<p>"[My father] hated confrontations. He was very good at negotiating settlements... Frequently, that settlement would involve a compromise, and he was all for 'give and take'. As a person, he gave in a great deal and sometimes, as younger and less mature people, we would fight with him for conceding ground in the quest for a solution, for peace or whatever," he wrote, as per a remembrance tribute shared by Tata Sons.</p>

<h3><strong>THE ARCHITECT</strong></h3>

<p>As he has often said, architecture provided him with the equipment to be a perceptive business leader. Pity was that Mr Tata had only a handful of opportunities to use that equipment in the discipline proper, a house he designed for his mother, an abode in Alibaug and his own seafront home in Mumbai being the most prominent of these.</p>

<h3><strong>HIS PASSION AND HIS LOVE FOR PETS</strong></h3>

<p>Mr Tata had a bit more time for his other desires. Flying and fast cars, both of them, like so much else, born in the Cornell cauldron, were enduring passions. As was scuba diving till his ears could take the pressure no more.</p>

<p>A teetotaller and a nonsmoker, Mr Tata consciously chose to stay single. That seems so much like the man: a lonesome warrior wedded to the Tata cause. The company he kept in his book-lined abode in Mumbai were his German Shepherds, Tito and Tango, and his fondness for them was always boundless.</p>

<p>Too many of these pets of Mr Tata were snatched away by death and the loss took its toll, but he never gave up on the chance to bond with yet another loyal bounder. "My love for dogs as pets is ever strong and will continue for as long as I live," he had once said.</p>

<p>"There is an indescribable sadness every time one of my pets passes away and I resolve I cannot go through another parting of that nature. And yet, two-three years down the road, my home becomes too empty and too quiet for me to live without them, so there is another dog that gets my affection and attention, just like the last one."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Online hate against Americans of South Asian ancestry has risen steadily in 2023 and 2024 with the rise of politicians from that community to prominence, according to a report released on Wednesday by nonprofit group Stop AAPI Hate.</p>

<p><strong>WHY IT'S IMPORTANT</strong></p>

<p>Democratic presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris is of Indian descent, as are former Republican presidential candidates Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance's wife, Usha Vance, is also Indian American.</p>

<p>Harris faces Republican former President Donald Trump in the 2024 U.S. elections.</p>

<p>There has been a steady rise in anti-Asian hate in extremist online spaces from January 2023 to August 2024, the report said.</p>

<p>The nonprofit group blamed the rise on a "toxic political climate in which a growing number of leaders and far-right extremist voices continue to spew bigoted political rhetoric and disinformation."</p>

<p><strong>KEY QUOTES</strong></p>

<p>"Online threats of violence towards Asian communities reached their highest levels in August 2024, after Usha Vance appeared at the Republican National Convention and Kamala Harris was declared a presidential nominee at the Democratic National Convention," Stop AAPI Hate said.</p>

<p>"The growing prevalence of anti-South Asian online hate ... in 2023 and 2024 tracks with the rise in South Asian political representation this election cycle," it added.</p>

<p><strong>BY THE NUMBERS</strong></p>

<p>Among Asian American subgroups, South Asian communities were targeted with the highest volume of anti-Asian online hostility, with 60% of slurs directed at them in that period, according to the report.</p>

<p>Anti-South Asian slurs in extremist online spaces doubled last year, from about 23,000 to more than 46,000, and peaked in August 2024.</p>

<p>There are nearly 5.4 million people of South Asian descent living in the United States, comprising of individuals with ancestry from nations including India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The United States on Wednesday said Israel must avoid any Gaza-like military action in Lebanon after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned it risked "destruction" like that in the Palestinian territory.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States on Wednesday said Israel must avoid any Gaza-like military action in Lebanon after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned it risked "destruction" like that in the Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>"There should be no kind of military action in Lebanon that looks anything like Gaza and leaves a result anything like Gaza," State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told journalists.</p>

<p>But Israeli armed forces chief Herzi Halevi vowed it would keep up the intensive bombing of Hezbollah targets that has already killed more than 1,200 people since September 23, "without allowing them any respite or recovery".</p>

<p>In a phone call on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden told Netanyahu to "minimise harm" to civilians in Lebanon, particularly in "densely populated areas of Beirut", the White House said.</p>

<p>It added the two leaders had agreed to stay in "close contact" over the coming days.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said in a video address to the people of Lebanon on Tuesday: "You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will lead to destruction and suffering like we see in Gaza."</p>

<p>He added: "Free your country from Hezbollah so that this war can end."</p>

<p><strong>- Iran conflict concerns -</strong></p>

<p>A Lebanese government source told AFP that Hezbollah had accepted a ceasefire with Israel on September 27, the day an Israeli strike killed the Iran-backed militant group's leader Hassan Nasrallah.</p>

<p>But they said Israel's response had torpedoed the ceasefire plan, backed by Washington and its allies, and the Lebanese government had "had no contact with Hezbollah" since his death.</p>

<p>Biden and Netanyahu's call had been expected to focus on Israel's response to last week's missile barrage by Iran.</p>

<p>Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said: "Our attack on Iran will be deadly, precise and surprising."</p>

<p>Iran fired some 200 missiles at Israel in what it said was retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. Most were intercepted by allied air forces or Israel's own air defences.</p>

<p>Biden has cautioned Israel against attempting to target Iran's nuclear programme, which would risk major retaliation, and is also against striking the country's oil installations, which would send world crude prices spiking.</p>

<p><strong>- Hezbollah rockets, Israeli strikes -</strong></p>

<p>Hezbollah said its fighters were locked in clashes with Israeli troops in southern Lebanon, using rocket-propelled weapons to repel Israeli attempts to breach the border.</p>

<p>Two people were killed by suspected Hezbollah rocket fire in the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona, while Israeli air defences also intercepted two projectiles fired towards the coastal town of Caesarea, officials said.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry said at least four people were killed in an Israeli strike on a village in the Shouf district, southeast of Beirut, a region so far largely spared by Israel's intensified bombing campaign.</p>

<p>Lebanon's state civil defence body later said an Israeli strike killed five of its personnel in the southern village of Derdghaiya.</p>

<p>Israel has intensified air strikes on Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon since September 23, forcing more than a million people to flee, according to an AFP tally of official figures.</p>

<p>Its ground forces crossed into Lebanon on September 30 in response to Hezbollah rocket and artillery attacks over the past year that have forced tens of thousands of Israelis from their homes in border areas.</p>

<p>Israel's military said on Wednesday that its troops had "eliminated terrorists during close-quarter encounters and in aerial strikes" over the previous 24 hours, adding that "100 Hezbollah terror targets were destroyed".</p>

<p>Israeli operations have expanded from border areas in the interior to the southern section of Lebanon's Mediterranean coast.</p>

<p>According to a new toll from the Israeli army on Wednesday 13 of its soldiers have died since ground operations inside Lebanon began.</p>

<p>Israel's air force also said on Wednesday it had killed a Hezbollah member named Adham Jahout in Syria.</p>

<p><strong>- Civilians trapped in north Gaza -</strong></p>

<p>Israel was also extending an ongoing military operation around Jabalia in the north of Gaza, where around 400,000 people are trapped, according to Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).</p>

<p>Posting on X, Lazzarini said there was "no end to hell" in the area and that "recent evacuation orders from the Israeli authorities are forcing people to flee again &amp; again".</p>

<p>The army surrounded the town of Jabalia and its refugee camp at the weekend and was shelling it on Wednesday, preventing the delivery of aid, the Palestinian territory's civil defence agency said.</p>

<p>Washington said it was "incredibly concerned" about the humanitarian situation in north Gaza as Israel tightens its siege, adding that it had been "the subject of some very urgent discussions between our two governments".</p>

<p>"We have been making clear to the government of Israel that they have an obligation under international humanitarian law to allow food and water and other needed humanitarian assistance to make it into all parts of Gaza," State Department spokesman Miller told journalists.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 42,010 people in Gaza, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry which the United Nations has described as reliable.</p>

<p><strong>- Displaced in Beirut -</strong></p>

<p>Israeli police said at least six people were wounded Wednesday, some of them seriously, in a stabbing rampage at four locations in the central Israeli town of Hadera.</p>

<p>In the occupied West Bank, Israeli border police killed at least four Palestinians in the northern city of Nablus, Palestinian health authorities and Israeli security forces said.</p>

<p>In Beirut, many people are sleeping out in the streets after Israeli air strikes and dozens of displaced families were seen on Beirut's seafront on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Ahmad, a 77-year-old Beirut resident who did not want to give his second name for fear of reprisals, said he had a message for Hezbollah.</p>

<p>"If you can't continue to fight, announce you are withdrawing and that you have lost. There is no shame in losing," he said.</p>

<p>But Raed Ayyash, a displaced man from the south of the country, said he hoped Hezbollah would keep fighting.</p>

<p>"We hope for victory and we will never give up," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ratan Tata, the businessman who inherited one of India's oldest conglomerates and transformed it through a string of eye-catching deals into a global empire, has died. He was 86.</p>

<p>His death was announced in a statement by Tata Group Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran, who called Tata "a truly uncommon leader whose immeasurable contributions have shaped not only the Tata Group but also the very fabric of our nation."</p>

<p>As chairman for more than two decades beginning in 1991, Tata rapidly expanded the 156-year-old business house. It now has operations in more than 100 countries and clocked $165 billion in revenue for the year ended March 2024.</p>

<p>Through more than two dozen listed firms, the conglomerate makes products ranging from coffee and cars to salt and software, runs airlines and introduced India's first superapp. It has also partnered with Taiwan's Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. for a $11 billion chip fabrication plant in India and is said to be planning an iPhone assembly plant.</p>

<p>Under Tata's stewardship, the conglomerate embarked on an expansion drive that turned the tables on India's colonial past. It snapped up iconic British assets including steelmaker Corus Group Plc. in 2007 and luxury carmaker Jaguar Land Rover in 2008. But the financial crisis roiled global markets soon after, damping car sales in developed economies.</p>

<p>"Ratan Tata imagined big and took the empire beyond India," said Kavil Ramachandran, executive director of the Thomas Schmidheiny Center for Family Enterprise at the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad. "While he thought globally, these turned out to be hasty initiatives."</p>

<p>Tata helmed the group for 21 years in his first stint and retired in 2012. He returned as interim chief for a few months in 2016 following the acrimonious ouster of his successor, Cyrus Mistry.</p>

<p>Tata also found himself at the center of intense battles for control of the conglomerate not once but twice in his career.</p>

<p>The first battle, when he took over as chairman in 1991, pitted him against long-time executives who had been running fiefdoms within the conglomerate under his predecessor. The second, in 2016 - four years after his retirement - was about preserving his legacy as Mistry sought to reduce debt.</p>

<p>Tata won both. In 2016, Mistry was ousted as the chairman of Tata Sons, the group's main holding firm, in a boardroom coup. The move triggered a bitter courtroom battle that threatened to end a 70-year partnership with Mistry's family and stamped Tata's authority on the conglomerate. In 2020, Mistry's family signaled its intent to sell an 18% stake in Tata Sons.</p>

<h2><strong>2008 MUMBAI TERROR ATTACK</strong></h2>

<p>The conglomerate faced another crisis in late 2008 when terrorists targeted the group's flagship hotel, the Taj Mahal Palace, overlooking Mumbai's Gateway of India, part of a broader attack on the city. About 31 people, including 11 employees, died during the four-day siege. Guests staying at the hotel today are greeted by a memorial with the names of the victims, each of whose families Tata personally visited.</p>

<p>Tata never married and had no children. His death leaves a vacuum at the helm of the powerful Tata Trusts, a collective of charities. These philanthropic trusts own about 66% of Tata Sons, which in turn controls all the major listed Tata firms. Tata Trusts have traditionally been led by a member of the Tata family and wields control over the conglomerate through its holding in Tata Sons.</p>

<p>In his last few years, Tata became a passionate backer of startups including Ola Electric Mobility Ltd., which had a bumper listing in 2024, and Goodfellows, a platform aimed at intergenerational friendships.</p>

<p>The origins of the Tata group date back to 1868, when Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata set up a trading company that later diversified into cotton mills, steel plants and hotels. The Tatas belong to the Parsi Zoroastrian community, which fled religious persecution in Persia centuries ago before finding refuge in western India.</p>

<h3><strong>PARENTS DIVORCED</strong></h3>

<p>Born in Mumbai on Dec. 28, 1937, Ratan Naval Tata was brought up by his grandmother after his parents, Naval and Sooni Tata, divorced when he was 10. His father had been adopted into the main Tata family at 13 by the daughter-in-law of Jamsetji Tata, founder of the Tata Group.</p>

<p>Usually chauffeured around in a Rolls-Royce, Tata attended school in India's business capital, Mumbai. As a young student, he learned the piano and played cricket but was afraid of public speaking. His younger brother, Jimmy Tata, stayed out of public life, and little is known about him.</p>

<p>"We faced a fair bit of ragging and personal discomfort because of our parent's divorce, which in those days wasn't as common as it is today," Ratan Tata wrote in a Facebook post in 2020. "But our grandmother taught us to retain dignity at all costs, a value that's stayed with me until today. It involved walking away from these situations, which otherwise we would have fought back against."</p>

<p>Tata went to college in the US at Cornell University with plans to study mechanical engineering, as his father wished, but he found his calling elsewhere.</p>

<p>"I had always wanted to be an architect, and at the end of my second year at Cornell, I switched - much to my father's consternation and upset," Tata recalled in a 2009 interview with Cornell. He graduated in 1962 with a degree in architecture.</p>

<h3><strong>IBM OFFER</strong></h3>

<p>Tata wanted to settle down in California, but the poor health of his grandmother prompted him to return to India, where he had a job offer from International Business Machines Corp.</p>

<p>The then-chairman of Tata Sons, Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata, popularly known as JRD, persuaded him to instead work for the group. The two men were distantly related, parts of different branches of the Tata family tree. Groomed by JRD, the younger Tata started his career at the conglomerate in 1962, undertaking several stints at various units before joining management in the 1970s.</p>

<p>In 1991, when Tata was handpicked for the top job at Tata Sons, the group was mostly focused on India. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., the software maker that would become a cash cow years later, was still in its infancy. The automotive business hadn't yet started making passenger cars.</p>

<p>The 1990s was also the decade when India started cutting its notorious red tape, discarding parts of a failed Soviet-style planned economy. That meant private sector companies could compete more effectively in sectors that were dominated by government enterprises, paving the way for faster economic growth and unleashing consumption.</p>

<p>As India allowed foreign automakers from Ford Motor Co. to Hyundai Motor Co. to set up factories and tap burgeoning consumer demand, Tata decided to make cars as well. Tata called the first locally built passenger vehicle - rolled out in 1998 and named Indica - "my baby."</p>

<p>As India's economy started to boom in the 2000s, Tata became more adventurous. In 2007, he took on debt to pay about $13 billion for Corus, the British steelmaker. The following year, he acquired Jaguar Land Rover, or JLR, from Ford for $2.3 billion. He also bought Tetley Group Plc and the heavy-vehicles unit of South Korea's Daewoo group.</p>

<h3><strong>NEW CHALLENGES</strong></h3>

<p>While the acquisition spree helped bring the conglomerate's geographical footprint to an entirely new level, it also set up a number of challenges.</p>

<p>The 2008 financial crisis triggered a broad slide in commodity prices, while a steel glut fueled by an increase in Chinese exports depressed prices, sparking criticism that Tata had overpaid to acquire Corus. Tata Steel Ltd. has pared its European operations in recent years in the face of slumping demand and high cost structures, and slashed thousands of jobs in the continent.</p>

<p>JLR also hit a rough patch soon after it was acquired by Tata as the financial crisis pummeled demand for luxury cars as well as the company's ability to access credit. While the Tata Group managed to turn around the marquee car brand within a couple of years, it soon faced other headwinds, from slumping Chinese demand to Brexit. The pandemic and chips shortage affected JLR in recent years.</p>

<p>Tata oversaw another auto-related setback with the failure of the Nano microcar. He wanted to build a cheap automobile that would retail for 100,000 rupees ($1,190.9), targeted at the millions of Indians who typically used motorcycles to get around and transport their families. Production of the Nano was ended in 2018, about 10 years after its unveiling, amid a lack of demand due to early quality and safety concerns.</p>

<p>Perhaps the final business battle Tata fought was his most gratifying.</p>

<p>In 2021, Tata Sons regained control of Air India Ltd., the nation's flagship carrier, almost 90 years after it was taken over by the state. Heavily indebted and a shadow of its former glory - Salvador Dali once designed ashtrays as gifts for the airline's guests - the deal meant Tata was able to welcome home to the group an airline originally founded by his mentor, JRD.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu agreed Wednesday to stay in "close contact" as Israel mulls its response to Iran, with the US leader also urging the Israeli premier to "minimize" harm to civilians in Lebanon, the White House said.</p>

<p>Biden and Netanyahu's call was their first in nearly two months and came amid mounting pressure from Washington not to strike Iran's oil or nuclear facilities less than four weeks before the US presidential election.</p>

<p>A White House readout of the call did not directly mention possible retaliation for an Iranian missile strike on Israel last week but said Biden had condemned Tehran's attack "unequivocally" and pledged "ironclad" support for Israel.</p>

<p>Biden and Netanyahu "agreed to remain in close contact over the coming days, both directly and through their national security teams," the readout said, adding that Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris also joined the call.</p>

<p>The call came as Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who had been due to discuss Israel's response in Washington on Wednesday before the last-minute postponement of his visit by Netanyahu, pledged on Wednesday: "Our attack on Iran will be deadly, precise and surprising."</p>

<p>Biden and Netanyahu also discussed Israel's offensive against Iranian ally Hezbollah in Lebanon, the White House said.</p>

<p>The US president "reaffirmed" Israel's right to defend itself against Hezbollah rocket attacks "while emphasizing the need to minimize harm to civilians, in particular in the densely populated areas of Beirut," it said.</p>

<p>Netanyahu had warned earlier Wednesday that Lebanon faced "destruction" like that in the Palestinian territory of Gaza, which has been under relentless bombardment since Hamas's October 7, 2023 attacks on Israel.</p>

<p>On Gaza, the two leaders also "discussed the urgent need to renew diplomacy to release the hostages held by Hamas."</p>

<p>The White House had earlier described the call lasting around 30 minutes as "direct," "honest" and "productive."</p>

<p>"The US and the Israeli government have had discussions since last week since after the Iran attack. Those discussions continued with the president and the prime minister," Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.</p>

<p>"We're going to continue to have those discussions with Israel on how they're going to respond."</p>

<p>Jean-Pierre also reacted to Netanyahu's comments on Lebanon, saying: "We cannot and will not see Lebanon turn into another Gaza."</p>

<p>But she would not comment on a new book by veteran US journalist Bob Woodward detailing growing tensions between Biden and Netanyahu.</p>

<p>Biden had told Netanyahu in July that "the perception of Israel around the world increasingly is that you're a rogue state, a rogue actor," The New York Times reported the book as saying.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi will begin his two-day official visit to Laos in southeast Asia to attend the annual ASEAN-India Summit. He will also attend the East Asia Summit as New Delhi's Act East policy gains momentum.</p>

<p>PM Modi will arrive in Laos's capital Vientiane on the invite of his counterpart Sonexay Siphandone, who is the current chair for the Association of South East Asian Nations or ASEAN.</p>

<p>Besides the 21st ASEAN-India summit and the 19th East Asia Summit, the prime minister will also hold several bilateral meetings with heads of states from member countries.</p>

<p>PM Modi's visit on October 10-11 will highlight how the ASEAN member countries are a crucial part of India's 'Act East' policy. It will also underscore New Delhi's cooperation with allies and partners with a common vision of the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<p>The prime minister has prioritised east and southeast Asia with his vision for an initiative called SAGAR - Security And Growth for All in the Region.</p>

<p>Speaking about the prime minister's visit to Laos, the Ministry of External Affairs said, "The ASEAN-India Summit will review progress of India-ASEAN relations through our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and chart the future direction of cooperation. The East Asia Summit, a premier leaders-led forum that contributes to building an environment of strategic trust in the region, provides an opportunity for leaders of EAS Participating Countries, including India, to exchange views on issues of regional importance."</p>

<p>2024 marks a decade of India's Act East Policy and during this decade, the engagements have grown from stronger people-to-people connections to robust cooperation in trade and investment, defence and security, and connectivity including fin-tech, heritage conservation and capacity building.</p>

<p>It also marks important anniversaries of the establishment of India's diplomatic relations with several countries in the region - 75th with Indonesia, 75th with the Philippines, 60th with Singapore and 40th with Brunei.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ratan Tata, one of India's most loved industrialists, died today aged 86. He was reportedly admitted to a Mumbai hospital in critical condition. N Chandrasekaran, Chairman of Tata Sons, has confirmed the sad news.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a statement, Mr Chandrasekaran said, "It is with a profound sense of loss that we bid farewell to Mr. Ratan Naval Tata, a truly uncommon leader whose immeasurable contributions have shaped not only the Tata Group but also the very fabric of our nation. "</p>

<h2><strong>Here is the full statement by Tata Sons:&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>"It is with a profound sense of loss that we bid farewell to Mr. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/ratan-tata-dies-at-86-tata-conglomerates-chairman-emeritus-dies-at-mumbai-hospital-6755024">Ratan Naval Tata</a>, a truly uncommon leader whose immeasurable contributions have shaped not only the Tata Group but also the very fabric of our nation.</p>

<p>For the Tata Group, Mr. Tata was more than a chairperson. To me, he was a mentor, guide and friend. He inspired by example. With an unwavering commitment to excellence, integrity, and innovation, the Tata Group under his stewardship expanded its global footprint while always remaining true to its moral compass.</p>

<p>Mr. Tata's dedication to philanthropy and the development of society has touched the lives of millions. From education to healthcare, his initiatives have left a deep-rooted mark that will benefit generations to come. Reinforcing all of this work was Mr. Tata's genuine humility in every individual interaction.</p>

<p>On behalf of the entire Tata family, I extend our deepest condolences to his loved ones. His legacy will continue to inspire us as we strive to uphold the principles he so passionately championed.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Abortion rights are arguably the single-most important issue in the US ahead of the presidential election on November 5. It affects 50% of the population and is a matter of an individual's fundamental liberty, which is protected by the Constitution.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Abortion rights are arguably the single-most important issue in the US ahead of the presidential election on November 5. It affects 50 per cent of the US population and is a matter of an individual's fundamental liberty, which is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution.</p>

<p>During his term as President, Donald Trump reshaped the Supreme Court, which in 2022 left the states to decide their own abortion policies by overturning Roe vs Wade, the federal guarantee of abortion access - and thus dismantling five decades of precedent protecting abortion rights across the US.</p>

<p>Now, at least ten states in the US are holding referendums on the issue of abortion, and the questions on it will appear on the same ballots used to cast the vote to select the next US President.</p>

<p>This is the first US presidential election to be held after access to abortion was banned or restricted across much of the US following a landmark Supreme Court ruling.</p>

<p>The outcome could have profound implications, with the potential for restrictions affecting tens of millions of women to be overturned. Democrats also hope that the issue will mobilise a broader swath of the electorate in their favor.</p>

<p>In recent times, women in the US are being forced to cross state lines to terminate their life-threatening pregnancies. "This is a health care crisis, and Donald Trump is the architect," Kamala Harris has said.</p>

<h2><strong>THE REFERENDUMS</strong></h2>

<p>According to the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution, "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."</p>

<p>With the referendums in November, each constitutional amendment will enshrine state-level reproductive rights, which were undermined by the US Supreme Court's 2022 ruling which led to restrictions on abortion access.</p>

<p>Among the states that have been affected by the US Supreme Court ruling which has made abortions restrictive, Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska, and South Dakota are holding referendums.</p>

<p>As of now, the other states that are holding the vote on abortion rights are Colorado, Maryland, Montana, Nevada, and New York.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT IT WILL MEAN FOR THESE STATES</strong></h3>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><strong>ARIZONA</strong> - In the state of Arizona, which is a crucial swing state, abortion is currently limited to 15 weeks of pregnancy. Democrats hope referendum would bolster their chances of winning this key battleground state. Proposition 139, which is all but sure to be adopted, would protect abortions until the point of fetal viability.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>FLORIDA</strong> - This is the third-most populous state in the US. Currently abortion in the state is banned after six weeks of pregnancy. This is so short a period of time that women often know of their pregnancy only after this time. Voters will on November 5 choose whether to extend that time until the point of fetal viability, which is about 24 weeks of pregnancy. The proposed amendment must receive 60 per cent of the votes cast in order to pass. A recent poll indicated that 55 per cent of Floridians support it, and 20 per cent are "not sure."</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>MISSOURI</strong> - The midwestern state of Missouri has one of the strictest abortion bans in the United States, with no exceptions even for rape or incest. The referendum proposes to allow abortion until fetal viability in the traditionally Republican-leaning state.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>NEBRASKA</strong> - This is state, abortion is legal until 12 weeks. It is the only US state which will vote on two competing propositions. One would establish a "fundamental right" to abortion until fetal viability, while the other would ban it after the first trimester (13 weeks). The winning amendment will require 50 per cent of the vote, and more votes than the competing initiative.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>SOUTH DAKOTA</strong> - South Dakota has a similar abortion ban to Missouri, with the procedure allowed only to protect the life of a mother. Voters will now decide whether to reestablish the right to abortion during the first trimester.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>COLORADO</strong> - Colorado is among a handful of states where abortion is legal without a gestational limit. A citizen-led initiative now proposes to constitutionally protect the right to abortion in the Democratic-led state.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>MARYLAND</strong> - Maryland voters will decide whether to amend their constitution to enshrine the right to abortion until fetal viability.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>MONTANA</strong> - Abortion is legal in Montana, traditionally a conservative state, until fetal viability, despite legal efforts to restrict access that have been blocked by judges. The proposed amendment would enshrine existing reproductive rights in the state's constitution.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>NEVADA</strong> - Voters in the western state of Nevada, where abortion is legal until fetal viability (24 weeks), will choose whether to enshrine the right in the state constitution.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>NEW YORK</strong> - Lawmakers in New York have submitted an amendment to further bolster abortion access, which is already legal until fetal viability, by including anti-discrimination protections for reproductive healthcare.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Air France said on Wednesday it had opened an internal investigation after one of its planes flew over Iraq on October 1 during an Iranian missile attack on Israel.</p>

<p>The company said flight AF662 from Paris to Dubai was travelling at the time of the attack through a special corridor used by all airlines in southern Iraq and fifteen minutes later it left the country's air space, which was not closed to airplane traffic until 1756 GMT.</p>

<p>"Without waiting for instructions from the Iraqi authorities, Air France has decided to suspend overflight of the country's airspace by its aircraft from 1700 GMT," the airline said.</p>

<p>"An internal investigation has been launched into this event," it added.</p>

<p>Air France also said that another flight returned to Paris, while a third, from Singapore to Paris, made an additional stop in Delhi to get more fuel to take a longer route.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media giant X was available to some Brazilian users on Wednesday, one day after the country's Supreme Court cleared billionaire Elon Musk's platform to resume service for complying with court rulings.</p>

<p>Brazil's telecommunications regulator, Anatel, said on Wednesday that it has begun ordering internet providers to allow users to access X again. Some users were already accessing the platform, and topics such as "we're back" were trending on Wednesday in Latin America's biggest country.</p>

<p>Yet some Brazilians were still not able to access X, previously know as Twitter, and Anatel said the time it takes for the platform to be unlocked would depend on the procedures taken by each internet provider.</p>

<p>Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who had been locked in a months-long feud with Musk, gave X the green light to resume operations in Latin America's largest country Tuesday afternoon, ordering Anatel to allow X to come back online within 24 hours.</p>

<p>In the decision, Moraes said X had met all the necessary requirements to start operating again in the country, after the platform reversed course and started complying with court rulings Musk had previously vowed to resist.</p>

<p>X had been suspended in Brazil, one of its largest and most-coveted markets, since late August after not complying with court orders related to hate speech moderation and failing to name a legal representative in the country, as required by law.</p>

<p>Brazil is X's sixth-biggest market globally and as of April had about 21.5 million users, according to data platform Statista.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before Narendra Modi assumed office of India's Prime Minister in 2014, there was instability due to frequent changes in the leadership, former US President Donald Trump has said in an podcast called 'Flagrant' with comedians Andrew Schultz and Akash Singh.</p>

<p>The former US President lavished high praise on PM Modi and described him the nicest human being who can be tough when required.</p>

<p>"Before him they were replacing him (Indian PMs) every year, it was very unstable. He came along, he's great, he's a friend of mine. On the outside he looks like he's your father he's the nicest...," said Trump, who is seeking re-election as US President.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Former American President Donald Trump, in the Flagrant podcast, describes Prime Minister Modi as the nicest human being but also a total killer.<br />
<br />
He added that Modi took him by surprise with his threat of aggressive retaliation against Pakistan when he said we would handle them;… <a href="https://t.co/8oOH9ELvx3">pic.twitter.com/8oOH9ELvx3</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Trump also talked about the success of 'Howdy Modi' in Houston, Texas, in 2019 when he was the US President.</p>

<p>"They filled up the stadium, it was beautiful like 80,000 people, it was going crazy and we're walking around today....we were walking in the middle, waving to everybody," he said.</p>

<p>Trump also spoke about how PM Modi told him that India can deal with Islamabad after being offered US support.</p>

<p>"He is nicest human being but we had couple of occasions where somebody was threatening India. I said let me help, I am very good with those people (Trump imitating PM Modi) 'I will do it, I will do , I will do anything necessary. We have defeated them for 100s of years...," Trump said without naming Pakistan.</p>

<p>Trump also said he has very good relationship with PM Modi.</p>

<p>Trump spoke about his relationship with PM Modi around the 37-minute mark of 88 minute long interview.</p>

<p>'Howdy Modi' was an Indian community event in Houston, Texas in 2019. The event at NRG Stadium saw a huge crowd and showcased the relationship between the two countries. PM Modi and Trump addressed the gathering.</p>

<p>Trump has praised PM Modi earlier too and has described him a "fantastic man".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded on Wednesday to three scientists who have help unravel some of the enduring secrets of proteins, the building blocks of life.</p>

<p>While Demis Hassabis and John Jumper of Google's DeepMind lab used artificial intelligence techniques to predict the structure of proteins, biochemist David Baker managed to design totally new ones never seen in nature.</p>

<p>These breakthroughs are hoped to lead towards numerous advances, from discovering new drugs to enzymes that decompose pollutants.</p>

<p>Here is an explainer about the science behind the Nobel win.</p>

<p><strong>What are proteins?</strong></p>

<p>Proteins are molecules that serve as "the factories of everything that happens in our body," Davide Calebiro, a protein researcher at the UK's University of Birmingham, told AFP.</p>

<p>DNA provides the blueprint for every cell. Proteins then use this information to do the work of turning that cell into something specific -- such as a brain cell or a muscle cell.</p>

<p>Proteins are made up of 20 different kinds of amino acid. The sequence that these acids start out in determines what 3D structure they will twist and fold into.</p>

<p>American Chemical Society president Mary Carroll compared how this works to an old-fashioned telephone cord.</p>

<p>"So you could stretch out that telephone cord, and then you would just have a one-dimensional structure," she told AFP.</p>

<p>"Then it would spring back" into the 3D shape, she added.</p>

<p>So if chemists wanted to master proteins, they needed to understand how the 2D sequences turned into these 3D structures.</p>

<p>"Nature already provides tens of thousands of different proteins, but sometimes we want them to do something they do not yet know how to do," said French biochemist Sophie Sacquin-Mora.</p>

<p><strong>What did AI do?</strong></p>

<p>The work of previous Nobel winners had demonstrated that chemists should be able to look at amino acid sequences and predict the structure they would become.</p>

<p>But it was not so easy. Chemists struggled for 50 years -- there was even a biannual competition called the "Protein Olympics" where many failed the prediction test.</p>

<p>Enter Hassabis and Jumper. They trained their artificial intelligence model AlphaFold on all the known amino acid sequences and corresponding structures.</p>

<p>When given an unknown sequence, AlphaFold compares it with previous ones, gradually reconstructing the puzzle in three dimensions.</p>

<p>After the newer generation AlphaFold2 crushed the 2020 Protein Olympics, the organisers deemed the problem solved.</p>

<p>The model has now predicted the structure of almost all of the 200 million proteins known on Earth.</p>

<p><strong>What about the new proteins?</strong></p>

<p>US biochemist Baker started at the opposite end of the process.</p>

<p>First, he designed an entirely new protein structure never seen in nature.</p>

<p>Then, using a computer programme called Rosetta that he had developed, he was able to work out the amino acid sequence that it started out as.</p>

<p>To achieve this, Rosetta trawled through all the known protein structures, searching for short protein fragments similar to the structure it wanted to build.</p>

<p>Rosetta then tweaked them and proposed a sequence that could end up as the structure.</p>

<p><strong>What is all this for?</strong></p>

<p>Mastering such fundamental and important little machines as proteins could have a vast number of potential uses in the future.</p>

<p>"It allows us to better understand how life functions, including why some diseases develop, how antibiotic resistance occurs or why some microbes can decompose plastic," the Nobel website said.</p>

<p>Making all-new proteins could lead to new nanomaterials, targeted drugs and vaccines, or more climate-friendly chemicals, it added.</p>

<p>Asked to pick a favourite protein, Baker pointed to one he "designed during the pandemic that protects against the coronavirus".</p>

<p>"I've been very excited about the idea of a nasal spray of little design proteins that would protect against all possible pandemic viruses," he told the Nobel ceremony via videolink.</p>

<p>Calebiro emphasised how "transformative" this research would be.</p>

<p>"I think this is just the beginning of a completely new era."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris spoke Wednesday with Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, the White House said, as Israel weighs its response to last week's missile attack by Iran.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden spoke by phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday and the two leaders were expected to discuss Israeli plans for a retaliatory strike on Iran.</p>

<p>The call was the leaders' first known chat since August and coincided with a sharp escalation of Israel's conflict with both Iran and the Iran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah with no sign of an imminent ceasefire to end the conflict with Iran-backed Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>The Middle East has been on edge awaiting Israel's response to a missile attack last week that Tehran carried out in retaliation for Israel's military escalation in Lebanon. The Iranian attack ultimately killed no one in Israel and Washington called it ineffective.</p>

<p>Netanyahu has promised that arch-foe Iran will pay for its missile attack, while Tehran has said any retaliation would be met with vast destruction, raising fears of a wider war in the oil-producing region which could draw in the United States.</p>

<p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Relations between Biden and Netanyahu have been tense, strained over the Israeli leader's handling of the war in Gaza and the conflict with Hezbollah.</p>

<p>In "War," a book out next week, journalist Bob Woodward reports that Biden regularly accused Netanyahu of having no strategy, and shouted "Bibi, what the fuck?" at him in July, after Israeli strikes near Beirut and in Iran.</p>

<p>Asked about the book, one US official familiar with the two leaders' past interactions said Biden has used sharp, direct, unfiltered and colorful language both with and about Netanyahu while in office.</p>

<p>Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant canceled a Wednesday visit to the Pentagon, the Pentagon said, as Israeli media reported Netanyahu wanted first to speak with Biden.</p>

<p>Tensions have increased in recent weeks as US officials were repeatedly blindsided by Israeli actions, according to a person familiar with the matter. These included Israel's killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and the detonation of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah members in Lebanon that Israel has neither confirmed nor denied carrying out.</p>

<p>Israel has also been slow to share details of its planning for retaliation against Iran's ballistic missile attack, the person said.</p>

<p><strong>ELECTION ISSUE</strong></p>

<p>Biden has been hit by sharp criticism from international partners as well as members of his own Democratic Party over his inability to use leverage, including the US role as Israel's chief arms supplier, to curb Netanyahu's attacks.</p>

<p>By extension, Kamala Harris, Biden's vice president and the Democrats' presidential candidate in the Nov 5 election, has been challenged to defend the administration's policy on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>Many Arab American voters in Michigan, a key battleground state, are backing independent candidate Jill Stein instead, a move that could cost Democrats the state and perhaps the White House in a race with Republican former President Donald Trump that opinion polls show to be very tight.</p>

<p>Harris joined the call with Biden and Netanyahu, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliation is a key subject, with Washington hoping to weigh in on whether the response is appropriate, a separate person briefed on the discussions said.</p>

<p>Israel and Netanyahu in particular have faced widespread condemnation over the nearly 42,000 Palestinians killed in the Gaza war, according to the Palestinian health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza, and the deaths of over 2,000 people in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Israel says it is defending itself after Hamas militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies, and from attacks by other militants including Hezbollah who support Hamas.</p>

<p><strong>IRAN OIL FIELDS</strong></p>

<p>Biden said last Friday he would think about alternatives to striking Iranian oil fields if he were in Israel's shoes, adding he thought Israel had not concluded how to respond to Iran. Last week, he also said he would not support Israel striking Iranian nuclear sites.</p>

<p>Israel has faced calls by the United States and other allies to accept a ceasefire deal in Gaza and Lebanon but has said it will continue its military operations until Israelis are safe.</p>

<p>Biden and Netanyahu were also expected to discuss the conflicts with Hamas in Gaza and with Hezbollah in Lebanon, along with other topics.</p>

<p>The United States has said it supports Israel going after Iran-backed targets like Hezbollah and Hamas.</p>

<p>About three million people in Gaza and Lebanon have been displaced by Israel's military campaigns, according to Palestinian and Lebanese officials, and Gaza is also facing a humanitarian crisis with a lack of food and fresh water. Israel has said some 70,000 Israelis have been displaced from northern Israel by Hezbollah attacks the past year.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a direct connection between social media use and mental health, especially among teenagers, the US Surgeon General Vice Admiral Vivek Murthy told NDTV today. He said that his office had even issued an advisory in this regard, appealing for more focus on this very concerning issue.</p>

<p>The US Surgeon General is the doctor to all of the United States of America. The Surgeon General is consulted by the President of the US on all public health issues and health-related emergency matters. It is one of the topmost posts in the US and is responsible for America's overall healthcare system, new technology in the sector, and scientific advancement in medicine.</p>

<p>The current Surgeon General, Vice Admiral Vivek Murthy spoke exclusively to NDTV today on a range of issues, including a growing mental health crisis globally and how social media impacts it.</p>

<p>"There is a need to protect our children," the Surgeon General said, adding that it is a priority for him and his department to "make mental health the priority that it needs to be." He said that "Many countries are struggling with mental health crisis, with many cases of depression, anxiety, and sadly suicide."</p>

<h2><strong>'THE STIGMA'</strong></h2>

<p>Vice Admiral Murthy explained that his advisory aims to focus on the "stigma around mental health", which he says "makes it harder for patients to talk about it at home with their families, and makes their struggle harder because not often can they ask for the help they need."</p>

<p>As an increasing number of young adults are battling mental health issues globally, the top doctor of the United States said, "Fundamentally what we have to do is to see mental health for what it is - It is part of our overall health, and mental health is just as important to a person as their physical health is, and must be treated with the urgency and priority that it deserves."</p>

<h3><strong>'GENERATIONAL DIFFERENCES, COMMUNITY OUTLOOK'</strong></h3>

<p>"Older generations are not always used to talking about mental health issues," the Surgeon General said, acknowledging that "different generations look at mental health differently, as do different communities."</p>

<p>"While older generations do not talk about it openly, the younger generations are far more open and sensitive to mental health challenges," he said.</p>

<p>Speaking about cultural views on mental health and the stigma attached to it, Vice Admiral Murthy said, "We see a lot of cultural differences when it comes to viewing mental health issues. My family is originally from India, and the Indian-American community which I grew up in, we never spoke about mental health issues. In fact, it was something that was seen as a source of shame."</p>

<p>Giving an example of his own experience of the stigmatisation of mental health challenges, he said, "I had an uncle who sadly lost his life to suicide. I remember the sense of shame around the family that something like this had happened. There was so much concern about telling other people what had happened because of what they would think about the family. That kind of stigma and the message it sends to both young and old people, is that these issues are just not okay to talk about."</p>

<p>"We need to change this. I aim for a day where we can talk about the mental health issues we face just as easily as we would about a sprained ankle or heart disease. We need to talk about it with the same amount of openness" he said.</p>

<h3><strong>'BUILDING BLOCKS OF A FULFILLING LIFE'</strong></h3>

<p>Young people are under tremendous pressure and stress of performing well in life, said the top doctor, and so, I asked a lot of young adults what success means to them, he added.</p>

<p>"We need to ask ourselves what we are doing to define success for young people in order to help them having a fulfilling life. When I spoke to young people in the US, many of them said they feel they are being asked to hustle behind a definition of success that is largely dependent on - 'How much money you make', 'How much fame you can acquire', and 'How much power can you attain' - And while there is nothing wrong in wanting to amass power, fortune and fame, if we feel that that is what is going to lead to long-term fulfilment, unfortunately life's experiences and challenges tends to make us feel the other way," he said.</p>

<p>"So, if we really want our children to be truly and deeply fulfilled, the thing we need to increasingly think about is - How can we help them build a life that is focussed on meaning, on purpose, on service, and on community - because these are the building blocks of fulfilment that we all ultimately want for our children," he explained.</p>

<h3><strong>THE ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT TO MANAGE STRESS</strong></h3>

<p>Delving on the issue of stress and the pressures faced by young individuals, Vice Admiral Murthy said, "We need to see and understand where the pressures being faced by our children are coming from. We also need to mitigate and manage them to make the environment that our children are growing up in much more hospitable and welcoming."</p>

<p>Explaining his statement, he added, "One of the things we know is that pressure is a lot easier to deal with - stress in general, is a lot easier to deal with when we have social support around us. Which is why the issues of loneliness and isolation being a broader epidemic is a serious problem in the US and increasingly across the world."</p>

<h3><strong>SUICIDE - THE DEEPEST PAIN, A GLOBAL EPIDEMIC</strong></h3>

<p>Speaking about an ever-increasing suicide rate globally, the Surgeon General said, "Suicide is one of the most painful consequences of all of the broader mental health challenges we are facing today. The thought of losing your child to suicide is the deepest pain for any parent to deal with."</p>

<p>He further explained that "Suicide deaths have increased significantly across the world in the last two decades." This, he says, is due to several reasons:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Loneliness has become a profound issue among children. It affects the entire population, but is hitting young people the hardest. It is now an epidemic across the world.</li>
	<li>The impact of violence and the fear of violence - Over 50 per cent children in the US now fear a school shooting.</li>
	<li>Negative news and mobile phones - Most children today carry or have access to smartphones that are constantly buzzing with negative and violent headlines which make them feel like their life and the future is bleak because nothing positive is happening around the world.</li>
	<li>Most of all, Technology and Social Media - Children are, on average, spending more than 3 hours a day on social media. By doing so, they face double the risk of depression and anxiety. It is one of the many reasons we have to address the harms of social media.</li>
</ol>

<h3><strong>'WE'VE FAILED AS A SOCIETY'</strong></h3>

<p>Social media algorithms are what make these platforms so addictive. These algorithms have a direct impact on the brain and the hormones secreted by it. But there are no laws to keep these algorithms in check. While even smoking or drinking have their own set of laws to not pose a risk to the public, social media firms have no such rules to bind them from using their algorithms indiscriminately.</p>

<p>Elaborating on the challenges faced in combating the harms of social media, the Surgeon General said, "For the last 20 years that social media has been around, we have broadly failed as a society to ensure that social media companies meet safety standards."</p>

<p>Giving the example of cars, Vice Admiral Murthy explained that "Cars have a basic level of safety and standards in place. These standards ensure that that brakes are working, the seat belts and the engine are in sound condition, the frame of the car is such it protects the occupants of the vehicle. But we do now have anything like that, especially in the US, when it comes to checks and balances for social media. There are no safety standards to protect children in particular from its harmful effects."</p>

<p>"The entire burden of checks and balances for social media are entirely on kids and parents. Not only is that unfair, but is ineffective, and we can see that from how it is manifesting today," he said.<br />

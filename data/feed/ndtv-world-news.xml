       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Support has poured in for the family of Gursimran Kaur, a 19-year-old Walmart employee found dead earlier this month in a walk-in oven at a Canadian Walmart store.&nbsp;The Maritime Sikh Society, to which Ms Kaur's family belongs, announced in an update on their <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-the-family-of-gursimran-who-lost-her-life-at-walmart" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>GoFundMe page </em></a>on Friday, October 25, that they had raised over $194,949 to assist her "bereaved family," some of whom had been in India and were working to travel to Canada for her funeral.</p>

<p>"We want to express our deepest gratitude to everyone who has donated to support Gursimran Kaur's family during this unimaginable time. Your kindness and generosity have been a source of strength for the family as they navigate through this tragedy," a representative of the group shared.</p>

<p>The society also announced that they would "turn off donations" to begin "distributing the funds to the family," with the contributions intended to support them in the coming steps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"... We cannot thank you enough for standing with them during this painful period," the representative continued. "Thank you again for your support, compassion, and for being a part of this effort to help Gursimran's family in their time of need."</p>

<p>According to Halifax Regional Police, Ms Kaur was found dead inside an oven in the bakery section of a Halifax Walmart on the night of Saturday, October 19.</p>

<p>The Maritime Sikh Society described Kaur as "a young beautiful girl who came to Canada with big dreams." She had been at the store with her mother, who, after losing contact with her for an hour, eventually found her inside the oven. Both Kaur and her mother had been employed at the Walmart store for two years.</p>

<p>Constable Martin Cromwell told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/family-of-walmart-employee-who-died-in-oven-share-gratitude-for-public-support-8734910" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>PEOPLE</em></a> on Oct. 25 that police have not yet determined how Kaur entered the oven, noting that the investigation is "complex."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli emergency service and police said a truck rammed into a bus stop north of the commercial hub Tel Aviv on Sunday, injuring dozens of people.</p>

<p>Police did not immediately say what caused the incident or whether it was an attack.</p>

<p>"At 10:08 am (0808 GMT), a report was received... of a truck hitting a bus stop on Aharon Yariv Boulevard in Ramat Hasharon... Paramedics are currently providing medical treatment on site to dozens of casualties," the Magen David Adom service said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iranian officials should determine how best to demonstrate Iran's power to Israel after the Israeli attack on Iran two nights ago, Iran's official IRNA news agency cited the country's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as saying on Sunday.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, is once again making headlines as a prominent figure in the UK's far-right movement.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of supporters of Tommy Robinson, gathered in London for a "Unite the Kingdom" rally, to oppose immigration policies on Saturday. Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, is once again making headlines as a prominent figure in the UK's far-right movement. The rally saw a massive police presence, &nbsp;to prevent clashes with counter-protesters.</p>

<p>Robinson has been a polarizing figure in British politics since he founded the English Defence League (EDL), a far-right Islamophobic organization, in 2009. Despite organizing the rally, he was unable to attend it due to his arrest on Friday.</p>

</div>

<p>Recently, Robinson has been at the centre of unrest in the UK following a mass stabbing incident in Southport that caused the deaths of three children. He allegedly spread misinformation on social media, falsely claiming that the assailant was a Muslim asylum seeker, leading to violent riots across the country, with demonstrators chanting his name and escalating tensions between far-right groups and anti-racism activists.</p>

<p>As reported by Reuters, Saturday's demonstration occurred amid rising tensions over immigration, with over 29,578 asylum seekers having crossed the English Channel this year-more than the total for all of 2023. His supporters argue that Britain is under siege from not only immigration but also "Islamification," while critics, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, label the unrest fuelled by them, as racist.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><span class="ins_instory_span_credit">Photo Credit: AFP</span></p>
</div>

<p>Saturday's rally saw participants waving British flags and carrying placards which resonated with&nbsp; Robinson's nationalist sentiments. Police were deployed from across the country to monitor both events and ensure public safety. Many were seen carrying banners featuring slogans about former US President Donald Trump, reflecting the influence of a shared right-wing ideology across the globe.</p>

<p>Known for his anti-Islam rhetoric, Robinson has previously faced multiple criminal convictions, including assault and contempt of court. His controversial statements and actions have led to bans from major social media platforms as well. However, he regained access to social media platform X (formerly, Twitter) after its acquisition by Elon Musk.</p>

<p>He is currently in police custody facing charges related to contempt of court for repeatedly breaching an injunction that prohibits him from making defamatory statements about Syrian refugee Jamal Hijazi. In 2021, Robinson was found guilty of libel after falsely accusing Hijazi of assaulting girls at school. Robinson's court appearance is scheduled for Monday. If convicted, he be sentenced to up to 4 years in prison.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/m5vu5teo_narendra-modi-olaf-scholz-german-chancellor-pti_625x300_25_October_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Following nuclear testing in 1998, the Singh-Talbott talks provided the framework for shifting the Indo-US relationship from "estranged democracies" to "engaged democracies." A comparable transition is already ongoing between Germany and India, as seen by Germany's "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/blob/2680288/8909ac2c501ab85d55defff7d1b8b75d/241016-fokus-indien-data.pdf">Focus on India</a>" policy. This move is underscored before Chancellor Olaf Scholz's October 2024 visit to New Delhi, indicating a growing realization that India is not just a key regional actor but also an important partner in the global arena.&nbsp;Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar's 2022 statement, "Europe must grow out of the mindset that its problems are the world's problems," resonates strongly with Germany's stance, which coincides with a more pragmatic and multipolar world order.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Chancellor Scholz's Visit and Growing Partnership&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Chancellor Scholz's visit to India is a significant milestone in the growing Indo-German partnership. His schedule included the Asia-Pacific Conference of German Businesses in Delhi, where he and Prime Minister Modi spoke to senior industry leaders from both countries. With bilateral commerce reaching a record high of Euro 30 billion in 2023 and strong German interest in India's technology and manufacturing sectors, this conference provided an opportunity to transform economic engagement into a long-term industrial collaboration. The visit further channelled the Green and Sustainable Partnership between India and Germany. Furthermore, the two countries began commemoration of the 25th anniversary of their strategic Partnership, providing an appropriate backdrop for Scholz's visit and demonstrating the maturity of the relationship. Scholz emphasized on contribution of the Indian diaspora in the growth of Germany and released India India-specific <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bmas.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/a798e-skilled-labour-strategy-india.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=1">Skilled Labour Strategy</a>.</p>

<p><strong>A New Realization in the West</strong></p>

<p>The release of two India-specific documents signals the post-Markel era in the India-German partnership. The tone and content of those two documents indicate a positive alignment towards India. The Scholz administration has appreciated the vitality of Indian democracy and desisted from lecturing India. Germany's strategic focus on India highlights three major themes underscoring India's rising global position. First, the changing geopolitical landscape has led Germany and the West to view India not just as an occasional ally but as a strategic partner with lasting influence. This shift is captured in Germany's recent "Focus on India" strategic document, signalling a transformation from episodic cooperation to a committed partnership. The document underlined India as a 'central and active shaper of international politics'. The West increasingly recognises India's ability to contribute strategically, reflecting a maturing relationship that is responsive, rather than reactionary, to shared global challenges. Like the United States' shift in its India policy post-1998, Germany's approach now highlights India's role as a reliable partner in areas such as economic resilience, technology, and sustainable development.</p>

<p>The Focus on India document's identification of India as a "stabilizer" in the Indo-Pacific underscores the second major theme: India's Anchor of Stability, both regionally and on broader global issues. With rising concerns about China's influence, Germany acknowledges India as essential to a free and open Indo-Pacific. Thus, recognizes the Indian commitment to safeguarding maritime security and upholding sovereignty. Chancellor Scholz's recent visit to the German frigate Baden-Wurttemberg in Goa further emphasized this stance, highlighting the alignment between Germany's Indo-Pacific vision and India's security priorities. As India and Germany strengthen their ties in the Indo-Pacific, their partnership is moving beyond transactional goals to shared principles of freedom and mutual respect for sovereignty. This reflects the fundamental shift in Germany's perspective concerning the Indo-Pacific. In 2020, the German government's <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/blob/2380514/f9784f7e3b3fa1bd7c5446d274a4169e/200901-indo-pazifik-leitlinien--1--data.pdf">Indo-Pacific policy guidelines </a>have referred to India as 'another Indo-Pacific partner'.</p>

<p>Finally, India's unique positioning as a pragmatic and reliable bridge in complex conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, is gaining international recognition. Unlike other major powers, India maintains open diplomatic channels with all stakeholders in the conflict, including the U.S., Germany, Russia, and Ukraine. The recently concluded BRICS plus summit in Kazan in Russia signalled India holds the best geopolitical position globally. Germany's acceptance of India's neutral stance highlights an understanding that independence in decision-making and focus on long-term relationships shape Indian foreign policy. Unlike China, whose interests often diverge from Western priorities, India promotes global stability without treating crises as mere transactions. This perception of India as a pragmatic yet empathetic bridge solidifies its credibility on the world stage and demonstrates its value in navigating geopolitical conflicts with sensitivity and reliability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Together, these themes reveal a fundamental shift: Germany and the West are moving from viewing India as a regional ally to recognizing it as a strategic partner with a stabilizing and mediating influence essential to today's multipolar world.</p>

<p><strong>Limitations and Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Germany's "Focus on India" policy marks a shift from a distant, episodic relationship with New Delhi to a steady, strategic collaboration grounded in mutual respect for sovereignty and values. However, while Germany acknowledges India's significance, the policy's cover-where Kashmir is subtly obscured on the map-hints at lingering sensitivities. Besides, the Focus on India document refers to the so-called "Global South" on three occasions. In the West, this term is often viewed dismissively. In contrast, New Delhi and over 100 capitals worldwide identify with it proudly. The disdainful tone concerning the term underlines the need for jointly traversing along the road of partnership.</p>

<p>Yet, this evolution reflects Germany's move from a Eurocentric approach to a realistic embrace of global multipolarity. By viewing India as a true partner, not merely a regional ally, Germany aligns itself with the emerging world order. This alliance offers both nations a historic opportunity to address shared challenges, drive economic growth, and enhance stability amid global shifts.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Li became catatonic and stopped eating, drinking, moving, or engaging in conversation.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A young Chinese woman, Li, from Henan province, suffered a severe psychological breakdown after being scolded by her supervisor at work. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3283564/chinese-woman-scolded-work-stops-eating-needs-reminders-use-toilet?module=latest&amp;pgtype=homepage">South China Morning Post</a></em>, Li became catatonic and stopped eating, drinking, moving, or engaging in conversation. This disturbing incident began a month prior when her team leader reprimanded her, leaving her unhappy and ultimately leading to a complete emotional and physical shutdown.</p>

<p>As Li's condition continued to deteriorate, her physical abilities also severely declined. Her family reported that if they removed the pillow from beneath her head, it would hang limply in mid-air, unable to support itself. Furthermore, she lost control over basic bodily functions, requiring constant assistance from her loved ones to remind her to use the toilet.</p>

<p>Dr. Jia Dehuan, Li's physician at Zhengzhou Eighth People's Hospital, described her condition as resembling a "wooden" figure, devoid of movement or responsiveness. According to Dr. Jia, Li was suffering from a catatonic stupor, a severe symptom of depression characterized by immobilisation, unresponsiveness, loss of motor control, and withdrawal from reality. This rare and extreme manifestation of depression is often triggered by intense emotional trauma or stress.</p>

<p>The doctor noted that&nbsp;Li had an introverted personality and struggled to open up to those around her, which ultimately contributed to her more severe condition. Under Dr. Jia's care, Li received the necessary treatment and support to recover from this critical condition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The disturbing incident has sparked widespread concern and debate on mainland Chinese social media. Users expressed shock and sympathy for Li's ordeal and outrage over workplace bullying and stress.&nbsp;One user wrote, ''If your job is too demanding, it's better to leave rather than suffer in silence.''</p>

<p>Another commented, ''She had been torturing herself due to her boss's actions.''</p>

<p>A recent survey by the Chinese Psychological Society shed light on the alarming state of workplace mental health in China. The findings revealed that 4.8% of employees experienced workplace depression, while 80% reported feelings of agitation at work. Additionally, 60% of respondents cited anxiety, and nearly 40% exhibited symptoms of depression, according to Shangguan News (2023).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The survey's results highlight the pressing issue of workplace mental health in China, where high work demands, limited job security, poor work-life balance, and inadequate communication contribute to the problem.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On November 5, Americans will cast their votes not only for the presidency but also for 34 Senate seats, all 435 House seats, 11 governorships and thousands of state legislative positions. Among the new contenders is Ashwin Ramaswami, a young Indian American Democrat challenging Republican Senator Shawn Still in Georgia's Senate District 48, a traditionally conservative seat.</p>

<p><strong>Who is Ashwin Ramaswami?</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li aria-level="1">Ashwin Ramaswami was born to Indian immigrant parents from Tamil Nadu and grew up in Johns Creek. He is running for the Georgia State Senate in District 48, and just meets the minimum age requirement of 25, turning that age in May 2024.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Ashwin Ramaswami studied Computer Science at Stanford University and then pursued a law degree at Georgetown University, as per his election <a href="https://ashwinforgeorgia.com/ " rel="nofollow,noindex">campaign website</a>.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">He has a strong background in cybersecurity, having <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashwin-r/ " rel="nofollow,noindex">worked with CISA</a>, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, where he helped secure local election systems from cyberattacks, and Schmidt Futures, where he conducted research on securing open-source software, which contributed to a bill in Congress. He decided to quit his job at CISA after three years to run for office after realising that the greater threat to democracy lies not just in cyberattacks but in political misinformation surrounding election integrity, reported <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna144294 " rel="nofollow,noindex">NBC News</a>.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">During his studies, he taught classes on Hindu philosophy and raised $100,000 for Dharmic programmes at Georgetown, supporting students of various faiths, including Hindu, Sikh, Jain and Buddhist.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Ashwin Ramaswami's campaign promises election security and integrity, positioning him against Shawn Still's alleged 2020 election-related activities. Shawn Still was one of the fake electors who participated in the Donald Trump fake electors plot, which aimed to award Georgia's electoral votes to Donald Trump despite him losing the state to Joe Biden. Mr Ramaswami's campaign has raised more than $700,000 in funding, which is considered a significant amount for a first-time candidate.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has claimed that Google CEO Sundar Pichai called him to compliment his recent visit to McDonald's.&nbsp;“I did McDonald's last week and I actually got a call from Sundar (Pichai),” Donald Trump said during an appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast. “He said, ‘This is the biggest thing we've had in years.'”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump continued, “Sundar, who's a great guy by the way, said, ‘This McDonald's thing, I want to tell you, it's one of the biggest things we've ever had on Google. It just hit.'”</p>

He quipped that he had now worked “15 minutes more than her” at the fast-food chain, referring to her previous comments about her own experience working there when she was young.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“She lied about McDonald's,” Trump declared. “I've worked here for 15 minutes, which is 15 minutes more than she worked here. Has that proven that she never worked at McDonald's? Well, McDonald's has no information. No, she has no information. She's nobody. The manager said she'd never worked there,” he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This comes after Trump alleged that Google obscured results for people attempting to find information about him. He has previously said that he reached out to CEO Sundar Pichai to voice his complaints regarding the perceived bias in search results.</p>

<p>At an event organised by the <a href="http://https://www.newsweek.com/trump-called-google-ceo-couldnt-find-good-stories-about-himself-1969781 " rel="nofollow,noindex">Economic Club of Chicago</a> on October 15, Trump told John Micklethwait, editor-in-chief of Bloomberg News, that he had recently contacted the “head of Google” to voice his concerns over the search results associated with his name.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I'm getting a lot of good stories lately, but you don't find them in Google,” Trump said he told Pichai. “I think it's a whole rigged deal. I think Google's rigged just like our government is rigged.” “They only have bad stories. In other words, if I have 20 good stories and 20 bad stories, and everyone's entitled to that, you'll only see the 20 bad stories,” he told Micklethwait.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rescuers in the Philippines were diving into a lake and scouring isolated villages on Sunday to locate dozens of missing people as the death count from Tropical Storm Trami hit 100.</p>

<p>Trami, which rammed into the Philippines on October 24, was among the deadliest storms to hit the Southeast Asian country this year.</p>

<p>According to the national disaster agency, it forced more than half a million people to flee their homes and at least 36 people remain missing.</p>

<p>Police in the hardest-hit Bicol region have recorded 38 deaths, most due to drowning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are still receiving many calls and we are trying to save as many people as we can," Bicol regional police director Andre Dizon told AFP.</p>

<p>"Hopefully, there will be no more deaths."</p>

<p>Dizon added that "many residents" in the region's Camarines Sur province are still trapped on roofs and the upper floors of their homes. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The death count in Batangas, south of Manila, has risen to 55, provincial police chief Jacinto Malinao told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two were reported dead in separate incidents of electrocution and drowning in Cavite province, police said.</p>

<p>Five more bodies were recovered in other provinces, bringing the total to 100, according to an AFP tally based on official police and disaster agency sources.</p>

<p>"A higher death toll is possible in the coming days since rescuers can now reach previously isolated places," Edgar Posadas of the Civil Defence Office told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The police, coast guards and a Marines diving team were searching on Sunday for a family of seven at Taal Lake in Batangas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The waters from the mountains hit their home in Balete town, causing it to be swept away with them possibly inside," Malinao, the provincial police chief, said.</p>

<p>Most of the deaths in Batangas have been attributed to rain-induced landslides.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More than 20 bodies were pulled from heaps of mud, boulders and fallen trees, while police said at least another 20 people in the province are still missing.</p>

<p>"We will continue searching until all bodies are retrieved," Malinao said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The national disaster agency said Sunday that about 560,000 people had been displaced by floods, which submerged hundreds of villages in swaths of the northern Philippines.</p>

<p>About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the archipelago nation or its surrounding waters each year, damaging homes and infrastructure and killing dozens of people.</p>

<p>A recent study showed that storms in the Asia-Pacific region are increasingly forming closer to coastlines, intensifying more rapidly and lasting longer over land due to climate change.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Nima Rinji Sherpa became the youngest climber to reach all 14 of the world’s tallest mountains, known as the “eight-thousanders.”]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At just 18 years old, Nepal's Nima Rinji Sherpa has achieved a milestone few have accomplished, becoming the youngest climber to reach all 14 of the world's tallest mountains, known as the "eight-thousanders." Mr Rinji's journey culminated on October 9 with the summit of Shishapangma, Nepal's 8,027-metre peak, alongside climbing partner Pasang Nurbu Sherpa.</p>

<p>Reflecting on his latest feat, Mr Rinji described reaching the summit as "pure joy." His passion, he said, is inspired by his family, a lineage of accomplished mountaineers, including his father, Tashi Lakpa Sherpa, and uncle, Mingma Sherpa, both renowned in Nepal's climbing community.</p>

<p>"My uncles and my father... came from a very small village. To even dream about being this successful, for them it was really hard," he told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/26/travel/nima-rinji-sherpa-mountaineering-legacy-intl-hnk/index.html">CNN</a>. "I have the privilege that they didn't have."</p>

<p>Mr Rinji's next goal is equally daring: a winter ascent of Manaslu without supplemental oxygen or fixed ropes, in collaboration with Italian climber Simone Moro. "That means we're climbing an 8,000-metre mountain in winter... there is no support for us. So, it's like pure human endurance," he said. "It has never been done in the history of mountaineering."</p>

<p>This recent accomplishment did not attract major sponsors; he relied on his father's 14 Peaks Expedition for funding. Despite the lack of support, he remains hopeful about inspiring young Sherpa climbers. "Hopefully I become the face of a big brand," he said, adding that he hopes to redefine the perception of Sherpa climbers as "support staff" only.</p>

<p>Over the past two years, Mr Rinji has tackled Everest, K2, and five peaks in less than five weeks. Among his climbs, Annapurna remains a personal favourite. "For a teenager of 17 years to do something without using oxygen, you know, normally it's not recommended," he said, recalling the challenges he faced.</p>

<p>Summiting the eight-thousanders requires navigating the perilous "death zone," where oxygen levels are critically low and temperatures are extreme. Nima Rinji noted the harsh reality of life at such altitudes: "Your body starts to shut down... Maybe I like suffering," he joked.</p>

<p>Mr Rinji envisions a sustainable future for Nepal's mountaineering industry and hopes his achievements will inspire a new generation of Nepali climbers. "Hopefully, the younger generation... we will try to mobilise this industry and make it more sustainable for the upcoming generations," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1992, the Israeli embassy in Argentina's capital Buenos Aires was bombed, killing 29 and injuring over 240. Two years later, a Jewish community centre in the capital was bombed, killing 86 and injuring over 300. Now over three decades later, the alleged mastermind behind the attacks has been identified as Hussein Ahmad Karaki, a notorious Hezbollah operative.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Long known to law enforcement as a shadowy figure operating under numerous aliases, Karaki has evaded capture for decades, thanks in part to an extensive network and forged documentation allegedly supplied by Venezuela.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Saturday, Argentina's Defence Minister Patricia Bullrich shared new details about Karaki's alleged role as the head of Hezbollah operations in Latin America. According to Ms Bullrich, Karaki was not only responsible for the planning and execution of the two infamous Argentine bombings but also remains active in the region, with evidence linking him to a series of thwarted terrorist attempts across Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

— Patricia Bullrich (@PatoBullrich) <a href="https://twitter.com/PatoBullrich/status/1849919369158996055?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Karaki was responsible for overseeing the logistics behind the 1992 and 1994 attacks in Argentina, Ms Bullrich said, adding that he was operating under the alias "David Assi." "We want the Argentine people to know the identity of the person responsible for these heinous acts," she stated. Bullrich further described Karaki as a "ghost," one who has effectively evaded detection for years, thanks to sophisticated tactics.</p>

<p>Ms Bullrich alleged Hezbollah's growing relationship with Brazilian cartels, notably Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC) and Comando Vermelho, both known for controlling vast swathes of Brazil's drug trade.</p>

<p>According to Ms Bullrich, Hezbollah has transformed these cartels into hybrid narco-terrorist entities, with PCC's illicit earnings reportedly funnelled to fund Hezbollah's arsenal and attacks against Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The relationship reportedly extends to a vast drug-smuggling operation: PCC drug boats cross the mid-Atlantic, where they rendezvous with vessels linked to the Calabrian or Balkan mafia. South American cocaine is traded for Lebanese hashish, and the boats return to their respective ports to complete the cycle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The attacks on the Israeli Embassy and the Jewish community centre have long been suspected of having Iranian backing. Recent rulings by Argentina's judiciary further implicate Iran's role in planning, financing, and supporting Hezbollah's operations in Argentina.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-12/ck3em2f8_saudi-arabia-restaurant-reuters_625x300_09_December_19.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Saudi Arabia is changing. You have to see it to believe it. The Saudi Arabia with strict gender segregation, tough Islamic laws, and dress codes, no longer exists. It's a new country that is open, just, welcoming and rising. With Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman's Vision 2023 as its compass, the kingdom is making great strides and is dropping the shackles of the past, very fast. Roam around Riyadh, the capital, and you see it buzzing with young and aspirational Saudis making the most of the newfound freedoms and opportunities. According to the 2022 census, 63% of Saudis are under the age of 30. And the regime's policy changes are guided with this key statistic in mind. The biggest beneficiaries of the new openness are the Saudi women, who never had it so good.</p>

<h2><strong>Women-Led Transformation</strong></h2>

<p>The Kingdom's inclusive Vision 2030 aims to diversify and strengthen the nation's economy. According to a World Bank report, Saudi Arabia is now ranked at the top in terms of economic and social progress for women out of 190 economies. The country's women are now truly in the driver's seat. The lifting of restrictions on their movement and choices has meant that Saudi women are steering the social, cultural and economic transformation of their country. Till a few years ago, they had to look to their fathers, husbands and brothers for even the basics like permission to travel or work.</p>

<p>With Vision 2030, female workforce participation has gone up to nearly 40% now compared to about 15% a few years ago. This progress is evident in the increasing number of women receiving advanced degrees, enrolling in STEM fields, and owning 40% of small and medium-sized startups. Right from the moment you land in Riyadh, you see women taking up key jobs. From immigration counters to shopping malls to government offices, Saudi women are everywhere. I saw women making presentations at key government events, doing camera work, running stalls at local markets. The presence of women in the workforce has also meant increased intermingling of genders and rewriting of many social norms and gender behaviours.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Saudi For All</strong></h2>

<p>A big focus of Vision 2030 is also the cultural and social integration of all those living and working in Saudi Arabia. The Media Ministry's Global Harmony project is aimed at enhancing understanding and collaborations between diverse groups that call Saudi home. According to the Saudi Deputy Minister of Media, Dr Khaled Bin Abdulqader al Ghamdi, the Global Harmony project aims to make expats feel more at home. But more than that, it aspires to make local Saudis understand better the various communities that live among them. So, during the Riyadh Season, which starts in September and continues till February-March, you see a host of public cultural and social events to bring communities together. &nbsp;It's a true celebration and appreciation of diversity.</p>

<h2><strong>Indians Are Special And Loved</strong></h2>

<p>Even among the expats, special attention is on Indians, who are the largest expat group in Saudi Arabia. At present, 2.6 million Indians live in the Kingdom, working in the domestic sector as well as private jobs, and running both start-ups as well as big companies. Recognising the role of India, Dr Khaled calls the community “an integral part of the Saudi story”. This year, the Media Ministry dedicated the Suwaidi Park festival exclusively to India. The 10-day festival saw a celebration of Indian culture, food, music and art. People from all communities streamed into the vast Suwaidi Park to savour a slice of India. The Global Harmony project attempts to present Saudi as an inclusive and harmonious society where people from all backgrounds live and celebrate their own cultures, traditions and festivals. And, it's not some civil society gig. It's a government policy initiative with clear objectives and plans. That makes it an attempt worth emulating for many countries that are facing social fissures due to their diversity.</p>

<h2><strong>Looking Back To The Future</strong></h2>

<p>As Saudi strides into modernity, it is also conscious of its history and heritage. It's encouraging studies and excavations at heritage sites, such as at al Ula, and is promoting its pre-Islamic history too. Nouf Marwaai, a yoga instructor and also a consultant with the Saudi government, gave us a presentation on the historical and social similarities between India and Saudi Arabia. In her talk, she went back to 6000 BCE to trace the Almagar Civilisation.</p>

<p>Clearly, the new Saudi Arabia projects itself as an old civilisation, and not just as a society defined by the advent of Islam 1,400 years ago. That is now portrayed as only an important event, not the sole marker of the civilisational identity. The Kingdom is also promoting its historical sites. The Diriyah town, just outside Riyadh, is one such heritage site that has a UNESCO tag. It was the home of the Saudi royal family and also served as the capital of the Emirate of Diriyah under the first Saudi dynasty from 1744 to 1818. Today, Diriyah is one of the foremost cultural hubs and the centre of many sports and adventure activities in the Kingdom. Even so, its historical character has been maintained all along. On the one hand, you have mega infrastructural projects, new businesses and modern wave sweeping Saudi, and on the other, there is a renewed focus on its over 1,400-year-old history.</p>

<h2><strong>Music Connects</strong></h2>

<p>Coming back to the India connect: wherever there are Indians, there is music. Indian film music has been a great brand ambassador and unifier across the world. Saudi Arabia is no different. My local support, Abdulwahab al Ghamdi, a young, peppy guy in his late 20s, played Hindi songs for me in the car while we drove around Riyadh. He told me that he and his friends dance to Punjabi numbers at their parties. And how he loved Shah Rukh Khan and Indian film music. He also showed me a video of a Saudi artist singing a popular Hindi film song at a Saudi talent show.</p>

<p>The new Saudi Arabia is truly a surprise, and a pleasant one.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan voted on Sunday in its tightest election in years, with new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and his juggernaut Liberal Democratic Party facing potentially their worst result since 2009.</p>

<p>Opinion surveys suggest the conservative LDP and its junior coalition partner risk falling short of a majority, a result that could deal a knockout blow to Ishiba.</p>

<p>The 67-year-old former defence minister took office and called a snap election after being narrowly selected last month to lead the LDP, which has governed Japan for almost all of the past seven decades.</p>

<p>But voters in the world's fourth-largest economy have been rankled by rising prices and the fallout from a party slush fund scandal that helped sink previous premier Fumio Kishida.</p>

<p>"I made my decision first and foremost by looking at their economic policies and measures to ease inflation," Tokyo voter Yoshihiro Uchida, 48, told AFP on Sunday. "I voted for people who are likely to make our lives better."</p>

<p>Ishiba has pledged to revitalise depressed rural regions and to address the "quiet emergency" of Japan's falling population through family-friendly measures such as flexible working hours.</p>

<p>But he has rowed back his position on issues including allowing married couples to take separate surnames. He also named only two women ministers in his cabinet.</p>

<p>The self-confessed security policy "geek" has backed the creation of a regional military alliance along the lines of NATO to counter China, although he has cautioned it would "not happen overnight".</p>

<p>Several polls by Japanese media have found that the LDP and its coalition partner Komeito might struggle to get the 233 lower house seats needed for a majority.</p>

<p>Ishiba has set this threshold as his objective, and missing it would undermine his position in the LDP and mean finding other coalition partners or leading a minority government.</p>

<p>"We want to start afresh as a fair, just and sincere party, and seek your mandate," Ishiba said at a rally on Saturday.</p>

<h3><strong>'Alternative' to LDP</strong></h3>

<p>Local media speculated that Ishiba could potentially even resign immediately to take responsibility, becoming Japan's shortest-serving prime minister in the post-war period.</p>

<p>The current record is held by Naruhiko Higashikuni who served for 54 days -- four days more than British leader Liz Truss in 2022 -- just after Japan's 1945 defeat in World War II.</p>

<p>In many districts, LDP candidates are neck-and-neck with those from the Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP), the second-biggest in parliament, led by popular former prime minister Yoshihiko Noda.</p>

<p>"The LDP's politics is all about quickly implementing policies for those who give them loads of cash," 67-year-old Noda told his supporters on Saturday.</p>

<p>"But those in vulnerable positions... have been ignored," he added, accusing the government of offering insufficient support for survivors of an earthquake in central Japan.</p>

<p>Noda's stance "is sort of similar to the LDP's. He is basically a conservative," Masato Kamikubo, a political scientist at Ritsumeikan University, told AFP.</p>

<p>"The CDP or Noda can be an alternative to the LDP. Many voters think so," Kamikubo said.</p>

<p>Ishiba has promised not to actively support the candidates running in the election despite being caught up in the funding scandal.</p>

<p>"I want to focus on young candidates rather than those who have had a long career, because they may bring something different," said a 63-year-old voter who gave her surname as Taniyama, adding she had "made my decision by elimination".</p>

<p>Mitsuyuki Ikezoe, 86, said he had voted for the LDP because he was "worried North Korea or Russia may invade Hokkaido" in northern Japan.</p>

<p>But "Ishiba may be treated dismissively by the United States because he is new", and if Donald Trump becomes president again, "he will not give Ishiba the time of day," Ikezoe said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shot in her hand and neck as her brother went on a shooting spree, an 11-year-old girl in Washington escape death by playing dead as he inspected the bodies of their family members.</p>

<p>The mass shooting left five members of a Washington state family dead early Monday morning.</p>

<p>The 15-year-old brother, charged with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder, allegedly targeted their family in a sequence of violent events. According to the girl's testimony, she woke up to gunshots and discovered a nightmarish scene. She saw her father&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/15-year-old-charged-with-murder-of-parents-3-siblings-at-2-million-us-home-6868770">Mark Humiston</a>&nbsp;and her nine-year-old brother bloody and lifeless in the hallway. Her seven-year-old sister, who walked out of their shared bedroom, was shot moments later, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/25/us/fall-city-washington-shooting-murders/index.html " rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN</a> reported.</p>

<p>Despite her injuries, the girl told investigators she recognised both the shooter – her older brother – and the weapon, a silver Glock handgun that belonged to their father. Court documents said that the girl, wounded in her neck and hand, pretended to be dead as her brother examined the bodies. When he eventually left the room, she escaped through a fire window and ran to a nearby house, where neighbours dialled 911 shortly after 5 am.</p>

<p>Minutes earlier, the 15-year-old had made his own 911 call, claiming he was hiding in a bathroom and alleging his 13-year-old brother had committed the shooting before taking his own life. He suggested that his younger brother's recent trouble over online content might have driven the incident.</p>

<p>Prosecutors are pushing to transfer the case to adult court, where he could face a life sentence if convicted. His attorney, Amy Parker, reminded the public that “these are not proven facts, merely allegations,” noting, “the law presumes our client is innocent of these charges.”</p>

<p>Court documents reveal that investigators believe the accused “systematically” killed his parents, two brothers and sister, then staged the crime scene before first responders arrived. The 11-year-old survivor reportedly indicated that he was the only sibling who knew the lockbox combination for their father's firearm.</p>

<p>Following medical treatment, the girl has been discharged and is now in the care of a family member, while her brother remains in custody under a court order, barring him from contacting his surviving sister.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Commercial satellite imagery showed that Israeli airstrikes hit buildings during an attack on Saturday that Iran used for mixing solid fuel for ballistic missiles.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Commercial satellite imagery showed that Israeli airstrikes hit buildings during an attack on Saturday that Iran used for mixing solid fuel for ballistic missiles, according to separate assessments by two American researchers.</p>

<p>The judgments were reached by David Albright, a former UN weapons inspector who heads the Institute for Science and International Security research group, and Decker Eveleth, an associate research analyst at CNA, a Washington think tank.</p>

<p>They told Reuters separately that Israel struck Parchin, a massive military complex near Tehran. Israel also hit Khojir, according to Eveleth, a sprawling missile production site near Tehran.</p>

<p>Reuters reported in July that Khojir was undergoing massive expansion.</p>

<p>Eveleth said the Israeli strikes may have "significantly hampered Iran's ability to mass produce missiles."</p>

<p>The Israeli military said three waves of Israeli jets struck missile factories and other sites near Tehran and in western Iran early on Saturday in retaliation for Tehran's October 1 barrage of more than 200 missiles against Israel.</p>

<p>Iran's military said the Israeli warplanes used "very light warheads" to strike border radar systems in the provinces of Ilam, Khuzestan and around Tehran.</p>

<p>Eveleth said that an image from Planet Labs, a commercial satellite firm, showed that an Israeli strike destroyed two buildings in Khojir where solid fuel for ballistic missiles was mixed.</p>

<p>The buildings were enclosed by high dirt berms, according to the image reviewed by Reuters. Such structures are associated with missile production and are designed to stop a blast in one building from detonating combustible materials in nearby structures.</p>

<p>Planet Labs imagery of Parchin showed that Israel destroyed three ballistic missile solid fuel mixing buildings and a warehouse, he said.</p>

<p>Albright said he reviewed low-resolution commercial satellite imagery of Parchin that appeared to show that an Israeli strike damaged three buildings, including two in which solid fuel for ballistic missiles was mixed.</p>

<p>He did not identify the commercial firm from which he obtained the images.</p>

<p>The buildings, he said, are located about 350 yards from a facility once involved in what the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and US intelligence say was a comprehensive nuclear weapons development program that Iran shuttered in 2003. Iran denies having such a program.</p>

<p>"Israel says they targeted buildings housing solid-fuel mixers," Eveleth said. "These industrial mixers are hard to make and export-controlled. Iran imported many over the years at great expense, and will likely have a hard time replacing them."</p>

<p>With a limited operation, he said, Israel may have struck a significant blow against Iran's ability to mass-produce missiles and made it more difficult for any future Iranian missile attack to pierce Israel's missile defenses.</p>

<p>"The strikes appear to be highly accurate," he said.</p>

<p>Iran has the Middle East's largest missile arsenal and supplied missiles to Russia for use against Ukraine, and to Yemen's Houthi rebels and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, according to US officials.</p>

<p>Tehran and Moscow deny that Russia has received Iranian missiles.</p>

<p>Planet Labs imagery reviewed earlier this year by Eveleth and Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey showed major expansions at Khojir and the Modarres military complex near Tehran that the pair assessed were for boosting missile production, Reuters reported.</p>

<p>Three senior Iranian officials confirmed that conclusion.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Young blue-collar workers are being courted in a tight US presidential election that is forcing voters to weigh competing claims on immigration, inflation and other hot-button issues.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Young blue-collar workers like Luke Gonzalez are being courted in a tight US presidential election that is forcing voters to weigh competing claims on immigration, inflation and other hot-button issues.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Gonzalez, a 25 year-old glazier, sat through an 80-minute presentation at his Warren, Michigan union hall where labor leaders pressed the case that Kamala Harris was better for workers than Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Gonzalez, who is undecided, is a member of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT), one of several leading unions backing Harris due in part to industrial policy under the Biden-Harris administration expected to sustain building-trades employment for years.</p>

<p>Democrats also back collective-bargaining rights, in contrast to Trump who joked recently with billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk about firing striking workers.</p>

<p>But Trump's unconventional style has enjoyed lasting appeal with a sizeable number of blue-collar workers, who can be more conservative culturally -- that has helped keep the race tight in Michigan and other swing states with large working-class populations.</p>

<p>Trump supporters include Isaiah Goddard, 24, who is part of a group of insurgent United Auto Workers members who back Trump.</p>

<p>Trump "is not a politician," he said. "He knows how to run the country and he can do it again."</p>

<p>Goddard, who works at Ford, doesn't believe Harris' support for electric vehicles will be good for Michigan.</p>

<p>He also endorses Trump's stance on abortion and immigration, saying "these illegal immigrants are going to be taking American jobs."</p>

<p>Nick Nabozny, another Ford worker, sold 32 red "Auto Workers for Trump" t-shirts at his Wayne, Michigan plants this week.</p>

<p>"There's more people in the union that support Trump than they truly believe," Nabozny said of the UAW. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Turned off by politicians</strong></h3>

<p>Trump in 2016 became the first Republican candidate since Ronald Reagan to cut significantly into the Democratic lead among union households.</p>

<p>Besides immigration, Trump in 2016 blasted international trade deals that led to industrial job loss in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Biden won back enough of these voters in 2020 to flip those states, although this year's race is neck-and-neck.</p>

<p>Democratic pollster David Mermin expects a big gender gap, with working-class women supporting Harris based in part over abortion rights.</p>

<p>Young voters are the most "persuadable" part of the working-class population, said Mermin, who works at Lake Research Partners. "They don't like the parties. They don't like politicians."</p>

<p>They "are the ones you can influence, they're learning still," said Jeff Tricoff, 39, a refinery worker at the Teamsters union in Detroit who is undecided.</p>

<p>Lucas Hartwell, 22, a labor organizer with the Operating Engineers union who backs Harris tells peers to "vote your interests, even if the social issues don't match up for you."</p>

<h3><strong>Debating immigration</strong></h3>

<p>While the national Teamsters union made no endorsement, other prominent unions such as IUPAT and the UAW are campaigning hard for the Democrat, distributing lawn signs, phone banking and canvassing door to door.</p>

<p>IUPAT president Jimmy Williams attributes the Democratic Party's slippage to decades of failures to deliver.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Williams, a fourth-generation member of his union who became a glazier after high school, considers Biden to be a turning point because the outgoing president became the first to join a strikers' picket line, and because of big legislative successes.</p>

<p>At the Warren event, Williams described to apprentices that Trump talked about infrastructure, but didn't get anything done, adding that Harris will continue Biden's ambitious initiatives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But when Williams polled the audience of around 30, about a third raised their hands for Trump. Inflation, cost of living," explained one bearded young worker.</p>

<p>Williams acknowledged that costs are "going through the roof," as he blamed big business and described inflation as a global phenomenon due to supply chain problems.</p>

<p>Williams got more pushback on immigration, but he argued workers should aim their outrage at the businesses that exploit cheap labor.</p>

<p>"As a union, we just can't stand for that," Williams told the group. "The biggest tool that the bosses use to divide workers is race."</p>

<p>After the event, Robert Gonzalez, head of IUPAT's Michigan district, estimated the room as "50-50 split."</p>

<p>His son, Luke, was drawn to the idea that "Kamala is for the working union" in contrast to "big business" candidate Trump, before adding, "I still have a lot of reading up to do."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China will take "countermeasures" to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity, the government said, lambasting a $2 billion arms sale package by the United States to Taiwan.</p>

<p>The United States is bound by law to provide Chinese-claimed Taiwan with the means to defend itself despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties, to the constant anger of Beijing.</p>

<p>On Friday, the Pentagon said the United States had approved a potential $2 billion arms sale package to Taiwan, including the delivery for the first time to the island of an advanced air defence missile system battle-tested in Ukraine.</p>

<p>In a statement late Saturday, China's foreign ministry said it strongly condemns and firmly opposes the sales and has lodged "solemn representations" with the United States.</p>

<p>China urges the United States to immediately stop arming Taiwan and stop its dangerous moves that undermine peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, it added.</p>

<p>"China will take resolute countermeasures and take all measures necessary to firmly defend national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity," the ministry said, without elaborating.</p>

<p>China has over the past five years stepped up its military activities around democratically governed Taiwan, whose government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, including staging a new round of war games earlier this month.</p>

<p>Taiwan's government has welcomed the new arms sale, the 17th of the Biden administration to the island.</p>

<p>"In the face of China's threats, Taiwan is duty-bound to protect its homeland, and will continue to demonstrate its determination to defend itself," Taiwan's foreign ministry said, responding to the arms sale.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Michelle Obama on Saturday aired her "genuine fear" that Donald Trump could retake the White House.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michelle Obama on Saturday aired her "genuine fear" that Donald Trump could retake the White House as the popular former first lady made a passionate appeal to voters in the desperately close US election.</p>

<p>Both Trump and Kamala Harris were in Michigan searching for holdout votes ahead of the November 5 election, with Harris focused on abortion rights and Trump returning to his anti-immigrant campaign theme.</p>

<p>Obama said Democratic candidate Harris would be an "extraordinary president of the United States" if elected in just 10 days.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But, with polls forecasting a virtual dead heat, she also spoke of a sense of frustration and anxiety that few on Harris's team dare express after she lost some momentum in recent weeks.</p>

<p>"My hope about Kamala is also accompanied by some genuine fear," Obama said, ripping into Trump's record and asking, "Why is this race even close?"</p>

<p>"I'm a little angry that we are indifferent to his erratic behavior, his obvious mental decline, his history as a convicted felon, a known slum lord, a predator found liable for sexual abuse."</p>

<p>Obama, appearing alongside Harris, hammered home the vice president's message that abortion rights -- and women's health care overall -- are at stake on the ballot.</p>

<p>"Please do not hand our fates over to the likes of Trump," Obama said, adding he could effectively ban abortion nationwide.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump on the attack</strong></h3>

<p>At his rally, Trump launched bitter personal attacks on Harris and accused her of pushing an "open border" migration policy.</p>

<p>"She's a dope," he said. "This person cannot be president."</p>

<p>"She will destroy our country. Everyone knows it. No one respects her. The United States is now occupied country. Kamala broke it, we will fix it."</p>

<p>With more than 38 million people already casting early ballots, Americans are deciding whether to elect the country's first-ever woman president, or its oldest commander in chief.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, still refuses to accept his defeat in the vote four years ago and is expected to reject the result if he loses again -- potentially pitching the United States into chaos.</p>

<p>Trump swept the three Blue Wall states -- Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania -- in his shock victory in 2016 only to see Joe Biden reclaim them four years later.</p>

<p>He hopes to claw back one or more of the trio, and win the so-called Sun Belt swing states to propel him back into power.</p>

<p>After his Michigan event, Trump headed straight to Pennsylvania for another rally on Saturday evening.</p>

<h3><strong>Abortion rights</strong></h3>

<p>Harris further highlighted abortion rights -- a weak point for Republicans -- by visiting a local doctor's office and meeting with physicians, staff and medical students.</p>

<p>"Because of Trump and what he did with the Supreme Court, we are looking at a health care crisis in America," she told reporters, referring to justices chosen by Trump who tipped the court into ending the national right to abortion in 2022.</p>

<p>The penultimate weekend before the vote began on Friday evening with Harris appearing alongside superstar Beyonce, and Trump giving a three-hour interview to Joe Rogan, America's most popular podcaster.</p>

<p>On Sunday Harris, 60, will campaign in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the largest city in the largest of the swing states likely to determine the election winner.</p>

<p>She will criss-cross the city, especially historically Black and Latino districts, trying to persuade uncommitted residents to cast their vote.</p>

<p>Trump will rally his supporters on Sunday evening in Madison Square Garden, the famous arena in the heart of heavily Democratic New York.</p>

<p>The brash billionaire and onetime reality television star appears keen to orchestrate a grand spectacle, and demonstrate he can fill an arena in a liberal bastion.</p>

<p>But critics, including Trump's 2016 rival Hillary Clinton, have noted that Madison Square Garden was also the scene of a 1939 pro-Nazi rally organized by a group supportive of Adolf Hitler.</p>

<p>Part of Harris's election strategy is to peel moderate Republicans away from Trump, who often demeans some Americans as the "enemy."</p>

<p>Harris told her supporters that as a prosecutor she "took on perpetrators of all kinds -- predators, fraudsters and repeat offenders. I took them on and I won.</p>

<p>"In 10 days, it's Donald Trump's turn."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk, a powerful critic of illegal immigrants and a staunch supporter of Donald Trump who has for years portrayed migrants as invaders and criminals, worked "illegally" in the United States during the start of his career, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/26/elon-musk-immigration-status/?fbclid=IwY2xjawGJ9X9leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHTxa8uBiCwmifkowiNsJ2E0SrB2EVxmPJA-P-gIo8JdXg-I39oXvIAsAkw_aem_1Jbv1FA3AMBanjGB1v0s7Q" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">reported</a> The Washington Post.</p>

<p>According to the report, Musk, whose origin is from South Africa, dropped out of Stanford University in 1995 to work on his debut company, Zip2 for four years before it sold for around 300 million dollars. During this time, he was working without correct authorization.</p>

<p>Two of Musk's former colleagues also said that Musk received his US work authorisation around 1997, the report said.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-vladimir-putin-in-secret-communications-since-2022-report-6877055">Musk</a>, being a foreign student in US, could not have dropped out of school to build a company as per the rules.</p>

<p>Overstaying a student visa is common in most cases, however, it still remains illegal, the Post said.</p>

<p>Despite this, Musk has always maintained that his time from turning into an entrepreneur from a student is a "legal grey area".</p>

<p>The report also cited a 2020 podcast in which Musk had said that he was legally in US but he was meant to be doing student work. "I was allowed to do work sort of supporting whatever," he said.</p>

<p>Several of the Tesla and SpaceX boss' recent posts on social media platforms have been on immigration and voter fraud, accusing White House nominee and Vice-President Kamala Harris of "importing voters" through illegal immigrants. Last week, he also compared the US-Mexico border - where several Mexican immigrants enter America - to a "zombie apocalypse".&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

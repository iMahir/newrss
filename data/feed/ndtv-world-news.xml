       <description><![CDATA[Kamala Harris on Friday attacked Republican rival Donald Trump and his party as "hypocrites" over abortion, as the first voters cast their ballots for November's knife-edge US election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris on Friday attacked Republican rival Donald Trump and his party as "hypocrites" over abortion, as the first voters cast their ballots for November's knife-edge US election.</p>

<p>The Democrat unleashed one of the most forceful speeches of her campaign so far as she blamed Trump for an abortion ban in the battleground state of Georgia that she said had caused the deaths of two women.</p>

<p>"And these hypocrites want to start talking about how this is in the best interest of women and children," the vice president told a rally in Atlanta, Georgia to cheers from a mainly female audience.</p>

<p>"Well, where have you been? Where have you been when it comes to taking care of the women and children of America, where have you been? How dare they."</p>

<p>Since replacing President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket two months ago, Harris has repeatedly focused on what she calls "Trump abortion bans."</p>

<p>Trump has frequently bragged on the campaign trail that his three Supreme Court picks paved the way for the 2022 overturning of the national right to abortion.</p>

<p>At least 20 states have since brought in full or partial restrictions, with Georgia banning most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.</p>

<p>Harris led the crowd in chanting the name of Amber Nicole Thurman, a 28-year-old mother-of-one from Georgia who developed a rare complication from abortion pills and died during emergency surgery in 2022.</p>

<p>An official state committee blamed the fatal outcome on a "preventable" lag in performing a critical procedure.</p>

<p>"We will make sure Amber is not just remembered as a statistic," said Harris, who met Thurman's family during a campaign event hosted by chat show star Oprah Winfrey on Thursday.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Excited' -</strong></p>

<p>Harris's abortion speech came as three US states -- Virginia, Minnesota and South Dakota -- began early voting 46 days before election day in what is an agonizingly close race.</p>

<p>Former president Trump has previously cast doubt on early voting and mail voting to back his false claims that he won the 2020 election against Biden.</p>

<p>Most US states permit in-person voting or mail-in voting to allow people to deal with scheduling conflicts or an inability to cast their ballots on election day itself on November 5.</p>

<p>Dozens of people waited at a polling station in the center of Arlington, Virginia, just outside the capital Washington.</p>

<p>A number had "Harris-Walz" shirts, while there were also some "Trump-Vance" signs in front of the building.</p>

<p>"I'm excited," said Michelle Kilkenny, 55, adding that voting early, "especially on day one, helps the campaign and raises the enthusiasm level."</p>

<p>Ann Spiker, 71, told AFP she usually cast her ballot by mail "but I'm going to vote today because it's so exciting."</p>

<p>The Democratic supporter added: "I can't believe we can pick Donald Trump, when I think about it I become very worried. That's why we're out and doing what we can."</p>

<p>Trump, 78, faces criminal charges for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 result, after which his supporters assaulted the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.</p>

<p>- 'Abhorrent' -</p>

<p>Every vote will count in the race, whose result Trump has once again refused to say he will accept.</p>

<p>Harris, 59, has erased Trump's lead since sensationally replacing President Biden as Democratic candidate in July, but remains neck-and-neck with the Republican.</p>

<p>The result is expected to hinge on just seven crucial swing states, including Georgia.</p>

<p>Trump however sought to lay the blame for any potential loss at the door of Jewish American voters, sparking outrage on Friday.</p>

<p>"If I don't win this election... in my opinion the Jewish people would have a lot to do with a loss," Trump told an anti-Semitism event on Thursday, repeating his grievance that Jewish voters have historically leaned towards the Democrats.</p>

<p>The White House slammed his comments.</p>

<p>"It is abhorrent to traffic in dangerous tropes or engage in scapegoating at any time -- let alone now, when all leaders have an obligation to fight back against the tragic worldwide rise in anti-Semitism," White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations on Friday denounced the detonation of hand-held communication devices used by Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon this week, saying the attack violated international law and could constitute a war crime.</p>

<p>"International humanitarian law prohibits the use of booby-trap devices in the form of apparently harmless portable objects," the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, told the Security Council, adding that it "is a war crime to commit violence intended to spread terror among civilians."</p>

<p>The blasts that killed at least 37 people and wounded nearly 3,000 over two days targeted communication devices used by the Iran-backed Hezbollah group.</p>

<p>Pagers and walkie-talkies exploded as their users were shopping in supermarkets, walking on streets and attending funerals, plunging the country into panic.</p>

<p>Hezbollah blamed Israel for the blasts.</p>

<p>"I am appalled by the breadth and impact of the attacks," said Turk.</p>

<p>"These attacks represent a new development in warfare, where communication tools become weapons," he added.</p>

<p>"This cannot be the new normal."</p>

<p>Israel has not commented on the operation but has said it will widen the scope of its war in Gaza to include the Lebanon front.</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters on Friday, Israel's ambassador to the UN refused to comment on the device blasts.</p>

<p>"But I can tell you that we will do everything we can to target those terrorists," Danny Danon said.</p>

<p>He spoke after Israel announced it had killed the commander of Hezbollah's elite unit in a strike on Beirut on Friday.</p>

<p>"We have no intention to enter a war with Hezbollah in Lebanon, but we cannot continue the way it is," Danon said, noting that Israel prefers a diplomatic solution and wants to "prevent" further escalation.</p>

<p>Iran-backed Hezbollah is an ally of Palestinian militant group Hamas, which has been fighting a war in Gaza since its October 7 attack on Israel.</p>

<p>For nearly a year, the focus of Israel's firepower has been on Gaza but its troops have also been engaged in near-daily clashes with Hezbollah militants along its northern border.</p>

<p>Hundreds have been killed in Lebanon, most of them fighters, and dozens in Israel, including soldiers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A day before Sri Lanka votes for the next President, Ranil Wickremesinghe, who currently occupies the post spoke to NDTV. During the interview, he spoke about his country's special bond with India and how he aims to strengthen ties, if re-elected.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>"India and Sri Lanka have to have a close economic relationship. The vision statement that Prime Minister Modi and I had issued mentions this," Mr Wickremesinghe, who is seeking another term as President, told NDTV.</li>
	<li>Speaking further about areas of shared investment and development, Mr Wickremesinghe said, "India has a huge demand of renewable energy, as do we. That is an area we seek to strengthen ties. When the Singapore-India pipeline (via Andaman and Nicobar Islands) is complete, we too can look for opportunity in it."</li>
	<li>Other significant area that he said Sri Lanka aims partner with India for is to enhance port infrastructure and to get more tourists from India. "We want to encourage more investments from India and more tourists from India. We are working together with India on infrastructure projects like the Trincomalee Harbour," he said.</li>
	<li>Speaking about the social and cultural ties shared by the two countries, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said, "that has been happening for thousands of years". He also said that the two nations share very strong people-to-people ties and that it is the people's mutual regard and appreciation that is the bedrock of India-Sri Lanka relations. "There will always be some groups who may make anti-India remarks, what needs to be done is to minimise it. As far as the India-Sri Lanka friendship is concerned, it is decided by the people and they have already decided it. So, let's further strengthen (the bond)."</li>
	<li>India's economy has "taken off", the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ahead-of-sri-lankan-elections-president-ranil-wickremesinghe-tells-ndtv-about-chinas-growing-presence-6604052" target="_blank">Sri Lankan President told NDTV</a>, adding that Sri Lanka would also like to benefit from it, after all India is "just 20 miles away" and the two nations have shared deep cultural and historical ties. Mr Wickremesinghe further said that "Sri Lanka will deal with China as well to fulfill its national objectives, but at the same time, we will always keep India's interests in mind."</li>

       <description><![CDATA[Ibrahim Aqil, the Hezbollah operations commander killed in an Israeli strike on Friday, had a $7 million bounty on his head for two 1983 Beirut truck bombings that killed more than 300 people at the American embassy and a U.S. Marines barracks.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ibrahim Aqil, the Hezbollah operations commander killed in an Israeli strike on Friday, had a $7 million bounty on his head for two 1983 Beirut truck bombings that killed more than 300 people at the American embassy and a U.S. Marines barracks.</p>

<p>Two security sources in Lebanon confirmed the veteran fighter was killed in an airstrike on Beirut's southern suburbs during a meeting of the elite Radwan unit of the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group.</p>

<p>Aqil, who has also used the aliases Tahsin and Abdelqader, was the second member of Hezbollah's top military body, the Jihad Council, to be killed in two months after an Israeli strike in the same area targeted Fuad Shukr in July.</p>

<p>Israel escalated its attacks on the group this week after months of border fighting triggered by the conflict in Gaza that began on Oct. 7 with a deadly raid and hostage-taking in Israel by Hezbollah's Palestinian ally Hamas.</p>

<p>Like Shukr, Aqil is a veteran of Hezbollah, which was founded by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in the early 1980s to battle Israeli forces that had invaded and occupied Lebanon.</p>

<p>Born in a village in Lebanon's Beqaa valley sometime around 1960, Aqil had joined the other big Lebanese Shi'ite political movement, Amal, before switching to Hezbollah as a founding member, according to a security source.</p>

<p>The United States accuses him of a role in the Beirut truck bombings at the American embassy in April 1983, which killed 63 people, and a U.S. Marine barracks six months later that killed 241 people.</p>

<p>It further accused him of directing the abduction of American and German hostages in Lebanon and listed him as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist in 2019, putting the $7 million bounty on his head.</p>

<p>Referring to the bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks and other attacks on Western interests in Lebanon in the 1980s, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said in a 2022 interview with an Arabic broadcaster that they were carried out by small groups not linked to Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Aqil's cohort of founding Hezbollah operatives helped turn the group from a shadowy militia into Lebanon's most powerful military and political organisation, pushing Israel from its occupation of the south in 2000 and fighting it again in 2006.</p>

<p>When Shukr was killed in July, it was seen as the heaviest blow to its command structure since the 2008 assassination of Imad Mughniyeh, remembered by Hezbollah as a legendary commander but by Israel and the United States as a terrorist.</p>

<p>Aqil, whose bounty was set by the United States at an even higher value than that of Shukr's, may prove a similar blow.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The lethal hack of Hezbollah's Asian-branded pagers and walkie-talkies has sparked an intense search for the devices' path, revealing a murky market for older technologies where buyers may have few assurances about what they are getting.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The lethal hack of Hezbollah's Asian-branded pagers and walkie-talkies has sparked an intense search for the devices' path, revealing a murky market for older technologies where buyers may have few assurances about what they are getting.</p>

<p>While supply chains and distribution channels for higher-margin and newer products are tightly managed, that's not the case for older electronics from Asia where counterfeiting, surplus inventories and complex contract manufacturing deals can sometimes make it impossible to identify the source of a product, analysts and consultants say.</p>

<p>The response from the companies at the centre of the booby-trapped gadgets that killed 37 people and wounded about 3,000 in Lebanon this week has underlined difficulties in discerning how and when they were weaponised.</p>

<p>Taiwan-based Gold Apollo put the blame on a Europe-based licensee of its pager, sparking investigations in Hungary, Bulgaria, Norway and Romania into the origins of the deadly device. Japan's Icom said it could not tell if the walkie-talkies bearing its name were real, in a market awash with fake products.</p>

<p>"If the supply chain was compromised to put explosives inside ... it's incredible engineering to do that. But the actual supply chain compromise is not that hard. Probably the easiest part was the supply chain compromise," said David Fincher, a China-based technologist and consultant.</p>

<p>He said counterfeit products are prevalent, especially in big manufacturing centres like China where fake components can be easily produced, adding that it isn't a big leap to go from fake components to supply chain compromise.</p>

<p>"As the technologist I am, I can tell you getting a little explosive in a radio is not that hard."</p>

<p>Hezbollah acquired the devices around five months ago, according to a security source, who added that the armed group thought it was buying the pagers from Gold Apollo.</p>

<p>The hand-held radios, which the source said were purchased around the same time as the pagers, had labels bearing the name of Osaka-based Icom and the phrase "Made in Japan", images of one exploded device showed.</p>

<p>Both companies have ruled out the possibility that any of the deadly components were made in factories in either of their home locations.</p>

<p>Taiwan's Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei has also said the components used in the pagers that detonated in Lebanon were not made in Taiwan.</p>

<p>A preliminary investigation by Lebanese authorities into the devices found that the explosives were implanted before they arrived in the country, according to a letter to the U.N. Security Council by Lebanon's mission to the United Nations.</p>

<p><strong>FAKE GOODS</strong></p>

<p>But, for now, that's about all anyone is certain of. It's not clear how or when the pagers and walkie-talkies were weaponised so they could be remotely detonated.</p>

<p>Joe Simone, partner with Chinese intellectual property firm East IP, said part of the problem is that smaller brands tend to invest less in policing counterfeits, due in large part to costs that could impact their profitability.</p>

<p>"Authorities are happy to deal with low-tech counterfeits but the IP owners need to monitor, investigate and file complaints and that doesn't always happen as much as it might for high-tech and bigger technology brands," he said.</p>

<p>For Icom, one problem is that it stopped making the IC-V82 model in question a decade ago, around the time it started introducing holographic stickers as a protection against counterfeit products, the company said.</p>

<p>The company has long warned about imitation products, especially of its older models.</p>

<p>In fact, more than 7% of firms in Japan reported business losses from counterfeit products in 2020, according to the latest available report by the Japan Patent Office, with around a third of cases linked to China.</p>

<p>Icom has urged that customers only use its official distributor network to ensure they are buying genuine products.</p>

<p>But in China, there are dozens of shops selling Icom-branded walkie-talkies on e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba.com, Taobao, JD.com and Pinduoduo, including in some cases the IC-V82 model, according to Reuters checks.</p>

<p>Among three China-based vendors of Icom products on Alibaba.com, none of which were listed as official suppliers on Icom's website, Guangzhou Minxing Communications Equipment Co and Chengdu Bingxin Technology Co Ltd both said they sell authentic products, while Quanzhou Yitian Trading Co acknowledged selling "Chinese made imitations" in addition to original products.</p>

<p>Icom has said it makes all its products in its factories in Japan. It did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Icom-branded products sold in Chinese online sites.</p>

<p>The discontinued IC-V82 model is also sold in Vietnam on e-commerce platform Shopee, a Reuters check showed, indicating wide availability of such products.</p>

<p>For Gold Apollo, which licensed its brand to Budapest-based BAC, the supply chain devolved into a mysterious production trail that authorities in various countries are now trying to piece together.</p>

<p>"The widespread availability of cheap, second-hand manufacturing equipment meant counterfeiters were increasingly able to go beyond single components and even make full-fledged products," said Diganta Das from the University of Maryland's Center for Advanced Lifecycle Engineering, who studies counterfeit electronics.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't call it counterfeiting anymore, it's like illegal manufacturing," Das said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russell Bentley, a US national who went missing in Russian-controlled eastern Ukraine early this year, is believed to have been tortured to death by Russian soldiers who are now set to go on trial, Russia's top investigative body said on Friday.</p>

<p>Bentley died in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk in April, Margarita Simonyan, head of Russia's state media outlet RT, wrote at the time, saying he had been "fighting there for our guys" and working with Russia's Sputnik news service.</p>

<p>Bentley, born in 1960, was a self-declared supporter of Russian-backed forces in Ukraine. The Russian state news agency RIA reported that he had joined pro-Russian fighters in eastern Ukraine in 2014, later working with Sputnik and obtaining Russian citizenship.</p>

<p>The Investigative Committee said in a statement that it had completed its probe and accused three Russian servicemen of torturing Bentley to death in Donetsk on April 8.</p>

<p>It said two of the soldiers had then put his body in a car and blown it up. A fourth soldier had been ordered the following day to move Bentley's remains to another location in an attempt to conceal the crime.</p>

<p>The Committee's statement said the accused soldiers, whom it named, were familiarising themselves with the allegations before the indictment was sent for approval.</p>

<p>It said they would variously be tried on charges ranging from exceeding their authority, using physical violence and torture, and causing death by negligence, to attempted concealment of a serious crime. It did not say whether or not they had denied the accusations.</p>

<p>Russian media outlets have suggested that the soldiers may have mistaken Bentley - the subject of a 2022 interview with Rolling Stone magazine titled "The Bizarre Story of How a Hardcore Texas Leftist Became a Frontline Putin propagandist" - for a US spy.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US Secret Service probe found communication gaps and a lack of diligence ahead of the July attempted assassination of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at a Butler, Pennsylvania rally.</p>

<p>"There was complacency on the part of" some agents "that led to a breach of security protocols," Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe told reporters on Friday, adding that agency employees will be held accountable.</p>

<p>The assassination attempt against Trump at the July 13 rally led to widespread criticism of the Secret Service and the resignation of its former director. Critics raised concerns about how the suspect was able to access a nearby rooftop with a direct line of sight to where the former president was speaking.</p>

<p>Trump's ear was wounded, a rally attendee was killed and two others were wounded in the shooting. The Secret Service has since said it was "ashamed" of the security lapse.</p>

<p>Authorities are also probing a separate apparent assassination attempt against Trump in Florida on Sunday. In that case, the Secret Service caught the suspect and no shots were fired at Trump.</p>

<p>Rowe said that Trump was getting the same level of protection as President Joe Biden and Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris, his rival in the Nov. 5 election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lanka, which is slowly recovering from its worst-ever economic crisis, will vote to elect the next President on Saturday. While current President Ranil Wickremesinghe is seeking another term in office, he is being challenged by the key Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa.</p>

<p>Mr Premadasa, 57, is the son of former President Ranasinghe Premadasa. He leads the Samagi Jana Balawegaya party or SJB, that separated from Ranil Wickremesinghe's party - United National Party or UNP in 2020.</p>

<p>Mr Premadasa's centrist, more left-leaning party has called for major changes to the $2.9 billion bailout programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and has outlined plans of his own to adjust some targets, such as changing taxes to reduce the cost of living. He plans a very different approach to that of Mr Wickremesinghe.</p>

<p>Mr Premadasa favours a mix of interventionist and free-market economic policies, and has promised subsidies and has been accused of promising freebies too at his election rallies. But he says he has a different vision for Sri Lanka and has a plan for how he will achieve them.</p>

<p>Speaking exclusively to NDTV, Mr Premadasa spoke about how his vision is different from the current regime, how he plans to revive the economy differently from how the current President is doing, how he views the India-Sri Lanka relationship and how he plans to tackle China.</p>

<h2><strong>Here are the key highlights of his interview to NDTV:</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Q) What according to you makes these elections so significant and crucial?</strong><br />
<strong>A)</strong> Sri Lanka is facing multiple crises. In the economic sphere, the social sphere, the political sphere - and we don't have a legitimate government in the sense that the present administration is an extension of the administration that was primarily responsible for making Sri Lanka bankrupt. It is the very same parliamentary majority that led to the bankruptcy. So the Sri Lankan people are eagerly waiting to express their opinions and provide their mandate for change. Change that will make the country prosperous.</p>

<p><strong>Q) It is acknowledged widely that the incumbent President, Ranil Wickremesinghe, is credited for bringing stability to the economy, but you are saying he is part of the problem and not the solution - that is a serious charge. Can you please elaborate?</strong><br />
<strong>A)</strong> If one takes out their laurels and gets on to the streets and talks to the poor, the downtrodden, the self-employed, the labour force, the entrepreneurs, the rural and urban estate sectors; if you look at the major sections of society, other than those who are super rich, people who have been impacted detrimentally, and if I may provide you with some statistics... stats which were ascertained by the government statistical department has Illustrated that more than 260,000 micro, small and medium sized enterprises have closed. Millions have become unemployed, millions more have become poor, and the government does not have a strategy to deal with it.</p>

<p>The micro, small, and medium sized enterprises contribute to 50% of GDP, employs over 4 million, so people are suffering from the policies of a government that has basically suffocated the people. So, if you achieving stability at great human cost... at a cost where people are suffering,&nbsp; then I don't think that's the right way to do it.</p>

<p><strong>Q) So, in comparison, what is your action plan?</strong><br />
<strong>A)</strong> Where we defer, is that we will grow ourselves out of the problem. We have to go on a massive economic growth trajectory. Huge amounts of FDI coming into Sri Lanka, restructuring of society to ensure that entrepreneurs thrive. That the hold of the bureaucracy, which has basically suffocated entrepreneurship, must be ended. Ensure that businesses flourish... ensure that the micro, small, and medium sized industry are given adequate support. What you have right now is not inclusivity, it's exclusive.</p>

<p><strong>Q) So, how do you plan to ensure all this? How do you go about solving the funding problem? And furthermore, ensure that the economy grows and not shrinks because of the fund crunch?</strong><br />
<strong>A)</strong> You're quite correct in stating that the economy is fragile. That fragility does not give an excuse to be corrupt... to loot the public treasury. Shold we be elected, what we propose to do is to ensure that we follow good governance practices... ensure that the major indices that have a contributing factor with regard to foreign direct investment, good governance indices, ease of doing business... We should have a responsible government, a transparent government, and a&nbsp; government that is accountable - All three are lacking at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>Q) One of the criticisms your party has faced largely, is that you are promising large subsidies and freebies to people at a time when the economy is facing a fund crunch. Where will the funds come from? Would that not jeopardise the economy further?</strong><br />
<strong>A)</strong> We will eradicate the crony-capitalist structure that is existing at present. We will ensure that growth is the major phenomenon in our economic program. This government doesn't understand growth. They are contracting growth. To show everybody that the economy is stable, you're making everything smaller - That is not the way to go. We have to grow ourselves out of the problem. So, stability with malnutrition, stability with huge unemployment, stability with growth contraction, stability while losing livelihoods, stability while having lower standards of living... I'm sorry, I don't agree with that. The difference between the government and us is that we don't just focus on macroeconomics, we also look at the microeconomics. So, we are taking an overarching integrated approach, whereas this government is only keen on showing to the whole world and to a particular class in our country that everything is stable and fine.</p>

<p><strong>Q) India has strategic interests in the region. India had and still has very close ties with Sri Lanka. How do you view the India-Sri Lanka relationship from here on?</strong><br />
<strong>A)</strong> When you talk of recovery, I must say in these very difficult and dire times, India has been one of the countries that has been very generous, and very supportive... and I would like to extend a very big thank you to the Indian government, PM Modi's government, and also to the people of India... and to the various states that have come forward to help our country. So, a big thank you. Having said that, I don't think Sri Lanka is on the correct path to recovery. So, we will ensure that we have a very balanced policy. Where India comes in, is that our External Affairs policy will be to promote our national interest. We will do what is right for our country, and it is in the interest of our country to have cordial relation with India and the rest of the powers in the world.</p>

<p>We do what recognise that we have a special relationship, a kinship, a camaraderie between our two countries and we have a history of positive progressive and good relationship. We have to build upon that and I think we will ensure that mutual interests that matter to both of us are accomplished.</p>

<p><strong>Q) China is a significant player in the region and the last couple of years has seen a rise in Chinese Investments and&nbsp; rise in Chinese naval presence in the region. How do you view the China equation for Sri Lanka?</strong><br />
<strong>A)</strong> As I mentioned to you, in our external relations, we have a special relationship with India. But we also have to work with all of the other nation states. I'm the only politician (from Sri Lanka) who has proposed that India must be included in the United Nations Security Council. Having said that, we as a country will work with all other countries, all other democracies, all other nation states to ensure that Sri Lanka's national interests are achieved. We will in no way work towards downgrading the security and geopolitical interests of others.</p>

<p><strong>Q) What is your reasoning of wanting India as a veto power in the UN Security Council?</strong><br />
<strong>A)</strong> Well, that is a major reflection of global geopolitical reality and I must say it's not just China... all the five permanent members of the UN Security Council have veto power. Sri Lanka as a whole has been very balanced. We want to make sure that we protect our interests and also ensure that interests of other nation states are also not compromised and neutralised. So we are very sensitive to ensure that we don't interfere in the affairs of other nations.</p>

<p><strong>Q) What would be your number one expectation or demand from India, keeping in mind your vision for Sri Lanka and the region?</strong><br />
<strong>A)</strong> First and foremost, I must say I don't demand. I always use uh the power to persuade. I will use all available skills at my disposal to persuade India to invest more in Sri Lanka, to support Sri Lanka to come out of this problem, to help the people of Sri Lanka... ensure that social and economic stability are protected. So, I would use my power to persuade your great country, India, to protect Sri Lankan people's human rights, not just political and civil rights, but their economic rights, their social rights, their right to life, right to alleviate poverty, right to alleviate unemployment... and that's the arena in which we hope to cooperate with India.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mayor of the French town where a man for over a decade brought strangers to rape his wife apologised on Friday for remarks that were criticised for playing down the ordeal of the victim.</p>

<p>Louis Bonnet, 74, mayor of Mazan in southern France, told broadcaster BBC in an interview that "after all, no one died" about the mass rape for which dozens of men are on trial.</p>

<p>They are accused of raping Gisele Pelicot at the invitation of her then-husband Dominique Pelicot who drugged her first.</p>

<p>"It could have been far more serious," Bonnet told the BBC. "There were no kids involved. No women were killed."</p>

<p>Bonnet's remark caused a storm of indignation on social media in France and beyond.</p>

<p>"People say I minimised the serious nature of the abject crimes of which the defendants are accused," Bonnet said in a statement posted on Facebook.</p>

<p>"I understand that people are shocked by these remarks and I am truly sorry."</p>

<p>The mayor said his apologies were addressed "notably to women who were hurt by the clumsy words that were pronounced under the pressure felt in front of the microphone of a foreign media".</p>

<p>Mazan and its 6,000 residents had been under "constant media pressure" since the start of the mass rape trial this month, he said.</p>

<p>Dominique Pelicot has admitted to drugging Gisele Pelicot into unconsciousness and inviting strangers to rape her.</p>

<p>She has become a feminist icon since demanding a public trial.</p>

<p>The trial has horrified France, partly because 71-year-old Dominique Pelicot's co-defendants include apparently ordinary men such as a fireman, a nurse and a journalist, many of them with families.</p>

<p>Forty-nine co-defendants are accused of raping or attempting to rape Gisele Pelicot, and one is accused of imitating Dominique Pelicot to sexually assault his own wife.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's around 3:30 in the afternoon on September 17. People in Lebanon are going about their daily business, doing the shopping, having a haircut, conducting meetings.</p>

<p>Hundreds of pagers across the country, and even outside its borders, then simultaneously bleep with a message and explode, wounding and killing their owners and also bystanders.</p>

<p>The communications devices were used by members of the Iran-backed Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah, which swiftly blamed Israel for the operation, as did several international media organisations.</p>

<p>Israel, according to its convention for operations outside its borders, neither confirmed nor denied the charge.</p>

<p>But observers say that the simultaneous explosions bear all the hallmarks of an operation by Israel, which appears to have infiltrated the supply chain of the pager production and inserted tiny but potent explosives inside.</p>

<p>Israel may have even set up a shell company to supply the devices to Hezbollah in a years-long project that would seem fantastical even in an espionage thriller, according to analysts.</p>

<p>But that was not the end. A day later, on September 18, around the same time in the afternoon, another low-fi gadget, the walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah cadres, exploded, even amid the funerals for those killed in the pager attacks.</p>

<p>The subsequent day, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, who himself had told group members to use low-fi devices so as not to be targeted by Israel through the positioning of their smartphones, made his first public comments, admitting an "unprecedented blow" but also vowing "tough retribution and just punishment" for Israel.</p>

<p>Even though there is next to no doubt Israel was behind the operation, questions abounded. Why now? Is this the start of the widely-feared Israeli offensive into southern Lebanon? Or has Israel simply activated the explosives now simply because it feared the whole operation risked being compromised?</p>

<h2><strong>'IN THE MIDST OF THEIR ORDINARY LIVES'</strong></h2>

<p>The explosions were felt Hezbollah's strongholds throughout Lebanon: the southern Beirut suburbs, the south of the country and the Bekaa Valley in the east, as well as in Syria.</p>

<p>At least 37 people were killed in the two attacks and thousands injured.</p>

<p>The wounded included Iran's ambassador to Lebanon. But those killed also included a 10-year-old girl and another child. As the hospitals filled up the most common wounds were mutilated hands and eyes.</p>

<p>"Hezbollah suffered a very serious blow on a tactical level, a very impressive and comprehensive one that affects the operational side, the cognitive side," said Yoram Schweitzer, a former intelligence officer now at the The Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University.</p>

<p>Peter Harling, founder of the Synaps Lab think tank added: "The targets may have been Hezbollah members, but many were caught in the midst of their ordinary lives, and in the heart of their communities."</p>

<p>"This is also a breach that is extraordinarily hard to explain."</p>

<p>UN rights chief Volker Turk warned that the simultaneous targeting of thousands of individuals "whether civilians or members of armed groups" without knowledge as to who was around them at the time "violates international human rights law".</p>

<p>International humanitarian law prohibits the use of "booby traps" precisely to avoid putting civilians at grave risk and "produce the devastating scenes that continue to unfold across Lebanon", said Lama Fakih, Middle East and North Africa Director at Human Rights Watch.</p>

<h3><strong>'ISRAELI FRONT'</strong></h3>

<p>Espionage professionals have meanwhile expressed their admiration for how the operation was put together.</p>

<p>"It's not a technological feat," said a person working for a European intelligence service, asking not to be named. But "it's the result of human intelligence and heavy logistics."</p>

<p>The small devices, bearing the name of the firm Gold Apollo in Taiwan, were intercepted by Israeli services before their arrival in Lebanon, according to multiple security sources who spoke to AFP, asking not to be named.</p>

<p>But the Taiwanese company denied having manufactured them and pointed to its Hungarian partner BAC.</p>

<p>Founded in 2022, the company is registered in Budapest. Its CEO, Cristiana Barsony-Arcidiacono, appears there as the only employee.</p>

<p>The devices in question have never been on Hungarian soil, according to the Hungarian authorities.</p>

<p>The New York Times, citing three intelligence sources, said BAC was "part of an Israeli front" with at least two other shell companies were created as well to mask the real identities of the people creating the pagers who were Israeli intelligence officers.</p>

<p>It described the pagers as a "modern day Trojan Horse" after the wooden horse said to have been used by the Greeks to enter the city of Troy in the Trojan War.</p>

<h3><strong>'IMPRESSIVE OPERATION'</strong></h3>

<p>The attack comes nearly a year after Hezbollah ally Hamas carried out its October 7 attack on Israel, sparking the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>The focus of Israel's firepower has since been on the Palestinian territory, but Hezbollah fighters and Israeli troops have exchanged fire almost daily across the border region since October, forcing thousands on both sides to flee their homes.</p>

<p>Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the focus of the war was shifting towards Lebanon, while the government said securing the northern front was a key objective, in order to allow Israelis evacuated from the area to return home.</p>

<p>Schweitzer said that despite the spectacular nature of the device operation it did not represent the end of Israel's work to degrade Hezbollah.</p>

<p>"I don't think this impressive operation that has its tactical gains... is getting into the strategic layers yet.</p>

<p>"It does not change the equation, it is not a decisive victory. But it sends another signal to Hezbollah, Iran and others," he said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Indian-Origin astronaut Sunita Williams has celebrated her 59th birthday -- the second in space.</p>

<p>SunitaWilliams is currently stranded at the International Space Station (ISS) after Boeing's faulty Starliner spacecraft was declared unfit for human travel by NASA. While Starliner is back on Earth unharmed, SunitaWilliams is expected to return on SpaceX's capsule in February next year.</p>

<p>SunitaWilliams marked her 59th birthday aboard the ISS on September 19. She dedicated her day to vital maintenance tasks and scientific research on the orbiting lab.</p>

<p>Along with fellow astronaut Don Pettit, she worked on maintaining life support systems on the ISS.</p>

<p>The astronaut duo then replaced filters in the station's waste and hygiene compartment -- called the space bathroom.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old created history by becoming the first woman to fly on the maiden mission of the Starliner. The Starliner flight is SunitaWilliams's third to space -- the first being in 2006 and the second in 2012.</p>

<p>According to NASA, "Sunita has spent a cumulative total of 322 days in space", and she is the second woman astronaut with the highest number of spacewalks.</p>

<p>On her birthday, Sunita Williams received a rendition of legendary singer Mohd Rafi's birthday song 'Bar bar din ye aaye' from Indian music company Saregama.</p>

<p>In a post on Instagram, Saregama shared: "Come on India let's sing #HappyBirthdaySunita along with India's biggest icons and send our collective wishes to Astronaut Sunita Williams up in space. Use #HappyBirthdaySunita to post your videos and Tag @saregama_official".</p>

<p>In the video shared along with the post, film director Karan Johar, and iconic singers Sonu Nigam, Shaan, Hariharan, and Neeti Mohan sang the song to wish her birthday.</p>

<p>The post also called for people to make videos wishing Sunita Williams and share them with #HappyBirthdaySunita.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sunita Williams is expected to cast her votes in the 2024 US presidential elections, scheduled for November 5, from space.</p>

<p>Originally slated for an eight-day mission, Sunita William's stay in space has now stretched to eight months.</p>

<p>Commenting on being stuck in space, the Indian-origin astronaut in a recent video press conference said, "That's how things go in this business."</p>

<p>She added that the transition to station life was "not that hard" since both astronauts had prior experience on the ISS.</p>

<p>Reflecting on her extended mission, Sunita Williams shared, "This is my happy place. I love being up here in space."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel announced it had killed the commander of Hezbollah's elite unit in a strike Friday that Lebanese officials said left 12 dead and dozens wounded in the movement's Beirut stronghold.</p>

<p>Ibrahim Aqil, who was also wanted by the United States for involvement in the 1983 bombing of the US embassy in Beirut, headed the Iran-backed militant group's elite Radwan unit.</p>

<p>AFP journalists at the scene said the blast had left a massive crater and destroyed the lower floors of a high-rise building in the Lebanese capital's southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold.</p>

<p>The killing of Aqil was the second of a senior Hezbollah commander since the start of the war in Gaza, following another Israeli strike in Beirut that killed Fuad Shukr in July.</p>

<p>It also came after two waves of explosions, on Tuesday and Wednesday, of communication devices used by Hezbollah members, which Hezbollah blamed on Israel, that killed dozens and left Hezbollah reeling while dramatically shifting the focus of the Israel-Hamas war northwards.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said Friday it conducted a "targeted strike" to kill Aqil and which also killed around 10 other senior Radwan commanders.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry said the attack killed 12 people and wounded 66 more.</p>

<p>Earlier, a source close to Hezbollah, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said the strike had killed Aqil.</p>

<p>"The Israeli air strike killed Radwan Force commander Ibrahim Aqil, its armed force's second-in-command after Fuad Shukr," the source close to Hezbollah said.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has not officially confirmed his death, but it said after the strike that it targeted with rockets an Israeli intelligence base it blamed for unspecified "assassinations".</p>

<p>The United States had offered a $7 million reward for information on Aqil, describing him as a "principal member" of the organisation that claimed the 1983 embassy bombing, which killed 63 people.</p>

<p><strong>Communication device explosions</strong></p>

<p>Israeli troops and Hezbollah fighters have battled each other along the Israel-Lebanon border since Hamas sparked the war in Gaza with its October 7 attack.</p>

<p>The focus of Israel's firepower for nearly a year has been on Gaza, but with Hamas much weakened, the focus of the war has shifted dramatically to Israel's northern border.</p>

<p>Months of near-daily border clashes have killed hundreds in Lebanon, most of them fighters, and dozens in Israel, and forced thousands on both sides to flee their homes.</p>

<p>On Tuesday and Wednesday, Hezbollah was hit by an unprecedented attack that it has blamed on Israel, though Israel has yet to comment.</p>

<p>The attack saw thousands of Hezbollah operatives' communication devices explode across two days, killing 37 people and wounding thousands more.</p>

<p>Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah vowed on Thursday that Israel would face retribution for the blasts.</p>

<p>Earlier Friday, Israel said Hezbollah had fired dozens of rockets from Lebanon following air strikes which destroyed dozens of the militant group's launchers.</p>

<p>Speaking to troops on Wednesday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said: "Hezbollah will pay an increasing price" as Israel tries to "ensure the safe return" of its citizens to border areas.</p>

<p>"We are at the start of a new phase in the war," he said.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meanwhile delayed his scheduled departure to the United States, where he is due to address the UN General Assembly, by a day, with an official citing the situation on the northern front.</p>

<p>Earlier Friday, Hezbollah said it targeted at least six Israeli military bases with salvos of rockets after overnight bombardment that people in south Lebanon described as among the fiercest so far.</p>

<p><strong>'Fear of wider war'</strong></p>

<p>Residents of Marjayoun, a Lebanese town close to the border, said the overnight bombardment was among the heaviest since the border clashes began last October.</p>

<p>"We were very scared, especially for my grandchildren," said Nuha Abdo, 62. "We were moving them from one room to another."</p>

<p>Clothing store owner Elie Rmeih, 45, counted more than 50 strikes.</p>

<p>"It was a terrifying scene and unlike anything we have experienced since the escalation began.</p>

<p>"We live in fear of a wider war, you don't know where to go."</p>

<p><strong>Calls for restraint</strong></p>

<p>International mediators have been scrambling to stop the Gaza war from turning into an all-out regional conflict.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has tried to salvage efforts for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, called for restraint on all sides.</p>

<p>"We don't want to see any escalatory actions by any party" that would endanger the goal of a Gaza ceasefire, he said.</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attacks that sparked the Gaza war resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, on the Israeli side, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Out of 251 hostages seized by militants, 97 are still held in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 41,272 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to figures provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The United Nations has acknowledged the figures as reliable.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With just six years left to meet the deadline for the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the world is not on track to meet those targets.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic, escalating conflicts and growing climate chaos have severely hindered progress.</p>

<p>To get back on track, the world needs massive investment in sustainable development, as well as accelerated action in several critical areas, including climate change, peace and security, and inequalities among and between countries, as the recent <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://dashboards.sdgindex.org/" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">Sustainable Development Report 2024</a> found.</p>

<p>To address these acute challenges, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.un.org/en/summit-of-the-future" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">Summit of the Future</a> at the United Nations in New York on September 22-23.</p>

<p>With the theme "Multilateral solutions for a better tomorrow", the summit will bring together UN member states and agencies, academic institutions, non-governmental organisations, civil society organisations, the private sector and young people.</p>

<p>Humanity is facing a set of unprecedented challenges that can only be solved through global cooperation, also known as multilateralism. During the summit, attendees will collectively forge a new global consensus on what our future should look like - and what we can do today to secure it.</p>

<p>The summit will focus on five core areas: sustainable development and financing; international peace and security; fostering digital cooperation and the control of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence; the empowerment of young people and future generations; and reform of the UN architecture.</p>

<p>Within sustainable development, the core challenge is securing global financing. After all, achieving the Sustainable Development Goals will require sizeable public investment.</p>

<p>With low-income and lower-middle-income countries, in particular, lacking the access to financing they need to achieve those goals, the global system will need to work out a way to provide access to long-term, low-cost financing to these countries.</p>

<p>To achieve global peace, one of the core challenges today is great-power competition, including between the US, Russia and China. The world will need to move toward a UN-led system in which this great-power competition is governed and restrained by the UN Charter rather than by militarism and power politics.</p>

<p>To support this goal, countries must be truly committed to global cooperation - and a new index on UN-based multilateralism could play a part in monitoring just how committed to that goal UN member states are.</p>

<p>For digital cooperation and new technologies, the main challenge is to ensure that they are transparently and responsibly governed.</p>

<p>For youth and future generations, high-quality education plays an essential role in their empowerment and progress. The world will need to work toward a new global financial arrangement to ensure that every child, even in the poorest countries, is given the opportunity for a decent education.</p>

<p>All of these objectives cannot be achieved without reform of the UN system, ensuring that more power is given to UN institutions and ensuring that they are more representative. To make the UN as representative as possible, boosting diverse representation, including women's representation, at leadership levels is essential.</p>

<p>Furthermore, approaching decarbonisation and other sustainability efforts with a gender lens and boosting women's representation in this area is critical for making progress on all of the above challenges.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon's Hezbollah was still handing its members new Gold Apollo branded pagers hours before thousands blew up this week, two security sources said, indicating the group was confident the devices were safe despite an ongoing sweep of electronic kit to identify threats.</p>

<p>One member of the Iranian-backed militia received a new pager on Monday that exploded the next day while it was still in its box, said one of the sources.</p>

<p>A pager given to a senior member just days earlier injured a subordinate when it detonated, the second source said.</p>

<p>In an apparently coordinated attack the Gold Apollo branded devices detonated on Tuesday across Hezbollah's strongholds of south Lebanon, Beirut's suburbs and the eastern Bekaa valley.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, hundreds of Hezbollah walkie-talkies exploded. The consecutive attacks killed 37 people, including at least two children, and injured more than 3,000 people.</p>

<p>The batteries of the walkie-talkies were laced with a highly explosive compound known as PETN, another Lebanese source familiar with the device's components told Reuters on Friday. Up to three grams of explosives hidden in the pagers had gone undetected for months by Hezbollah, Reuters reported earlier this week.</p>

<p>One of the security sources said it was very hard to detect the explosives "with any device or scanner." The source did not specify what type of scanners Hezbollah had run the pagers through.</p>

<p>Hezbollah examined the pagers after they were delivered to Lebanon, starting in 2022, including by travelling through airports with them to ensure they would not trigger alarms, two additional sources told Reuters. In total, Reuters spoke to six sources familiar with the details of the exploding devices for this story.</p>

<p>The sources did not specify the name of the airports where they conducted the tests.</p>

<p>Lebanon, Hezbollah and Western security sources say Israel was behind the attacks. Israel, which has since stepped up airstrikes on Lebanon, has neither denied or confirmed involvement.</p>

<p>Rather than a specific suspicion of the pagers, the checks had been part of a routine "sweep" of its equipment, including communications devices, to find any indications that they were laced with explosives or surveillance mechanisms, one of the security sources said.</p>

<p>The attacks, and the distribution of the devices despite the routine sweep and checks for breaches, have struck at Hezbollah's reputation as the most formidable of Iran's allied 'Axis of Resistance' umbrella of anti-Israel irregular forces across the Middle East.</p>

<p>In a televised speech on Thursday, Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah said the attacks were "unprecedented in the history" of the group.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's media office and Israel's armed forces did not immediately respond to requests for comment for this story.</p>

<p>Taiwan-based Gold Apollo has said it did not manufacture the devices used in the attack, saying they were made by a company in Europe licensed to use the firm's brand. Reuters has not been able to establish where they were made or at what point they were tampered with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A batch of 5,000 of the pagers were brought into Lebanon earlier this year. Reuters previously reported that Hezbollah turned to pagers in an attempt to evade Israeli surveillance of its mobile phones, following the killing of senior commanders in targeted airstrikes over the past year.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's conflict with Israel dates back decades but has flared up in the past year in parallel with the Gaza war, heightening worries of a full-blown regional war.</p>

<p><strong>TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE</strong></p>

<p>After the pagers detonated on Tuesday, Hezbollah suspected more of its devices may have been compromised, two of the security sources, as well as an intelligence source, told Reuters.</p>

<p>In response, it intensified the sweep of its communications systems, carrying out careful examinations of all devices. It also began investigating the supply chains through which the pagers were brought in, the two security sources said.</p>

<p>But the review had not been concluded by Wednesday afternoon, when the hand-held radios exploded.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hezbollah believes that Israel opted to detonate the group's hand-held radios because it feared Hezbollah would soon find that the walkie-talkies were also rigged with explosives, one of the sources told Reuters.</p>

<p>The walkie-talkie explosions left 25 people dead and at least 650 injured, according to Lebanon's health ministry - a much higher fatality rate than the previous day's pager blasts, which killed 12 and wounded nearly 3,000.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That is because they carried a higher payload of explosives than the beepers, one of the security sources and the intelligence source said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The group's probe into precisely where, when and how the devices were laced with explosives is ongoing, three of the sources said. Nasrallah later said the same in the speech on Thursday.</p>

<p>One of the security sources said Hezbollah had foiled previous Israeli operations targeting devices imported from abroad by the group - from its private landline telephones to ventilation units in the group's offices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That includes suspected breaches in the past year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There are several electronic issues that we were able to discover - but not the pagers," the source said. "They tricked us, hats off to the enemy."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian politicians have argued for decades that the nation deserves to be a member of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).</p>

<p>An aspirational superpower, India believes that it has been unfairly denied a seat at the high table.</p>

<p>Several visiting foreign political dignitaries and international coalitions that have pushed for UNSC reforms have also voiced support for India's candidacy for permanent membership of the Security Council.</p>

<p>However, despite persistent lobbying by India, experts are not hopeful of change in the near future.</p>

<p>There are four key challenges India must overcome before it secures veto power in the United Nations.</p>

<h2><strong>CHINA'S OPPOSITION</strong></h2>

<p>Among the five permanent security council members all except China - the US, the UK, France, and Russia - have categorically supported India's candidature in the past.</p>

<p>As a close competitor of India in regional and international politics, China - the only Asian country with a security council seat - is unwilling to endorse New Delhi's position.</p>

<p>This adds to its power and international prestige and China is unlikely to want to share this space with India. What's more, particularly amid an ongoing border dispute with India, China will resist any attempt by any of the four members to change the composition of the UNSC.</p>

<p>China is also uncomfortable with Japan, a close US ally that, like India, is a strong contender for a permanent seat.</p>

<p>China has unofficially dropped hints that it may back India, provided New Delhi doesn't endorse Japan's bid. China knows that New Delhi will not break the unity of the G-4 (comprising Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan, are four countries which support each other's bids for permanent seats on the security council) and thus, considers it is a safe bet to pit India against Japan.</p>

<h3><strong>DISAGREEMENT ON MEMBERSHIP WITHOUT VETO POWER</strong></h3>

<p>Some parties have raised the prospect of India gaining UNSC membership without veto power.</p>

<p>Groups including Uniting for Consensus (UfC) - a powerful coalition led by Italy, with other members including Canada, Mexico, Spain, Pakistan, South Korea and Turkey - have advocated reinforcing the working of the General Assembly and increasing the number of non-permanent members.</p>

<p>Its argument is that the addition of non-permanent members will make the UN more accountable and representative by accommodating relevant regional voices in the decision-making process. In doing so, the group argues, this solution would mean there are more than a few select chief custodians of the international system.</p>

<p>But there are questions about what happens if India gets a high seat without veto power. Could this be considered a piecemeal approach towards achieving the larger objective?</p>

<p>Despite some parties saying they prefer this kind of arrangement, New Delhi is not comfortable with this proposition. India's position is that all new permanent members to the security council must possess a veto. Thus, it is unlikely this outcome will unfold.</p>

<h3><strong>WESTERN CONCERNS THAT INDIA MAY NOT ALIGN WITH US PRIORITIES</strong></h3>

<p>The US has, in principle, endorsed India gaining a permanent seat on the security council. But not everyone believes US policymakers will actually support such a reform in practice.</p>

<p>Indeed, in the past, P-5 countries have displayed "a habit of being non-commital" when it comes to actual decision-making on veto powers. As former US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns said in 2008: "We want to preserve the veto, and we do not want to extend a veto to new permanent members."</p>

<p>Prominent US-based South Asian expert Ashley Tellis recently penned a piece in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/india/americas-bad-bet-india-modi" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">Foreign Affairs magazine</a> arguing that the US cannot be sure of India's support on significant strategic matters. Ashley later defended this position in an interview, saying "the current war in Ukraine is a good example... India defines its interest in ways that are not always identical to our own".</p>

<p>It is true that India has not always voted with the West in the UN and has maintained an independent position on several critical subjects (e.g., India abstaining on the Russian invasion of Ukraine). Due to this, many think India is a fence-sitter and see it as an unreliable partner.</p>

<p>The West, particularly after the Russian-Ukraine war, is more watchful of new geopolitical reality. The understanding that Russia may fail to secure any support in the world for its war has changed.</p>

<p>Despite developing closer strategic ties with the West, India remained uncommitted on supporting sanctions on Russia. While China's response was anticipated, for the West, foot dragging by New Delhi in criticising Russia was no less than a shock.</p>

<p>In these changed circumstances, it is difficult to imagine that the West, particularly the US, will go ahead with a reformed security council where India has veto power.</p>

<h3><strong>THE REGIONAL CONUNDRUM</strong></h3>

<p>India also faces formidable challenges to its leadership emanating from its own region. India influences the region, but not in absolute terms. Indeed, as instability in the region has increased, so too have New Delhi's troubles.</p>

<p>South Asia has become a battleground of India-China competition.</p>

<p>And while the India-Pakistan rivalry captures most attention, there are major India-related issues that agitate people in Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives and even in Bhutan.</p>

<p>With its recent change of government, Bangladeshis no longer on the same page. Queries over India's regional leadership raises questions over its claims to be a global power.</p>

<h3><strong>NEXT STEP FOR INDIA</strong></h3>

<p>There are convincing arguments that the UN is in desperate need of reform, particularly the Security Council. Expanding the Security Council's membership to include developing countries like India would benefit the UN and the international community.</p>

<p>However, New Delhi must make more concerted efforts to address criticisms to further legitimise its demand for permanent membership.</p>

<p>India's geographical, political, and social influence in South Asia cannot be ignored. Recent criticism around its increasing political intolerance - which is directly linked to the state of democracy in India - must be addressed and resolved.</p>

<p>India's failure to improve its ranking in the Human Development Index, the issue of economic inequality, and its lack of world-class infrastructure all contribute to the nation's global image.</p>

<p>Therefore, there are structural and more prominent geopolitical factors that overshadow India's chances to acquire security council permanent membership.</p>

<p>Additionally, India needs better engagement with the region and much more internal work to strengthen its claim further.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is work experience from India not enough to fetch you a decent salary abroad? A video of an Indian man, who works as a process inventory associate in Canada, highlights the struggle to land a job even though he previously worked with Google India for three years.</p>

<p>"They (Canadians) are preferably looking for <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-canadas-2-year-cap-on-foreign-students-and-who-will-be-impacted-4969561">Canadian candidates</a> only and not looking for Indian candidates," he said. In a conversation with digital creator Piyush Monga, the man expressed dissatisfaction with his current salary of CAD 17,500 (around Rs 10.78 lakh), deeming it inadequate for a comfortable living.</p>

<p>When asked about his satisfaction with the salary, he candidly responded, "Obviously no one is happy. You hardly make any survival with that sort of money."</p>

<p>The former Google employee voiced his disappointment regarding the undervaluation of his experience, saying that he has worked on-site with the company in India for over three years as a digital marketing expert. However, since moving to Canada, he feels compelled to "cut down his experience" as employers think that "if you have experience from India, it's not going to count."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Addressing the significance of local experience, he said, "It definitely doesn't make any sense because you have spent a lot of years over there and have done a lot of things. Some companies say I'm overqualified for the job."</p>

<p>&nbsp;"Is Indian experience irrelevant? Bro has worked with Google but, recruiters don't care," read the caption posted with the video on Instagram.</p>

<p>People reacted in the comments of the video with their own edperiences. One of them wrote, "Here I was sad my Wipro experience doesn't count in Canada."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"When fresher goes they want experience. When experienced guy goes they want less experience. What do they want," a person wrote questioning the confusion over job opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another user, however, did not agree with the man's claims and added, "I do not think that's true. If one has developed Google ad skills, a recruiter will prefer those. Not having Canadian experience might impact his level and pay but you can get a job or at least an internship in a year.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Justin Trudeau-led government in Canada recently announced a <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/indian-students-in-canada-face-deportation-after-policy-change-6429289#:~:text=Canada%20is%20also%20reducing%20the,getting%20deported%20from%20the%20country">policy change</a> affecting foreign students.

       <description><![CDATA[In a recent interview, Melinda French Gates criticised CEOs and tech entrepreneurs who boast about functioning on minimal sleep, calling the trend "so dumb."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire philanthropist Melinda French Gates has taken CEOs and tech entrepreneurs to task for bragging about getting minimal sleep, claiming it maximises productivity. An interview with <em>Vanity Fair</em> ended with her calling the approach "so dumb." She confided that she gets between seven and eight hours of sleep at night.</p>

<p>In the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/story/melinda-gates-interview-politics?_sp=3adf1d39-eefb-4f9c-992b-2070941c5bd7.1726583518652"><em>interview,</em></a> French Gates identified the negative side of sleep deprivation, adding that "some of us didn't want to be around them! Let's be honest!" referring to CEOs, in her opinion, who advocate for a destructive and performative deprivation of sleep.</p>

<p>Physicians support this, highlighting the need for sufficient rest for optimal health. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6506a1.htm#:~:text=To%20promote%20optimal%20health%20and,mortality%20(2%E2%80%934).">The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention</a> recommends that adults aged 18 to 60 years should sleep for at least seven hours in a day.</p>

<p>Extreme sleep deprivation causes critical health conditions such as diseases of the heart and kidneys, high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, obesity, and depression.</p>

<p>French Gates' comments come as a growing number of prominent figures, including Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bill Gates, have acknowledged the importance of sleep and are prioritising it in their own lives.</p>

<p>"I've tried [to sleep] less... Even though I'm awake more hours, I get less done," Musk told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/18/elon-musk-sacrificing-sleep-for-productivity-gave-me-brain-pain.html"><em>CNBC </em></a>last year. "And the brain pain level is bad if I get less than six hours [of sleep]."</p>

<p>Research shows that getting enough sleep is essential for peak physical and mental performance, and sleep deprivation can even mimic the effects of being intoxicated.</p>

<p>According to CDC, insufficient sleep impairs cognitive performance, which can increase the likelihood of motor vehicle and other transportation accidents, industrial accidents, medical errors, and loss of work productivity that could affect the wider community.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A zoo in the Shanwei city of China's eastern Guangdong province was forced to admit that the pandas in their exhibits are, in fact, "painted dogs".</p>

<p>The duped visitors at the Shanwei zoo, who were left outraged, witnessed that one of the so-called "pandas" was actually panting and barking, New York Post reported.</p>

<p>They even clicked photographs and took videos of the animals that have gone viral on social media.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Glitch in the Matrix: China zoo forced to admit the truth after one of their “pandas” started panting and barking. The Shanwei zoo admits they painted dogs white and black to make them look like pandas. <a href="https://t.co/5SWDlpOSqB">pic.twitter.com/5SWDlpOSqB</a></p>
— SynCronus (@syncronus) <a href="https://twitter.com/syncronus/status/1836886099404411227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 19, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>In one of the viral videos, one of the animals can be seen panting while lying on a rock in a fenced area. Also, it shows another dog, having a long, curly tail, strolling around.</p>

<p>Officials at the zoo initially tried to cover upand bizarrely claimed that the two animals were a breed of "panda dogs."</p>

<p>However, when the visitors criticised them over various social media platforms, the zoo's manager said the dogs are one of its top attractions.</p>

<p>"You can see by our name, we are 'Strange Animals and Cute Pets Paradise. These are Chow Chow dogs being painted (as pandas), as this is part of our specialties," CNN quoted her as saying.</p>

<p>Chow Chows are a fluffy breed of spitz, originally from northern China.</p>

<p>The two dogs were painted with black-and-white markings.</p>

<p>This was not the first time when a zoo in China was caught misleading visitors with the claims of housing real pandas in their exhibits.</p>

<p dir="ltr">A few months ago, the Taizhou Zoo in Jiangsu Province was also criticised by many for <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/watch-outrage-after-china-zoo-paints-chow-chow-dogs-to-look-like-pandas-5618273">painting Chow Chows</a> and presenting them as 'pandas'.&nbsp;The zoo advertised the attraction of ''Xiong Mao Quan'', which translates as ''panda dogs'' to boost its visitor footfall during the May Day holiday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At that time too, the zoo representatives had claimed that the animals were rare "panda dogs" breed. However, they later admitted that such animal breeds don't exist.</p>

<p>Back then, the zoo officials had informed the local media that they did not intentionally mislead anyone as they advertised the animals as "panda dogs".</p>

<p>After being confronted on the idea of inventing "panda dogs," a zoo representative said, "There are no panda bears at the zoo and we wanted to do this as a result. People also dye their hair. Natural dye can be used on dogs if they have long fur."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah has acknowledged that his powerful group had suffered an "unprecedented" blow when thousands of operatives' communication devices exploded in attacks it blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>Israel has not commented on the attacks that killed 37 people and wounded nearly 3,000 across Lebanon over two days but has said it will widen the scope of its war in Gaza to include the Lebanon front.</p>

<p>Delivering a speech after the attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday, which plunged Lebanon into panic, Nasrallah struck a defiant tone and warned of retaliation.</p>

<p>Describing the attacks as a possible "act of war", he said Israel would face "tough retribution and just punishment, where it expects it and where it does not".</p>

<p>The attacks were a "massacre" that "could be a war crime or a declaration of war," he said, accusing Israel of having wanted to "kill no less than 5,000 people in two minutes".</p>

<p>Nasrallah also vowed to keep up Hezbollah's fight against Israel until a ceasefire in Gaza is reached.</p>

<p>"The Lebanese front will not stop until the aggression on Gaza stops" despite "all this blood spilt," he said.</p>

<h2><strong>'STOP' GAZA WAR</strong></h2>

<p>Nasrallah addressed Israeli officials' promises to return to their homes thousands of Israelis displaced by exchanges of fire across the border with Lebanon.</p>

<p>"You will not be able to return the people of the north to the north," he said, warning that "no military escalation, no killings, no assassinations and no all-out war can return residents to the border".</p>

<p>The "only way" to return the displaced to the north is to "stop the war on Gaza," he said.</p>

<p>Hezbollah is an ally of Palestinian militant group Hamas, which on October 7 launched an unprecedented attack on Israel that sparked Gaza's deadliest ever war.</p>

<p>Up until now, the focus of Israel's firepower had been on Gaza.</p>

<p>But Israel's northern border with Lebanon has seen exchanges of fire between Israeli troops and Hezbollah militants almost every day since October 8.</p>

<p>The violence has killed hundreds of people, mostly fighters, on the Lebanese side, and dozens on the Israeli side.</p>

<p>Israeli warplanes broke the sound barrier over Beirut as Nasrallah spoke, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said, with AFP correspondents in Beirut reporting loud booms.</p>

<p>Nasrallah announced the launch of an internal probe into the attacks, which experts and some Israeli media have said bear all the hallmarks of Israeli intelligence agency Mossad.<br />

<p>Amidst the cacophony of US Presidential election campaigns, many Indian American youth are rallying for the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. Eager little dancers are fine-tuning their steps to be at their coordinated best when they perform for him on September 22 at the Nassau Coliseum in Long Island, New York. Thirteen-year-old Mahita Pendota is one of over 80 performers who will showcase their talent in traditional and popular pan-India performing arts. Beats of<i>&nbsp;‘Dhol baje'&nbsp;</i>will reverberate across the venue as her group from East Coast's Shivaay Dance Academy will present ‘traditional garba in a Bollywood twist style' to a soundtrack custom-produced in India. Rohan Virdi, the co-founder of the academy, describes the enthusiasm among Indian American families thus: “They are willing to do anything possible to be a part of this show. Even if the parents will not get to attend, they don't want their kids to miss seeing Modiji.”</p>

<p>The enthusiasm among Indian American youngsters springs from the cultural milieu they are being raised in. For instance, Sandeep Shetty, a former Bollywood choreographer who runs New Jersey-based Rudra Dance Academy, not only focuses on technical skills but also ‘teaches culture'. “We educate them about cultural, current and historical things from India like festivals. Students know a lot about Modi. When they got to know the Prime Minister was coming to New York, they were so excited to participate!” he says. Shetty's group will also be presenting a Bollywood-style performance.</p>

<p>US-raised graduate Agrima Agnihotri finds herself fortunate to be one of the volunteers. She and many young second-generation immigrant peers who “speak highly of Modi” will be attending the event. “We finally get to see him!” she exclaims. Like her Indian immigrant parents, Agnihotri is convinced that PM Modi thinks “futuristically” and has “put India in a good light”. “Modiji is not only an inspiration in India. I like to think that he inspires us across the oceans. He is my role model personally. My parents are huge supporters, and I've learned to be a supporter as well,” she says. Calling him a "guiding light" for youth, she says Modi even makes Indian American youth feel cool about their identity and background socially. “After he became the PM, India is much more respected than earlier which makes us feel confident and validated when we talk to our non-Indian peers. The narrative has switched in our favour.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Indian Americans Are A Diverse Lot</strong></h2>

<p>The largest Asian immigrant community in the US, Indian Americans are a diverse lot, representing various Indian cultures and political leanings. Their population has more than doubled in the last two decades. The ideological leanings of recent immigrants reflect home country politics, evident in their affinity for Indian political leaders. It is well-known that Modi is very popular among a large chunk of Hindu Americans. Temple University's Dr Sanjoy Chakravorty, co-author of<i>&nbsp;The Other One Percent: Indians in America</i>, is sceptical of generalising for most Indian Americans but recognises that the affinity for PM Modi among those from Gujarat is strong. “By and large, the second-generation children have very little political knowledge of India. In Gujarati families, there's a worship of Modi and you know how Gujaratis are well-represented in certain parts of the US, particularly in New Jersey, New York and Chicago.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the same time, for those growing up in the US, the dominant culture for a majority of Indian American youth remains American. “The American political horse race is kind of fascinating and it's constantly in your face. They constantly talk about it as it's always on TV, always in the news, and they get caught up in it. India is a distant thing and a good chunk of them have rarely been to India,” Dr Chakravorty explains. And thus, while some second-generation immigrants reject their parents' politics, there are others who follow it, he adds.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>"A Bubble"</strong></h2>

<p>“You're seeing a particular bubble which I don't think is representative. It really doesn't strike me in any shape or fashion as something that's representative of the second-generation Indians in the US,” Chakravorty points out. Even so, within the bubble that's enthusiastic about Modi's visit, culture and politics seem to transcend continents and generations. The sign-ups for the event, dubbed as ‘Modi and US, Progress Together', crossed 29,700 according to a lead organiser. It was not open to the public and only well-recognised cultural and philanthropic US-based organisations could apply. The 600 selected, including sponsors, had to trim their member lists to be accommodated into the 13,500-capacity at the Nassau Coliseum.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wanting to be seen and recognised, this is a grand stage for aspirational Indian diaspora members. “It's networking at the highest level. Being at a Prime Minister event is high visibility. Getting a picture taken with the Prime Minister is something they'll hang on the walls, show everywhere, put on their websites. It's not just Indians, everybody does it,” says Dr Chakravorty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A group of US-based ‘Welcome Partner Organizations' have come together as the ‘Indo American Community of USA' to steer the effort. Participants will be taking long flights and drives from over 42 states to Long Island on the US East Coast. One of those attending from the West Coast is California-based Vijaya Aasuri, President of the Association of Indo-Americans, a conglomeration of 48 Indian cultural and charity organisations. She has been part of Modi's past meetings at The White House and diaspora events, including the 2014 Madison Square Garden summit and the 2019 Howdy Modi rally in Texas. Aasuri says she is looking forward to his latest address. “Every day, every minute you see growth in India. Getting those updates from the media is one thing but hearing about the progress directly from our honourable Prime Minister is very reassuring.”</p>

<h2><strong>Hindu Indian-Americans Biggest Supporters</strong></h2>

<p>In line with the religious demographics of the Indian American community, the rally will largely consist of Hindu Indian-Americans but will also have a smattering of other religions. Nikunj Trivedi, president of the Coalition of Hindus of North America, says, “I do know that there are Sikh groups, there's an Indian Christian group and a Muslim group. Ismaili Bohra Muslims from Gujarat maintain a strong affinity to the state. I know that as I am from Gujarat.” Meanwhile, two large Sikh-American groups as well as the Indian American Muslim Council say they will not be participating in the rally.</p>

<p>According to a lead organiser, the rally is being funded by participating groups and sponsors. One of the gold sponsors, Indiaspora, is an influential organisation whose mission is to “build bridges among diaspora leaders in several countries and professions with leaders residing in India”. They have close ties with US and Indian administrations and corporate leaders and are an example of the role the Indian diaspora plays in enhancing synergy between the two countries. Their Executive Director, Sanjeev Joshipura, says Indiaspora, a “secular and non-partisan organisation”, has been part of the Indian Prime Minister's earlier US visits too. “It makes sense for an organisation to work with the sitting Prime Minister of India regardless of political party. A lot of Indiaspora network and members are going to be part of the VIP seating and backstage opportunities with Foreign Minister Jaishankar, and a possible meet-and-greet with the PM.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>No Political Leanings</strong></h2>

<p>A clear directive being followed by the organisers is not to lean towards any one US political party. A few prominent Indian American politicians “might be” in attendance, but organisers say they will be at the event in their “personal capacity”. This would be unlike the 2019 ‘Howdy Modi' event, which saw addresses by both PM Modi and then US President Donald Trump. San Francisco Bay Area-based Democrat Ajay Bhutoria, member of ‘National Finance Committee 2024, Harris for President', is one of the attendants at the rally. He says, “During the planning stages, organisers had thought to extend invitations to both Trump and Harris, but they were unsure, just in case one accepts and the other doesn't for some reason. To avoid that, they decided against it, and are not inviting any members of Congress or elected officials.”</p>

<p>As preparations for the Long Island rally continue in full swing, Joshipura points out that though it is only natural that a mass rally would generate conversation and grab headlines, Modi's US visit will also be defined by several other non-public aspects. “There is the UNGA assembly going on, climate week is also at the same time, there is a QUAD meeting that will occur just before Modi's big speech in Nassau County and meetings with corporate leaders. In addition to what one sees on TV, there is a lot of substance to this visit, sometimes bilateral, in some cases even multilateral,” he says.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US presidential hopeful Kamala Harris appears to be taking a leaf out of rival Donald Trump's playbook by focusing on evoking emotion, rather than explaining policy, on the campaign trail -- and she's hoping her appeal to "joy" will help her beat the Republican at his own game.</p>

<p>Since taking over from President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic Party's ticket in July, Harris has had to run her campaign in fast-forward, with just months to go before the November election.</p>

<p>With few exceptions she has avoided press conferences, interviews and lengthy discussions on policy. Instead, her official coronation at the Democratic National Convention focused on one pervasive theme: "joy."</p>

<p>And the vibe-heavy approach appears to be working.</p>

<p>While Biden was lagging behind Trump, Harris has pulled back into the race, with the two candidates running neck-and-neck in six key battleground states, according to the latest polls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The shift to evoking a primarily emotional message, experts say, is effective political strategy.</p>

<p>"We think we think like scientists, carefully and objectively weighing the evidence and facts before us," said Jennifer Mercieca, a communications professor at Texas A&amp;M University.</p>

<p>"But we actually think like lawyers, building a case for our preferred position."</p>

<p>The appeal to so-called emotional truths -- things that "feel true," even if they are not rooted in empirical evidence -- is powerful, she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"When speakers try to persuade based on affective truth it's harder to hold them accountable because it's difficult to argue against a feeling."</p>

<h2>Moving away from Biden</h2>

<p>The shift from Biden's campaign -- which presented an argument based heavily on Trump being "a threat to democracy" -- has been striking.</p>

<p>Since he dropped out, a New York Times/Siena poll "found that anger and resignation had been subsiding among voters of both parties, while joy had jumped."</p>

<p>Mashail Malik, an assistant professor of government at Harvard University, said Harris's shift can be explained by the "exhaustion" that negative emotions can cause.</p>

<p>"I think fear was failing to fully inspire a wider range of potential Democratic voters, many of whom are exhausted from the negativity that had so overtaken the news cycle," she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The messaging about joy seems designed to alleviate some of this exhaustion and to offer an alternative to fear."</p>

<p>Moreover, she argues, it offers a way for Harris to differentiate herself from her current boss Biden.</p>

<p>That gets much harder when drilling down on issues, rather than atmospherics.</p>

<p>On US support for Israel's war in Gaza, for example, Harris has tried to satisfy Democratic critics mostly through a shift in tone on the massive loss of civilian Palestinian life. That, however, is not likely to heal the small but significant rift in the party.</p>

<h2>Trump's appeals</h2>

<p>Republican candidate Trump has been using appeals to emotions for years, with his speeches often heavy on rhetoric and light on facts -- or filled with outright fictions.</p>

<p>This campaign, the former president has focused on what he calls an "invasion" of migrants into the United States. He calls US cities "war zones."</p>

<p>"Kamala Harris will deliver crime, chaos, destruction and death," he said in a recent campaign speech in Michigan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In an August 27 interview with talk show host Phil McGraw, Trump repeated a frequent line from his stump speech: "If she wins, they're going to destroy our country."</p>

<p>The apocalyptic messaging might be misleading but it speaks to emotions that Trump's supporters consider true.</p>

<p>Malik said Trump's appeals to pride and resentment are "very similar to populist leaders around the world, including not only in Europe but also in Latin America and South Asia."</p>

<p>"It's a familiar story," she said. "And it usually doesn't end well."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China will no longer send children overseas for adoption, the government said, overturning a more than three-decade rule that was rooted in its once strict one-child policy.</p>

<p>More than 160,000 Chinese children have been adopted by families across the world since 1992, when China first opened its doors to international adoption.</p>

<p>Around 82,000 of these children, mostly girls, have been adopted in the United States, according to China's Children International (CCI).</p>

<p>On Thursday, Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Mao Ning said the Chinese government had adjusted its cross-border adoption policy to be "in line" with international trends.</p>

<p>"Apart from the adoption of a child or stepchild of blood relatives of the same generation who are within three generations of foreigners coming to China to adopt, China will not send children abroad for adoption," Mao said.</p>

<p>"We express our appreciation to those foreign governments and families, who wish to adopt Chinese children, for their good intention and the love and kindness they have shown," she added.</p>

<p>It was not immediately clear what would happen to families who were in the process of adopting children from China.</p>

<p>The rule change comes as Chinese policymakers struggle to encourage young couples to get married and have children after the population fell for two consecutive years.</p>

<p>China has one of the lowest birth rates globally and has been trying to incentivise young women to have children. Many, however, have been put off by the high cost of childcare, worries over job security and their future outlook as growth in the world's second largest economy slows.</p>

<p>China implemented a rigorous one-child policy from 1979-2015 to reduce its population. When families were restricted to having only one child, many opted to keep male children, who are traditionally expected to be the main caregivers for their families, and give up females for adoption.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; China's move to halt international adoptions comes after the Netherlands in May banned its citizens from adopting children from foreign countries. In Denmark, people will no longer be able to adopt children from abroad after the only adoption agency said it was stopping operations.</p>

<p>The gumdrop-shaped capsule landed gently at the White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico at approximately 0401 GMT (9:30 am), its descent slowed by parachutes and cushioned by airbags, having departed the ISS around six hours earlier.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After years of delays, Starliner launched in June for what was meant to be a roughly weeklong test mission -- a final shakedown before it could finally be certified to ferry crew to and from the orbital laboratory.</p>

<p>But unexpected thruster malfunctions and helium leaks on its way up derailed those plans, and NASA ultimately decided it was safer to bring astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams back on a rival SpaceX Crew Dragon -- though they'll have to wait until February 2025.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An advertisement warning that the US was ready to deploy its F-16 fighter jets to protect its allies in the face of Iranian threats appeared on the dating app Tinder in Lebanon.</p>

<p>The warning, in Arabic, read "Do not take up arms against the United States or its partners. America will protect its partners in the face of threats from the Iranian regime and its proxies."</p>

<p>The advertisement also had images of US fighter jets on it and stated that the US was "fully prepared" to use F-16 and A-10 aircraft that were already in the area.</p>

<p>The bizarre platform to advertise such a warning has raised eyebrows about the US military's information operations aimed at influencing the views of overseas audiences and reshaping what it calls misleading narratives.</p>

<p>A freelance journalist based in Lebanon found the advertisement on Tinder last week and said that swiping right redirected him to a Central Command post on X. The X post had a similar warning on it.</p>

<p>After he posted screenshots of the ad on X, his post went viral.</p>

<p>"Opened Tinder in Lebanon. Was greeted by an ad from CENTCOM saying in Arabic, "Do not take arms against the US and its partners", that F-16s and A-10s are already prepared, and that the US will "protect its partners in the face of threats from the Iranian regime and its agents," his post read.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican candidate Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Kamala Harris are all set to participate in the highly-anticipated first Presidential debate next week. Ahead of the September 10 face-off, Ms Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, spoke about their debates as a married couple in a new interview with 'Pod Save America'. The US Vice President and her husband were both accomplished lawyers before entering politics, Mr Emhoff shared in the interview. So, when <em>'Pod Save America' </em>cohost Tommy Vietor asked the second gentleman about the upcoming presidential debate between Ms Harris and former US President Donald Trump, Mr Emhoff revealed that he has never won a debate against his wife.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I assume no one has debated with her more often than you have," Mr Vietor said. "What should we expect? What should we look for?" he asked, as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.businessinsider.in/politics/world/news/doug-emhoff-says-hes-never-won-a-debate-against-kamala-harris/articleshow/113135379.cms" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Business Insider</em></a>.</p>

<p>"I haven't won one," Mr Emhoff said of debating Ms Harris. He then went on to call Ms Harris a "great debater" and "first-class trial lawyer".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's not like we're in a debate, but I realize if we're talking about something, any really good lawyer will lay little traps for you along the way, and as I'm going through this discussion about some husband-wife thing, I say 'Oh, that's what you're doing!'" he said, adding, "I was a pretty good trial lawyer too."</p>

<p>Notably, before entering politics, Ms Harris served as district attorney of San Francisco and attorney general of California. Mr Emhoff, on the other hand, was a partner at DLA Piper in Los Angeles specialising in intellectual property and entertainment and media law. The couple celebrated their 10-year anniversary in August.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Kamala Harris was exactly the right person for me at an important time in my life. At this moment in this nation's history she is exactly the right president," the 59-year-old said last month at the Democratic National Convention.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kamala Harris will face-off Donald Trump on September 10, Tuesday in a debate hosted by ABC News. The campaigns have traded barbs while negotiating the host network and rules of the debate, such as whether their microphones will stay unmuted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Regarding this, Mr Emhoff said, "It's Donald Trump, so who the hell knows what you're going to get, but I know from her she's going to be talking about us, she's going to be talking about the American people."&nbsp;</p>

<p>ABC News is hosting the second presidential debate on Tuesday, September 10, at 9 pm ET. It will be the first time Ms Harris and Mr Trump debate each other. The debate will be held at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Roughly one in six people are affected by infertility worldwide. And with more than half the worlds population now living in urban areas, researchers are interested in whether living in noisy and polluted cities could be to blame.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>Roughly <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.who.int/news/item/04-04-2023-1-in-6-people-globally-affected-by-infertility">one in six people</a> are affected by infertility worldwide and with more than half the world's population now living in <a href="https://esa.un.org/unpd/wup/">urban areas</a>, researchers are interested in whether living in noisy and polluted cities could be to blame.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://press.psprings.co.uk/bmj/september/infertility.pdf">new study</a> in Denmark has used nationwide data to explore infertility.</p>

<p>It found long-term exposure to air pollution and traffic noise may be associated with higher infertility – but these factors affect men and women differently.</p>

<h2><strong>What do pollution and noise do to the body?</strong></h2>

<p>We know <a href="https://www.who.int/teams/environment-climate-change-and-health/healthy-urban-environments/transport/health-risks#:%7E:text=Transport%20accounted%20for%20about%2023,effects%20(IPCC%2C%202018)">traffic pollution</a> has undeniable impacts on the environment. Its negative effects on human <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016041202200188X?via%3Dihub">health</a> are also well established, with links to cancers and heart disease.</p>

<p>Inhaled chemicals from polluted air may also travel to the reproductive tract via the blood. They can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9825271/">reduce fertility</a> by either disrupting hormones or causing direct damage to eggs and sperm.</p>

<p>The effects of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/36/39/2653/2398234">traffic noise</a> on health are less clear, but some research suggests this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6878772/">affects stress hormones</a>, which could alter fertility.</p>

<h2><strong>What did they look at?</strong></h2>

<p>This <a href="http://press.psprings.co.uk/bmj/september/infertility.pdf">new study</a> was conducted in Denmark, which collects data about every resident into multiple <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-014-9930-3">national databases</a> over their lifetime, using a unique identification number.</p>

<p>Nationwide data allows researchers to investigate links between a person's health and factors such as where they live, their job, education history and family. This method is called “data linkage”.</p>

<p>The study aimed to capture people who were likely to be trying to get pregnant, and therefore at risk of receiving an infertility diagnosis.</p>

<p>Over 2 million men and women were identified as being of reproductive age. The study looked at those who were:</p>

<ul>
	<li>aged 30 - 45</li>
	<li>living together or married</li>
	<li>with less than two children</li>
	<li>living in Denmark between January 1 2000 and December 31 2017.</li>
</ul>

<p>It excluded anyone who was diagnosed with infertility before age 30, lived alone or in a registered same-sex partnership. People with incomplete information (like a missing address) were also excluded.</p>

<p>There were 377,850 women and 526,056 men who fit these criteria.</p>

<p>The study did not survey them. Instead, over a five-year period it cross-checked detailed information about where they lived and whether they received an infertility diagnosis, collected from the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1403494811401482?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed">Danish National Patient Register</a>.</p>

<p>Researchers also estimated how much each residential address was exposed to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969799002168">road traffic noise</a> (measured in decibels) and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S135223101830726X">air pollution</a>, or how much fine particulate matter (called PM2.5) is in the air.</p>

<h2><strong>What did they find?</strong></h2>

<p>Infertility was diagnosed in 16,172 men (out of 526,056) and 22,672 women (out of 377,850).</p>

<p>The study found the risk of infertility was 24% greater for men exposed to PM2.5 levels 1.6 times higher than <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240034228">recommended</a> by the World Health Organization.</p>

<p>For women, exposure to traffic noise at 10.2 decibels higher than average (55-60 decibels) was associated with 14% increased infertility risk for those over 35.</p>

<p>Risks were similar based on residing in urban or rural areas, and when accounting for education and income.</p>

<h2><strong>What does it suggest?</strong></h2>

<p>The study highlights how environmental exposure can have immediate and long-term effects, and may affect male and female reproduction differently.</p>

<p>After puberty, men <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6010318/">constantly produce</a> sperm – up to 300 million a day. The impact of environmental changes on male fertility – such as exposure to toxic pollutants — tends to show up more quickly than in females, affecting sperm number and quality.</p>

<p>In contrast, women are born with <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/article/93/5/111,%201-7/2434274">all their eggs</a>, and cannot produce new ones. Eggs have some “<a href="https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/24/2/119/4825064">damage control</a>” mechanisms to protect them from environmental hazards across a lifetime.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean eggs are not sensitive to damage. However it may take longer than the five years of exposure this study looked at for the impact on women to become clear.</p>

<p>It is possible even longer-term studies could reveal a similar impact for pollution on women.</p>

<h2><strong>Is data linkage a good way to look at fertility?</strong></h2>

<p>Data linkage can be a powerful tool to uncover links between environmental exposures and health. This allows assessments in large numbers of people, over long periods of time, like this recent Danish study.</p>

<p>But there are inherent limitations to these types of studies. Without surveying individuals or looking at biological factors – like hormone levels and body mass — the research relies on some assumptions.</p>

<p>For example, this study involved some major assumptions about whether or not couples were actually trying to conceive.</p>

<p>It also calculated people's exposure to noise and air pollution according to their address, assuming they were at home.</p>

<p>A more precise picture could be painted if information was gathered from individuals about their exposure and experiences, including with fertility.</p>

<p>For example, surveys could include factors like sleep disturbance and stress, which can <a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/EHP10197">alter hormone responses</a> and impact fertility. Exposure to chemicals that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935120315930?via%3Dihub">disrupt hormones</a> is also found at home, in everyday household and in personal care products.</p>

<p>In its scale, this study is unprecedented and a useful step in exploring the potential link between air pollution, traffic noise and infertility. However more controlled studies – involving actual measures of exposure instead of estimations – would be needed to deepen our understanding of how these factors affect men and women.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 14-year-old Georgia boy who opened fire at a classroom in his school, killing two students and two teachers, was raised in a troubled home, family and neighbours have said.</p>

<p>His father, Colin Gray, bought him the AR-15 rifle he used for the shooting as a Christmas gift even after the cops had previously investigated the child for threatening to shoot people at his school in 2023.</p>

<p>His mother, Marcee, had been arrested several times on drug use and domestic violence charges.</p>

<p>A neighbour described the mother as neglectful and abusive towards her children, saying she would regularly lock Gray and his siblings out of the house and refuse to let them in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"They would be banging on the back door, just screaming like 'Mom! mom! mom!' and crying. It was absolutely devastating," she told the New York Post, adding that sometimes the children would beg for food from neighbours.</p>

<p>His mother's lengthy criminal history, which spanned 17 years, includes charges of domestic violence, drug possession, property damage and various traffic violations, including drink driving. She was in jail as recently as April</p>

<p>"I would find her in the driveway, passed out, with the car running and blaring music early in the morning," the neighbour said, adding that the woman would drive her younger son to daycare while under the influence of drugs or alcohol.</p>

<p>She said Gray didn't speak much about the abuse or acted aggressively, but she'd often see him missing school and wandering around the empty house or the forest.</p>

<p>"He wasn't a bully or a mean kid. He didn't say much. He was so quiet," she said.</p>

<p>Gray's maternal grandfather, however, blamed the teen's father, saying Gray was "just a good kid" who lived in an environment that was hostile."</p>

<p>"His dad beat up on him, I mean, I'm not talking about physical, but screaming and hollering, and he did the same thing to my daughter," he told CNN, but added that the teen never showed any signs of anger.</p>

<p>Gray's aunt told the Washington Post that her nephew was struggling with mental health issues, and had been "begging for help from everybody around him" months before the shooting.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American actress, singer and entrepreneur Selena Gomez is now a billionaire, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>, which values her net worth at $1.3 billion. Some of the wealth of the 32-year-old comes from singing, brand partnership and acting, but the "vast bulk" of her wealth is tied to her 5-year-old make-up company called Rare Beauty, the outlet said. Her brand's success has made her one of the "youngest self-made" wealthy on the Bloomberg Billionaire Index, alongside the likes of Taylor Swift and Rihanna.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-06/selena-gomez-is-a-billionaire-after-rare-beauty-success-exclusive" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the<em> 'Only Murders in the Building'</em> star has also amassed wealth as the world's third most-followed person on Instagram behind soccer icons Cristiano Ronaldo who boasts 639 million followers on the platform and Lionel Messi who has garnered 505 million Instagram followers. Ms Gomez herself has 424 million followers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Selena Gomez has a storybook career, beginning with <em>'The Wizards of Waverly Place'</em> - a popular TV show on Disney Channel. She has a slew of other popular TV shows and film projects as well. She created a now-cancelled Max cooking show<em> 'Selena + Chef' </em>and stars alongside comedy icons Martin Short and Steve Martin on the hit show<em> 'Only Murders in the Building'</em>. The 32-year-old has also brought in tens of millions of dollars from endorsement deals with the likes of Louis Vuitton, Coach and Puma, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, despite her on-screen success, those achievements count for a relatively small fraction of her wealth. The "vast bulk" of her wealth is tied to Rare Beauty, which she launched in 2020. The brand reportedly did net sales of $400 million in the 12 months to February. She also reportedly reached out to investors for Rare Beauty, seeking a $2 billion valuation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2020, Ms Gomes revealed that she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and later said in an interview that any deal struck with her has to have an element that's charitable or in the mental health space. She started the Rare Impact Fund to help raise $100 million to help people gain access to mental health services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other revenue streams for the 32-year-old include income from her show <em>'Only Murders in the Building,'</em> which was just renewed for a fifth season where she reportedly makes $6 million a season, and a smaller slice from her music royalties.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two animal lovers who stopped on a US freeway to rescue a stranded kitten caused a three-vehicle crash -- and then lost the cat they were trying to help.</p>

<p>The couple spotted the stray moggy as they drove east on the CA-91 near Los Angeles on Wednesday, California Highway Patrol Officer Javier Navarro said.</p>

<p>The woman driver got off at the next exit and headed back to search for the cat, slowing down to 35 miles (56 kilometers) an hour in the carpool lane -- the innermost lane.</p>

<p>When they found the animal, the male passenger jumped out and grabbed the kitty, while the driver blocked traffic, causing a queue of cars.</p>

<p>"Another car comes up behind them and swerves to the left to avoid rear-ending them, clips the left rear of the last car" sending it careering towards the man holding the cat, said Navarro.</p>

<p>"The driver of that car swerves right to avoid the pedestrian, and ends up going across all lanes and hitting a semi-truck."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the man holding the cat hopped the center-divider to get out of the path of the car -- dropping the animal in the process.</p>

<p>Three vehicles were damaged in the incident, though no one was injured.</p>

<p>And the cat?</p>

<p>"He doesn't get hit, he doesn't get hurt. He made it across on his own," said Navarro.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Boeing's beleaguered Starliner left the International Space Station (ISS) on Friday, bound for Earth without the astronauts who rode up on the spaceship after NASA deemed the risk too great.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Boeing's beleaguered Starliner left the International Space Station (ISS) on Friday, bound for Earth without the astronauts who rode up on the spaceship after NASA deemed the risk too great.</p>

<p>After years of delays, Starliner launched in June for what was meant to be a roughly weeklong test mission -- a final shakedown before it could finally be certified to ferry crew to and from the orbital laboratory.</p>

<p>But unexpected thruster malfunctions and helium leaks on its way up derailed those plans, and NASA ultimately decided it was safer to bring astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams back on a rival SpaceX Crew Dragon -- though they'll have to wait until February 2025.</p>

<p>Starliner autonomously undocked from the space station at 6:04 pm Eastern Time (2204 GMT), and is set to land at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico at approximately 0403 GMT.</p>

<p>"It is time to bring Calypso home," Williams radioed to mission control, using the spaceship's nickname.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A smooth, uneventful ride is critical not only for salvaging some pride but also for Boeing's prospects of achieving certification in the future.</p>

<p>The century-old aerospace giant had carried out extensive ground testing aimed at replicating the technical issues the spaceship had experienced on its ascent, and devised plans to prevent more problems.</p>

<p>With its reputation already battered by safety concerns affecting its passenger jets, Boeing made assurances in public and in private that it could be trusted to bring the astronauts home -- an assessment not shared by NASA</p>

<p>"Boeing believed in the model that they had created that tried to predict the thruster degradation for the rest of the flight," Steve Stich, program manager for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, told reporters this week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But "the NASA team, due to the uncertainty in the modeling, could not get comfortable with that," he added, characterizing the mood during meetings as "tense."</p>

<p>- Certification decisions to come -</p>

<p>Shortly after undocking, Starliner performed a powerful "breakout burn" to quickly send it clear of the station to prevent a collision -- a maneuver that would have been unnecessary if it had crew aboard who could take manual control of the ship if needed.</p>

<p>Overall, the expectation is that Starliner will successfully carry out its parachute- and airbag-assisted landing in the desert -- just as it has during two previous uncrewed tests in 2019 and 2022.</p>

<p>But ground teams will be closely studying all aspects of its performance, particularly its nettlesome thrusters ahead of the critical "deorbit burn" that brings the spacecraft back through Earth's atmosphere, scheduled to take place at 0217 GMT.</p>

<p>NASA awarded Boeing and SpaceX multibillion-dollar contracts a decade ago to develop spacecraft to ferry astronauts to and from the ISS, following the end of the Space Shuttle program, which had left the US space agency reliant on Russian rockets for rides.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elon Musk's SpaceX, initially considered the underdog, beat the mighty Boeing to the punch, and has successfully flown dozens of astronauts since 2020.</p>

<p>The Starliner program meanwhile has been plagued by setbacks.</p>

<p>In 2019, during a first uncrewed test flight, a software defect meant the capsule failed to rendezvous with the ISS. A second software bug could have caused a catastrophic collision between its modules, but was caught and fixed just in time.</p>

<p>Then in 2021, with the rocket on the launchpad for a new flight, blocked valves forced another postponement.</p>

<p>The ship finally reached the ISS in May 2022 on a non-crewed launch. But other problems including weak parachutes and flammable tape in the cabin that needed to be removed caused further delays to the crewed test.</p>

<p>For the current mission, Wilmore and Williams were strapped into their seats and ready to fly twice before late "scrubs" due to technical hitches sent them back to their quarters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The 20-year-old arrested accused, Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, allegedly planned a terrorist attack in New York City around October 7.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Pakistani national residing in Canada was arrested after being charged with attempting to provide material support and resources to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), a statement by the US Department of Justice said. The 20-year-old arrested accused, Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, allegedly planned a terrorist attack in New York City around October 7 "with the intent of slaughtering in the name of ISIS, as many Jewish people as possible," Attorney General Merrick B Garland said, as per the statement.</p>

<p>"The defendant was allegedly determined to kill Jewish people here in the United States, nearly one year after Hamas' horrific attack on Israel. This investigation was led by the FBI, and I am proud of the terrific work by the FBI team and our partners to disrupt Khan's plan," FBI Director Christopher Wray said.</p>

<p>"The FBI will continue to work closely with our partners to investigate and hold accountable those who seek to commit violence in the name of ISIS or other terrorist organizations. Fighting terrorism remains the FBI's top priority," Wray added.</p>

<p>As alleged in the complaint, Khan, attempted to travel from Canada to New York City, where he intended to carry out a mass shooting in support of ISIS at a Jewish center in Brooklyn, New York. Khan began posting on social media and communicating with others on an encrypted messaging application about his support for ISIS in or about November 2023, when, among other things, Khan distributed ISIS propaganda videos and literature. Subsequently, he began communicating with two undercover law enforcement officers, the statement said.</p>

<p>Khan repeatedly instructed the undercover law enforcement officers to obtain AR-style assault rifles, ammunition, and other materials to carry out the attacks, and identified locations where the attacks would take place. Khan also provided details about how he would cross the border from Canada into the United States to conduct the attacks. During these conversations, Khan emphasised that "Oct 7th and Oct 11th are the best days for targeting the Jews" because October 7 is the anniversary of the Hamas attack on Israel. October 11 is Yom Kippur, a Jewish religious holiday.</p>

<p>The Pakistani national is charged with one count of attempting to provide material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organisation. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the US Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>

<p>The Israel Defense Forces on October 7 last year declared a state of readiness for war following a massive barrage of rockets from the Gaza Strip and infiltration of Hamas terrorists into Israel, and the war is on ever since.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A Turkish-American woman was shot dead Friday while demonstrating against Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank town of Beita, where the army acknowledged opening fire.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Turkish-American woman was shot dead Friday while demonstrating against Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank town of Beita, where the army acknowledged opening fire.</p>

<p>Turkey identified the woman as Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, condemning her death, while the United States called it a "tragic" event and called on its ally Israel to carry out an investigation.</p>

<p>While Washington stopped short from blaming anyone, the UN rights office directly accused Israeli forces of killing Eygi, saying Israeli security forces "shot in the head and killed" her.</p>

<p>The incident occurred as Israeli forces withdrew from a deadly 10-day raid in the West Bank city of Jenin, another flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, amid the ongoing Gaza war.</p>

<p>The raid, part of broader Israeli military operations, has drawn international criticism, with Israeli ally Germany warning against escalating military actions in the West Bank.</p>

<p>The UN said Eygi, 26, was participating in a "peaceful anti-settlement protest" in Beita, scene of weekly demonstrations. Israeli settlements in the West Bank -- where some 490,000 people live -- are illegal under international law.</p>

<p>She arrived at the Rafidia hospital in Nablus "with a gunshot in the head" and was later pronounced dead, said hospital director Fouad Nafaa.</p>

<p>Turkey said she was killed by "Israeli occupation soldiers". President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the Israeli action as "barbaric".</p>

<p>"We are deeply disturbed by the tragic death of an American citizen," said White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre aboard Air Force One travelling with President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>"We have reached out to the government of Israel to ask for more information and request an investigation into the incident," she added.</p>

<p>The Israeli army said it was looking into her death.</p>

<p>Eygi was a member of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), a pro-Palestinian organisation, and was in Beita for a weekly demonstration against Israeli settlements, said Neta Golan, the group's co-founder.</p>

<p>'Series of crimes'</p>

<p>Beita mayor Mahmud Barham said he was told an Israeli soldier "fired two shots" at protesters demonstrating against an Israeli settlement outpost, with one bullet hitting Eygi "in the head".</p>

<p>An ISM activist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the shot that killed Eygi was "a shot to kill" and reported seeing "blood coming out of her head".</p>

<p>The Israeli army said its forces "responded with fire toward a main instigator of violent activity who hurled rocks at the forces and posed a threat to them".</p>

<p>Since Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel which triggered the ongoing war in Gaza, Israeli troops or settlers have killed at least 662 Palestinians in the West Bank, according to the Palestinian health ministry.</p>

<p>At least 23 Israelis, including security forces, have been killed in Palestinian attacks during the same period, according to Israeli officials.</p>

<p>Responding to Friday's incident, Hamas strongly condemned "the crime committed by the Zionist occupation army" resulting in Eygi's death.</p>

<p>Hussein al-Sheikh, secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization executive committee, said on X that he extended condolences to Eygi's family.</p>

<p>"Another crime added to the series of crimes committed daily by the occupation forces, which require that their perpetrators be held accountable in international courts," he said.</p>

<p>Jenin pullout</p>

<p>There was no official confirmation of the withdrawal from Jenin, but AFP journalists reported residents returning home.</p>

<p>The raid on Jenin and other regions of the West Bank killed "35 terrorists', the Israeli army said Friday, stressing that its "counterterrorism operation has yet to be concluded".</p>

<p>The UN rights office said however that 36 Palestinians, including eight children, were killed in the 10-day operation launched on August 28.</p>

<p>The Jenin pullout came with Israel at loggerheads with key ally the United States over talks to forge a truce in the Gaza war, now nearly in its 12th month.</p>

<p>On Thursday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Israel and Hamas to finalise a deal, saying: "I think based on what I've seen, 90 percent is agreed."</p>

<p>But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied this, telling Fox News: "It's not close."</p>

<p>Washington and fellow mediators Qatar and Egypt have been pushing a proposal to bridge gaps between both sides.</p>

<p>Netanyahu insists on a military presence on the border between Gaza and Egypt along the so-called Philadelphi Corridor.</p>

<p>Hamas is demanding a complete Israeli withdrawal, saying it agreed months ago to a proposal outlined by US President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Visiting Israel on Friday, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said "a purely military approach is no solution to the situation in Gaza", after the recovery of six dead hostages announced at the weekend.</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians including some hostages killed in captivity, according to official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Of 251 hostages seized by Palestinian militants during the attack, 97 remain in Gaza including 33 the Israeli military says are dead. Scores were released during a one-week truce in November.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has so far killed at least 40,878 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.</p>

<p>Most of the dead are women and children, according to the UN rights office.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Hindus for America First has announced it will endorse Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and launch a campaign against Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the key battleground states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hindus for America First, a newly created grassroots organisation, has announced it will endorse Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and launch a campaign against Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris in the key battleground states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina.</p>

<p>Announcing the decision on Thursday, Hindus for America First chairman and founder Utsav Sanduja claimed that Harris would be "very destabilising for Indo-US relations".</p>

<p>"The concern is that if Kamala becomes the president of the United States, then she might put in some liberal wolves on the bench who may actually reverse the Supreme Court on this (and) that impacting the Asian-American voters," he said.</p>

<p>The Biden-Harris administration has not kept the border secure. Harris is the second in command after President Joe Biden and did nothing to stem the flow of illegal immigrants into the US, he said.</p>

<p>"As a consequence of all these illegal immigrants, we've seen record crime, record drug smuggling... and it ends up affecting minority communities, in particular many of the Asian-American business owners," he said.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Sanduja praised Trump's efforts to make the immigration system more merit-based. He also lauded the former president's efforts to bolster defence and technology cooperation with India.</p>

<p>Trump is "very pro-India". He was able to cultivate an excellent relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and collaborate on many defence projects that would enable India to take on China, he said.</p>

<p>Unlike Harris, who made a lot of "disparaging remarks" about the government and people of India, Trump did not interfere in the country's internal affairs, Sanduja said.</p>

<p>"Kamala Harris would be very destabilising for Indo-US relations," he claimed.</p>

<p>He said Hindus for America First is organising efforts among Hindus in battleground states like Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, and Nevada against Harris.</p>

<p>Sanduja said the global Hindu community is concerned about the attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>"We would request all political entities concerned to raise this issue," he said, adding that the Hindus of Bangladesh are suffering.</p>

<p>"I give President Trump a lot of credit. Under his leadership, the State Department acknowledged the persecution of Hindus in various parts of the subcontinent, like in Afghanistan...Pakistan, it was President Trump that took the leadership in acknowledging Hindu genocide," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday said that his country desired peace with all neighbours, asserting that progress and peace are "intertwined".</p>

<p>Sharif made the remarks while addressing Defence and Martyrs Day here.</p>

<p>He said Pakistan wants peaceful relations with all its neighbours but added that the country would not compromise its freedom and independence.</p>

<p>"Pakistan has no intention of aggression against any country…It has played a role in peace and stability in the region," he said.</p>

<p>"Peace is our first desire" as progress and peace are "intertwined", he said.</p>

<p>The ceremony was attended by the army's top brass, senior military and governmental officials, and families of soldiers, among others.</p>

<p>Army chief General Asim Munir, in his address, said the country would "not allow political differences to turn into hatred".</p>

<p>He asserted that the strong relations between the army and the public would act as the foundation to defeat any enemy trying to create rifts between the two.</p>

<p>"The relation between the armed forces and the nation is of heart," he said, adding that the nation always strengthened the army in all fields including, "rescue works in the events of natural disasters, foreign hostilities or war against terrorism." Speaking about the Kashmir issue, Munir said it was not just a national issue but one of regional and global significance.</p>

<p>In a message, President Asif Ali Zardari also paid tribute to the sacrifices of soldiers. He reaffirmed the nation's commitment to defend its sovereignty and supported the Armed Forces in their readiness to respond to threats.</p>

<p>Separately, the Pakistan Navy inducted two newly built warships, PNS Babur and PNS Hunain, in the Pakistan Navy fleet in Karachi on Defence Day.</p>

<p>Addressing the induction ceremony, Zardari said the inclusion of new warships will significantly increase the country's maritime security.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia will continue its special military operation until all objectives are achieved and there is currently no set deadline for when it will end, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.</p>

<p>"We must fulfill the goals that were set at the start of the special military operation," Peskov said on Friday on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum currently being held in Russia's Far East city of Vladivostok.</p>

<p>He added that it is important to ensure security and predictability for future generations, and to establish a new security architecture across the continent, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>The spokesman said that there are no specific time limits regarding when the special operation should end.</p>

<p>"The timing is not important here," Peskov noted, expressing hope however that this would be sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>The Eastern Economic Forum is underway on the campus of the Far Eastern Federal University in Vladivostok on September 3-6, 2024.</p>

<p>The main theme of the Eastern Economic Forum in 2024 is "Far East 2030. Combining strengths to create new potential".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Any Iranian transfer of ballistic missiles to Russia would mark a sharp escalation in the Ukraine war, the United States said on Friday, following reports that the two countries had deepened ties in recent weeks with such an arms transfer.</p>

<p>Reuters reported in August that Russia was expecting the imminent delivery of hundreds of Fath-360 close-range ballistic missiles from Iran and that dozens of Russian military personnel were being trained in Iran on the satellite-guided weapons for eventual use in the war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Short-range missiles have now been delivered to Russia by Iran, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing an unnamed U.S. official.</p>

<p>"We have been warning of the deepening security partnership between Russia and Iran since the outset of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and are alarmed by these reports," said White House National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett.</p>

<p>"Any transfer of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia would represent a dramatic escalation in Iran's support for Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine."</p>

<p>Another U.S. official told Reuters they were watching the potential Iranian-Russian missile transfers closely.</p>

<p>The potential moves come after the United States and partners, including in Europe, warned that such a step by Iran could meet with consequences. The Western countries have been watching Iran and Russia's deepening ties in recent months with increasing concern.</p>

<p>Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York said on Friday that Tehran's position on the Ukraine conflict was unchanged.</p>

<p>"Iran considers the provision of military assistance to the parties engaged in the conflict - which leads to increased human casualties, destruction of infrastructure, and a distancing from ceasefire negotiations - to be inhumane," it said.</p>

<p>"Thus, not only does Iran abstain from engaging in such actions itself, but it also calls upon other countries to cease the supply of weapons to the sides involved in the conflict," the mission said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Pakistani man living in Canada has been arrested on charges of plotting to carry out an attack on Jews in New York City, the US Justice Department said Friday.</p>

<p>Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, 20, also known as Shahzeb Jadoon, was arrested on Wednesday on charges filed in the United States, the department said.</p>

<p>"The defendant is alleged to have planned a terrorist attack in New York City around October 7 of this year with the stated goal of slaughtering, in the name of (the Islamic State), as many Jewish people as possible," Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Thanks to the investigative work of the FBI, and the quick action of our Canadian law enforcement partners, the defendant was taken into custody," he said.</p>

<p>According to the criminal complaint, Khan planned to travel to New York and carry out a mass shooting in support of IS at a Jewish center in Brooklyn on the anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel.</p>

<p>He revealed his plans in conversations with conspirators who were actually undercover law enforcement officers, it said.</p>

<p>Khan was taken into custody by Canadian authorities in the town of Ormstown some 12 miles (19 kilometers) from the US-Canada border.</p>

<p>The Justice Department said it will seek his extradition from Canada.</p>

<p>Khan is charged with attempting to provide material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization. He could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine shot down 27 out of 44 Shahed-131 and Shahed-136 drones launched by Russia overnight, the Ukrainian Air Force said.</p>

<p>Eight drones have disappeared from the radars, while another one has flown in the direction of the Russia-held area in the Donetsk region, it said on Friday in a post on social media app Telegram.</p>

<p>Several drones remained in the Ukrainian airspace as of Friday morning, the Air Force said.</p>

<p>Apart from the drones, Russia fired Kh-59 guided missiles and Kh-31P anti-radiation missiles at Ukraine, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>In the attack one person was killed and 30 others injured in the town of Pavlograd in the central Dnipropetrovsk region, said regional governor Sergii Lysak.</p>

<p>The air defence was also activated in the Kyiv region, but there were no casualties or damage to critical and housing infrastructure, according to the Kyiv Regional Military Administration.</p>

<p>The governor of the northeastern region of Kharkiv said a missile attack damaged residential buildings and injured three people in the town of Liubotyn on Friday morning.</p>

<p>Lysak said the Air Force shot down five drones and one missile over the region.</p>

<p>Various overnight attacks in this central region injured two people, damaged over 12 homes and impacted power lines and gas pipelines, he added.</p>

<p>Lviv regional authorities said drone debris fell in an industrial zone, setting fire to four trucks. A team of 32 firefighters had doused the fire by Friday morning and the governor reported no injuries during the attack.</p>

<p>Another fire caused by falling debris had been put out in the southern region of Mykolaiv where the Air Force shot down seven drones, its governor said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The small passenger plane involved in a crash that killed 18 people in Nepal in July was carrying a load and travelling at a speed that did not match guidelines at the time of the accident, a government-led investigation team said in a preliminary report on Friday.</p>

<p>The aircraft owned by Nepal's Saurya Airlines crashed shortly after taking off from the capital Kathmandu on July 24, killing all 17 passengers and the co-pilot, with only the captain surviving.</p>

<p>The report said the airline had not complied with the "load weighing, loading and securing of load requirements" and that the plane speed given in the "operation flight plan of the event flight, as well as recorded in the FDR, were inconsistent with the Quick Reference Handbook".</p>

<p>"We found problems with the plane's speed and the load it was carrying. Also, proper, secure latching of load was absent," Ratish Chandra Lal Suman, chairman of the probe team, told Reuters by phone.</p>

<p>The panel said that guidelines on baggage and cargo weighing, its distribution and latching should all be adhered to.</p>

<p>The 50-seater CRJ-200 plane carrying two crew members and 17 technicians was heading for regular maintenance to Nepal's new Pokhara airport, which has aircraft maintenance hangars that are unavailable in adequate numbers at Kathmandu airport.</p>

<p>Those on board were Nepali citizens except for one engineer from Yemen.</p>

<p>Nearly 360 people have died in plane or helicopter crashes in the country since 2000.</p>

<p>Nepal has been criticised for its poor air safety record, where many airlines fly to small airports in remote hills and near mountains shrouded in cloud. Nepal is home to eight of the world's 14 tallest mountain peaks.</p>

<p>The country's main airport is ringed by mountains, affecting wind direction and intensity and making takeoff and landing a challenge for pilots.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

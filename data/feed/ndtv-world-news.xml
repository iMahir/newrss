       <description><![CDATA[The India-Canada relations nosedived after Justin Trudeau said last year that there was credible intelligence linking India's government to the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India and Canada have been dealing with an unprecedented diplomatic crisis after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged that Indian government agents were involved in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada. India has rejected Canada's allegations, terming it "absurd" and "politically motivated."</p>

<p>On Monday, Canada expelled six Indian diplomats and consular officials in connection with a probe of the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ndtv-explains-hardeep-singh-nijjar-killing-lawrence-bishnoi-gang-trade-talks-how-india-canada-relations-soured-6793249">killing of Nijjar in British Columbia</a> in 2023.</p>

<p>India has also announced its decision to expel six Canadian diplomats, which include Canada's Acting High Commissioner in India, Steward Ross Wheeler, Deputy High Commissioner in India Patrick Hebert and First Secretary Marie Catherine Joly.</p>

<p>Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner, Mike Duheme on Monday (local time) claimed that they have information on certain criminal activity carried out by agents of the Indian government.</p>

<p>He said, "In the past few years and more recently, law enforcement agencies in Canada have successfully investigated and charged a significant number of individuals for their direct involvement in homicides, extortions and other criminal acts of violence. In addition, there have been well over a dozen credible imminent threats to life which have led to the conduct of duty to warn, by law enforcement with members of South Asian community and specifically, members of the pro-Khalistan movement."</p>

<p>In a statement on Monday, India "strongly" rejected a diplomatic communication from Canada suggesting that the Indian High Commissioner and other diplomats were "persons of interest" in an investigation and termed it as "preposterous imputations" and part of the political agenda of the Justin Trudeau government.</p>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's hostility to India has long been in evidence and his government has consciously provided space to violent extremists and terrorists "to harass, threaten and intimidate Indian diplomats and community leaders in Canada".</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-expels-6-canadian-diplomats-amid-spiraling-tension-6789267">India-Canada relations reached a new low</a> after Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing in 2023. However, the history of strained ties between India and Canada extends beyond current events.</p>

<h3><strong>Events That Led To Strained Ties Between India And Canada</strong></h3>

<p><strong>February 2018:</strong> A convicted Khalistani terrorist Jaspal Atwal, who was active in the banned International Sikh Youth Federation, posed with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's former wife Sophie Trudeau at an event in Mumbai, during the Canadian first family's visit to India.</p>

<p>Jaspal Atwal was also invited for a formal dinner with the Canadian Prime Minister, hosted by the Canadian High Commissioner in Delhi. However, the invitation to Atwal to Trudeau's reception was rescinded. Atwal was convicted of the attempted murder of Punjab minister, Malkiat Singh Sidhu, on Vancouver Island in 1986.</p>

<p><strong>June 2023:</strong> Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar was shot outside a Gurdwara in British Columbia's Surrey on June 18, 2023.</p>

<p><strong>August 2023:</strong> A Hindu temple was vandalised in Canada by extremist elements, with Khalistan referendum posters in the late hours of Saturday, Australia Today reported. The incident happened in British Columbia province in Canada.</p>

<p><strong>September 2023:</strong> Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited India to attend the G20 Summit on September 9-10 last year. During his bilateral talks with Trudeau on the sidelines of the G20 Summit, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-modi-conveys-strong-concerns-about-anti-india-activities-of-extremist-elements-in-canada-to-justin-trudeau-4377475">Prime Minister Narendra Modi</a> raised "strong concerns" about the continuous "anti-India activities" by extremist elements in Canada, and stated that it is essential for the two countries to cooperate in dealing with such threats, according to MEA.</p>

<p>Even as Canadian PM Trudeau was in India for the G20 Leaders' summit, Khalistani secessionists held a so-called 'Referendum' in Surrey, British Columbia.</p>

<p>Designated terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun was present at the gathering of the Khalistani separatists held at the Guru Nanak Singh Gurudwara in Surrey. He used intimidating language against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and other leaders.</p>

<p><strong>September 18, 2023:</strong>&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/khalistani-terrorist-hardeep-singh-nijjar-killing-canada-pm-justin-trudeaus-fresh-charge-deepens-diplomatic-row-with-india-4415993">Justin Trudeau</a> made the stunning revelation in the House of Commons that there was credible intelligence linking India's government to the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar outside Gurdwara.</p>

<p>In the aftermath, India swiftly retaliated by issuing a statement that denied any involvement in the issue, terming them "absurd and politically motivated."</p>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs has said that Canada has consistently given space to anti-India extremists. According to the MEA, Canada has not been able to present any evidence to back its claims over Nijjar's killing.</p>

<p>India also suspended its visa services in Canada after Trudeau alleged the Indian government's involvement in the killing of a Khalistani terrorist in June.</p>

<p><strong>October 2023:</strong> Canada pulled out 41 diplomats from India and also halted its visa and consular services in Chandigarh, Mumbai, and Bengaluru consulates in the wake of the Union government's decision to strip them of their immunity.</p>

<p>This came after New Delhi conveyed its concerns to Ottawa over the disproportionate number of diplomats in India and sought a 'parity' in diplomatic strength.</p>

<p>Later in October, India resumed visa services in Canada for four categories after a considered review of the security situation which "takes into account some recent Canadian measures in this regard".</p>

<p>Entry visa, Business visa, Medical visa and Conference visa are four categories in which India has decided to resume visa services in Canada with effect from October 26.</p>

<p><strong>November 2023:</strong> Indian High Commissioner in Canada, Sanjay Kumar Verma said that India is only asking for "specific and relevant" evidence in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar so that it can help Canada in reaching the conclusion of the investigation.</p>

<p>The National Investigation Agency (NIA) registered a case against 'listed individual terrorist' Gurpatwant Singh Pannun over his viral video threatening the passengers flying in Air India and the airlines with a global blockade and closure of its operations from November 19.</p>

<p>The NIA booked Pannun under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. In the video, Pannun urged the Sikhs not to fly on Air India planes on and after November 19 claiming a threat to their lives if they flew on Air India. He also threatened that Air India would not be allowed to operate in the world.</p>

<p><strong>April 2024:</strong> At the Khalsa Day Celebrations that took place in Toronto, loud chants of pro-Khalistan slogans were seen being raised in the presence of Justin Trudeau, as well as opposition leader Pierre Poilievre.</p>

<p>As Trudeau was about to take the stage for his address to mark Khalsa Day, the chants were heard getting louder till he arrived and commenced his speech in the video released by Canada-based CPAC TV. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow were also present at the event.</p>

<p><strong>May 2024:</strong> The Canadian Police arrested and charged three individuals in connection with the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar. The three individuals were identified as Karanpreet Singh (28), Kamalpreet Singh (22), and Karan Brar (22).</p>

<p>A few days later, the Canadian Police arrested a fourth suspect over his alleged involvement in the killing of Nijjar. The accused was identified as Amandeep Singh (22).</p>

<p><strong>June 2024:</strong> Canada's Members of Parliament from all parties observed a moment of silence for Nijjar.</p>

<p><strong>July 2024:</strong> The BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Edmonton fell victim to vandalism. Member of Parliament for Nepean, Chandra Arya, voiced deep concern over the escalating incidents of hate-fueled violence directed at Hindu-Canadian communities.</p>

<p><strong>October 2024:</strong> On October 15, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hardeep-singh-nijjar-killing-bishnoi-gang-canada-bishnoi-gang-linked-to-indian-government-agents-canada-cops-big-claim-6792233">Justin Trudeau</a> accused agents of the Indian government on Monday of engaging in "clandestine information-gathering techniques, coercive behavior targeting Canadians, and involvement in threatening and violent acts."</p>

<p>Citing evidence from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Trudeau claimed that Indian government officials were involved in activities that posed a threat to public safety.</p>

<p>"As the RCMP Commissioner stated earlier they have clear and compelling evidence that agents of the Government of India have engaged in and continue to engage in activities that pose a significant threat to public safety. This includes clandestine information-gathering techniques, coercive behavior targeting South Asian Canadians, and involvement in a dozen threatening and violating acts, including murder. This is unacceptable," Trudeau alleged while addressing the press conference.</p>

<p>He further claimed that Canadian law enforcement had "made several attempts" to work with Indian counterparts on these matters but were "repeatedly refused."</p>

<p>Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs Melanie Joly has said that the decision to expel Indian diplomats was based on evidence gathered by the RCMP in the Nijjar killing case and urged the Indian government to support the ongoing probe for the benefit of two nations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[India-Canada diplomatic ties soured further this week after allegations by Canadian federal police that "agents" of Delhi are working with organised criminals to "target (the) South Asian community... specifically pro-Khalistani elements" there.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India-Canada diplomatic ties soured further this week after allegations by Canadian federal police that "agents" of Delhi are working with organised criminals - including the Bishnoi gang linked to last week's <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/how-shooters-used-procession-firecrackers-as-cover-to-kill-baba-siddique-6782217" target="_blank">murder of ex-Maharashtra minister Baba Siddique</a> - to "target (the) South Asian community... specifically pro-Khalistani elements" in that country.</p>

<p>The allegations were preceded by each side ejecting six diplomats, including high-ranking envoys like Canada's acting High Commissioner, Stewart Wheeler, and India's High Commissioner, Sanjay Verma. Delhi later said it was pulling its staff over security concerns.</p>

<p>India issued a stern rebuttal to Canada's claims about its 'expelled' staff being 'persons of interest' in cases of alleged extortion and murder, slamming the "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/38417" target="_blank">preposterous imputations</a>" and the "political agenda" of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government before an election.</p>

<p>That was followed by Mr Trudeau holding a press conference - after his police force's claims - in which he backed the cops' charges and criticised "a fundamental error" - that India thinks it can "engage in supporting criminal activity against Canadians, here on Canadian soil".</p>

<p><strong>READ |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hardeep-singh-nijjar-killing-bishnoi-gang-canada-bishnoi-gang-linked-to-indian-government-agents-canada-cops-big-claim-6792233" target="_blank">"Bishnoi Gang Linked To Indian Government Agents": Canada Cops' Claim</a></p>

<p>"Whether it be murders or extortion or other violent acts, it is absolutely unacceptable," Mr Trudeau said, claiming also that his administration had "shared our concerns" with Delhi.</p>

<p>He said Canadian police had spoken to Indian government officials but been rebuffed.</p>

<p>The allegation - that "agents of the Indian government" are colluding with organised crime bosses to target Canadian citizens - is a sharp escalation in the diplomatic row between the two countries, a row that erupted in September last year, when Mr Trudeau accused the Indian government of involvement in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.</p>

<h3><strong>India-Canada Diplomatic Row Background</strong></h3>

<p>The India-Canada row erupted in September last year after Justin Trudeau's comment about "credible allegation" about "agents" of the Indian government being linked to the killing of Nijjar, a Canadian citizen, was shot dead outside a gurdwara in Vancouver three months earlier.</p>

<p>The "mastermind" of the Khalistani Tiger Force, a designated terror group, Nijjar was high on India's 'most wanted list' for multiple crimes; in July, anti-terror agency NIA announced a cash reward of Rs 10 lakh for his capture for the murder of a Hindu priest in Punjab's Jalandhar.</p>

<p>Responding to Canada's claims India then, as it has since, issued a firm denial, calling the allegation "absurd" and motivated", and pointing out that no evidence had been provided.</p>

<p>The allegations drove already tense relations - in July 2023 India served Canada a demarche asking for action against Khalistani separatists threatening its diplomats, and, in March, there were security breaches at Indian consulates in the United States and Canada - further south.</p>

<p>The Indian government took a very dim view of the attacks and expressed strong concerns about continuing anti-India activities of extremist elements in Canada". The External Affairs Ministry spoke about a "nexus" of criminal activity in that country should be a focus for both sides.</p>

<p>All of this followed an operation by police in India to track down and arrest Khalistani separatist and radical preacher Amritpal Singh, and over 100 members of his outfit, the 'Waris Punjab De'.</p>

<p>Delhi also served a demarche in 2022, asking Ottawa to stop a 'Khalistan referendum' by Gurpatwant Pannun's Sikhs For Justice, another separatist outfit branded as a terror group.</p>

<h3><strong>Trade Talks Paused, G20 Tension</strong></h3>

<p>Days before Canada's unsubstantiated claim about "agents of the Indian government" trade talks with Delhi were paused. Canada's Trade Minister, Mary Ng, then said the talks would remain paused while Mr Trudeau's government investigates the "credible allegations".</p>

<p><strong>READ |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/india-canada-trade-talks-mary-ng-on-paused-trade-talks-canada-minister-says-focus-on-hardeep-nijjar-case-4581447" target="_blank">On Paused Trade Talks, Canada Minister Says "Focus" On Nijjar Case</a></p>

<p>She did not confirm a direct link between Nijjar's killing and the paused trade talks.</p>

<p>The two nations have been in talks over a trade deal since 2010.</p>

<p>The halting of trade talks came shortly before Mr Trudeau flew to India for the G20 summit, which led to a few awkward moments. These included the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/technical-issue-in-justin-trudeaus-grounded-plane-fixed-delegation-to-fly-out-of-india-this-afternoon-canada-foreign-ministry-4382107" target="_blank">Canadian leader's plane being grounded</a> due to technical issues on the day of his scheduled departure - and the replacement then being diverted.</p>

<p>Mr Trudeau's India visit also included sharp comments from Prime Minister Narendra Modi about "anti-India" activities being permitted to take place on Canadian soil.</p>

<p>He leader later said his country would "always defend freedom of expression... of conscience... of peaceful protest" but also "always prevent violence and push back against hatred."</p>

<h3><strong>Canada Parliament Honours Nijjar</strong></h3>

<p>In June, in a move that triggered a furious response from India, the Canadian Parliament observed a moment's silence on the one-year anniversary of Nijjar's death.</p>

<p>The Indian government responded with a stern statement, saying it would "naturally oppose any move giving political space to extremism and advocacy of violence".</p>

<p>The Indian consulate in Vancouver hit back with a tribute to the 329 victims of the Air India Montreal-London flight bombed by Khalistani terrorists in 1985.</p>

<p>On that subject an Indian-origin Canada MP, Chandra Arya, said the ideology responsible for the terrorist attack is still alive among a few people in his country.</p>

<h3><strong>What Does The US Say?</strong></h3>

<p>The United States - which last month <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/completely-unwarranted-india-on-us-court-summons-over-khalistani-terrorist-6600977" target="_blank">summoned the Indian government</a> after Pannun filed a civil lawsuit, alleging a plot to murder him - has said it is "deeply concerned" by the claims and, in May this year, called on Delhi to take allegations against it "very seriously and investigate".</p>

<p>The Indian government has set up a high-level committee to inquire into the charges.</p>

       <description><![CDATA["To build a city on Mars that can grow by itself likely requires at least a million tons of equipment, which would therefore require >$1000 trillion," Elon Musk, SpaceX CEO wrote on X (formerly Twitter).]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 1000X improvement in rocket and spacecraft technology can vastly bring down the cost of building a city on Mars, Elon Musk has said on social media, responding to a user's post.</p>

<p>On Monday, X user @WholeMarsBlog posted a graphic explaining the cost of launching to low earth orbit. It said, “Today, launching a spacecraft is 10x cheaper than it was a decade ago.”</p>

<p>They captioned it “When Elon Musk enters an industry…”</p>

<p>In response, Elon Musk shared a long explainer with a cost breakdown and possible resolution. He pointed out that recent “US Mars missions have had a cost per ton of useful load to the surface of Mars of about $1B. Moreover, it has become more, not less, expensive over time!”</p>

<p>The increased cost acts as a hurdle in making life on Mars a reality. “To build a city on Mars that can grow by itself likely requires at least a million tons of equipment, which would therefore require &gt;$1000 trillion, an obviously impossible number, given that US GDP is only $29T,” he added.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Since your handle is “Whole Mars”, perhaps this lengthy reply is apropos:<br />
<br />
Getting the cost per ton to the surface of Mars low enough that humanity has the resources to make life multiplanetary requires a roughly 1000X improvement in rocket &amp; spacecraft technology.<br />
<br />
Recent US… <a href="https://t.co/BdasygYS5q">https://t.co/BdasygYS5q</a></p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1846001324246319409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>However, there is a solution. If rocket technology can be improved by 1000 times, the cost of becoming sustainably multiplanetary would drop to $1 trillion. And if this could be spread over 40 years, the cost would translate to less than $25 billion annually</p>

<p>“At that cost, it becomes possible to make life multiplanetary, ensuring the long-term survival of life as we know it, without materially affecting people's standard of living on Earth,” he added.</p>

<p>Musk mentioned SpaceX's Starship, designed to achieve over 1,000X improvement over existing systems. “Especially after yesterday's booster catch and precise ocean landing of the ship, I am now convinced that it can work,” he said.</p>

<p>On Sunday, SpaceX's Starship had its fifth test flight. Starship is referred to as the most powerful launch system ever developed, with the capacity to carry up to 100 people on long-duration, interplanetary flights.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Liftoff of Starship's fifth flight test <a href="https://t.co/D3AvQsRox2">pic.twitter.com/D3AvQsRox2</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The Starship's design demonstrates reusability, a crucial factor in reducing costs.</p>

<p>“Building cities on Mars will require affordable delivery of significant quantities of cargo and crew. The fully reusable Starship system uses on-orbit propellent transfer to enable the transport of up to 100 people to Mars or other distant destinations,” explains SpaceX.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The likelihood of a La Nina weather event in coming months has decreased, Australia's weather bureau said on Tuesday, adding that if the phenomenon did appear, it would be weak and short-lived.</p>

<p>The development of La Nina and its opposite, El Nino, are of huge importance to global agriculture, with La Nina typically increasing rainfall in eastern Australia, Southeast Asia and India and reducing rainfall in the Americas.</p>

<p>"The chance of a La Nina event developing in the coming months has decreased," the Australian Bureau of Meteorology said in a two-weekly update.</p>

<p>The bureau said its in-house climate model suggests La Nina will not develop and four of the six other climate models it surveys now agree.</p>

<p>La Nina and El Nino are caused by the cooling and warming of sea surface temperatures off western South America.</p>

<p>"If a La Nina were to develop, it is forecast to be relatively weak (in terms of the strength of the sea surface temperature anomaly) and short-lived, with all models forecasting neutral values in February," the bureau said.</p>

<p>Other meteorologists have also become less confident that a La Nina will appear.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea on Tuesday blew up sections of the deeply symbolic roads connecting it to the South, Seoul's military said, adding it had conducted a "counter-fire" operation in response.</p>

<p>Pyongyang's military last week vowed to permanently seal its southern border after spending months laying mines and building anti-tank barriers in the wake of leader Kim Jong Un's declaring the South his country's "principal enemy".</p>

<p>Last week, North Korea accused Seoul of using drones to drop anti-regime propaganda leaflets on the capital Pyongyang, with Kim convening a security meeting to direct a plan of "immediate military action" in response, state media reported Tuesday.</p>

<p>"North Korean has detonated parts of the Gyeongui and Donghae roads north of the Military Demarcation Line," the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Tuesday, referring to inter-Korean infrastructure that once connected the two countries.</p>

<p>"There has been no damage to our military, and our forces conducted counter-fire in areas south of the MDL," it added.</p>

<p>The roads have long been shuttered, but destroying them sends a clear message that Kim is not prepared to negotiate with the South, experts said.</p>

<p>"This is a practical military measure related to the hostile dual-state system that North Korea has frequently mentioned," Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, told AFP.</p>

<p>The North may also be looking to erect more physical barriers along the border, Yang said, adding that the road detonations could be "preparatory work for its construction of those walls".</p>

<p><strong>Drones?</strong></p>

<p>Seoul's military initially denied sending drones north but has subsequently declined to comment, even as Pyongyang has blamed them directly, warning it would consider it "a declaration of war" if another drone was detected.</p>

<p>Activist groups have long sent propaganda northwards, typically by balloon, and enthusiasts are also known to have flown small, hard-to-detect drones into the North.</p>

<p>Unlike conventional drones made of metal, the devices they used were constructed from expanded polypropylene, similar to Styrofoam, allowing them to go undetected by both South and North Korean authorities, according to enthusiasts who spoke to local media.</p>

<p>At Kim's meeting Monday, officials heard a report on the "enemy's serious provocation", said KCNA, adding Kim had "expressed a tough political and military stand".</p>

<p>The North has said the United States, which has a military alliance with South Korea, should also be held responsible.</p>

<p>North Korea has itself sent drones southwards -- in 2022, five of Pyongyang's drones crossed the border, prompting the South Korean military to fire warning shots and deploy fighter jets.</p>

<p>The jets failed to shoot down any of the drones.</p>

<p>In July, Seoul said it would deploy drone-melting lasers this year, saying the South's ability to respond to provocations would be "significantly enhanced".</p>

<p>The new laser weapons -- dubbed the "StarWars Project" by the South -- shoot an invisible, silent beam that costs just 2,000 won ($1.45) per use, according to the Defense Acquisition Program Administration.</p>

<p>Relations between the two Koreas are at their lowest point in years, with the North's army saying last week it would permanently shut the southern border by "completely cutting off roads and railways" connected to the South and building "strong defence structures".</p>

<p>Following Kim's meeting in Pyongyang, "attention is turning to whether North Korea will respond by sending drones into the South or take strong action if drones infiltrate its territory again", said Cheong Seong-chang of the Sejong Institute.</p>

<p>"North Korea is likely to engage in strong provocations along the border if there is a recurrence of drone infiltrations," Cheong told AFP.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The cop admitted to fantasising about the day her father's killer would serve his sentence behind bars.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gislayne Silva de Deus, a 35-year-old police officer from Boa Vista, Roraima, Brazil, has finally achieved justice for her father's brutal murder. Ms Deus, just 9 years old at the time, spent more than two decades seeking justice. Now, as a police officer, she tracked down and arrested her father's killer, bringing closure to her family's painful journey. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/10/14/woman-whose-dad-murdered-nine-becomes-cop-catch-killer-21792089/">Metro</a></em>, the police officer's father Giraldo Jose Vicente de Deus was shot and killed in February 1999 over a 20-pound debt.</p>

<p>The tragic events unfolded at a local bar, where Mr Deus, a supermarket owner, was playing pool with a friend. At the bar, Raimundo Alves Gomes, one of Deus's suppliers and a convicted murderer, demanded payment for the debt. Despite Deus's offer to settle with a freezer, Gomes refused, leading to an argument between the two.&nbsp;Gomes left the bar only to return with a gun and shot Mr Deus in the head, according to a recount by Brazilian news outlet&nbsp;<em><a href="https://nova1.com.br/policial-que-prendeu-assassino-do-pai-25-anos-depois-do-crime-teve-crise-de-choro-apos-prisao/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Nova1</a>.</em></p>

<p>Gomes was caught, put on trial and sentenced to 12 years in 2013. However, he avoided imprisonment while appealing the verdict. Following the rejection of his final appeal in 2016, an arrest warrant was issued, but Gomes evaded capture and went into hiding.</p>

<p>Determined to find Gomes, Ms Deus started&nbsp;studying law at 18 and later joined the police force. She held various positions, fueled by her resolve to bring her father's killer to justice. Assigned to the General Homicide Division, she then tirelessly tracked down Alves Gomes and found him hiding on a farm in the Nova Cidade region near Boa Vista. He was finally arrested on September 25.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cop admitted to fantasising about the day her father's killer would serve his sentence behind bars. "When I was a prison [police officer], I always imagined [the killer] arriving there to serve his sentence," she told local media.</p>

<p>Twenty-five years after the brutal murder, she confronted Alves Gomes, now 60, face-to-face. ''It's because of me that you are here. You are now going to pay,'' she told him.</p>

<p>"When I saw the man who was responsible for my dad's death was finally in handcuffs, I couldn't hold back the tears, It was an explosion of feelings that turned into tears of relief, as it seemed like this day would never come.&nbsp; My dad was an honest and hard-working man. He encouraged us to study and spent time helping us with homework and times tables. He was always very close to us and caring. My sisters and I went through really difficult times after we lost him. What happened could easily have sent us in a different direction, but our mother always taught us to follow the right path,'' she remarked.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On September 26, 2024, Alves Gomes' conviction was upheld by a judge and the killer was sent to prison for 12 years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Canada's Royal Canadian Mounted Police claimed that "agents of the Government of India" use criminals - referring specifically to the Bishnoi gang - to "target (the) South Asian community... specifically pro-Khalistani elements" in that country.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Royal Canadian&nbsp;Mounted Police claimed Monday that "agents of the Government of India" use criminals - referring specifically to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/bishnoi-gang" target="_blank">Bishnoi gang</a> - to "target (the) South Asian community... specifically pro-Khalistani elements" in that country.</p>

<p>The charge - by Commissioner Mike Duhene and his deputy, Brigitte Gauvin - adds to the row festering since Ottawa last year accused "agents" of Delhi of involvement in the killing of Canadian citizen and Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Nijjar.</p>

<p>"It (the Indian government) is targeting the South Asian community... but they are specifically targeting pro-Khalistani elements in Canada. What we have seen, from an RCMP perspective, is that they use organised crime elements," Ms Gauvin told reporters.</p>

<p>"It has been publicly attributed and claimed by one crime group in particular - the Bishnoi gang. We believe the group is connected to agents of the Government of India."</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>When asked specifically if "agents of Indian government" were being accused of "homicide, extortion, intimidation, and coercion", Mr Duheme replied "yes".</p>

<p>Mr Duheme and Ms Gauvin further claimed some Indian diplomatic staff work with organised crime elements to "collect - through questionable and illegal means - information on Canadian citizens... (that is fed to criminal organisations) that would then take violent actions from extortion to murder".</p>

<p>India has strongly rejected what it calls "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/38417" target="_blank">preposterous imputations</a>", including those by Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accusing New Delhi of "supporting criminal activity against Canadians" and "coercive behaviour targeting South Asian Canadians".</p>

<p>India also said that since the allegations were first made, the Trudeau administration "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/hardeep-singh-nijjar-killing-s-jaishankar-asks-canada-to-provide-evidence-4577831" target="_blank">has not shared a shred of evidence</a> with the Government of India, despite many requests..."</p>

<p>The External Affairs Ministry further rejected claims by Ottawa that Sanjay Kumar Verma, posted as the Indian High Commissioner, and five of his staff, are 'persons of interest'. All six have been expelled by the Canadian side after it claimed Delhi's continuing non-cooperation in its investigation.</p>

<p>Hours after the police officers' press conference Mr Trudeau spoke to reporters and doubled down on charges against the Indian government.</p>

<p>"I think it is obvious the Government of India made a fundamental error in thinking they could engage in supporting criminal activity against Canadians, here on Canadian soil. Whether it be murders or extortion or other violent acts, it is absolutely unacceptable."</p>

<p>The allegations coincide with sliding support and tanking popularity; last week he survived a second parliamentary confidence vote in as many weeks before the 2025 election.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The filmmaker claimed that insiders from the Breakthrough Listen project tipped him off that concrete evidence may be revealed within a month, possibly coinciding with the US election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Renowned NASA filmmaker Simon Holland has claimed that Earth-based telescopes have detected signs of intelligent extraterrestrial life, with a potential announcement coming next month. Mr Holland, who has collaborated with the BBC and NASA-funded initiatives, asserted that an Oxford University-backed program dedicated to searching for extraterrestrial signals has made the groundbreaking discovery, the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/14/us-news/nasa-filmmaker-claims-evidence-of-alien-life-could-be-revealed-within-the-next-month/">New York Post</a></em> reported.</p>

<p>The filmmaker claimed that insiders from Mark Zuckerberg's Breakthrough Listen project&nbsp;tipped him off that concrete evidence may be revealed within a month, possibly coinciding with the US election.&nbsp;This evidence might be linked to alien signals intercepted by the Parkes telescope in Australia, courtesy of researchers from the Oxford-based Breakthrough Listen initiative.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"They found the evidence of a non-human technological signature a few years ago, using the Parkes telescope in Australia," claimed Mr Holland.</p>

<p>The extraordinary claims have sparked a flurry of activity, with astronomers scrambling to gather evidence to substantiate the discovery. However, Simon Holland warns that a rival effort may be underway, suggesting that Chinese researchers might attempt to preempt the announcement.</p>

<p>''This is breaking news, as of yesterday, but the Chinese might be pipping them to the post, with their, FAST [Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope] program. It's the largest telescope in the world since Arecibo,'' Mr Holland told <em>The Mirror.</em></p>

<p>Mr Holland further claimed that Chinese researchers are racing to publish findings on BLC-1 (Breakthrough Listen candidate 1), a promising signal detected by the Parkes Telescope in April 2019. BLC-1, emanating from Proxima Centauri, 4.2 light-years from Earth, is considered significant due to its single-point source origin, narrow band electromagnetic frequency (982 MHz) and Doppler&nbsp;shift, indicating a rotating planet.</p>

<p>Mr Holland believes this signal is unlikely to be human interference, as its characteristics are inconsistent with known natural phenomena. Breakthrough Listen has invested $100 million in telescope time to investigate five potential candidates, including BLC-1.</p>

<p>Dr Andrew Siemion from Berkeley's Breakthrough Listen Science Program confirmed that researchers are still analysing BLC-1. If sufficient data confirms the signal's technological origins, they will publish their findings. The Chinese are allegedly aware of BLC-1's coordinates and may attempt to scoop the announcement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While this news is exciting, it's essential to note that there's currently no conclusive proof of extraterrestrial life. Astrobiologists have been studying the possibility of life beyond Earth, exploring extreme environments and chemically harsh ecosystems that could support life. The search for extraterrestrial life has been ongoing since the mid-20th century, with scientists using various methods to detect signs of life, including telescope data analysis and radio communications.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 26-year-old British man died on Sunday after falling from Spain's tallest bridge, which he had climbed to create social media content, authorities reported on Monday. Accompanied by a 24-year-old fellow Briton, the unidentified victim fell while climbing the cable-stayed bridge in Talavera de la Reina, approximately 70 miles southwest of Madrid, the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/14/british-man-dies-fall-spanish-bridge-online-content">Guardian</a></em> reported.&nbsp;The man reportedly attempted his climb without any safety equipment.&nbsp;Local authorities also cited heavy rainfall in Talavera before the accident, which may have made the bridge's surface slippery, according to Spanish media reports.</p>

<p>"As far as we have been able to learn, they had come to Talavera to climb the bridge and create content for social networks, which has resulted in this disastrous and sad outcome," Talavera city councillor for public security Macarena Munoz said.</p>

<p>She added, ''We have been able to find out, they had come to Talavera to climb the bridge and create content for social networks, which has resulted in this unfortunate and sad outcome.''</p>

<p>According to city officials, climbing the bridge is strictly prohibited, with repeated warnings emphasising that it's not allowed under any circumstances. Despite these warnings, thrill-seeking tourists continue to risk their lives for social media content, resulting in tragic incidents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We have reiterated on many occasions that it cannot be done under any circumstances," said Ms Munoz.</p>

<p>The city council said the man's body has been removed from the scene and taken to a nearby funeral home by a coroner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office said: ''We are supporting the family of a British man who has died in Spain, and are in contact with the local authorities.''</p>

<p>Notably, the Castilla-La Mancha Bridge, towering at 630 feet, is Spain's tallest bridge and one of Europe's most impressive structures. Its striking design features a unique 152-wire rope system, forming a triangular fan-like shape that dominates the Spanish skyline.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Global public debt is expected to reach a record $100 trillion this year, the IMF said, warning that the fiscal outlook for many countries may even be "worse than expected."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Global public debt is expected to reach a record $100 trillion this year, the IMF said Tuesday, warning that the fiscal outlook for many countries may be even "worse than expected."</p>

<p>In its latest report on fiscal policy, the International Monetary Fund said it expects global public debt to hit 93 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) this year, and to approach 100 percent of GDP by 2030 -- 10 percentage points higher than in 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic hit.</p>

<p>"Global public debt is very high," Era Dabla-Norris, the deputy director of the IMF's Fiscal Affairs Department, told reporters ahead of the report's publication.</p>

<p>"There are very good reasons to believe that the debt burden -- or the debt outlook -- could be worse than expected," she said, pointing to current spending pressures to address issues like climate change, overly-optimistic debt projections, and the possibility of large amounts of unidentified debt.</p>

<p>"So the bottom line is that it's time for countries to get their fiscal house in order," she said.</p>

<p>The IMF report introduced a new "debt-at-risk" approach to assessing the risks to debt projections.</p>

<p>It estimated that, in a worst-case scenario, global public debt could hit 115 percent of GDP by 2026 -- almost 20 percentage points higher than the Fund's baseline estimate.</p>

<p>The report found that "global factors increasingly drive the fluctuations in government borrowing costs across countries," suggesting that elevated levels of debt in key countries could "increase the volatility of sovereign yields and debt risks" for others.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Japan Elections: Key issues include price rises, regional security, and disquiet over scandals in Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Campaigning kicked off Tuesday in Japan for an October 27 election in which new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is seeking to retain his long-ruling party's majority.</p>

<p>Loudspeaker trucks began circulating and candidates handed out fliers ahead of the vote. Key issues include price rises, regional security, and disquiet over scandals in Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party.</p>

<p>The LDP has governed Japan almost uninterrupted for decades, albeit with frequent leadership changes.</p>

<p>Low voter turnout and a divided opposition mean the party and its coalition partner are highly likely to win.</p>

<p>A weekend Kyodo News poll showed that Ishiba's LDP remains the most popular party at 26.4 percent, versus 12.4 percent who intend to vote for the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP).</p>

<p>Former defence minister and self-confessed security policy "geek" Ishiba, 67, won a ruling party leadership election in September and was approved as premier soon afterwards.</p>

<p>He has called a snap election to shore up his mandate for policies that include plans to "re-create" ageing Japan by revitalising depopulated rural areas.</p>

<p>On the diplomatic front, Ishiba has called for revising the Japan-US security treaty to make it better reflect his country's sovereignty.</p>

<p>He also backs the creation of a regional military alliance along the lines of NATO to counter China, although he has cautioned it would "not happen overnight".</p>

<p>Ishiba says his "victory line" for the election would be for the LDP and its junior partner Komeito to maintain a simple majority in parliament's lower house.</p>

<p>But the LDP will need to convince voters jaded by a slush fund scandal that has swept the party along with questions over its lawmakers' ties to the Unification Church.</p>

<p>Ishiba has pledged to "ensure Japan's economy emerges from deflation" and wants to boost incomes through a new stimulus package as well as support for low-income households.</p>

<p>Another thorny issue is the question of whether to allow women to retain their maiden names after marriage, an issue where opposition parties hope to gain liberal support.</p>

<p>The justice ministry says that to the best of its knowledge, Japan is the only nation that requires married couples to choose one of their surnames -- almost always the husbands'.</p>

<p>While the CDP supports allowing married couples to maintain separate surnames, the conservative LDP has been more cautious, citing "traditional family values".</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel has assured the White House that a planned retaliatory attack on Iran won't target nuclear or oil facilities, US media reported Monday.</p>

<p>Israel has vowed to counterattack after Iran fired ballistic missiles at the country on October 1, launched in response to Israel's killing of Tehran-aligned militant leaders in the region, along with a general in Iran's Revolutionary Guards.</p>

<p>Citing unnamed US officials, the Washington Post said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had reassured the White House that a counterstrike it is contemplating would target only military sites.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal, also citing US officials speaking on condition of anonymity, said the pledge came in a call between US President Joe Biden and Netanyahu last week, as well as in conversations in recent days between US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant.</p>

<p>The plan "was met with relief in Washington," the Washington Post reported.</p>

<p>Biden has warned Israel against striking Iran's nuclear or oil facilities in order to avoid a further expansion of regional war and amid worries of a spike in global energy prices.</p>

<p>The attack was Iran's second direct attack on Israel after missile and drone fire in April, carried out in response to an air strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus that is attributed to Israel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taiwan detected a record 153 Chinese military aircraft around the self-ruled island, official data showed Tuesday, after China held a day of large-scale drills.</p>

<p>The aircraft were spotted in the 25 hours to 6:00 am on Tuesday (2200 GMT Monday), the defence ministry said in a statement -- the most for a single day.</p>

<p>Beijing deployed fighter jets, drones, warships and coast guard boats to encircle Taiwan on Monday, with Taiwan responding by dispatching "appropriate forces" and placing its outlying islands on heightened alert.</p>

<p>Taiwan condemned China's actions as "irrational and provocative", and the US called them "unwarranted".</p>

<p>Japan said Tuesday it had expressed its "concerns" to China over the drills, and scrambled fighter jets near its southern island of Yonaguni.</p>

<p>"The government is closely monitoring the related activities with great interest, and has conveyed Japan's concerns to the Chinese side," deputy chief cabinet secretary Kazuhiko Aoki told reporters.</p>

<p>China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and insisted Monday it will never renounce the use of force to bring the island under its control.</p>

<p>Beijing has ramped up military pressure on Taipei in recent years to accept its claims of sovereignty over the island, and Monday represented the fourth round of large-scale drills in just over two years.</p>

<p>Taiwan's defence ministry also recorded 14 Chinese navy ships in the latest 25-hour period, slightly fewer than the 17 announced Monday afternoon.</p>

<p>Of the aircraft spotted, 111 crossed the median line of the sensitive Taiwan Strait that separates mainland China and Taiwan, the figures showed.</p>

<p><strong>'Unwarranted'</strong></p>

<p>The United States said <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/chinas-military-encircles-taiwan-us-calls-it-unwarranted-6785647">China's actions on Monday were "unwarranted"</a> and risked "escalation" as it called on Beijing to act with restraint.</p>

<p>China said the drills, dubbed Joint Sword 2024B, were held in areas to the north, south and east of Taiwan.</p>

<p>Beijing declared them over by around 6:00 pm on Monday, about 13 hours after they started.</p>

<p>China said the exercises served as a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/china-launches-military-drills-around-taiwan-sends-a-stern-warning-to-separatist-forces-6783700">"stern warning to the separatist acts of 'Taiwan Independence' forces"</a>.</p>

<p>Taiwan President Lai Ching-te, who took office in May, has been more outspoken than his predecessor Tsai Ing-wen in defending Taiwan's sovereignty, angering Beijing, which calls him a "separatist".</p>

<p>In his National Day speech on Thursday, Lai vowed to "resist annexation" and insisted that Beijing and Taipei were "not subordinate to each other".</p>

<p>Lai pledged Monday to "protect democratic Taiwan and safeguard national security".</p>

<p>In late May, three days after Lai's inauguration, China launched Joint Sword-2024A, an apparent precursor to the latest drills.</p>

<p>The dispute between China and Taiwan dates back to a civil war in which the nationalist forces of Chiang Kai-shek were defeated by Mao Zedong's communist fighters and fled to the island in 1949.</p>

<p>China and Taiwan have been ruled separately since then.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lone catamaran named "Silky" patrols waters around the remote island of Malpelo, a refuge that is protected yet full of peril for endangered marine species in the Colombian Pacific.</p>

<p>Its crew of environmentalists is the terror of boats illegally fishing for sharks inside the reserve some 500 kilometers (310 miles) off mainland Colombia -- one of the richest countries in terms of marine fauna.</p>

<p>Without weapons or backup, the activists shoo away intruder vessels, threaten to report them to the authorities, even dive under water to cut loose sharks caught in nets or on lines.</p>

<p>Active round-the-clock since 2018, the team of shark-lovers claims to be turning the tide in the Malpelo Fauna and Flora Sanctuary, a mecca for divers and the largest no-fishing zone in the Eastern Tropical Pacific.</p>

<p>"The success of the project can be seen in the fact that they (the illegal fishers) do not return," said Colombian diver Erika Lopez, who created the foundation Biodiversity Conservation Colombia with the help of an Australian philanthropist.</p>

<p>The project was born from what the activists view as a lack of official shark protection, with the navy arresting illegal fishers only if they happen to come across them on routine patrols against drug traffickers and other territorial intruders.</p>

<p>Due to play host of the UN COP16 biodiversity conference starting next Monday, Colombia's vast Pacific coastline is on a key migratory route for hammerhead sharks, whale sharks and other species, many of them endangered.</p>

<p>But the bountiful waters of the sanctuary attract vessels from far and wide, many from neighboring Ecuador, others from Panama and Costa Rica in the Caribbean or even China, where shark fin is a delicacy.</p>

<p>Lopez's foundation claims the crew of the Silky -- the name of a type of shark -- has rescued 508 animals alive since 2018, scared away 302 boats and confiscated more than 70,000 meters of fishing line.</p>

<p>Since last December, the foundation reports it has not spotted any fishing boats near Malpelo island in the reserve of more than 850,000 hectares recognized as a UNESCO heritage site.</p>

<p>"We try as much as possible to take the equipment away from them, to free the species that are trapped, that's the main mission," 53-year-old Dario Ortiz, an artisanal fisherman-turned-environmentalist, told AFP on board the "Silky."</p>

<p>But it is a full-time effort.</p>

<p>"This boat has to be basically 24/7, 365 days a year containing this threat," said Lopez, 51, who dreams of upscaling the project to a flotilla of vessels dedicated to conservation and science in the Pacific.</p>

<p><strong>Rich and desirable</strong></p>

<p>On the high seas, far from Malpelo island, a Colombian navy warship also patrols an area teeming with hammerhead sharks, marlin and other endangered creatures.</p>

<p>On a recent mission with AFP on board, it arrested three Ecuadoran fishermen found with a highly valuable haul of silky, hammerhead and blacktip sharks, sailfish and four blue marlins -- all still alive.</p>

<p>"The Colombian Pacific is very rich and it is desirable," said Admiral Rafael Aranguren.</p>

<p>With "our ships we can reach this part of the territory and exercise controls so that they do not illegally exploit these riches, so that they do not harm the environment."</p>

<p>In 2020, the government of former president Ivan Duque banned shark fishing, both on an industrial and small-scale, to try to protect marine stocks.</p>

<p>But faced with an outcry from Afro-Caribbean fishing communities on the Pacific coast which rely on shark catches for meat to eat and sell, incumbent President Gustavo Petro in January partly repealed the ban.</p>

<p>The government decreed that small-scale fishermen may keep and consume sharks accidentally caught in nets meant for other, unrestricted, fish species.</p>

<p>The decision caused outrage among conservationists who view it as a license to kill.</p>

<p>The Navy estimates it has arrested 30 people so far this year for illegal fishing in Colombian waters.</p>

<p>Between 2012 and 2022, authorities seized more than 334 tons of fish meat illegally harvested, according to the Ministry of Environment.</p>

<p>The country does not keep a record of sharks that fall victim to illegal fishing.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau doubled down on accusations of India "supporting criminal activity against Canadians", as the two countries expel six diplomats each in the row over the killing of terrorist Hardeep Singh NIjjar.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/justin-trudeau" target="_blank">Justin Trudeau</a> late Monday doubled down on accusations of India "supporting criminal activity against Canadians" and "coercive behaviour targeting South Asian Canadians".</p>

<p>The two countries this week exchanged a second round of&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-expels-6-canadian-diplomats-amid-spiraling-tension-6789267#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll_Imagetopscroll" target="_blank">tit-for-tat expulsion of diplomats</a>, amid a deepening row over claims linking "agents of the Indian government" with the killing of Khalistani terrorist <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/hardeep-singh-nijjar" target="_blank">Hardeep Singh Nijjar</a>, a Canadian citizen, in June last year.</p>

<p>India - which has yet to respond to these latest comments - has set up a high-level committee to investigate the allegation. However New Delhi has repeatedly shot down "absurd" and "motivated" the claim it was linked to the murder, pointing out <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/hardeep-singh-nijjar-killing-s-jaishankar-asks-canada-to-provide-evidence-4577831" target="_blank">no evidence has been provided</a>&nbsp;to back up the charges.</p>

<p>On Monday, Delhi also said that since the allegations were first made, the Trudeau administration "has not shared a shred of evidence with the Government of India, despite many requests..."</p>

<p>In comments after India ejected six Canadian diplomats - including acting High Commissioner Stewart Wheeler and his deputy - Mr Trudeau said he had shared information about the accusations with Five Eyes partners, particularly the United States.</p>

<p>These latest charges, though, represent an escalation as they allege a wider campaign of the Indian government - of working, Mr Trudeau said, with organised crime elements in Canada to "collect - through questionable and illegal means - information on Canadian citizens... (that is fed to criminal organisations) that would then take violent actions from extortion to murder".</p>

<p>"I think it is obvious the Government of India made a fundamental error in thinking they could engage in supporting criminal activity against Canadians, here on Canadian soil. Whether it be murders or extortion or other violent acts, it is absolutely unacceptable," Mr Trudeau <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/statements/2024/10/14/statement-prime-minister-ongoing-investigation-violent-criminal-activity-linked" target="_blank">said</a>.</p>

<p>Mr Trudeau also said, "We shared our concerns with the Government of India and asked them to work with us...". However, he claimed that these requests had been "repeatedly refused".</p>

<p>"That is why... this weekend... Canadian officials took an extraordinary step. They met with Indian officials to share RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) evidence, which concluded six agents of the Government of India are 'persons of interest' in criminal activities. And despite repeated requests to the Government of India, they have decided not to co-operate..."</p>

<p>"Canada fully respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India, and we expect India to do the same for us," he added.</p>

<p>Mr Trudeau's allegations coincide with sliding support and tanking popularity ratings; last week he <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/canadian-pm-justin-trudeau-survive-second-parliamentary-confidence-vote-6696632" target="_blank">survived a second parliamentary confidence vote</a> in as many weeks ahead of an election in 2025.</p>

<p>The comments came after a RCMP Commissioner Mike Duheme and Assistant Commissioner Brigitte Gauvin <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rcmp-india-expel-1.7351837" target="_blank">warned Canadians of a public safety threat but offered few details</a>. They would only say the RCMP has evidence pertaining to "connections" between a certain number of individuals arrested and charged for murder (eight people) and extortion (at least 22) and the Government of India.</p>

<p>Pressed on the current "public safety threat to Canadians", Mr Duheme called on Canadian citizens to come forward if faced with "intimidation, harassment, coercion, or extortion, in any way or form, (to) obtain information for the Government of India".</p>

<p>The current row spiked after Canada Foreign Minister Melanie Joly, acting on RCMP information, issued six Indian diplomats a deportation notice. "They must leave Canada..." Mr Trudeau said, "Let me be clear... the evidence brought to light by the RCMP cannot be ignored..."</p>

<p>India later issued a statement saying it was withdrawing the six officials over security concerns.</p>

<p>From its side, Delhi has ramped up criticism of the Trudeau government, saying accusations against its envoy, Sanjay Kumar Verma, are "ludicrous and deserve to be treated with contempt".</p>

<p>Delhi also said that Mr Trudeau's "hostility to India has long been in evidence".</p>

<p>"Sanjay Verma is India's senior-most serving diplomat with a distinguished career spanning 36 years. He has been an Ambassador in Japan and Sudan, while also serving in Italy, Turkiye, Vietnam and China," the foreign ministry said, calling the allegations a "strategy of smearing India for political gains".</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pollution, habitat degradation, climate change and over-use of freshwater resources are putting a strain on Europe, with only a third of its surface water in good health, the European Environment Agency warned on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"The health of Europe's waters is not good. Our waters face an unprecedented set of challenges that threatens Europe's water security," EEA executive director Leena Yla-Mononen said in a statement.</p>

<p>Only 37 percent of Europe's surface water bodies achieved "good" or "high" ecological status, a measure of aquatic ecosystem health, the EEA report said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, only 29 percent of surface waters achieved "good" chemical status over the 2015-2021 period, according to data reported by EU member states.</p>

<p>Europe's groundwaters -- the source of most drinking water in the continent -- fared better, with 77 percent enjoying "good" chemical status.</p>

<p>Good chemical status means the water is free of excessive pollution from chemical nutrients and toxic substances like PFAS and microplastics.</p>

<p>Surface water is threatened by air pollution -- such as coal burning and car emissions -- as well as the agriculture industry, whose dumped waste contaminates the soil.</p>

<p>"European agriculture needs to increase its use of more sustainable organic and agroecological practices, accompanied by incentives and a change in our food and dietary habits," the report said.</p>

<p>The European agency analysed 120,000 surface water bodies and 3.8 million square kilometres (1.5 million square miles) of groundwater body areas in 19 EU countries and Norway.</p>

<p>It called on EEA member states to halve their use of pesticides by 2030.</p>

<p>"We need to redouble our efforts to restore the health of our valued rivers, lakes, coastal waters and other water bodies, and to make sure this vital resource is resilient and secure for generations to come," Yla-Mononen said.</p>

<p>Climate change effects, including extreme droughts and flooding, and the over-use of freshwater resources are putting a strain on Europe's lakes, rivers, coastal waters and groundwaters "like never before", the EEA said.</p>

<p>Governments must prioritise reducing water consumption and restoring ecosystems, it said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indigenous organizations in the Brazilian state of Para said they were not consulted by the government before it signed a deal with multinational companies to sell carbon offset credits to support conservation of the Amazon rainforest in the state.</p>

<p>Amazon.com Inc and other firms agreed last month to buy carbon credits valued at $180 million through the LEAF Coalition conservation initiative, which it helped set up in 2021 with a group of companies and governments, including the United States and United Kingdom.</p>

<p>At the time, Para Governor Helder Barbalho said the deal had the participation of Indigenous peoples and traditional communities.</p>

<p>But on Tuesday, 38 Indigenous and community organizations from Para signed a public letter denouncing his failure to consult them.</p>

<p>"It is unacceptable for the government of Para to take decisions without consulting traditional communities, who are the greatest protectors of the forests while also being the most impacted by the lack of effective climate adaptation policies," they said in the letter.</p>

<p>"Forest peoples must be heard and consulted. Our territories are not for sale," they said.</p>

<p>Alessandra Korap Munduruku, a tribal leader who was the letter's principal author, said the role of U.S.-based companies like Amazon and the Walmart Foundation, Walmart's philanthropic organization, in the carbon credit purchase was worrying.</p>

<p>"Our priority is the eviction of invaders on our reservation lands that are threatened by miners and a grain railway," she told Reuters by telephone. "Our leaders were never consulted on the carbon credits. We are being sold like goods."</p>

<p>The governor's office did not reply to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Korap Munduruku is an Indigenous&nbsp;teacher turned community leader who won the prestigious Goldman environmental prize in 2023 for her efforts to convince mining companies leave Munduruku lands.</p>

<p>The agreement is LEAF's first deal in the Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, which is vital to curbing climate change because of the enormous amount of greenhouse gas its trees absorb.</p>

<p>The deal foresees the purchase of up to 12 million tons of carbon credits generated by reducing deforestation in Para between 2023 and 2026. It was announced on Sept. 24 during New York Climate Week.</p>

<p>Each of the credits represents a reduction of 1 metric ton of carbon emissions and they are jurisdictional, so Para gets paid for reducing deforestation across the state, including on public lands like reservations.</p>

<p>Governor Barbalho said the state would only collect the portion of the sales' proceeds needed to continue its efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions, while the rest would go to Indigenous peoples and traditional communities as well as family farms.</p>

<p>Para will host the UN COP30 climate summit next year, in a move that is the centerpiece of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's bid to restore Brazil's environmental credentials after years of soaring deforestation.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday vowed to strike Hezbollah without mercy following a deadly drone strike on a military base in Israel, and retaliation would extend to targets in Beirut.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday vowed to strike Hezbollah without mercy, a day after the Iran-backed group's deadliest strike on Israel since the start of the war in late September.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's drone attack on an Israeli base killed four soldiers on Sunday, while another 60 people were injured, according to the Israeli volunteer rescue service United Hatzalah.</p>

<p>"We will continue to mercilessly strike Hezbollah in all parts of Lebanon -- including Beirut," Netanyahu said as he visited the base near Binyamina, south of Haifa.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it launched the "squadron of attack drones" in response to Israeli attacks, including one last week that Lebanon's health ministry said killed at least 22 people in central Beirut.</p>

<p>Since Israel on September 23 escalated its bombing against targets in Lebanon the war has killed at least 1,315 people, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures, though the real toll is likely to be higher.</p>

<p>Prior to Netanyahu's comments a string of new air strikes had already occurred against targets around Lebanon, including one in a northern Christian-majority village which killed at least 21 people, according to the health ministry.</p>

<p>Yousef, the manager of a restaurant near the Binyamina base, told AFP he heard "a huge boom" before many ambulances arrived.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said on Monday around midday that it had launched rockets at a naval base near Haifa before a further "big rocket salvo" in the early evening at the northern Israeli town of Safed.</p>

<p>Its fighters were also "engaged in violent clashes" in the Lebanese frontier village of Aita al-Shaab, and were fighting elsewhere as well, it said.</p>

<p>Air raid sirens sounded across central Israel in the early evening, including in the commercial hub of Tel Aviv, the military said, after it earlier reported the interception of two drones approaching from Syria.</p>

<p><strong>'Never-ending' strikes</strong></p>

<p>After almost a year of tit-for-tat exchanges between Hezbollah and Israeli forces over the Lebanon border, Israel intensified its strikes against targets in Lebanon late last month before sending ground troops across the frontier.</p>

<p>Israel wants to push back Hezbollah in order to secure its northern boundary and allow tens of thousands of people displaced by rocket fire over the last year to return home safely.</p>

<p>Hezbollah says its strikes are in solidarity with its Palestinian ally, Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7 last year, triggering the ongoing Gaza war with Israel.</p>

<p>The International Organization for Migration said last week it had verified 690,000 displaced people in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Israel's deadly air strike on the village of Aito in northern Lebanon on Monday marked a departure from the usual pattern, being located far from the main combat area and in a mostly Christian area.</p>

<p>Israel has focused its firepower mostly on Hezbollah strongholds in Shiite Muslim-majority areas in the south and in the suburbs of Beirut.</p>

<p>An AFP photographer in Aito said the missile levelled a residential building. Body parts were scattered in the rubble.</p>

<p>In the southern border town of Marjayoun, civil defence chief Anis Abla told AFP his rescue teams were exhausted.</p>

<p>"Our rescue missions are becoming more and more difficult, because the strikes are never-ending and target us," he said.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry condemned Israel's "continued targeting of medical, relief and paramedics teams."</p>

<p>Israel also continues to face criticism over injuries and damage sustained by the UN peacekeeping force which has been deployed in Lebanon since 1978.</p>

<p>Five peacekeepers were injured in a series of incidents last week, with the UN force on Sunday accusing Israeli troops of breaking through a gate with two tanks and entering one of their positions.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said a tank "backed several meters into a UNIFIL post" while "under fire" and attempting to evacuate injured soldiers.</p>

<p><strong>Anti-missile defence</strong></p>

<p>Prime Minister Simon Harris of Ireland, which has troops in the UNIFIL mission, on Monday told Israeli President Isaac Herzog in a phone call that UNIFIL has "a clear mandate from the Security Council, and that it must be allowed to carry out its functions unimpeded," Harris's office said.</p>

<p>The Hamas attack on Israel last year which triggered war in Gaza resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The number includes hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, 42,289 people, the majority civilians. The UN has described the figures as reliable.</p>

<p>With the war there, and in Lebanon, showing no sign of abating, fears of even wider regional conflict have seen Iran, which backs Hezbollah and Hamas, engage in diplomatic efforts with allies and other powers.</p>

<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met a senior official from Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi movement in Oman, the latest stop in a regional diplomatic tour.</p>

<p>Jordan's King Abdullah II warned of "a regional war that will be costly for everyone," during a meeting with Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati on Monday.</p>

<p>Just before Sunday's attack on the Israeli army base, the Pentagon said it would deploy a high-altitude anti-missile system known as THAAD to Israel to further boost its ally's defences against a potential Iranian attack.</p>

<p>Israel is still weighing its response to an October 1 missile attack by Iran, the latest of two it has carried out against Israel this year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Extreme temperatures and humidity driven by climate change could reduce the Amazon rainforest's capacity to absorb the greenhouse gas methane by 70 per cent, a study has found. Researchers said that under a warmer climate, the extreme rainfall and droughts projected for South America's Amazon could impact its net greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>Often referred to as the 'lungs of the planet', the tropical rainforest lies majorly in Brazil, with parts in Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, among others, and is known to be a crucial 'greenhouse gas sink' that absorbs these gases from the air.</p>

<p>However, 20 per cent of the Amazon region, which remains flooded for nearly half a year, releases methane, countering its ability to absorb other greenhouse gases, the researchers at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil said. Their study is published in the journal Environmental Microbiome.</p>

<p>Previous studies have shown that the flooded areas of Amazon contribute up to almost 30 per cent of methane emissions from wetlands globally.</p>

<p>"Although it's already been shown that factors such as air temperature and seasonal flooding can influence the composition of microbial communities affecting the flow of methane in these environments. But what should we expect in the context of climate change and the projected extreme weather?" Lead author Julia Gontijo, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Davis, US, said.</p>

<p>For this study, researchers took soil samples from two flooded regions of the Amazon and one from elevated forests known to absorb methane. These samples were subjected to extreme temperatures -- 27 degrees Celsius and 30 degrees Celsius -- and humidity.</p>

<p>They found that in the soil sample from the elevated forest methane absorbtion dropped by 70 per cent in hot and dry conditions, while methane production surged in heavy rainfall, as the soil was not used to dealing with extreme humidity.</p>

<p>"Within this (elevated) forest soil, an average decrease of 70 per cent in (methane) consumption potential was observed with temperature increase in dry conditions," the authors wrote.</p>

<p>It means that the floodplain microbiome can adapt to climate change but the upland forest microbiome is sensitive to its effects, which could cause a shift in the balance of greenhouse gas emissions in the Amazon in future, Gontijo said.</p>

<p>"In view of the Amazon Rainforest biome's importance in proportion to global levels, this could represent a very serious problem," she said.</p>

<p>She further said that in both (the) floodplains, although there were no observation of significant changes in methane emission patterns, the number of methane-producing microorganisms increased that can be a future problem.</p>

<p>The results could be used in framing public policies, the author added</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shinkansen bullet trains could be whizzing around Japan without drivers from the mid-2030s, one of its main rail operators said, motivated in part by the country's demographic crisis.</p>

<p>East Japan Railway (JR East) will first introduce trains where many of the driver's tasks are automated -- but they will remain in the cab -- on parts of one route from 2028, the firm said Tuesday.</p>

<p>The following year, the company hopes to trial driverless trains on a short stretch of out-of-service track before rolling them out between Tokyo and Niigata on the Joetsu Shinkansen line in the mid-2030s.</p>

<p>"Through realising driverless driving and transforming railway management to an efficient and sustainable system, we will adapt to changes in the social environment such as declining population and reforms in ways of how workers work," a company statement said.</p>

<p>The main drive behind the plan, however, "is the need to constantly innovate railway technology, and that could in turn help address the labour shortage and other issues", a JR East spokesman told AFP on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The Shinkansen's maximum speed on the Joetsu route is 275 kilometres (170 miles) per hour, but on other lines, they can run at 300 km/h or faster.</p>

<p>Japan, whose shrinking population is the world's second oldest, is already facing worker shortages across many sectors of the economy.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran has vowed to respond to fresh sanctions imposed by Britain, France and Germany over what they said was its supply of short-range missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine.</p>

<p>"This action of the three European countries is the continuation of the hostile policy of the West and economic terrorism against the people of Iran, which will face the appropriate and proportionate action of the Islamic Republic of Iran," foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said in a statement late Tuesday.</p>

<p>The three governments had announced they would take steps to cancel air services agreements with Iran and "work towards imposing sanctions on Iran Air".</p>

<p>"In addition, we will pursue the designations of significant entities and individuals involved with Iran's ballistic missile programme and the transfer of ballistic missiles and other weapons to Russia," they added.</p>

<p>Iran again denied it had delivered any weapons to Russia for use in the Ukraine war.</p>

<p>"Any claim that the Islamic Republic of Iran has sold ballistic missiles to the Russian Federation is completely baseless and false," Kanani said.</p>

<p>Earlier, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia had received shipments of ballistic missiles from Iran and "will likely use them within weeks in Ukraine".</p>

<p>He added that dozens of Russian military personnel have received training in Iran on using the Fath-360 missile, which has a range of 120 kilometres (75 miles).</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BJP leaders have severely criticized Congress leader and Lok Sabha Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi following his meeting with US Congresswoman Ilhan Omar in the United States. BJP IT Cell head Amit Malviya accused the Congress of working against the country.</p>

<p>"India's Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi meets Ilhan Omar in the USA, a Pakistan-sponsored anti-India voice, a radical Islamist, and an advocate of independent Kashmir. Even Pakistani leaders would be more circumspect about being seen with such rabid elements. Congress is now openly working against India," Amit Malviya said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Another BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla also criticised Rahul Gandhi.<br />
<br />
"After spewing venom against Sikhs and running down India on foreign soil, now Rahul Gandhi meets and engages with anti-India Ilhan Omar - 1) Ilhan had introduced anti-India resolutions in US Congress 2) She has been against abrogation of Art 370 3) She violated India's sovereignty &amp; visited PoK on a trip sponsored by Pakistan 4) She met Imran Khan &amp; other such elements to discuss "Islamophobia" in India 5) She has been instrumental in peddling hatred against Hindus Why did Rahul Gandhi have to meet her? Why is he engaging with the most radical anti-India elements on every foreign trip? In BJP virodh - desh virodh is ok?," he posted on X.</p>

<p>Party spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari said, "Rahul Gandhi's meeting with Pro Pakistan Ilhan Omar in the United States of America has made it clear that - He endorses Pak apologists - He endorses Anti India elements Congress Party chooses to compromise with India's national security."</p>

<p>Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, on a three-day visit to the United States, engaged with the Indian community, students, and US lawmakers. His trip began with meetings at the Rayburn House Office Building, hosted by Congressman Bradley James Sherman. Among the attendees were US Congress members Jonathan Jackson, Ro Khanna, Raja Krishnamoorthi, Barbara Lee, Shri Thanedar, Jesus G. "Chuy" Garcia, Ilhan Omar, Hank Johnson, and Jan Schakowsky.</p>

<p>Sources told ANI that Mr Gandhi also met US diplomat Donald Lu and Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal. He also met Lu, Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia, on September 9 in Washington DC, ahead of Lu's visit to India and Bangladesh. He also interacted with Pramila Jayapal and officials from the US House Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>

<p>Mr Gandhi's visit to the US is his first since becoming the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha. Following his arrival, Mr Gandhi said he is looking forward to engaging in meaningful discussions that will strengthen the bond between India and the US. In a Facebook post, he described his visit to Dallas as a great start.</p>

<p>"My interaction with students and faculty at the University of Texas was dynamic and engaging, with thoughtful discussions on politics, production, skill-respect in India, and the vital role of youth and women in shaping the future of our nations," he said. He also spoke about the importance of the Indian community and their role in bridging the two countries.</p>

<p>Chairperson of the Indian Overseas Congress, Sam Pitroda, had already outlined the visit's activities, mentioning a full day in Dallas with events including the student discussion, a large community event with nearly 4,000 attendees, and a community dinner. Pitroda also noted upcoming meetings on Capitol Hill, at the National Press Club, with think tanks, and other engagements.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US media gave the edge to Democratic Presidential nominee Kamala Harris in her heated debate with her Republican rival Donald Trump. In sharp contrast to President Joe Biden's performance during his July debate, Harris was visibly confident and focused at the prime-time debate held in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>ABC News, which hosted the debate, focused on the falsehoods and conspiracies that Trump resorted to in a desperate attempt to outshine Harris. He was put on the defensive early in the debate as Harris didn't waste time in attacking Trump, it said.</p>

<p><strong>Check highlights of the debate <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-debate-live-donald-trump-and-kamala-harris-to-face-off-in-1st-televised-debate-6537144">here</a></strong></p>

<p>Politico declared Harris the winner of the debate - and said it wasn't even a close victory. She repeatedly baited him and knocked him off balance, it said.</p>

<p>The New York Times said Harris "owned much of the night" as she used her skills as prosecutor to put Trump on the defensive.</p>

<p>Vice President Harris was expected to defend the Biden administration before her rival Trump, but NYT pointed out the Republican was left defending his own record as President rather than picking on hers.</p>

<p>Trump looked "miserable", resorting to crowd sizes and conspiracies - which captured his difficult night, the NYT said. Harris was well prepared in leading him astray, it added.</p>

<p>Washington Post said Trump often strayed from facts and resorted to debunked theories about the 2020 presidential polls that he lost and immigration.</p>

<p>Harris called out Trump's "same old tired playbook, a bunch of lies, grievances and name-calling", declaring the Republican has no plan for the people and is more interested in defending himself.</p>

<p>The Post said Harris was able to deliver her case against Trump in a way that Biden struggled to do in July. She was ready with retorts to most of Trump's charges, it added.</p>

<p>CNN said Trump took every bait that Harris used to throw him off his game. The Vice President was well prepared and her every retort was designed to enrage Trump, who was often out of control, it said.</p>

<p>Trump nearly choked on Harris' baits, it reported, pointing out that he went on a bizarre spell insisting that migrants eat Americans' pets.</p>

<p>Fox News tried a balancing act, but focused on Trump having to spar with the ABC News' debate moderators for fact-checking him.</p>

<p>Trump and Harris faced off in their first televised debate on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Trump was initially leading in national polls, but the entry of Harris changed the game. Latest polls suggest the two leaders are neck and neck with the Democrat maintaining a marginal lead over her Republican rival.</p>

<p>If Harris wins the November polls, she will become the first woman president of the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former President Donald Trump said he does not care how Vice-President Kamala Harris identified racially. Harris' mother was from India and her father was from Jamaica. She identified both as black and Indian American.</p>

<p>"I don't, and I don't care," Trump said at the presidential debate when he was referencing the earlier statement. "I don't care what she is. I don't care if you make a big deal out of something. I couldn't care less. Whatever she wants to be is okay with me."</p>

<p>When the moderators pushed back, reminding him of his earlier statement, he said, "So I don't know. I don't know. I mean, all I can say is, I read where she was not black that she put out, and I'll say that. And then I read that she was black, and that's okay. Either one was okay with me. That's up to her."</p>

<p>In July, Trump said at a black journalists' conference, "I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black and now she wants to be known as black. So, I don't know, is she Indian or is she black?" Trump said.</p>

<p>Asked to respond to Trump's new position on the issue, Harris said, "I think it's a tragedy that we have someone who wants to be President who has consistently, over the course of his career, attempted to use race to divide the American people. You know, I do believe that the vast majority of us know that we have so much more in common than what separates us, and we don't want this kind of approach that is just constantly trying to divide us, especially by race."</p>

<p>"And let's remember how Donald Trump started. He owned land, he owned buildings, and he was investigated because he refused to rent property to black families. Let's remember this is the same individual who took out a full-page ad in the New York Times calling for the execution of five young black and Latino boys who were innocent. The Central Park Five took out a full-page ad calling for their execution."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is the same individual who spread birth lies about the first black President of the United States. And I think the American people want better than that. Want better than this. Want someone who understands as I do. I travel to our country. We see in each other, a friend. We see each other, a neighbour. We don't want a leader who is constantly trying to have Americans point their fingers at each other," she added.</p>

<p>Trump hit back, saying, "This is the most divisive President in the history of our country. There's never been anything like it. They're destroying our country, and they come up with things like what she just said, going back many, many years when a lot of people, including Mayor Bloomberg, agreed with me on the Central Park Five, they admitted, they said they pleaded guilty. And I said, well, if they plead guilty, they badly hurt a person, killed a person, ultimately. And if they plead guilty, then they plead we're not guilty ...I built one of the greatest economies in the history of the world, and I'm going to build it again."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[If Tesla were to now actually invest billions in xAI, and/or share revenue with it, the potential conflict of interest could hardly be clearer.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The all-in view of Tesla Inc. was summed up in a line from a report this summer by one of the more all-in analysts covering the company: "The car is to Tesla what the video game chip is to Nvidia. The car is to Tesla what selling books is to Amazon." Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas was arguing that Tesla is morphing from a maker of electric vehicles to an artificial intelligence and robotics powerhouse. On this reading, a Tesla isn't just a box-on-wheels with a battery but an AI-delivery vehicle. Chief Executive Elon Musk also touts this thesis, declaring with typical bravado: "If somebody doesn't believe Tesla is going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company."</p>

<p>An asterisk on that statement might be in order. This weekend, the Wall Street Journal reported that xAI, Musk's artificial intelligence side gig to his social media side gig, X, has floated the possibility of licensing its models to aid Tesla's autonomous driving ambitions in exchange for a revenue-sharing deal. Musk dismissed the story over the course of several tweets, including calling it "nonsense."</p>

<p>On the other hand, only five months ago, Musk accused Reuters of "lying" when it reported that Tesla had scrapped plans for a sub-$30,000 EV model, only for the company to soon after announce a pivot from a very cheap EV toward robotaxis. Plus, Musk has already polled that body of impartial sages known as his followers as to whether Tesla should invest $5 billion in xAI (the majority answered in the affirmative).</p>

<p>That flapping sound you hear is the wind blowing through a resplendence of red flags.</p>

<p>Musk has a habit of treating his various separate companies as parts of a unified whole. The most egregious example was Tesla's acquisition of SolarCity Corp. in 2016, whereby the EV company bought a spiraling rooftop solar business that was chaired by Musk, owed him (and Space X) money and was run by his cousin. Even Jonas later characterized that deal as a "controlled detonation." When Musk first bought Twitter Inc., which became X, he brought in engineers from Tesla to review its code. A few months ago, he redirected thousands of Nvidia Corp. chips destined for Tesla to xAI, explaining it away as a logistical hiccup.</p>

<p>If Tesla were to now actually invest billions in xAI, and/or share revenue with it, the potential conflict of interest could hardly be clearer. X has struggled as a business since Musk's takeover, with advertising revenue under pressure and Fidelity, one of the co-investors, marking down the value of its stake enormously. Musk has indicated that the shareholders of X would own 25% of xAI, though it isn't clear if that would be individually or collectively through X itself. Either way, any infusion of cash or revenue potential from Tesla would be useful not only to xAI but to the broader X project.</p>

<p>Such a deal would also make a mockery of Tesla's justification for awarding a gigantic options package to Musk and then pushing for its reinstatement after a Delaware court struck it down. Chairwoman Robyn Denholm exhorted shareholders to vote yes by arguing, in part, that it would keep Musk's roving eye focused on Tesla: "We want those ideas, that energy and that time to be at Tesla, for the benefit of you, our owners," she wrote. This followed Musk's unsubtle threat to take his AI vision elsewhere if he didn't get a bigger stake in Tesla (after he had sold off a chunk during the takeover of Twitter).</p>

<p>If Tesla were to end up investing in, or contracting with, another Musk-controlled venture that literally has AI in its name, that rather suggests at least some of his AI ideas went elsewhere, options or no. Beyond the conflicts and governance-trolling, though, there's a more fundamental problem here.</p>

<p>Jonas, like similarly bullish analysts, ascribes only a fraction of his Tesla valuation to the making and selling of EVs, even though this accounts for the vast majority of the company's revenue and profit. The only way to remotely justify the almost $700 billion market cap is to believe that Tesla isn't a mere automaker but instead an AI pioneer.</p>

<p>Yet if that is the case, if Tesla is going to "solve autonomy," why would it consider outsourcing core AI functions or feel the need to invest billions of dollars into a startup launched only last year? Automakers do partner with other companies for certain technologies. But Musk has been saying for years that Tesla is already on the cusp of cracking vehicle autonomy under its own steam. Putting money, or revenue, into xAI undercuts that narrative and would divert some of the promised value away from Tesla's shareholders to Musk's own ventures.</p>

<p>Perhaps these are mere proposals and polls that stay just that. Still, there was another line in that Jonas report that sticks, telling investors to prepare for the company's new strategy "to more conspicuously connect Tesla with Elon's other controlled enterprises such as SpaceX/Starlink, X and xAI." Autonomy is, after all, about just doing what you want.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A weight loss drug has been found to be broadly safe and effective for children under 12 with obesity, according to a small study on Wednesday that was cautiously welcomed by outside experts.</p>

<p>A new class of weight loss drugs called GLP-1 agonists have become hugely popular across the world in the last couple of years, sparking stock shortages and widespread off-label use despite steep prices.</p>

<p>But little research has been conducted on how these new drugs work on young children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Obesity in children and adolescents has quadrupled since 1990, according to the World Health Organization. Yet there are no regularly prescribed drugs which treat obesity in children.</p>

<p>The study looked at an older GLP-1 agonist called liraglutide, sold under the brand name Saxenda by Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk, which also makes the blockbuster semaglutide drugs Ozempic and Wegovy.</p>

<p>The US-based phase 3 trial, which was funded by Novo Nordisk, was the first to investigate liraglutide's effect on under-12s.</p>

<p>It involved 82 children aged six to 12 with obesity, some of whom were randomly assigned a daily injection of liraglutide, while others received a placebo. The children were also encouraged to exercise and eat healthily.</p>

<p>After a little over a year, 46 per cent of the children receiving the drug saw their body mass index (BMI) shrink by at least five per cent, according to the study.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Only nine per cent of the placebo group had such a reduction in BMI, which also takes into account height and was used because children at these ages grow quickly.</p>

<p>Some children taking the drug also reported side effects such as vomiting and nausea, which was in line with those experienced by adults, the researchers said.</p>

<p>Lead study author Claudia Fox of the University of Minnesota said that kids living with obesity are currently told to just "try harder with diet and exercise".</p>

<p>But these findings raise hopes that a drug could one day help these children "live healthier, more productive lives," she said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Stunted growth fear&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Stephen Burgess, a statistician at the University of Cambridge not involved in the research, said the study showed that drugs could "help change the trajectory of weight gain in young children".</p>

<p>"While receiving weight loss injections is clearly not the ideal solution to childhood obesity, reductions in body mass index for trial participants were sustained even beyond the duration of the treatment course," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Simon Cork, a researcher at the UK's Anglia Ruskin University, said that "the evidence that liraglutide is both safe and effective in children is positive".</p>

<p>But one concern about children taking weight loss drugs such as GLP-1 agonists which work by suppressing appetite is that this could risk stunting growth, he warned.</p>

<p>The new study showed no evidence this had occurred.</p>

<p>But Cork said that "further studies over longer time periods will need to be undertaken to ensure that appetite suppression in these children does not have unforeseen negative consequences later in their development".</p>

<p>The study was presented at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes being held in Madrid and was also published in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A production line in a warehouse in western Afghanistan churns out 24 energy drinks every second, feeding a thirst for the tonic used to mask life's hardships and lift wilting spirits.</p>

<p>The Taliban government has purged many signs of Western influence but a stimulant drink craze that arrived with US soldiers remains, and has even sprouted a thriving domestic industry.</p>

<p>Alcohol is outlawed in Afghanistan but caffeine-rich energy drinks are consumed by all, from secret police to children, and advertised on billboards more than even Taliban state propaganda.</p>

<p>Many homegrown brand names evoke the bygone war: "Commando", "Attack", and "Predator".</p>

<p>"It's obvious that there are more struggles and hardships of life among the youth here," said Milad Ghaznavi at a Herat city supermarket aisle that boasted 40 varieties of the beverage.</p>

<p>"Energy drinks have become kind of a habit and a craving for people," Ghaznavi told AFP.</p>

<p>"They consume anything that comforts them," said the 19-year-old, who claimed he had been "addicted" but gave them up for health reasons.</p>

<h3><strong>'We drink energy'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Energy drinks, which are high in caffeine and sugar and often more available than drinking water at roadside kiosks, are seen by many Afghans as a way to supplement an insufficient diet.</p>

<p>Nearly 90 per cent of people in poverty-stricken Afghanistan are consuming inadequate food, according to the World Food Programme (WFP).</p>

<p>Most recent data from March reveals 86 per cent of households are relying on less-preferred and cheaper food, with more than a third reducing meals and more than half reducing portions.</p>

<p>Gulzar, a labourer, fuels his 14-hour work days with four cans of "Hit".</p>

<p>"We work here, we sweat, so when we are tired we drink energy," said the 40-year-old, who goes by one name.</p>

<p>"If you don't drink you are tired, you have a headache, you are weary."</p>

<p>But drinking that many energy drinks comes with a cost.</p>

<h3><strong>Health impacts&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Gulzar's diet contains over 100 grams of sugar -- twice the intake the World Health Organization recommends -- as well as a caffeine hit equivalent to six espressos, which he compares to a smoking habit.</p>

<p>Excessive caffeine consumption can cause high blood pressure, heart palpitations, anxiety and insomnia, according to the US Food and Drug Administration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Gulzar says he has no choice.</p>

<p>"Afghanistan is below impoverished," he said. "If we had the means we wouldn't use this."</p>

<p>Local brands cost only around 30 Afghani ($0.40) while imported Red Bull or Monster, two of the most popular global names, are unaffordable to most.</p>

<p>The poorest Afghans, who rely on dwindling foreign aid, are unable to buy energy drinks and instead subsist on bread with caffeinated green tea.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Business is good'</strong>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Energy drinks were invented in Japan in 1962 but exploded in popularity during the 2000s into a global sector worth nearly $40 billion this year, according to research firm Future Market Insights.</p>

<p>In the industrial hub of western Herat, the Pamir Cola company says it produces over a million cans daily.</p>

<p>Still, Pamir Cola says it is a minor player in an industry it estimates produces two cans a day for each of Afghanistan's 40 million citizens.</p>

<p>The figure is impossible to verify because of the drought of data on Afghan commerce.</p>

<p>Workers at the company funnel sugar and citric acid into the bowels of a machine pumping out product every moment the electricity is on.</p>

<p>Pamir Cola says it manufactures to EU standards in a largely unregulated Afghan market left to its own devices.</p>

<p>While Red Bull affiliates with glamorous extreme sports and Monster with motorsports, Zahir Shah Bahaduri, who runs Pamir Cola with his two brothers, is under no illusions.</p>

<p>"For the people of Afghanistan who do hard labour duties and don't have good food, the best way for them is to drink energy drinks," said the 45-year-old.</p>

<p>"I think business is good and will probably get better."</p>

<p>By the side of a Kabul highway, enterprising vendors stack energy drinks high as the traffic roars past.</p>

<p>"It removes their tiredness," said 36-year-old Ahmad Gulab, who sometimes sells to customers by the crate. "It's their joy in life."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A California woman has been awarded $5.6 million after being sexually assaulted during a strip search while visiting her husband in prison. The incident occurred in September 2019 at a correctional facility in Tehachapi.</p>

<p>Christina Cardenas, who had travelled four hours to see her husband, was subjected to a series of invasive searches, including strip searches, drug and pregnancy tests, and medical scans. During one of these procedures, a male doctor sexually assaulted her.</p>

<p>"My motivation in pursuing this lawsuit was to ensure that others do not have to endure the same egregious offences that I experienced," Mrs Cardenas told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-inmate-wife-christina-cardenas-strip-search-settlement-lawyers/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>CBS News.</em></a></p>

<p>The settlement, which includes contributions from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and several individual defendants, will provide Mrs Cardenas with significant compensation for the harm she endured.</p>

<p>The lawsuit highlighted the excessive and invasive nature of the searches, which were conducted based on a warrant that authorized strip searches only if contraband was detected through X-rays or CT scans. Despite multiple scans revealing no evidence of contraband, Mrs Cardenas was subjected to humiliating and invasive procedures.</p>

<p>In addition to the sexual assault, Mrs Cardenas was subjected to other forms of mistreatment, including being denied necessities like water and bathroom use. She was also forced to pay exorbitant fees for the medical procedures she underwent.</p>

<p>Mrs Cardenas' attorneys argued that the prison officials' actions were intended to intimidate and deter her from visiting her husband. They emphasised that the invasive searches and the sexual assault were a clear violation of her rights.</p>

<p>The settlement includes a requirement for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to implement new policies to protect the rights of visitors who are subjected to strip searches. These policies will ensure that visitors are informed of their rights, that searches are conducted respectfully, and that the scope of the searches is strictly adhered to.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump's suggestion that he had sent a Taliban leader the photo of his own house has sparked a meme fest on social media.</p>

<p>The former president was talking about his negotiation with the Taliban before the 2021 withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, during the televised debate with his Democratic rival Kamala Harris. He was the President that time.</p>

<p>Criticised by Harris for brokering the "one of the weakest deals" with Taliban, Trump said that he spoke to Abdul, "the head of Taliban", at a time when the Taliban were killing US soldiers with snipers.</p>

<p>"I told Abdul don't do it anymore, you do it anymore you're going to have problems. And he said why do you send me a picture of my house? I said you're going to have to figure that out, Abdul. And for 18 months we had nobody killed," the former President said.</p>

<p><strong>Read |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-debate-kamala-harris-donald-trump-how-tables-turned-between-biden-vs-trump-and-harris-vs-trump-6538351">How Tables Turned Between Biden vs Trump And Harris vs Trump</a></p>

<p>In all likelihood, he was referring to Abdul Ghani Baradar, a senior Taliban commander and Afghanistan's first deputy prime minister.</p>

<p>The comment evoked a laugh from her rival Harris and a plethora of memes online - some suggesting that it would have been really an awkward moment for Abdul to find the photo of his own in the chat with the US President.</p>

<p>Here are some memes:</p>

<p>Trump and Harris faced off in their first televised debate on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Harris, who was passed the baton after President Joe Biden opted out of his re-election bid, targeted Trump over his criminal cases and favouring corporations and vowed to help small businesses prosper.</p>

<p>Trump was initially leading in national polls, but the entry of Harris changed the game. Latest polls suggest the two leaders are neck and neck with the Democrat maintaining a marginal lead over her Republican rival.</p>

<p>If she wins the November polls, Harris will become the first woman president of the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When he was a witch doctor, Moussa Diallo would regularly smear himself in a lotion made from a clitoris cut from a girl subjected to female genital mutilation.</p>

<p>"I wanted to be a big chief, I wanted to dominate," said the small but charismatic fiftysomething from northwest Ivory Coast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I put it on my face and body" every three months or so "for about three years", said Diallo, who asked AFP not to use his real name.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Genitalia cut from girls in illegal "circumcision" ceremonies is used in several regions of the West African country to "make love potions" or magic ointments that some believe will help them "make money or reach high political office", said Labe Gneble, head of the National Organisation for Women, Children and the Family (ONEF).</p>

<p>A ground-down clitoris can sell for up to around $170 (152 euros), the equivalent of what many in Ivory Coast earn in a month.</p>

<p>Diallo stopped using the functions a decade ago, but regional police chief Lieutenant N'Guessan Yosso confirmed to AFP that dried clitorises are still "very sought after for mystical practices".</p>

<p>And it is clear from extensive interviews AFP conducted with former faith healers, circumcisers, social workers, researchers and NGOs, that there is a thriving traffic in female genitalia for the powers they supposedly impart.</p>

<p>Many are convinced the trade is hampering the fight against female genital mutilation (FGM), which has been banned in the religiously diverse nation for more than a quarter of a century.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite that, one in five Ivorian women are still being cut, according to the OECD, with one in two being mutilated in parts of the north.</p>

<h3><strong>Cut and mixed with plants&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Before he had a crisis of conscience and decided to campaign against FGM, Diallo said he was often asked by the women who performed excisions around the small town of Touba to use his powers to protect them from evil spells.</p>

<p>Female circumcision has been practised by different religions in West Africa for centuries, with most girls cut between childhood and adolescence. Many families consider it a rite of passage or a way to control and repress female sexuality, according to the UN Children's agency UNICEF, which condemns cutting as a dangerous violation of girls' fundamental rights.</p>

<p>Beyond the physical and psychological pain, cutting can be fatal, and lead to sterility, birth complications, chronic infections and bleeding, not to mention the loss of sexual pleasure.</p>

<p>Diallo would often accompany the women who do the cutting out into the forest or to a home where dozens of girls would be circumcised, often surrounded by fetishes and sacred objects. So it was relatively easy for the former faith healer to obtain the precious powder.</p>

<p>"When they would cut the clitorises they would dry them for a month or two then pound them with stones," he said.</p>

<p>The result was a "black powder" which was then sometimes mixed with "leaves, roots and bark" or shea butter that is often used in cosmetics.</p>

<p>They could then sell it for around "100,000 CFA Francs (152 euros) if the girl was a virgin" or "65,000 (99 euros) if she already had a child" or barter it for goods and services, Diallo added.</p>

<p>The ex-witch doctor said he was able to get some of the powder recently -- a mix of human flesh and plants, he believes -- from a cutter in his village.</p>

<p>AFP was shown the powder but was unable to analyse it without buying it.</p>

<h3><strong>'Organ trafficking'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Former circumcisers interviewed by AFP insisted that clitorises cut from girls are either buried, thrown into a river or given to the parents, depending on local custom.</p>

<p>But one in the west of the country admitted some end up being used for magic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Some people pretend they are the girls' parents and go off with the clitoris," she said.</p>

<p>Witch doctors use them for "incantations" and sell them afterwards, she claimed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another circumciser said some of her colleagues were complicit in the trade, "giving (genitalia) to people who are up to no good" for occult purposes. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Mutilated when she was still a child, one victim told AFP that her mother warned her to bring home the flesh that had been cut.</p>

<p>The trade is regarded as "organ trafficking" in Ivorian law and is punishable -- like FGM -- with fines and several years in prison, said lawyer Marie Laurence Didier Zeze.</p>

<p>But police in Odienne, who are in charge of five regions in the country's northwest, said no one has ever been indicted for trafficking.</p>

<p>"People won't say anything about sacred practices," lamented Lieutenant N'Guessan Yosso.</p>

<p>The cutters themselves are both feared and respected, locals told AFP, often seen as prisoners of evil spirits.</p>

<h3><strong>'Just nuts'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"A clitoris cannot give you magical powers, it's just nuts," said gynaecologist Jacqueline Chanine based in the country's commercial capital Abidjan.</p>

<p>Even so, the practice is still stubbornly widespread in some parts of the country, according to researchers.</p>

<p>Dieudonne Kouadio, an anthropologist specialising in health, was presented with a box of the powder in the town of Odienne, 150 kilometres north of Touba.</p>

<p>"It contained a dried cut organ in the form of a blackish powder," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His discovery was included in a 2021 report for the Djigui Foundation, whose conclusions were accepted by the Ministry for Women.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Farmers in Denguele district, of which Odienne is a part, "buy clitorises and mix the powder with their seeds to increase the fertility of their fields", said Nouho Konate, a Djigui foundation member who has been fighting FGM in the area for 16 years.</p>

<p>He said parents of young girls were "gutted" when he told them of the trafficking.</p>

<p>Further south and in the centre west of the country, women use clitoris powder as an aphrodisiac, hoping to prevent their husbands from straying, said criminologist Safie Roseline N'da, author of a 2023 study on FGM which also pointed to the trade.</p>

<p>She and her two co-authors discovered that blood from cut women was also being used to honour traditional gods.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They are far from the only Ivorian folk remedies that use body parts, according to lawyer Didier Zeze.</p>

<h3><strong>Mystic beliefs keep it going&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"The mystic has a central place in daily life" in the Ivory Coast -- where Islam, Christianity and traditional animist beliefs co-exist -- said the Canadian anthropologist Boris Koenig, a specialist in occult practices there. "It touches every sphere of people's social, professional, family and love lives," he said, and there is generally nothing illegal about it.</p>

<p>The trade, however, is "one of the reasons that FGM survives" in the Ivory Coast, NGOs argue, where the rate of cutting is generally falling and is below the West African average of 28 per cent, according to the OECD.</p>

<p>Back near Touba, the former witch doctor Diallo recalled how up to 30 women would be cut in a day in the places his magic protected.</p>

<p>The dry season between January to March was the favoured period for circumcisions when the hot Harmattan wind from the Sahara helps scars heal, he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Staff at the region's only social work centre say the cutting is still going on but is hard to quantify because it never happens in the open.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead, it goes on in secret, hidden behind traditional festivals which have nothing to do with the practice, kept going they say by circumcisers from neighbouring Guinea -- only a few kilometres away -- where FGM rates are over 90 per cent.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla CEO and tech billionaire Elon Musk shared a post on X, which he owns, after pop star Taylor Swift endorsed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris as the next US President.</p>

<p>In his post, Musk referred to Swift calling herself a "Childless Cat Lady," a term used by Trump's vice presidential pick, JD Vance, to mock women without children.</p>

<p>"Fine Taylor … you win … I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life," he wrote.</p>

<p>The 34-year-old singer said she will vote for Harris as she "fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion."</p>

<p>"I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate Tim Walz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman's right to her own body for decades," she said in lengthy post on Instagram.</p>

<p>The singer signed off the post as "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/backing-kamala-harris-taylor-swift-calls-herself-childless-cat-lady-6538227">Taylor Swift, Childless Cat Lady</a>."</p>

<p>The international music sensation has remained tight-lipped about her choice of candidate in the upcoming November election.</p>

<p>However, in her long Instagram post, he attacked the Trump campaign for using AI-generated images to falsely endorse Trump, which "conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation."</p>

<p>"It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth," she said.</p>

<p>US presidential hopefuls <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/harris-trump-face-off-for-first-time-in-key-us-presidential-debate-6537401">Kamala Harris and Donald Trump</a> clashed in a fiery debate on Tuesday over economy, immigration and the war in Gaza and Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Indian-American candidate made sharp attacks on her 78-year-old rival, calling him a "convicted felon", "friend of dictators" and saying that he used "race to divide the American people."</p>

<p>An agitated Trump hit back saying that Harris borrowed her campaign ideas from her predecessor Joe Biden and labelled her a "Marxist".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On June 28, shortly after Joe Biden and Donald Trump faced off in a Presidential debate for the high-stakes US election, many concluded that the fight was over even before it began. As the 81-year-old US President lost his train of thought multiple times while speaking on critical subjects, his 78-year-old predecessor and opponent mocked his confusion.</p>

<p>Cut to September 11, Trump faced a different Democrat presidential candidate. And this time, he was the older one and by a much larger margin. At 59, Vice-President Kamala Harris is nearly two decades younger and she did not miss an opportunity to drive this point home, albeit in a subtle manner. "What I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country," she said.</p>

<p>In US Presidential debates, televised and followed closely on social media, optics matter. Where Biden had appeared pale and confused, Harris was confident and focused. Harris started by walking up to Trump and shaking his hand, "Hi, Kamala Harris, let's have a good debate," she said. This was the first handshake on the US Presidential debate stage after eight years. It was underlined that this was the first time the two leaders met.</p>

<p>As the debate began, the vice president of Indian origin pulled no punches. On multiple occasions, she managed to get under Trump's skin, setting him off on rants his team would not be happy about. She targeted him over his convictions in criminal cases, his administration's handling of the Covid pandemic and his image on the global scene. The tables had turned. In the earlier debate, Biden had struggled to counter Trump's attacks on his policies, this time Harris' messaging was crisp and Trump appeared to be defensive.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the debate, responding to a question on US economy and cost of living, Ms Harris spoke of her middle-class background and plans to support families and small businesses if elected to the top post. Targeting Trump, she said he would provide tax cuts to "billionaires and big corporations". "Donald Trump has no plan for you," she said.</p>

<p>Trump responded with a personal attack. "She's a Marxist - everybody knows she's a Marxist. Her father's a Marxist professor in economics, and he taught her well," he said.</p>

<p>As Trump targeted Harris over Biden administration's immigration policies, she responded sharply, "You're going to hear from the same old tired playbook, a bunch of lies, grievances and name-calling." A key moment in the debate was when Trump rattled out a social media conspiracy theory that immigrants are eating pets.</p>

<p>"In Springfield, they're eating the dogs, the people that came in, they're eating the cats. They're eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what's happening in our country," he said. Harris' microphone was off, but she was seen laughing and mouthing "what?".</p>

<p>Another sharp response was when Harris, speaking about the Ukraine war, said that "Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe" if Trump was President. She also said Putin "would eat you for lunch".</p>

<p>Compare these exchanges to the ones during the Biden vs Trump debate. The older President appeared to be putting up a relatively muted performance and struggling to articulate himself as Trump put out fireworks. The debate was still underway when the White House said Biden was suffering from a cold. The US President's performance did not help his attempts to convince the nation that he could serve in what is among the world's most powerful positions till 86.</p>

<p><strong>"You are not running against Biden"</strong></p>

<p>A key challenge Harris faced going into this debate was Team Trump's push to tie her to the Biden administration's failure. Harris, however, responded by stressing that she represents a new generation of leadership and that it's time to "turn the page".</p>

<p>"I'm clearly not Joe Biden and certainly not Donald Trump. And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country, one who believes in what is possible. One who brings a sense of optimism about what we can do instead of always disparaging the American people," she said.</p>

<p>At another point, she said, "You have heard tonight, two very different visions for this country. One that is focused on the future and one that is focused on the past."</p>

<p>She also managed to irk Trump by saying that world leaders laughed at him and said, "You are a disgrace". Trump responded by citing close ties with Hungary Prime Minister Viktor Orban and that he has said Trump should return as President. The reference to Orban, known for restrictions on immigration and gay rights, was widely seen as Trump's continuing admiration of autocratic leaders.</p>

<p>While there was no specific mic drop moment, the debate did see several of Harris' punches land well. The November election is still likely to be a close contest -- ABC poll tracker shows a 2.8 percentage points -- but the Democrats have without doubt made a comeback from where they were during the June 28 Biden vs Trump debate.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taylor Swift announced her endorsement of Kamala Harris on Tuesday night, minutes after the Democratic presidential nominee wrapped up her first debate against Republican rival Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The endorsement aligns Harris with a singular force in the world of music, offering to bolster her support among younger and female voters.</p>

<p>Calling herself a "Childless Cat Lady," a term used by Trump's running mate, JD Vance, to disparage women without children, Swift announced her support in an Instagram post featuring a photo of her posing with a cat in her arms.</p>

<p>Swift is voting for Harris "because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them," she wrote. "I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos."</p>

<p>The pop superstar's obsessive fans have been closely scrutinizing her social media accounts and public appearances for signs of her allegiance in the election. Swift backed President Joe Biden and Harris in 2020 and has over the course of her career made a handful of other public statements in favor of Democratic politicians.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris and Donald Trump participated in the US Presidential Debate today, exactly eight weeks before the United States goes to polls. In a fierce debate that saw both candidates indulge in a verbal duel, there were claims and counter-claims.</p>

<p>The debate, which is the first such debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will most likely also be the only debate they take part in with just over 50 days to go for the election. The debate was televised on US' ABC News.</p>

<p>Tens of millions of Americans tuned in to understand better what each presidential candidate had to offer and what their respective visions are to steer their nation forward. US, being a country of immigrants and a major global power, also invokes interest of people living in other countries, millions of whom tuned in earlier today to witness the closely-contested debate.</p>

<p>Both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris traded claims about each other's record in office, as well as their plans if they emerge victorious in the election. Some of these claims required fact-checks to give a clear picture.</p>

<p><strong>FACT-CHECK 1 - THE ECONOMY</strong></p>

<p>Asked if Americans were better off than they were four years ago, Kamala Harris did not give a direct answer. She accused Trump of leaving Democrats "the worst unemployment since the Great Depression." This can be seen as misleading. Joblessness spiked at 14.8 per cent in April 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the US. By the time Trump left office unemployment was 6.4 percent.</p>

<p><strong>FACT-CHECK 2 - INFLATION</strong></p>

<p>Kamala Harris said she would offer families a tax credit of up to $6,000 for each eligible child, as well as a $50,000 tax deduction for small businesses, if elected president. She claimed that Donald Trump would favor billionaires and corporations over anyone else, and said the former president planned a sales tax that would hurt ordinary Americans.</p>

<p>Trump countered this claim by saying President Joe Biden's administration ushered in the highest inflation in US history, quoting figures of 21 per cent and as high as 60 per cent on some goods. This is false. Inflation currently stands at 2.9 percent. Inflation did hit a high of 9.1 percent under Biden in 2022. This was well below a historic high of 23.7 percent in 1920.</p>

<p><strong>FACT-CHECK 3 - IMMIGRATION AND 'MIGRANT CRIME'</strong></p>

<p>Donald Trump falsely claimed that "millions and millions" of people from countries such as Venezuela "from mental institutions and insane asylums" are entering the US and committing crimes. He also re-aired a baseless viral claim that migrants are eating pets in places including Springfield, Ohio.</p>

<p>"In Springfield, they're eating the dogs, the people that came in, they're eating the cats. They're eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what's happening in our country."</p>

<p>Police and local authorities say there are no credible reports of any such animal killings.</p>

<p>Violent and property crimes in the US are near their lowest levels in decades, according to FBI data from 2022, the most recent year for which figures are available.</p>

<p>A June 2023 study found a decline in incarceration rates among immigrants from all regions since 1960. Other research has found migrants commit fewer violent crimes than US citizens.</p>

<p>FBI statistics from the first three months of 2024 also show a 15 percent decrease in violent and property crime year-over-year.</p>

<p>Illegal immigration during Donald Trump's administration was higher than under President Barack Obama's two terms. Earlier this year, during the Biden administration, illegal immigration reached a historic high. It has fallen since an executive order signed in July.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris said Donald Trump put politics above policy by ordering Republican lawmakers this summer to kill a bipartisan bill that would have toughened policies at the southern US border.</p>

<p><strong>FACT-CHECK 4 - ABORTION</strong></p>

<p>Donald Trump, who appointed three conservative judges to a Supreme Court that overturned Roe vs Wade, the precedent that guaranteed abortion access, called Democrats "radical" on the issue, claiming vice presidential candidate Tim Walz supports "execution after birth - it's execution, no longer abortion - because the baby is born is okay, and that's not okay with me."</p>

<p>This is false. No state allows a baby to be killed after it is born. This is infanticide, which is illegal across the US.</p>

<p>Debate moderator Linsey Davis corrected Donald Trump, saying: "There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born." Ms Harris added: "Nowhere in America is a woman carrying a pregnancy to term and asking for an abortion. That is not happening."</p>

<p>Kamala Harris claimed: "If Donald Trump were to be reelected, he will sign a national abortion ban." But the former president immediately replied: "I'm not signing a ban," saying that the issue is with the states.</p>

<p><strong>FACT-CHECK 5 - ON AFGHANISTAN</strong></p>

<p>Donald Trump claimed that the United States "left $85 billion" worth of equipment in Afghanistan. This is False. The actual figure is much lower than what Trump claimed in the debate. When the Taliban toppled Afghanistan's civilian government in 2021, it inherited US's military hardware given to the then government. The US Congress was briefed that about $7 billion of US military equipment remained in Afghanistan and in the Taliban's hands.</p>

<p>Speaking about Afghanistan, Kamala Harris said when he was president, Donald Trump had "invited the Taliban to Camp David." This is true, reported independent fact-checking agency <em>PolitiFact</em>. In September, 2019, Donald Trump had said he was canceling a planned, secret meeting for peace talks with the Taliban at Camp David. In February 2020, the US government and the Taliban signed a deal to end the war in Afghanistan within 14 months.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris said that Donald Trump "negotiated directly with a terrorist organisation called the Taliban. The negotiation involved the Taliban getting 5,000 terrorists released."</p>

<p>This is True. A 2020 agreement between the United States and the Taliban called for the release of up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners who were jailed by the Afghan government.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/sep/10/presidential-debate-live-fact-check-harris-trump/" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">PolitiFact</a>, news reports and statements from Afghanistan's president indicated that the release happened. Afghanistan officials said they freed the prisoners at the request of the US.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wednesday marks the 23rd anniversary of the devastating 9/11 terrorist attacks that shook the United States to its core. The 2001 attack on New York City's iconic World Trade Center had far-reaching global consequences, serving as a stark reminder of the vulnerability of even the most powerful nations.</p>

<p>On that fateful day, planes crashed into the Twin Towers, the Pentagon, and a field in Pennsylvania, claiming the lives of nearly 3,000 people. The attacks were the deadliest on US soil since the Pearl Harbor bombing, which had precipitated America's entry into World War II.</p>

<p>Among those who witnessed the horrific events firsthand was photojournalist Bill Biggart. Bravely documenting the chaos and destruction, Mr Biggart captured a haunting image of the collapsing remains of Tower Two. Tragically, this final frame would prove to be his last.</p>

<p><strong>See the picture here:</strong></p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The last photo taken by Bill Biggart, the only journalist killed covering 9/11. <a href="https://t.co/vt85v3dZw1">pic.twitter.com/vt85v3dZw1</a></p>
— Fascinating (@fasc1nate) <a href="https://twitter.com/fasc1nate/status/1833588782219624585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>A seasoned press photographer, Mr Biggart was known for his passion for capturing conflict and social movements both domestically and internationally. His work often took him into dangerous situations, where he fearlessly documented the realities of war and injustice.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://petapixel.com/2020/09/11/bill-biggart-the-hero-photographer-who-died-capturing-9-11/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>PetaPixel</em></a> reported that during the attack, Bill Biggart's wife called him on his cellphone to inform him it was an act of terrorism, not an accident. "I'm O.K.," he reassured her. "I'm with the firemen."</p>

<p>Bolivar Arellano, a photographer for the New York Post who was also covering the tragic event, recalled seeing his colleague, Bill Biggart, at the scene. According to Arellano, Biggart was closer to the towers than any other photographer, and even closer than many of the firefighters.</p>

<p>At 10:28:22 a.m., the weakened support beneath the impact zone of the North Tower finally gave way, causing the massive structure to collapse.</p>

<p>At 10:28:24 a.m., Bill Biggart captured a striking photograph of the South Tower's ruins alongside the still-standing base of the North Tower. The scene was a sombre tapestry of repetitive industrial lines, softened and fractured by dust and smoke. The image was nearly devoid of colour, reflecting the solemnity and grimness of the day.</p>

<p>Bill was likely still looking through the viewfinder of his Canon D30 when 500,000 tons of glass, concrete, and steel suddenly collapsed on him at 120 miles per hour.</p>

<p>Four days after the tragedy, rescue crews finally recovered Biggart's body from beneath the dense rubble that once was the World Trade Center. Biggart was the only professional photographer covering 9/11 who did not make it out alive.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of a game-changing presidential debate, US Vice President and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris walked over to her Republican rival Donald Trump and shook hands with him. This was the first time two US presidential candidates have shaken hands since 2016.</p>

<p>The debate also marks the first time the two candidates have met each other face-to-face.</p>

<p>As the two rivals entered the debate stage, Trump headed to his podium on the left to take his place. Kamala Harris, on the other hand, crossed the stage, walked up to him and held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Kamala Harris, Let's have a good debate," she said as she introduced herself to the former president.</p>

<p>"Nice to see you, let's have fun," Trump replied and the two shook hands.</p>

<p>"Thank you," Harris said.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Right off the bat, tonight's debate starts on a different foot than the Biden/Trump debate in June-- Harris goes for a handshake, introducing herself to Trump while saying, "Let's have a good debate."

<p>While there is no rule that require the two candidates to shake hand, it does mark a gesture of civility ahead of what is usually a politically brutal face-off.</p>

<p>The high-stakes debate began with a fiery jab by the 78-year-old Republican who called Harris a "Marxist" and claimed that she and President Joe Biden had allowed "millions of people pouring into our country from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums."</p>

<p>Harris jibed the former US president several time by calling him a "convicted felon", "friend of dictators" and saying that he used "race to divide the American people."</p>

<p>She said Trump's own former White House security officials have called him a "disgrace." "World leaders are laughing at Donald Trump," she added.</p>

<p>The crucial debate comes only 56 days before the election in what has been a narrow race to the White house.</p>

<p>The last presidential debate in June resulted in Joe Biden pulling out of his reelection campaign and nominating Harris to take his place instead.</p>

<p>Almost all polls have shown the two candidates in a tight neck-and-neck contest.</p>

<p>The debate proved to be a critical chance for the two rivals to battle it out before the US goes to vote on November 5.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said his Tuesday showdown with Democrat Kamala Harris was his "best debate ever," and accused the ABC network moderators of working against him.</p>

<p>"I thought that was my best Debate, EVER, especially since it was THREE ON ONE!" Trump posted on social media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kamala Harris savaged Donald Trump as "extreme" and the friend of dictators, while the Republican branded her a "Marxist" in a bitter televised debate Tuesday that poured fuel on an already explosive US presidential election.</p>

<p>On hot-button issues ranging from abortion and race to the fate of US democracy, the two held their first -- and possibly only -- debate ahead of the November 5 election, with each hoping for a breakthrough in an agonizingly close race.</p>

<p>Trump, who only a few weeks ago had believed himself to be cruising to victory, reacted to pressure from Harris by raising his voice and resorting to the kinds of colorful invective and often meandering insults that he uses at his rallies.</p>

<p>Harris, 59, responded by looking on in amusement, then clearly got under his skin, declaring that she represents a fresh start after the "mess" of the Trump presidency -- and saying: "We're not going back."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

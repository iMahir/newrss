       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistani singer Rahat Fateh Ali Khan today dismissed reports that he was arrested in Dubai. "Not true," said Mr Khan in a video posted on X.</p>

<p>"I am Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, your Rahat Fateh Ali Khan. I came here (to Dubai) to record songs... Everything is fine. I request you not to pay any attention to disgusting rumours. These reports are not true," he said.</p>

<p>"News circulating regarding the arrest of Rahat Fateh Ali Khan is fake and baseless. Regards Team RFAK," read the caption of the video posted by his team.</p>

<p>Several reports claimed that the popular singer was arrested over a defamation complaint by his former manager Salman Ahmed. The reports claimed that Mr Khan had dismissed Mr Ahmed a few months earlier following a dispute.</p>

<p>"You are my power. My audience and fans are my power. After god, my fans are my power," the 49-year-old said in the video message.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The singer hit headlines earlier this year when a video of him hitting a man with shoes surfaced online.&nbsp;In the clip, Mr Khan asked for a bottle from the man, who said that he didn't know about it. The singer replied, "<em>Main tujhe marunga </em>(I will beat you)." In a fit of rage, Mr Khan slapped the individual as he walked out of the room to look for the bottle.</p>

<p>Mr Khan later posted a clarification video alongside the man, who claimed to be the singer's student.&nbsp;They explained that the requested bottle contained holy water from a religious cleric who recited verses over it.&nbsp;"The bottle contained 'holy water' and I forgot where I kept it. He is my teacher, my father," the man said. Mr Khan also claimed that he apologised to the man later.</p>

<p>Rahat Fateh Ali Khan is the nephew of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan - a world-renowned Qawwali singer. Mr Khan has also sung several popular songs in Hindi cinema.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Bangladeshi student group leading demonstrations that have spiralled into deadly violence suspended protests Monday for 48 hours, with its leader saying they had not wanted reform "at the expense of so much blood".</p>

<p>What began as demonstrations against politicised admission quotas for sought-after government jobs snowballed into some of the worst unrest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's tenure.</p>

<p>A curfew has been imposed and soldiers are patrolling cities across the South Asian country, while a nationwide internet blackout since Thursday has drastically restricted the flow of information to the outside world.</p>

<p>"We are suspending the shutdown protests for 48 hours," Nahid Islam, the top leader of the main protest organiser Students Against Discrimination, told AFP from his hospital bed.</p>

<p>He was being treated for his injuries after being beaten by people he accused of being undercover police, he said.</p>

<p>"We demand that during this period the government withdraws the curfew, restores the internet and stops targeting the student protesters."</p>

<p>On Sunday, the Supreme Court pared back the number of reserved jobs for specific groups, including the descendants of "freedom fighters" from Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.</p>

<p>"We started this movement for reforming the quota," Islam said.</p>

<p>"But we did not want quota reform at the expense of so much blood, so much killing, so much damage to life and property."</p>

<p>At least 163 people have died in clashes, including several police officers, according to an AFP count of victims reported by police and hospitals.</p>

<p>Sporadic violence continued Monday, with four people brought to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital with bullet injuries, an AFP reporter at the scene saw.</p>

<p>Government officials have repeatedly blamed the protesters and opposition for the unrest.</p>

<p>Dhaka Metropolitan Police spokesman Faruk Hossain told AFP that "at least 532" people had been arrested in the capital since protests began, including some leaders of the opposition Bangladesh National Party.</p>

<p>Ali Riaz, a professor of politics and leading Bangladesh expert at Illinois State University, described the violence as "the worst massacre by any regime since independence".</p>

<p>"The atrocities committed in the past days show that the regime is entirely dependent on brute force and has no regard for the lives of the people," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"These indiscriminate killings cannot be washed by a court ruling or a government announcement."</p>

<p><strong>Diplomatic questions</strong></p>

<p>Bangladeshi Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus urged "world leaders and the United Nations to do everything within their powers to end the violence".</p>

<p>"There must be investigations into the killings that have taken place already," the 83-year-old said in a statement, his first public comments since the unrest began.</p>

<p>The respected economist is credited with lifting millions out of poverty with his pioneering microfinance bank but earned the enmity of Hasina, who has accused him of "sucking blood" from the poor.</p>

<p>"Bangladesh has been engulfed in a crisis that only seems to get worse with each passing day," Yunus said. "High school students have been among the victims."</p>

<p>Diplomats in Dhaka questioned Bangladeshi authorities' deadly response to the protests.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud summoned ambassadors for a briefing on Sunday and showed them a 15-minute video that sources said focused on damage caused by protesters.</p>

<p>US ambassador Peter Haas told Mahmud he was presenting a one-sided version of events, according to a senior diplomatic official.</p>

<p>"I am surprised you did not show the footage of police firing at unarmed protesters," the source quoted Haas as telling the minister.</p>

<p>A US embassy official speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed the ambassador's comments.</p>

<p>The diplomatic source added that Mahmud did not respond to a question from a UN representative about the alleged use of UN-marked armoured personnel carriers and helicopters to suppress the protests.</p>

<p>Bangladesh is a major contributor to UN peacekeeping operations around the world -- earning significant revenues from its efforts -- and has UN-marked equipment in its military inventories.</p>

<p><strong>'Freedom fighter' quota</strong></p>

<p>With around 18 million young people in Bangladesh out of work, according to government figures, the quota scheme's reintroduction deeply upset graduates facing an acute jobs crisis.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court decision curtailed the number of reserved jobs from 56 percent of all positions to seven percent, most of which will still be set aside for the children and grandchildren of "freedom fighters" from the 1971 war.</p>

<p>While 93 percent of jobs will be awarded on merit, the decision fell short of protesters' demands to scrap the "freedom fighter" category altogether.</p>

<p>Critics say the quota is used to stack public jobs with loyalists to Hasina's ruling Awami League.</p>

<p>Opponents accuse her government of bending the judiciary to its will.</p>

<p>Hasina, 76, has ruled the country since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.</p>

<p>Her government is also accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including by the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden dropped out of the forthcoming presidential election on Sunday and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party's new nominee. The announcement wasn't completely unexpected, especially after pressure mounted on Mr Biden following his poor performance in the first presidential debate last month. Amid this, former President Donald Trump's past donation to Kamala Harris' campaigns is going viral on social media.</p>

<p>The 45th President of the US donated twice to the campaigns of his potential presidential opponent. Financial records show that on September 26, 2011, and February 20, 2013, when Ms Harris was a candidate for California attorney general, Mr Trump gave $5,000 and $1,000 to her campaigns, respectively.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Ivanka Trump, the daughter of Mr Trump, further donated $2,000 to Senator Harris' campaign in 2014, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/biden-drops-out-election-2024/card/donald-trump-donated-thousands-to-kamala-harris-2uSNrJk08BdtPmwGPmEG"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>. A representative for Ms Harris clarified that she did not ask Trump for the donation. According to a 2020 Sacramento Bee report, Ms Harris gave the funds to a nonprofit organisation that "advocates for civil and human rights for Central Americans" during the start of Trump's presidential campaign.</p>

<p>As per a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-donated-kamala-harris-1928209"><em>Newsweek</em></a>, Mr Trump used to donate heavily to Democrats at that time. He also gave then-senator Joe Biden's campaign $1,000 in 2001. In 2002, he donated $5,000 to the New York State Democratic Party.</p>

<p>Mr Trump also donated $10,000 to Andrew Cuomo in support of his candidacy for attorney general of New York in 2006 and $15,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In 2010, he backed Kristen Gillibrand's campaign for the US Senate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Trump made multiple donations to the campaigns of his future opponent Hillary Clinton, including two contributions of $2,100 and $200, respectively, in 2006 and an additional $600 in 2007, according to OpenSecrets. Additionally, the non-profit organisation claims that he gave the Clinton Foundation at least $100,000 in donations.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Paris Olympics have been designed to showcase the City of Light in all its splendour, with events taking place at iconic locations.</p>

<p>AFP looks at five sites set to wow ticket-holders -- and a global TV audience of billions -- during the 17-day extravaganza starting on July 26:</p>

<p><strong>Eiffel Tower</strong></p>

<p>The most famous of the Paris landmarks, the Eiffel Tower, will welcome beach volleyball.</p>

<p>The action will take place in a temporary venue near the foot of the "Iron Lady".</p>

<p>Next door, the Champs de Mars park at the foot of the tower will host judo and wrestling.</p>

<p>Reviled by some Parisians when it was unveiled in 1889 for the World Fair by engineer Gustave Eiffel, the Eiffel Tower has become the capital's symbol.</p>

<p>Besides being one of the world's top tourist attractions, pulling in seven million visitors a year, it is also a working telecoms tower, used for radio and TV transmissions.</p>

<p>Winners at the Paris Games will all go home with a small part of the iron colossus. Each medal will contain an 18g crumb of original iron, removed during renovations, melted down and reforged.</p>

<p><strong>Grand Palais</strong></p>

<p>Fencing and taekwondo battles will take place in the opulent setting of the Grand Palais exhibition hall, a glass-and-steel masterpiece created for the World Fair of 1900.</p>

<p>Its distinctive feature is its glass domed roof, the largest of its kind in Europe, which covers a cavernous exhibition space of 13,500 square metres.</p>

<p>During World War I, the Grand Palais put its art collection in storage and converted its galleries into a military hospital where soldiers were patched up before returning to the trenches.</p>

<p>In the 21st century, the airy nave has hosted giant installations commissioned from some of the world's leading artists.</p>

<p>It has also been flooded to make the biggest ice rink in the world.</p>

<p><strong>Place de la Concorde</strong></p>

<p>The vast, paved square at the foot of the Champs-Elysees avenue, where heads rolled (literally) during the French Revolution, will serve as an urban sports hub.</p>

<p>Skateboarding, 3x3 basketball, BMX freestyle and, in its first Games appearance, breakdancing, will all take place on the elegant square by the Seine.</p>

<p>Its harmonious name conceals a bloody past. King Louis XVI and his wife Marie-Antoinette were guillotined there in 1793 during the Reign of Terror that followed the 1789 French Revolution.</p>

<p>The largest square in Paris is defined by its huge gold obelisk, one of a pair originally erected by Ramses II outside the temple in Luxor in Egypt. It was gifted to Paris in 1830.</p>

<p><strong>Palace of Versailles</strong></p>

<p>Dressage, showjumping and equestrian cross country will take place in the park of Versailles Palace, some 20 kilometres from Paris. It also feature on the marathon circuit and host pentathlon events.</p>

<p>In the 17th century, "the Sun King" Louis XIV transformed Versailles into a home of French royalty, where he resided with around 10,000 staff.</p>

<p>The vast gardens include a mile-long canal that once hosted opulent parties.</p>

<p>It has been a world heritage site since 1979 and is a firm favourite on the Paris tourist trail.</p>

<p><strong>Marseille</strong></p>

<p>The Olympics are spreading beyond the capital.</p>

<p>Sailing contests will take place in the Mediterranean city of Marseille, France's boisterous second city, better known as the home of Olympique Marseille football team.</p>

<p>Over 300 sailors from across the world will battle it out on the sapphire Mediterranean waters off the city. A marina has been built along the scenic Corniche coastal road heading southeast out of the city.</p>

<p>It's unlikely they'll have the sometimes ferocious mistral wind in their sails. It usually blows in winter and spring.</p>

<p>Marseille, which will also host 10 football matches, was where the Olympic torch landed in France on May 8 on its relay to Paris.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Kremlin said Monday it had noted the "unfriendly rhetoric" against Russia used by US Vice President, Kamala Harris, the frontrunner to replace Joe Biden in the US presidential election.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said previously that Moscow would prefer Biden over Donald Trump, calling the Democrat "more predictable."</p>

<p>Asked what the Kremlin made of Harris now looking likely to become the Democrats' candidate, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: "There have been some statements which were full of unfriendly rhetoric towards our country."</p>

<p>He did specify what comments he was referring to.</p>

<p>Harris, like Biden, has been a staunch backer of Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale military offensive in February 2022.</p>

<p>Earlier this year she said the death of opposition leader Alexei Navalny in an Arctic prison was "a further sign of Putin's brutality."</p>

<p>She has also called Russia's actions in Ukraine "horrendous atrocities," "gruesome," "barbaric," and "inhumane."</p>

<p>Peskov said Monday that Moscow could not "assess Harris's potential candidacy from the point of view of our bilateral relations, because so far we have not noticed her contribution to our bilateral relations."</p>

<p>Other than her "unfriendly" statements, Peskov said: "We have not recorded anything she's done in terms of our bilateral relations, either positively or negatively."</p>

<p>Biden on Sunday endorsed Harris to replace him in the presidential election, shortly after he announced he was dropping out with under four months to go until the vote.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Brett Clibbery and Sarah Packwood embarked across the Atlantic Ocean, sailing from Halifax to the Azores in their self-built, eco-friendly yacht, Theros.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A British-Canadian couple, who set sail across the Atlantic Ocean roughly six weeks ago, were found dead in a lifeboat off the coast of Canada. The bodies of Brett Clibbery and Sarah Packwood were discovered after their raft washed ashore on Sable Island, off the coast of Nova Scotia, reported the&nbsp;<a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/21/world-news/theories-emerge-on-brett-clibbery-and-sarah-packwood-deaths/ ">NY Post</a>.</p>

<p>The pair had embarked on an ambitious journey across the Atlantic Ocean, sailing from Halifax to the Azores in their self-built, eco-friendly yacht, Theros. The 42-foot vessel, powered solely by electric, wind, and solar energy, was intended to demonstrate the feasibility of sustainable travel. The couple had been posting about the construction of Theros on their YouTube channel, "Theros Adventures," and this voyage was to be their inaugural fully "green" journey.</p>

<p>They left Halifax Harbour on June 11 aboard their yacht bound for the Azores region of Portugal. They were reported missing on June 18 and found three weeks later on July 10.</p>

<p>While initially reported to be from British Columbia, it is believed that Ms Packwood was from the UK and Mr Clibbery was from Canada. Formal identification is still pending.</p>

<p>The cause of death is not yet known. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police are investigating the incident.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Their sailboat, Theros, was severely damaged, and investigators suspected that it was struck by a larger vessel.</p>

<p>The area they were sailing in is notoriously known as the "Graveyard of the Atlantic" due to the large number of shipwrecks that occurred there. The exact circumstances of the incident are still unknown, but investigators are exploring several theories.</p>

<p>One leading theory is that Theros was hit by a bulk carrier, which may have caused significant damage to the sailboat. Investigators have inspected a carrier ship, which was in the same area as Theros at the time of the incident, but they have not released their findings, as per the <a href="https://www.saltwire.com/atlantic-canada/news/ship-may-have-collided-with-couples-sailboat-off-nova-scotia-says-source-they-cant-be-positive-100979604/ ">Saltwire</a>.</p>

<p>The crew of the carrier ship reported that they did not notice any damage or collision, the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/expert-theory-what-caused-deaths-33289850 ">Mirror</a>&nbsp;reported. Some veteran sailors have suggested the homemade additions to Theros may have contributed to the tragedy, particularly the excessive weight of batteries and solar panels, which may have destabilised the boat.</p>

<p>Brett Clibbery and Sarah Packwood met by chance in 2015 at a bus stop in London. At the time, Ms Packwood was preparing to donate a kidney to her sister, while Mr Clibbery was visiting from Canada. This chance encounter led to them eventually falling in love and getting married on their yacht, Theros, in 2016.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>State Democratic party chairs on Sunday threw their weight behind Vice President Kamala Harris to be the party's new presidential nominee to run against Republican nominee and former president, Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The chairs held a conference call after President Joe Biden announced he was stepping aside as the party's candidate.</p>

<p>“Following President Biden's announcement, our members immediately assembled to unite behind the candidate who has a track record of winning tough elections, and who is a proven leader on the issues that matter to Americans: reproductive freedom, gun violence prevention, climate protection, justice reform, and rebuilding the economy," said Ken Martin, president of the Association of State Democratic Committees, in a statement.</p>

<p>"That person is our sitting Vice President Kamala Harris."</p>

<p>Reuters reported earlier that the group had backed the vice president, with one source saying there was "full support" for her being at the top of the ticket.</p>

<p>Many Democrats quickly backed Harris to run as the party's presidential nominee against Trump in the November election, but some powerful party members, including former House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, stayed quiet.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel will be the United States' strongest ally in the Middle East regardless of who is elected president in November, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday before flying to Washington, where he was due to address the U.S. Congress.</p>

<p>The visit, Netanyahu's first to his most important international ally since returning for a record sixth term as prime minister at the end of 2022, has been overshadowed by President Joe Biden's decision not to seek reelection.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said he would thank Biden for all he has done for Israel throughout his career and discuss with him issues such as securing the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza, defeating the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, and confronting Iran and its proxies in the region.</p>

<p>A meeting with Biden is tentatively planned for Tuesday if the 81-year-old president has recovered from Covid-19. Netanyahu is scheduled to address Congress on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"I will tell my friends on both sides of the aisle that regardless of who the American people choose as their next president, Israel remains America's indispensable and strong ally in the Middle East," he told reporters before taking off.</p>

<p>"In this time of war and uncertainty, it's important that Israel's enemies know that America and Israel stand together today, tomorrow and always," Netanyahu said, adding he wanted to "anchor the bipartisan support that is so important for Israel".</p>

<p>After months of frosty relations with Washington over how Israel has conducted its offensive launched in Gaza after the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, the visit offers Netanyahu a platform to try to reset relations with Washington.</p>

<p>His speech to Congress is expected to focus on coordinating the Israeli and U.S. response to the volatile situation in the Middle East, where there is a growing danger of the Gaza war spilling over into a wider regional conflict.</p>

<p>The speech is likely to be less confrontational than an address Netanyahu gave to Congress in 2015, when he criticised Barack Obama's drive as president for a nuclear deal with Iran.</p>

<h3><strong>PRESSURE</strong></h3>

<p>U.S. pressure on Israel for a resumption of talks on reaching a political agreement with the Palestinians, and a U.S. threat to withhold arms, have underlined perceptions in Israel that ties with Washington have weakened under Netanyahu. He has also faced protests in Israel demanding a ceasefire in Gaza.</p>

<p>"Part of the goal is to try to show that with all that's been said, with all the protests, Netanyahu is still the leader, still has support, he still has strong relations with America," said Yonatan Freeman, an international relations specialist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The invitation for Netanyahu to address a joint meeting of Congress - a rare honour generally reserved for the closest U.S. allies - was orchestrated by the House of Representatives' Republican leadership, which has accused Biden of not showing sufficient support for Israel.</p>

<p>There was no immediate sign that Netanyahu will see Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. The two forged a close relationship during Trump's presidency but Trump has since criticised Netanyahu and said the Gaza war must end quickly.</p>

<p>Although his welcome in Congress should be generally warm, protests roiling U.S. campuses suggest Netanyahu's reception outside official Washington may be hostile.</p>

<p>Activists opposing Israel's offensive in Gaza and Washington's support for Israel plan protests at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. Police expect a "large number of demonstrators" and are making additional security arrangements but said there were no known threats.</p>

<p>Israel has been isolated internationally over its campaign in Gaza, which Gaza health authorities say has killed almost 39,000 Palestinians, the expansion of settlement-building in the occupied West Bank and Jewish settlers' attacks on Palestinians.</p>

<p>An opinion issued on Friday by the International Court of Justice that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories is illegal was criticised by Washington. But it followed similar developments including a decision by the International Criminal Court's prosecutor to seek an arrest warrant against Netanyahu.</p>

<p>In Israel, Netanyahu faces growing calls for a deal that would halt the fighting in Gaza and allow the return of 120 hostages - alive or dead - still held in the enclave run by the Palestinian operative group Hamas.</p>

<p>Netanyahu has resisted pressure for an inquiry into the security failures before the Oct. 7 attack on Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and over 250 abducted into Gaza.</p>

<p>Opinion polls show most Israelis hold him responsible and would vote him out if elections were held.</p>

<p>Netanyahu will be accompanied by Noa Argamani, a hostage rescued by Israeli commandos last month. Her presence has been criticised by other hostage families who say Netanyahu has not been doing enough to secure the release of their loved ones.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The research by Wang Dan, a professor with the Naval Submarine Academy, was published last month in the Chinese-language journal, Command Control & Simulation.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's Starlink has been covering the empty space above the Earth with its satellites with a plan to provide internet to the remotest corner of the planet. But a study in China has claimed that People Liberation Army's (PLA's) submarines equipped with laser would be able to destroy these satellites if the country's security was at risk. According to <em>South China Morning Post (SCMP)</em>, the study has been conducted by the scientists of PLA. It further said that such submarines will be produced in large numbers and deployed in various oceans to counter military threats to China.</p>

<p>The undersea vehicles will have the capability to remain submerged in water with a retractable "optoelectronic mast" coming out and firing at the target, the study further said.</p>

<p>The research by Wang Dan, a professor with the Naval Submarine Academy, was published last month in the Chinese-language journal, Command Control &amp; Simulation, as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3270890/china-could-attack-starlink-satellites-submarine-laser-weapon-naval-study">the <em>SCMP</em> report</a>.</p>

<p>The entire project has been planned to hide the location of the attack vehicles (or submarines). Currently, missile launches are often accompanied by long trails of smoke, which can reveal the position of the attack vehicle. The team said this is too risky.</p>

<p>"Currently, the primary means of anti-satellite operations relies on ground-to-air missiles, but this approach has certain issues, mainly in terms of concealment," <em>SCMP</em> quoted Ms Ms Wang and her colleagues as saying in the study.</p>

<p>"Taking the satellites launched by the Starlink programme as an example, they are numerous, densely packed and small in size, making the satellite network extremely resilient. Even if a significant number of satellites are destroyed, there are redundancies to replace them. Therefore, using missiles to attack such satellites is highly inefficient," said the team.</p>

<p>"Submarine-based laser weapons can solve these issues," the study document further mentioned.</p>

<p>It then detailed a step-by-step guide to attacking Starlink-like satellites.</p>

<p>"First, one or several submarines equipped with laser weapons are deployed to the sea area where the operation is to be conducted. They enter the target sea area according to the command instructions and wait for the satellites to come within their attack range. The time to raise the laser weapon is determined based on the previously acquired satellite overhead time," said the study.</p>

<p>"When the satellite enters the attackable range, the laser weapon is raised. Due to the limitations of the submarine's detection equipment, other forces are required to provide satellite position guidance for the submarine to attack the satellite. After the attack is completed, the submarine can submerge and wait for the next mission or return to the home port," the researchers further said.</p>

<p>As of June 2024, there are 6,219 Starlink satellites in orbit, of which 6,146 are working, according to Astronomer Jonathan McDowell who tracks the constellation on his website.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After US President Joe Biden abandoned his reelection bid, the Kremlin said that for Russia the most important thing was achieving its goals in the Ukraine war not US politics where Moscow said much could change over coming months.</p>

<p>Biden abandoned his reelection bid on Sunday under growing pressure from his fellow Democrats and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the party's candidate to face Republican Donald Trump in the November election.</p>

<p>"The elections are still four months away, and that is a long period of time in which a lot can change," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the SHOT news outlet.</p>

<p>"We need to be patient and carefully monitor what happens. The priority for us is the special military operation," Peskov said, using the euphemism for the Ukraine war that President Vladimir Putin prefers.</p>

<p>Putin had said several times said that he felt Biden was preferable as the future US president to Trump for Russia, even after Biden cast the Kremlin chief as a "crazy SOB" though some of his remarks have been ambiguous.</p>

<p>Russian state television led news bulletins with the news of Biden leaving the election race and Biden's support for Harris, though it said it was unclear if Harris would earn the Democratic nomination.</p>

<p>Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said on the Telegram messaging app that he wished Biden good health and added that the goals of the special military operation would be achieved.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden's decision to step down from the 2024 presidential campaign has evoked reactions from the members of the Hollywood fraternity as well.</p>

<p>Taking to X, actor, singer and director Barbra Streisand penned a post in support of Biden.</p>

<p>She called Biden "a man who accomplished significant achievements".</p>

<p>"Joe Biden will go down in history as a man who accomplished significant achievements in his 4 year term. We should be grateful for his upholding of our democracy," Barbra posted on X.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Biden announced he is not seeking re-election in the "best interest" of the Democratic Party and the country. He has endorsed US Vice President Kamala Harris as the presidential nominee for the Democratic Party and called on Democrats to "come together and beat" Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Comedian and TV host, Ellen DeGeneres also reacted to the news and took to her official Instagram account to share, "I'm grateful to President Biden for everything he's done."</p>

<p>As per Variety, Oscar-winner and Billie Eilish's brother and song-writing collaborator Finneas posted a photo of his family standing with the President and wrote, "I see a person putting the people before themselves and their pride today, and for that, I have an enormous amount of respect."</p>

<p>Singer Lizzo posted a screenshot of the news with the comment, "We are truly living in unprecedented times."</p>

<p>Jimmy Kimmel on social media wrote, "Thank you President Joe Biden and First Lady Dr. Jill Biden for your leadership, integrity, empathy and service to our country."</p>

<p>The comedian also shared a picture of Biden with First Lady Jill Biden on his Instagram.</p>

<p>On Instagram, singer Ariana Grande re-posted Biden's own post endorsing Harris as his replacement in the coming presidential election.</p>

<p>Cardi B also threw her support immediately behind Harris.</p>

<p>"AHAHAHAHA LETS GOOOOO I TOLD YALLL KAMALA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE 2024 candidate," she wrote on X.</p>

<p>"The Bear" and "Borderlands" star Jamie Lee Curtis gives Harris a big thumbs up online writing, "She is trusted and tested and she is a fierce advocate for women's rights and people of color and her message is one of hope and unity for America at her time of great national divide."</p>

<p>Avenger, actor and activist Mark Ruffalo talks next steps and giving his followers the "marching orders." "No to Trump/Vance. No to the right-wing Christian religious takeover for our nation. Nothing wrong with Christianity, just shouldn't be running a nation birthed from freedom of religion."</p>

<p>"Veep" star and Emmy-winner Julia Louis-Dreyfus (who played the Vice President turned President Selina Meyer) showed her support for Biden, thanking him for his service.</p>

<p>Notably, Biden has been isolating at his home in Delaware after testing positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday while he was campaigning in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>His announcement to withdraw from the race to be the next president comes following mounting pressure from Democrats after his incoherent performance in the nationally televised debate with former US President Donald Trump on June 27.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 500 people, including some opposition leaders, have been arrested over days of clashes in the Bangladesh capital Dhaka sparked by protests against job quotas, police said Monday.<br />
"At least 532 people have been arrested over the violence," Dhaka Metropolitan Police spokesman Faruk Hossain told AFP.</p>

<p>"They include some BNP leaders," he added, referring to the opposition Bangladesh National Party.</p>

<p>The detainees included the BNP's third-most senior leader Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury and its spokesman Ruhul Kabir Rizvi Ahmed, he said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In war-torn Sudan, women are being forced to have sex with soldiers to get food to feed their families, a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jul/22/women-forced-to-have-sex-with-soldiers-for-food-in-sudanese-city">The Guardian</a> said. Over two dozen women who fled the Sudanese city of Omdurman said that having sex with soldiers was the only way they could access food or goods that they could sell to raise money to feed their families.</p>

<p>One woman who spoke to the Guardian said the assaults took place in factories across the the city where the food is stockpiled. “Both of my parents are too old and sick and I never let my daughter go out to look for food. I went to the soldiers and that was the only way to get food – they were everywhere in the factories area," said a woman, who was forced to have sex with soldiers at a meat-processing factory in May last year.</p>

<p>The assaults reportedly began soon after a civil war broke out in the country which has seen the country's army face off against paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. Reports of rape by armed men emerged within days of the conflict starting on 15 April last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The war in Sudan has killed tens of thousands of people, with some estimates placing the death count as high as 150,000. The war has created the world's worst displacement crisis -- with more than 11 million uprooted and brought the country to the brink of famine.</p>

<p>Several women have come forward sharing harrowing tales of RSF fighters sexually abusing them in a systematic manner in areas under their control. The soldiers have also demanded sex in exchange for access to abandoned houses where it is still possible to loot items to sell in local markets, the women told the Guardian.</p>

<p>One woman said that she was allowed to take food, kitchen equipment and perfumes from empty houses after she had sex with soldiers. “What I went through is indescribable, I would not wish it on an enemy … I only did it because I wanted to feed my children," she said.</p>

<p>Residents of the city claimed they see soldiers bringing women to abandoned houses where they were made to queue up as soldier picked the ones "they liked the look of". "A lot of women come and queue outside our neighbourhood. I sometimes hear screaming but what can you do? Nothing," one resident said.</p>

<p>Another woman told the Guardian that once she refused to have sex with the solider they tortured her and burned her legs. The 21-year-old said she had had sex with soldiers in exchange for being allowed to loot houses for food and goods, but went she refused to do so again the soldiers held her down and burned her legs.</p>

<p>A soldier, who denied ever assaulting a woman himself, said he had witnessed his colleagues. “It's awful. The amount of the sins in this city can never been be forgiven," he said.<br />

<p>Announcing his decision, Biden said, "It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President.

<p>The presidential elections in the US are slated for November 5 this year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vice President Kamala Harris wasted no time launching her 2024 presidential campaign, seeking the support of fellow Democrats with the backing of President Joe Biden after he pulled out of the race amid concerns about his age and health.</p>

<p>Her campaign officials and allies made hundreds of calls on behalf of Harris on Sunday, urging delegates to the Democratic Party convention next month to join in nominating her for president in the Nov. 5 election against Republican Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Multiple sources said the calls, aimed at blocking would-be Democratic challengers, began almost immediately after the 81-year-old Biden abandoned the race.</p>

<p>At the same time, Democratic state party chairs backed Harris in a phone call, several participants said.</p>

<p>Harris spoke with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a potential vice presidential running mate, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, and Congressional Black Caucus chair Representative Steven Horsford, said a source familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Harris, a 59-year-old woman who is Black and Asian-American, would fashion an entirely new dynamic with Trump, 78, offering a vivid generational and cultural split-screen.</p>

<p>The United States has yet to elect a woman president in its 248-year history.</p>

<p>"Harris will be easier to beat than Joe Biden would have been," Trump asserted on CNN shortly after Biden's announcement.</p>

<p>Biden, the oldest person ever to have occupied the Oval Office, said he would remain in the presidency until his term ends on Jan. 20, 2025, while endorsing Harris to run for president in his place.</p>

<p>The White House said Harris would deliver remarks on the South Lawn at 11:30 a.m. ET (1530 GMT) on Monday at an event celebrating the NCAA 2023-24 college championship teams.</p>

<p>Facing mounting questions about his mental acuity, Biden is the first sitting president to give up his party's nomination for reelection since President Lyndon B. Johnson during the Vietnam War in March 1968.</p>

<p>Biden's withdrawal leaves his replacement with less than four months to wage a campaign. Prominent Democrats, including potential Harris challengers such as California Governor Gavin Newsom, immediately backed the vice president.</p>

<p>"My intention is to earn and win this nomination," Harris said in a statement. "I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party — and unite our nation — to defeat Donald Trump."</p>

<p>Despite the early show of support for Harris, talk of an open convention when Democrats gather in Chicago Aug. 19-22 was not totally silenced.</p>

<p>Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former President Barack Obama did not announce endorsements, although both praised Biden.</p>

<p>Two other potential challengers - Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear - made no mention of the vice president in their statements.</p>

<p>With Democrats wading into uncharted territory, Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said the party would soon announce the next steps in its nomination process.</p>

<p>What is certain is that Biden's withdrawal has again reshaped a White House contest shaken repeatedly during the last month.</p>

<p>On June 27, Biden's poor performance in a debate with Trump led many Democrats to urge him to drop out. Then on July 13, a gunman attempted to assassinate former President Trump.</p>

<p>And last week Trump named hardline Republican U.S. Senator J.D. Vance, 39, to serve as his vice presidential running mate.</p>

<h3><strong>ABORTION RIGHTS LEADER</strong></h3>

<p>A former attorney general of California and former U.S. senator, Harris ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 2020.</p>

<p>Biden won the nomination, picked Harris to be his vice president, and went on to beat Trump.</p>

<p>Harris has been outspoken on abortion rights, an issue that resonates with younger voters and progressives.</p>

<p>She is expected to stick largely to Biden's foreign policy playbook on such issues as China, Iran and Ukraine, but could strike a tougher tone with Israel over the Gaza war if she tops the Democratic ticket and wins the November election.</p>

<p>Proponents argue she would energize those voters, consolidate Black support and bring sharp debating skills to prosecute the political case against the former president.</p>

<p>But some Democrats were concerned about a Harris candidacy, in part because of the weight of a long history of racial and gender discrimination in the United States.</p>

<p>Polling shows that Harris performs no better statistically than Biden had done against Trump.</p>

<p>In a head-to-head match-up, Harris and Trump were tied with 44% support each in a July 15-16 Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted immediately after the July 13 assassination attempt on Trump.</p>

<p>Trump led Biden 43% to 41% in that same poll, though the 2 percentage point difference was not meaningful considering the poll's 3-point margin of error.</p>

<p>Biden's campaign had $95 million on hand at the end of June, according to a filing with the Federal Election Commission. Campaign finance law experts disagree on how easily that money could be shifted to a Harris-led campaign.</p>

<p>Small-dollar donors raised more than $46.7 million on ActBlue in the first five hours of Harris' presidential campaign, the fundraising platform said on X on Sunday.</p>

<h3><strong>LAST-MINUTE SHIFT</strong></h3>

<p>Biden, who said he would address the nation this week, has not been seen in public since testing positive for COVID-19 last week. He was isolating at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.</p>

<p>"While it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term," Biden wrote on X.</p>

<p>Congressional Republicans argued on Sunday that Biden should resign as president immediately, which would turn the White House over to Harris and put House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, next in line in succession.</p>

<p>"If he's incapable of running for president, how is he capable of governing right now? I mean, there is five months left in this administration. It's a real concern, and it's a danger to the country," Johnson told CNN on Sunday before Biden's announcement.</p>

<p>During the 2020 campaign, Biden described himself as a bridge to the next generation. Some interpreted that to mean he would serve one term, a transitional figure who beat Trump and brought his party back to power.</p>

<p>But Biden decided to seek reelection, believing he could beat Trump again. His campaign was already struggling and ran into deep trouble after his debate performance raised serious concerns about his ability to win the election or stay on as president for another four years.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Analysts at Wedbush Securities, one of Wall Street's biggest believers in AI's potential, expect "growth and earnings to accelerate with the AI revolution and the wave of transformation" it is causing.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the next two weeks, the quarterly results of Big Tech giants will offer a glimpse on the bankability of artificial intelligence and whether the major investments AI requires are sustainable for the long haul.</p>

<p>Analysts at Wedbush Securities, one of Wall Street's biggest believers in AI's potential, expect "growth and earnings to accelerate with the AI revolution and the wave of transformation" it is causing.</p>

<p>The market generally agrees with this rosy AI narrative. Analysts forecast double-digit growth for heavyweights Microsoft and Google, in contrast to Apple, a latecomer to the AI party, with only three percent growth expected.</p>

<p>The iPhone maker, which releases its results on August 1, unveiled its new Apple Intelligence system only last month and plans to roll it out gradually over the next months, and only on the latest models.</p>

<p>CFRA analyst Angelo Zino believes that the impact of these new features will not be felt until the iPhone 16 launches in September, the first to feature the new AI powers built-in across all options.</p>

<p>But he expects Apple's upcoming earnings to show improvement in China sales, a black spot since last year.</p>

<p>"Apple's forecasts for the current quarter will be important" in assessing the company's momentum, said Zino.</p>

<p>But "if there's one that we were maybe a little bit more concerned about, versus the others, it would be Meta," he said.</p>

<p>He pointed out that Mark Zuckerberg's company raised its investment projections last April as it devoted a few billion dollars more on the chips, servers and data centers needed to develop generative AI.</p>

<p>CFRA expects Meta's growth to decelerate through the end of the year. Combined with the expected increase in spending on AI, that should put earnings under pressure.</p>

<p>As for the earnings of cloud giants Microsoft (July 30) and Amazon (August 1), "we expect them to continue to report very good results, in line with or better than market expectations," said Zino.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Crucial' bet&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Microsoft is among the best positioned to monetize generative AI, having moved the fastest to implement it across all its products, and pouring $13 billion into OpenAI, the startup stalwart behind ChatGPT.</p>

<p>Winning the big bet on AI is "crucial" for the group, said Jeremy Goldman of Emarketer, "but the market is willing to give them a level of patience."</p>

<p>The AI frenzy has helped Microsoft's cloud computing business grow in the double digits, something that analysts said could be hard to sustain.</p>

<p>"This type of growth cannot hold forever, but the synergies between cloud and AI make it more likely that Microsoft holds onto reliable cloud growth for some time to come," Goldman said.</p>

<p>As for Amazon, "investors will want to see that the reacceleration of growth over the first quarter wasn't a one-off" at AWS, the company's world-leading cloud business, said Matt Britzman of Hargreaves Lansdown.</p>

<p>Since AWS leads "in everything data-related, it should be well placed to capture a huge chunk of the demand coming from the AI wave," he added.</p>

<p>The picture "might be a little less clear" for Google parent Alphabet, which will be the first to publish results on Tuesday, "because of their search business" online, warned Zino.</p>

<p>"Skepticism around AI Overviews," introduced by Google in mid-May, "is certainly justified," said Emarketer analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf.</p>

<p>This new feature, which offers a written text at the top of results in a Google search, ahead of the traditional links to sites, got off to a rocky start.</p>

<p>Internet users were quick to report strange, or potentially dangerous, answers proposed by the feature that had been touted by Google executives as the future direction of search.</p>

<p>According to data from BrightEdge, relayed by Search Engine Land, the number of searches presenting a result generated by AI Overviews has plummeted in recent weeks as Google shies away from the feature.</p>

<p>Still, many are concerned about the evolution of advertising across the internet if Google pushes on with the Overviews model, which reduces the necessity of clicking into links. Content creators, primarily the media, fear a collapse in revenues.</p>

<p>But for Emarketer's Mitchell-Wolf, "as long as Google maintains its status as the default search engine across most smartphones and major browsers, it will continue to be the top destination for search, and the top destination for search ad spending."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump will try to show swing voters that his likely new rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, has her fingerprints all over two issues he is counting on for victory in November: immigration and the cost of living.</p>

<p>Sources within the Trump campaign said it will cast Harris, the likely Democratic candidate after President Joe Biden quit the race on Sunday, as the "co-pilot" of administration polices it says are behind both sources of voter discontent.</p>

<p>Biden's sudden exit and endorsement of Harris has upended the race, just eight days after Trump survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally.</p>

<p>Sources told Reuters that Trump's campaign had for weeks been preparing for Harris should Biden drop out and she win her party's nomination.</p>

<p>"Harris will be easier to beat than Joe Biden would have been," Trump told CNN shortly after Biden's announcement on Sunday.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign has signaled it will tie her as tightly as possible to Biden's immigration policy, which Republicans say is to blame for a sharp increase in the numbers of people crossing the southern border with Mexico illegally.</p>

<p>The second line of attack will revolve around the economy. Public opinion polls consistently show Americans are unhappy with high food and fuel costs as well as interest rates that have made buying a home less affordable.</p>

<p>"She's the co-pilot of the Biden vision," said one Trump adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity during last week's Republican National Convention, where a unified party anointed Trump as its nominee in the White House race.</p>

<p>"If they want to switch to Biden 2.0 and have 'Cackling' Kamala at the top of the ticket, we're good either way," the adviser said, repeating an insult the campaign has been trying out for weeks focused on how the vice president laughs.</p>

<p>Make America Great Again Inc, a super PAC backing Trump, said on Sunday it was pulling anti-Biden television ads that had been set to run in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania and replacing them with an ad attacking Harris.</p>

<p>The 30-second ad accuses Harris of hiding Biden's infirmity from the public, and it seeks to pin the administration's record solely on her. "Kamala knew Joe couldn't do the job, so she did it. Look what she got done: a border invasion, runaway inflation, the American Dream dead," the narrator says.</p>

<p>Trump, known for using insulting and sometimes offensive language to attack his opponents, gave supporters at a rally in Michigan on Saturday a taste of the insults he is likely to fling at Harris in the coming days.</p>

<p>"I call her laughing Kamala. You ever watch a laugh? She's crazy. You can tell a lot by a laugh. She's crazy. She's nuts," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>ALTERED RACE</strong></h3>

<p>The Democratic Party has yet to determine how to move forward, and there is as yet no guarantee that Harris will emerge as the party's nominee despite Biden's endorsement.</p>

<p>Harris as the Democratic nominee would alter the race in perhaps unforeseen ways, political strategists said.</p>

<p>A 59-year-old woman who is Black and Asian-American would fashion an entirely new dynamic with Trump, 78, offering a vivid generational and cultural split-screen. The United States has yet to elect a woman president in its 248-year history.</p>

<p>Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist and longtime congressional aide, said Harris would be able to mount "a more energetic campaign with excitement from younger voters and people of color" after Biden struggled to energize these important Democratic Party voting blocs.</p>

<p>A former prosecutor and California attorney general as well as a former U.S. senator, Harris would be able to use "her years of litigation experience to effectively prosecute Trump in the court of public opinion," Mollineau said.</p>

<p>Chip Felkel, a Republican strategist, cautioned that it would be a mistake for the Trump campaign to assume Harris could serve as a simple stand-in for Biden, because of her potential appeal to different parts of the electorate.</p>

<p>Recent polls have shown Harris to be competitive with Trump. In a hypothetical head-to-head matchup, Harris and Trump were tied with 44% support each in a July 15-16 Reuters/Ipsos poll.</p>

<p>Before Sunday, the Trump campaign had already begun discussions about how they would redeploy campaign resources should Biden drop out of the race, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.</p>

<p>Jeanette Hoffman, a Republican political consultant, said despite the contrasts Harris would bring to the ticket, her close ties to Biden would be a drag on her candidacy.</p>

<p>Harris "doesn't represent the change America is looking for," Hoffman said.</p>

<p>MAGA Inc CEO Taylor Budowich said his group has commissioned opposition research on several possible Democratic candidates. "MAGA Inc is prepared for all outcomes of a Democrat Party who has only brought chaos and failure," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Joe Biden announced on Sunday that he decided to give up running for re-election as president of the US and endorsed his deputy Kamala Harris to be the presidential nominee of the Democratic Party.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian-American businessman-turned-politician Vivek Ramaswamy had predicted some eight months ago that incumbent President Joe Biden would not be the presidential nominee of the Democratic Party.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joe-biden-drops-out-of-us-presidential-election-race-says-it-is-in-best-interest-of-country-for-me-to-stand-down-6156671#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll">Joe Biden</a> announced on Sunday that he decided to give up running for <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/live-updates-joe-biden-withdraws-from-us-presidential-race-6156785">re-election as president of the United States</a> and endorsed his deputy <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/as-kamala-harris-joins-presidential-race-who-will-be-her-running-mate-6158830#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll">Kamala Harris</a> to be the presidential nominee of the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>“Best way to predict the future: just follow the incentives. It's shocking how precisely right you can be, right down to the exact timing,” Ramaswamy, a 38-year-old Republican, said in a social media post along with the video interview with Fox News last November, soon after Biden announced his decision.</p>

<p>In his interview with Fox News, Ramaswamy had said: “I think that the reality is the managerial class around Biden has lost their use for him. This has been obvious to me since last year to play out the incentives. He is not the strongest candidate they can put up. And these people, they have stopped at nothing to keep Donald J Trump out of office,” he said.</p>

<p>The Indian-American, who then was the Republican presidential candidate in the primaries along with former president Donald Trump, said that two candidates – Kamala Harris and Michelle Obama – were possibly to be picked by the Democrats.</p>

<p>“Let's give credit where credit is due. For almost a year one man has been saying “Biden won't be the Democratic nominee” and predicting a last-minute blindside. People called him crazy,” Tristane Tate, a social media influencer, said, applauding Ramaswamy for his prediction coming true. Ramaswamy had made a similar prediction during one of the Republican presidential debates.</p>

<p>He also posted a compilation of videos of his predictions and said, "The anatomy of how a “conspiracy theory” became reality, in just 18 months."&nbsp;</p>

<p>“‘I remember corporate media reporters sneering and laughing when Vivek Ramaswamy made this point in the debate. They're not laughing now!” Raheem Kassam, a journalist, said on X.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden has ended his reelection bid and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the new Democratic nominee. The sudden change is similar to a development predicted years ago in the popular animated series <em>The Simpsons.</em></p>

<p>In the 17th episode of the 11th season, which aired in 2000, Lisa Simpson became the first female president of the US. She is seen in an outfit similar to what Kamala Harris wore at Joe Biden's inauguration, hinting at her rise to the presidency in future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The episode also points to a predecessor who left behind a budget crisis for President Lisa to manage, strongly suggesting a real estate mogul (Donald Trump) had previously held the office.</p>

<p>The Simpsons has a history of making eerily accurate and satirical references to global events. Some of their previous predictions include the rise of smartwatches, Donald Trump's presidency, Disney's acquisition of 20th Century Fox and Finnish economist Bengt R Holmstrom winning the Nobel Prize for his work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most recently, a cartoon showing the former president lying in a coffin went viral. This comes after the recent <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/fact-check-did-the-simpsons-predict-trump-assassination-attempt-6115400 ">attempted assassination</a> of Trump.</p>

<p>Joe Biden <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joe-biden-drops-out-of-us-presidential-election-race-says-it-is-in-best-interest-of-country-for-me-to-stand-down-6156671">dropped out of the US presidential race</a> on Sunday, saying it was in the "best interest of my party and the country" to step aside. His withdrawal was widely anticipated following his abysmal performance in the June debate against Trump. The announcement came unexpectedly while he was recovering from COVID-19 at his Delaware beach house.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kamala Harris received significant backing from key Democratic figures, including Hillary Clinton and California Governor Gavin Newsom, who is also a potential rival for the nomination.</p>

<p>The Democratic fundraising group ActBlue reported Harris received $27.5 million in small-donour contributions within just five hours.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

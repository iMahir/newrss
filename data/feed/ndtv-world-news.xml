       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the night before Election Day, at campaign events across the country, celebrities turned out in force for Kamala Harris' presidential bid.<br />
The battleground state of Pennsylvania was particularly starry: In Pittsburgh, the vice president's rally featured Cedric the Entertainer, Katy Perry and Andra Day. In Philadelphia, the finale of Harris' daylong dash across Pennsylvania, performers and presenters included DJ Cassidy, Fat Joe and Ricky Martin.</p>

<p>Republican Donald Trump was decidedly unimpressed with Harris' celebrity lineup.</p>

<p>At his own rally in Pittsburgh, which overlapped with Harris' event in the city, the former president criticized Harris for one celebrity endorsement in particular: Beyoncé. He spoke dismissively about Beyoncé's appearance at a Harris rally with Harris in Houston last month, drawing boos for the megastar from his supporters.</p>

<p>"Beyoncé would come in. Everyone's expecting a couple of songs. There were no songs. There was no happiness," Trump said.</p>

<p>Beyoncé did not perform at the event but was joined onstage by her Destiny's Child bandmate Kelly Rowland, and gave a joyful, impassioned speech met with cheers.</p>

<p>Previously, Beyoncé allowed the Harris campaign to take on her 2016 track "Freedom," a cut from her landmark 2016 album "Lemonade," as its anthem.</p>

<p>Trump added that Harris should have learned a lesson from Hillary Clinton and had Beyoncé speak after her, saying, "That way the people stay."</p>

<p>In 2016, Beyoncé performed at a campaign event for Democratic nominee Clinton in Cleveland in the days leading up to the election.</p>

<p>"They booed like hell, but the press didn't play that," Trump continued in his description of Beyoncé's appearance at the Harris event.</p>

<p>He insisted his campaign doesn't need celebrities to pack in a crowd, adding: "We don't need a star because we have policy. We have great policy."</p>

<p>At another point in the same rally, though, he enthused: "So many celebrities here, it's incredible: Mike Pompeo, please stand up," introducing his former secretary of state.</p>

<p>Trump also was joined by Megyn Kelly and baseball star Roberto Clemente's son.</p>

<p>Harris lined up performers to speak and play at campaign rallies in all seven battleground states on Monday, and melded them all into one Democratic get-out-the-vote livestream.</p>

<p>In Las Vegas, performers included Christina Aguilera and electro-dance duo Sofi Tukker. In Raleigh, North Carolina, Sugarland, the country music duo of Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush, took the stage.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Tim Cook receives over 800 emails while Mark Cuban gets more than a thousand emails a lot of which are repetitive'.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple CEO Tim Cook starts his day between 4 and 5 a.m. by checking his iPhone for emails and overnight sales reports. Given that he receives over 800 emails daily, including feedback from Apple customers, keeping up with them all is a challenge.</p>

<p>To manage this, Mr Cook, 64, uses Apple's latest AI tool, Apple Intelligence, which provides brief summaries of his emails. This feature automatically generates short overviews under each email in the Mail app, streamlining his inbox. "If I can save time here and there, it adds up over a day, a week, or a month," Mr Cook told the <em>Wall Street Journal Magazine</em>, adding, "It's changed my life. It really has."</p>

<p>Mr Cook isn't the only billionaire using AI to tackle an overflowing inbox. Entrepreneur and Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban also relies on AI for email management. Mr Cuban, who receives thousands of emails daily-many of them repetitive-uses Google's generative AI assistant and suggested replies in Gmail, calling it "the ultimate time-saving hack."</p>

<p>"It's reduced the need for me to write out routine replies," Mr Cuban told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/04/mark-cuban-and-tim-cook-swear-by-this-time-saving-email-hack.html" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>CNBC Make It</em></a>. "I can spend 30 seconds evaluating its response and hit 'send' versus typing it all out myself." With AI handling his routine messages, Mr Cuban said he can dedicate more time to strategic tasks, enhancing his productivity and effectiveness as a leader.</p>

<p>“I'll use different generative AI tools to edit my kids' homework assignments for spelling and grammar mistakes, which has helped me a lot as a parent,” he added. “And to make sure they're not using AI to write their papers.”</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The 2024 survey, which included over 76,000 responses, shows that only 34.6% of children aged 8 to 18 enjoy reading in their free time.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In worrying news for educators, a recent survey indicates that children's reading habits are approaching a "crisis" point, with the percentage of pupils who like reading books currently at its lowest level in nearly two decades.</p>

<p>According to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://literacytrust.org.uk/research-services/research-reports/children-and-young-peoples-reading-in-2024/">report by the National Literacy Trust (NLT)</a> organisation, the percentage of young people who say they enjoy reading has decreased dramatically over the past year, particularly among boys.</p>

<p>This report is based on 76,131 responses to NLT's Annual Literacy Survey from children and young people aged 5 to 18 in early 2024. It includes findings on reading enjoyment, frequency, and motivation and explores responses by age, gender, socio-economic background, and geographical region.</p>

<p>The NLT's Annual Literacy Survey indicates a steady decline in the number of children and young people who report enjoying reading and engaging in daily reading during their free time.</p>

<p>According to the survey, launched in 2005 to track children's interest in reading, this year has recorded the lowest percentage of children and young people who say they enjoy reading since the survey's inception.</p>

<p><strong>Key findings from the survey:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Just 1 in 3 (34.6%) children and young people aged 8 to 18 said that they enjoyed reading in their free time in 2024. Reading enjoyment levels have decreased by 8.8 percentage points over the past year alone.</li>
	<li>Only 1 in 5 (20.5%) 8- to 18-year-olds said that they read something daily in their free time in 2024, again, the lowest levels we've recorded since 2005, with daily reading levels decreasing by 7.5pp in the last year alone.</li>
</ul>

<p>"With children and young people's enjoyment of reading at an all-time low and high numbers leaving primary and secondary school without the reading skills they need to thrive, the futures of a generation are being put at risk," NLT chief executive Jonathan Douglas told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/nov/05/report-fall-in-children-reading-for-pleasure-national-literacy-trust"><em>The Guardian.</em></a></p>

<p>"For a report focused largely on reading enjoyment, much of this is not an enjoyable read," concluded the report. "The declining levels of reading enjoyment and reading frequency are, frankly, shocking and dispiriting."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[There are 4 important issues when it comes to the deciding factor. The economy, immigration and border control, abortion issues and safeguarding democracy.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. presidential election is going down to the wire, with polls showing a deadlocked race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina will play a crucial role in determining the outcome.<br />
Trump's favorability rating is stuck at 43 per cent, and he has never topped 50 per cent since leaving office. This means he has hit a ceiling in his support and may struggle to win the national popular vote.</p>

<p>There are 4 important issues when it comes to the deciding factor. The economy, immigration and border control, abortion issues and safeguarding democracy.</p>

<p>The country is in a bad mood, with 60-70 per cent of Americans believing the country is on the wrong track which means the election will change. Historically, when Americans feel the country is on the wrong track, the incumbent president tends to lose favor, giving their challenger a significant advantage in the election and Harris is facing this blow.</p>

<p>Trump is seen as the better candidate to manage the economy, leading by a 15-point margin in swing states, since during the Biden administration, the cost has risen between 10-40 per cent.</p>

<p>Trump has made immigration a central issue, and voters view him as the best candidate to manage the border. The first three years of Biden's term saw immigration troubles, however the rates have fallen now.</p>

<p>Harris is seen as the champion of reproductive rights, and polling shows her leading Trump among women voters in swing states by 15 points or more. Abortion rights are decided at the state level and it is on the ballot in two key swing states - Nevada and Arizona which is a positive aspect for Harris.</p>

<p>Half the country sees Trump as a threat to American democracy, an authoritarian, while Harris has pledged to unite the country and even get the Republicans and Democrats working.</p>

<p>If Harris wins, it will be because she has successfully sealed the deal with voters and made the election a referendum on Trump. Her ground game, which includes a USD 1 billion machine to reach voters in swing states, will be crucial.</p>

<p>If Trump wins, it will mean voters trusted him to manage inflation, immigration, and crime. Unease about Harris, a Black and South Asian woman, as president may also play a role.</p>

<p>The outcome is far from certain, and the next 24 hours will be intense. Will Harris' ground game deliver, or will Trump's economic message resonate with voters? The country holds its breath as it waits for the results.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Americans head to the polls on Tuesday in a mood of discontent and division, with opinion polls showing nearly two-thirds of voters believe the country has been heading in the wrong direction under President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>While the United States economy is the envy of the industrialized world, emerging from COVID shutdowns with strong job growth and wage increases, many Americans complain those gains were gobbled up by high grocery and housing prices.</p>

<p>Biden's promise of a return to a more humane immigration regime than under Republican former President Donald Trump soon collided with the reality of a spike in illegal border crossings.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court upended the legal landscape around abortion rights by overturning Roe v. Wade, inflaming one of the most divisive issues in American politics.</p>

<p>And despite Biden's pledge that America would serve as a stabilizing force in the world, overseas conflicts have overshadowed his presidency.</p>

<p>Whoever triumphs in the election - Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris - will inherit the legacy of a Biden administration that made good on some promises, saw others swept off-course by events, and others still only partially fulfilled. Here's how Biden fared on the defining issues of his presidency.</p>

<p><strong>IMMIGRATION</strong></p>

<p>Biden, a Democrat, started his presidency by reversing many of Trump's restrictive immigration policies. He haltedconstruction of Trump's border wall; rescinded bans targeting people from certain majority-Muslim countries and other nations; and wound down the "remain in Mexico" program, which forced non-Mexican asylum seekers to wait in Mexico as they pursued their US cases.</p>

<p>But months into his presidency, illegal crossings spiked, particularly among unaccompanied children from Central America, overwhelming US border processing centers and fueling Republican criticism.</p>

<p>Illegal crossings reached record levels in 2022 and 2023 as more migrants arrived from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and countries outside the hemisphere.</p>

<p>In response, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, in 2022 beganbusing arriving migrants north to Democratic cities including New York City and Chicago, which struggled to house them.</p>

<p>In January, Biden backed a bipartisan bill that aimed to tighten border security. After the bill was defeated in the US Senate amid Trump's opposition, Biden in June bannedasylum for most migrants crossing the border illegally.</p>

<p>The number of migrants caught crossing illegally dropped dramatically, undercutting Trump's false claims that Harris and Democrats support an open border.</p>

<p>Despite the political pressures surrounding migration, Biden created new legal pathways for hundreds of thousands of migrants and oversaw the restoration of the US refugee program, which admitted more than 100,000 refugees in fiscal year 2024, the most in 30 years.</p>

<p><strong>ABORTION</strong></p>

<p>The biggest upheaval on abortion access in decades occurred during Biden's presidency - but because of a decision by the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>In June 2022, the conservative majority formed by Trump's judicial appointments to the court eliminated the nearly 50-year-old federal right to abortion under Roe v. Wade.</p>

<p>The decision ushered in a period in which individual states set their own laws on abortion access. More than a dozen states banned abortion in all or most cases.</p>

<p>Biden condemned the Supreme Court ruling, and his administration, through the Department of Health and Human Services and the Justice Department, laid out guidelines to ensure access to emergency abortion care under federal law and defended the use of the abortion pill before the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>The administration also pushed for expanded access to reproductive health services like contraception through the Affordable Care Act.</p>

<p>The administration won its biggest victory in June when the Supreme Court rejected a case brought by anti-abortion advocates seeking to roll back the Food and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone, one of two medications used in the abortion pill regimen.</p>

<p>But the court dismissed on procedural grounds the administration's case arguing that Idaho's severe abortion ban conflicted with a federal law requiring medical providers to offer stabilizing emergency care, including abortions. In October, the court declined to hear a similar administration case about Texas' strict abortion ban.</p>

<p>While devoutly Catholic Biden was openly uncomfortable about abortion from early in his political career, mitigating the impacts of the dissolution of Roe v. Wade has become a pillar of his presidency.</p>

<p>Democrats more broadly made abortion rights central to their platform in the 2022 midterm elections. In March, Harris became the first sitting vice president or president to visit an abortion clinic.</p>

<p><strong>ECONOMY</strong></p>

<p>Joe Biden may go down in history as overseeing the best economy that everyone hated.</p>

<p>Since 2021, as the country emerged from a global pandemic that briefly created historic job losses and brought the economy to a near-standstill, employers have added nearly 16.5 million new jobs. The unemployment rate has averaged just 4.2%, including the longest run at 4% or below since the 1960s.</p>

<p>Gross domestic product growth has averaged 3.2% per quarter, well above what most economists view as the US economy's long-term potential. Incomes and wages have grown above trend. Collective US household net worth has climbed to a record $163.8 trillion, thanks to a booming stock market and rising home values.</p>

<p>But survey after survey over most of Biden's term has shown little of that registering with average Americans. Why? Because all of that occurred against the backdrop of the worst inflation breakout in a generation.</p>

<p>As the economy reopened, a mix of tangled supply chains, worker shortages and hot consumer demand, supported by roughly $5 trillion of government stimulus from Biden's and Trump's administrations, sent prices climbing - fast.</p>

<p>By the summer of 2022, the Consumer Price Index was rising by 9.1% year-over-year and the widely followed gauge of household satisfaction with the economy - the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index - tumbled to a record low.</p>

<p>While inflation has receded and sentiment has begun to recover, surveys show Americans still feel the sting of lingering high prices, and they blame Biden and Democrats for it.</p>

<p><strong>RACIAL JUSTICE</strong></p>

<p>On his first day in the White House, Biden signed an executive order aimed at addressing racism, police brutality, poverty and inequities impacting Black people and other communities of color.</p>

<p>But reform has been slow. The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, introduced in 2021 to stop aggressive law enforcement tactics and racial bias, stalled in Congress.</p>

<p>In 2022, Biden issued an executive order directing the Department of Justice to create a national database of misconduct by federal law enforcement officers and requiring federal law enforcement agencies to investigate the use of deadly force or deaths in custody. It also restricted federal agencies from using chokeholds and "no knock" entries.</p>

<p>While Biden's Justice Department revived investigations into civil rights abuses, which had largely stopped under Trump, it has failed to secure a single binding settlement in the 12 investigations opened into possible police civil rights abuses since Biden took office.</p>

<p>On the economic front, Black unemployment fell to a historic low last year. This year alone, the administration directed $1.5 billion in loans to Black-owned businesses. It has also invested more than $16 billion in historically Black colleges and universities and distributed $2.2 billion to more than 43,000 Black and other farmers who experienced discrimination. Last year, the Biden administration allocated $470 million to improve maternal health.</p>

<p><strong>FOREIGN POLICY</strong></p>

<p>From wars in Ukraine and Gaza to civil bloodshed in Sudan, overseas conflicts have dominated Biden's foreign policy agenda.</p>

<p>Biden came to office promising to restore US global leadership in the world and determined to push back on an increasingly aggressive China.</p>

<p>In some ways, his administration has done just that. After the chaotic 2021 withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, Biden rallied US allies the following year to oppose Russia's invasion of Ukraine and has also revitalized alliances across Asia to pressure China's leadership.</p>

<p>But the US has struggled to bring the grinding conflicts to an end, and hasn't been able to prevent the deepening ties between Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.</p>

<p>Now in its third year, the war of attrition in Ukraine continues despite billions of dollars in US military aid and massive losses on both sides. The conflict is increasingly international, with Western accusations that Moscow is receiving weapons and soldiers from North Korea, missiles and drones from Iran and technical and other support from China.</p>

<p>The war between Israel and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip, which started when Hamas fighters staged a deadly attack into Israel, has metastasized into conflict between Israel and Lebanese militants Hezbollah and sparked reprisal attacks between Israel and Iran.</p>

<p>Biden's staunch support for Israel has divided his party and undercut the United States' ability to criticize others on human rights and violations of international law.</p>

<p>A conflict in Sudan has triggered ethnic violence and famine conditions in Sudan's Darfur region, where violence about 20 years ago led to the International Criminal Court charging former Sudanese leaders with genocide and crimes against humanity. The United States has been trying to help broker an end to the 18-month-long conflict.</p>

<p><strong>ENERGY TRANSITION</strong></p>

<p>Biden entered the White House with huge ambitions to fight climate change by transitioning the US economy away from fossil fuels to cleaner, renewable sources - all while creating new green, unionized jobs and re-shoring US manufacturing. Among his goals: put an end to federal oil and gas leasing, expand deployments of solar and wind energy to decarbonize the power grid, electrify the nation's vehicle fleet, and ultimately put the economy on a path to become carbon-neutral by 2050.</p>

<p>On the win side of the ledger, Biden signed into law three pieces of legislation that have driven a massive investment in the clean energy economy: the Inflation Reduction Act, the bipartisan infrastructure law and the CHIPS Act, which aims to establish a domestic semiconductor supply chain that could insulate the domestic energy sector from supply shocks.</p>

<p>Under the IRA, companies have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in new solar, wind, electric vehicles and infrastructure, battery storage and other climate-friendly projects that have sped up the energy transition and created jobs - largely in Republican states whose lawmakers did not support the legislation.</p>

<p>The administration has awarded $90 billion in grants to climate, clean energy, and other projects under the IRA, or about 70% of the law's climate-focused grant money, according to administration officials.</p>

<p>The Biden administration also expanded federal leasing for renewable energy projects, and passed new regulations to curb greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, power plants and oil and gas operations.</p>

<p>On the loss side, his administration's attempts to end federal oil and gas leasing failed in the courts, and his policies failed to prevent a massive surge in US oil and gas output - mostly on privately owned lands in Texas and New Mexico - that has made the US the world's top petroleum producer.</p>

<p>And in perhaps the best litmus test of Biden's climate actions, projections from the Rhodium Group show US greenhouse gas admissions set to decline by 32-43% by 2030 under current policies, short of Biden's 50-52% goal.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Kim Kardashian's choice of a plunging neckline and the sacred symbolism of the Renaissance-style cross has sparked mixed reactions online]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kim Kardashian, the American media personality and socialite, is known for making bold statements by wearing iconic fashion artefacts. Over the years, she has worn pieces once owned by Marilyn Monroe, Janet Jackson, and Jackie Kennedy, among others. On Saturday, Ms Kardashian debuted another piece of cultural history: a diamond-studded cross pendant that was a favourite of Princess Diana. She wore the striking piece at the LACMA Art + Film Gala in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Ms Kardashian acquired the pendant for approximately $212,000 in a Sotheby's auction in January 2023, securing it in the final moments of bidding. Her appearance at the event marked the first public outing of the necklace since Diana's passing in 1997.</p>

<p>The pendant, crafted by British court jewellers Garrard in the early 20th century, measures 5.4 inches by 3.7 inches, with approximately 5.25 carats of diamonds. In the 1980s, it was purchased by the late Palestinian-British businessman Naim Attallah, who loaned it to Diana several times- most famously for a 1987 charity gala where she paired the bold piece with a matching maroon velvet gown by Catherine Walker.</p>

<p>Ms Kardashian opted for a different styling, shortening the pearl chain and layering it with other jewellery, including a six-strand pearl choker. Rather than matching her outfit to the pendant's amethyst colour, she used it as a pop of colour against an all-white ensemble.</p>

<p>However, her choice of a plunging neckline and the sacred symbolism of the Renaissance-style cross has sparked mixed reactions online. Some feel the daring cut clashes with the religious nature of the piece, while others are concerned about Ms Kardashian's access to historical treasures and the risk of potential damage.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India and China concluded the last lot of disengagement on October 21 and the implementation process is going on, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Tuesday, while calling this a "positive development."</p>

<p>The Foreign Minister was holding a joint presser with his Australian Counterpart Penny Wong in Canberra.</p>

<p>Being asked about the recent disengagement between India and China, Jaishankar said, "On October 21st we concluded the last lot of disengagement agreements, we had done some earlier. These are currently in the process of being implemented. The last agreement was primarily around patrolling rights of the two sides. So we think all in all it's a positive development."</p>

<p>The EAM said that Prime Minister Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping have agreed for meetings between the national security advisors and foreign ministers of the two countries.</p>

<p>"The fact that with that, once it's done the disengagement process is completed, we have other challenges to address including de-escalation of forces but at Kazan on the sidelines of the BRICS meeting Prime Minister Modi and President Xi had a meeting. It was agreed that the foreign ministers and the national security advisors would meet, so we will have to look at further building on this," he added.</p>

<p>PM Modi and Chinese President Xi held a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia. Prime Minister Modi stated that ties between the two nations are important for the people of India and China and for regional and global peace and stability.</p>

<p>The sentiment was also reiterated by India's Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, who last week said, "At some areas along the LAC, discussions have been ongoing between India and China at both diplomatic and military levels to resolve conflicts. Following recent talks, there has been a broad consensus to restore the ground situation. This consensus has developed on the basis of equal and mutual security. The agreement includes rights related to patrolling and grazing in traditional areas".</p>

<p>He added, "Based on this consensus, the disengagement process is nearly complete. We will strive to move beyond just disengagement, but for that, we will need to wait a little longer."</p>

<p>This came after both India and China confirmed that an agreement had been reached between the two nations regarding patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the India-China border areas.</p>

<p>The border standoff between India and China began in eastern Ladakh along the LAC in 2020, sparked by Chinese military actions. This incident led to prolonged tensions between the two nations, significantly straining their relations.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seven battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- are expected to play a decisive role in Tuesday's US presidential election between Democrat Kamala Harris or Republican Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Here are ten counties to watch in those states. Early results based on partial returns may not be predictive of the final vote tallies in the counties.</p>

<p>MARICOPA COUNTY, ARIZONA</p>

<p>Home to Phoenix, Maricopa County, Arizona, is key to winning the southwestern state as it makes up about 60% of the statewide vote. In the 2020 election, President Biden won this county by 2.2 percentage points while former President Donald Trump won the county by almost 3 percentage points in 2016.</p>

<p>COBB COUNTY, GEORGIA</p>

<p>Large and racially diverse Cobb County in Atlanta's northern suburbs is a spot Democrats could pick up the large number of votes needed to win the state, as Democratic President Joe Biden did in 2020 when he won the county by about 14 percentage points. In 2016, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton carried Cobb county by just 2 percentage points and lost the state to Trump.</p>

<p>BALDWIN COUNTY, GEORGIA</p>

<p>In central Georgia, Baldwin County is much smaller than Cobb but an indicator of Black voter turnout, as about 40% of voters in this county are Black. This is one place in Georgia where Biden's 2020 margin was narrower than Clinton's in 2016.</p>

<p>WAYNE COUNTY, MICHIGAN</p>

<p>Home to Detroit's 1.7 million residents, Wayne County, Michigan, is about 40% Black. Biden in 2020 won this county with more than 68% of the vote, helping him clinch the state.</p>

<p>WASHOE COUNTY, NEVADA</p>

<p>In the northwest corner of Nevada around Reno, Washoe County is less racially diverse than the Las Vegas area, but has been trending more Democratic in recent elections. Biden won this county by more than 4 percentage points in 2020 over Trump.</p>

<p>WAKE COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA</p>

<p>The city of Raleigh in Wake County, North Carolina, has boosted statewide turnout for Democrats in recent elections, as was the case when Biden in 2020 won 65% of the vote in the area. That was not enough to keep Trump from carrying the state in 2020.</p>

<p>ERIE COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA</p>

<p>Erie County in northwest Pennsylvania has voted for the winning presidential candidate in the last four elections, including Biden in 2020 when he won the county by 1 percentage point. In 2016, Trump won this county by 2 percentage points.</p>

<p>BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA</p>

<p>North of Philadelphia, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, is another highly competitive county due to its large population of working class voters -- a demographic group where Trump has made major inroads in his eight years on the national political stage. Trump is looking to win back the state -- as he did in 2016 -- but Biden won this county in 2020 by 4 percentage points, which helped him clinch the state.</p>

<p>CUMBERLAND COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA</p>

<p>The suburbs of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania's capital, have supported Trump in the last two elections. But Democrats could cut those gains in Cumberland County by attracting the area's growing population of white collar workers. In 2020, Trump won this county by 11 percentage points.</p>

<p>WAUKESHA COUNTY, WISCONSIN</p>

<p>The populous western suburbs of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, have been another stronghold for Trump in his past two campaigns and the Republican won Waukesha County by more than 20 percentage points each time. Voters here will need to vote for Trump again at similar levels in order for Republicans to win back the state that Biden carried in 2020.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A new UK-wide law aimed at creating the first "smoke-free generation" will on Tuesday be introduced in parliament, as part of a world-leading ban.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new UK-wide law aimed at creating the first "smoke-free generation" will on Tuesday be introduced in parliament, as part of a world-leading ban.</p>

<p>The proposals come after New Zealand revoked plans to introduce a so-called "generational smoking ban" that would have stopped sales of tobacco to anyone born after 2008.</p>

<p>"This is a groundbreaking piece of public health legislation. It will mean that we are creating the first ever smoke-free generation in our country. So children growing up in our country today will never, never legally be able to buy cigarettes," said Health Secretary Wes Streeting.</p>

<p>The UK's Tobacco and Vapes Bill will prevent anyone born after January 1 2009 from legally smoking by gradually raising the age at which tobacco can be bought.</p>

<p>The legislation is similar to a bill proposed by the last Conservative administration, which was shelved earlier this year when prime minister Rishi Sunak called a general election.</p>

<p>Sunak's successor Keir Starmer's new Labour government, however, has revived the proposals, which are part of a drive to increase preventative health measures and ease long-term pressure on the UK's state-funded National Health Service (NHS).</p>

<p>The bill will introduce restrictions on vape advertising and sponsorship, as well as restricting flavours, displays and the packaging of e-cigarettes to reduce their appeal to children and young people.</p>

<p>Last month the government announced that disposable vapes will be banned next year under separate legislation.</p>

<p><strong>Outdoor spaces</strong></p>

<p>New Zealand last November announced it would bin its own proposed anti-smoking legislation.</p>

<p>Under a law that had been due to come into force later that year anyone born after 2008 would have been prevented from buying tobacco.</p>

<p>The back pedalling came after new premier Christopher Luxon took the helm as head of a new coalition government and said he would prioritise tackling inflation and lowering interest rates.</p>

<p>The new UK bill also proposes extending existing smoking bans to outdoor spaces such as children's playgrounds and outside hospitals.</p>

<p>But Streeting said there would be no ban on smoking in pub gardens in England.</p>

<p>Pub and restaurant industry figures criticised the idea after it was leaked in August, arguing it could deter customers in a market already struggling with the long-term fallout from the pandemic and cost-of-living pressures.</p>

<p>"The UK hospitality sector has taken a battering in recent years, and we don't want to add to their pressure so we're not proposing to go ahead with an outdoor hospitality ban at this time," Streeting added.</p>

<p>England, Wales and Northern Ireland outlawed smoking in enclosed public places and workplaces in 2007 following a similar ban in Scotland in 2006.</p>

<p>The Action on Smoking and Health charity has said there was a 2.4-percent reduction in hospital admissions for heart attacks in England a year after the ban, saving the state-funded National Health Service (NHS) millions of pounds.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Founded by Thomas Jefferson, the Democratic Party is the oldest political party in the US.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Democratic Party, once a defender of slavery, has transformed into a force for diversity and progressive politics in the United States. Now, with Kamala Harris, the first Black and Asian American woman running for President in the US Elections, the shift is clear. Despite this new direction, the party remains tied to its complex past, which included supporting policies that contradicted the ideals of freedom and equality it advocates today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Founded by Thomas Jefferson, the Democratic Party (Democratic-Republican Party) is the oldest political party in the US. Initially rooted in agrarian ideals and a defence of states' rights, it attracted support from rural Americans, particularly in the South.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By the early 1800s, the party became a champion for ordinary citizens, yet also found itself at odds over slavery, leading to divisions that later gave rise to the Republican Party.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the nation expanded, so did the debate over slavery. The Democratic Party, by its 1852 convention in Baltimore, officially pledged to maintain the institution, refusing compromise. This stance alienated many, who left to join the fledgling Republican Party, founded on principles of abolition and individual freedom. This split foreshadowed a century of political rivalry, where the Republicans and Democrats would shape American politics by representing contrasting visions of governance.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party redefined itself in the early 20th century under President Woodrow Wilson, who advocated progressive reforms including labour rights and women's suffrage. The Great Depression further reshaped American politics. Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, a series of government programmes designed to revitalise the economy, won over a broad coalition, including African Americans, labour unions, and immigrant groups. This shift helped the Democrats solidify support among working-class Americans and minorities.</p>

<p>By the 1950s and 1960s, the Democratic Party underwent another transformation. With leaders like President John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson advocating for civil rights, the party gained significant African-American support. In contrast, Southern conservatives began aligning more with Republicans, who appealed to their values of limited government and opposition to civil rights legislation.</p>

<p>Today, the Democratic Party promotes social equality, advocating for voting rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and reproductive choice. It supports immigration reforms that create pathways to citizenship and family reunification. The party's stance on gun control, shaped by tragedies and increasing public concern, has led to legislation like the Gun Control Act of 1968 and the Brady Bill.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Voting for the 2024 US Presidential election began with the eastern time zone in America. New Hampshire was the first state where polling started.&nbsp;Dixville Notch, a small town in the state of New Hampshire became the first place in the country where voters cast their ballot.</p>

<p>Voting across the country begins at 6 am local time. Since the US is divided in different time zones, the eastern part of the country sees polling first. At 6 am local time (4:30 pm India time), eight states which fall in the Eastern Time zone or ET, began polling. These include the states of Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, New Hampshire and Virginia.</p>

<p>Tens of millions of voters across the United States have already cast their vote early. These votes were sent in either by mail or by visiting the polling station in person. According to data from the University of Florida's Election Lab more than 82 million voters across the US had already voted before the main election day.</p>

<p>This is the final opportunity for Americans to vote in the tightly contested 2024 presidential race between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris hurtled toward an uncertain finish.</p>

<p>The bitterly contested election campaign witnessed two assassination attempts against Trump, President Joe Biden's surprise withdrawal and Harris' rapid rise - remained too close to call, even after billions of dollars in spending and months of frenetic campaigning.</p>

<p>The candidates were running neck and neck in the campaign's final days in each of the seven states likely to determine the winner - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - showed opinion polls.</p>

<p>The winner may not be known for days if the margins in the key states remain as slim as they are expected.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Energy giant Saudi Aramco reported a 15 percent year-on-year drop in third quarter profit on Tuesday, citing low oil prices.</p>

<p>The fall in net income to $27.56 billion this year from $32.58 billion in 2023 "was mainly due to the impact of lower crude oil prices and weakening refining margins", the firm said in a statement posted to the Saudi stock exchange.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest crude exporter, is currently producing roughly nine million barrels per day (bpd), well below its capacity of 12 million bpd.</p>

<p>This reflects a series of output cuts since October 2022.</p>

<p>"Aramco delivered robust net income and generated strong free cash flow during the third quarter, despite a lower oil price environment," chief executive Amin Nasser said in a statement.</p>

<p>Aramco is the jewel of the Saudi economy and the main source of revenue for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 reform agenda, which aims to set the Gulf kingdom up for a prosperous post-oil future.</p>

<p>Its profits help finance flagship projects including NEOM, the planned futuristic mega-city being built in the desert, a giant airport in Riyadh and major tourism and leisure developments.</p>

<p>Aramco reported record profits in 2022 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent oil prices soaring.</p>

<p>But its profits dropped by a quarter last year because of lower oil prices and production cuts.</p>

<p>Profits were down 14.5 percent in the first quarter of this year and 3.4 percent in the second quarter.</p>

<p>Armed conflict in the Middle East, including direct strikes between Iran and Israel, has fuelled some market volatility but has not driven up oil prices.</p>

<p>Brent, the international benchmark, was priced at about $75 per barrel on Tuesday.</p>

<p>That is well below the $96.2 mark the International Monetary Fund said in April would be Saudi Arabia's fiscal break-even oil price at current production levels.</p>

<p>"The markets appear to be dismissing geopolitical risk in the Middle East, so anything short of an actual supply disruption" will be unlikely to exert upward pressure on prices, said Amena Bakr, senior research analyst at Energy Intelligence.</p>

<p>"So far there have been no supply disruptions."</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden in October said Israel should consider "other alternatives than striking oil fields" in its attacks on Iran.</p>

<p>"Some in the market believe that ahead of the US elections, there has been an effort to keep prices low," Bakr said, referring to Tuesday's vote.</p>

<p>- Lower expectations -</p>

<p>The year-on-year drop in Aramco's profits "isn't coming as a surprise to the government which has already revised down revenue expectations for this year based on weakening oil markets", said Jamie Ingram, senior editor at the Middle East Economic Survey.</p>

<p>On Sunday Saudi Arabia and seven other members of the OPEC+ group of oil-producing nations said they were extending a 2.2 million-barrel reduction announced in November 2023 by another month, until the end of December.</p>

<p>"When it comes to oil production policy, they'll be trying to assess what will ultimately bring in the most revenue," Ingram said.</p>

<p>"Is it maximising volumes or maximising prices? For now, the strategy remains the latter."</p>

<p>The Saudi finance ministry said in September it expected a budget deficit of 2.3 percent of GDP in 2025 and for deficits to continue through 2027.</p>

<p>Aramco announced last year it would start paying a performance-based dividend in addition to its base dividend.</p>

<p>Its statement on Tuesday said the company would maintain its $20.3 billion base dividend for the third quarter and pay out a $10.8 billion performance-linked dividend for the fourth quarter.</p>

<p>The government's stake in Aramco, one of the world's biggest companies by market capitalisation, is around 81.5 percent.</p>

<p>Aramco's initial public offering in 2019, the biggest flotation in history, raised $29.4 billion, and a secondary offering this year of nearly 1.7 billion shares fetched $12.35 billion.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia has pledged to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2060, a statement that has drawn intense scepticism from environmental activists.</p>

<p>Aramco has also vowed to achieve "operational net-zero" carbon emissions by 2050, which does not include the emissions from customers burning its products.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hundreds of sex tapes involving a high-ranking Equatorial Guinean civil servant with other men's wives have done the rounds on social media, prompting the authorities to attempt to curb their spread.</p>

<p>In the videos, the married director of the National Financial Investigation Agency (ANIF), Baltasar Ebang Engonga, is seen in flagrante with various partners -- including the wives of prominent officials -- at his office in the finance ministry.</p>

<p>On Monday, the country's vice president Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue announced on X that the government would order the "immediate suspension of all civil servants who have had sexual relations in the offices of the ministries, as this constitutes a flagrant violation of the code of conduct and the law on public ethics".</p>

<p>It is not the first time that sex tapes involving civil servants have been leaked on social media.</p>

<p>But the affair has blown up to unprecedented proportions due to the notoriety of the officials involved.</p>

<p>Last week, Obiang said that he had given 24 hours' notice to Equatorial Guinea's telecommunications ministry, regulator and telephone companies "to curb the distribution of pornographic videos that are flooding social networks in Equatorial Guinea".</p>

<p>"As the government, we cannot continue to see families destroyed," said the vice-president in charge of defence and security.</p>

<p>According to accounts first spread by WhatsApp groups and then posted to Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and X, Engonga shot more than 400 pornographic videos in his office.</p>

<p>Nicknamed "Bello" on account of his good looks, Ebang Engonga is a married father and the son of Baltasar Engonga Edjo, the current Chairman of the Commission of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community.</p>

<p>He is also related to the country's long-serving president.</p>

<p>The sex tapes were leaked on social networks at a time when he had been remanded in custody at Malabo's infamous Black Beach prison in a case of embezzlement of public funds, according to state television station TVGE.</p>

<p>Equatorial Guinea's chief prosecutor Anatolio Nzang Nguema, assured TVGE that if medical examinations revealed that Ebang Engonga was "infected with a sexually transmitted disease" he would be prosecuted for an offence against "public health".</p>

<p>The flow of internet traffic, and in particular the downloading of images, has been severely disrupted in the country after the authorities took measures to curb the sex tapes' spread, witnesses told AFP.</p>

<p>Social media is awash with speculation that more videos involving other individuals, both men and women, could be released in the next few days.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American voters deliver their verdict Tuesday after an extraordinarily turbulent election that will either make Kamala Harris the first woman president in US history or deliver Donald Trump a comeback that sends shockwaves around the world.</p>

<p>As polling stations open nationwide on Election Day, Democratic vice president Harris, 60, and Republican former president Trump, 78, are dead-even in the tightest and most volatile White House race of modern times.</p>

<p>The bitter rivals spent their final day of the campaign frenziedly working to get their supporters out to the polls and trying to win over any last undecided voters in the swing states expected to decide the outcome.</p>

<p>But despite a series of head-spinning twists in an unprecedented campaign -- from Harris's dramatic entrance when President Joe Biden dropped out in July, to Trump riding out two assassination attempts and a criminal conviction -- nothing has broken the deadlock in the opinion polls.</p>

<p>Polling stations open at 6:00 am (1100 GMT) on the US east coast and tens of millions of voters are expected to cast their ballots, on top of the more than 82 million people who have already voted early in the preceding weeks.</p>

<p>A final outcome may not be known for several days if the results are as close as the polls suggest, adding to the tension in a deeply divided nation.</p>

<p>And there are fears of turmoil and even violence if Trump loses, then contests the result as he did in 2020, with barriers erected around the White House and businesses boarded up in Washington.</p>

<p>The world is meanwhile anxiously watching as the outcome will have major implications for conflicts in the Middle East, for Russia's war in Ukraine, and for tackling climate change -- which Trump calls a hoax.</p>

<p><strong>'Every single vote matters'</strong></p>

<p>Harris and Trump are effectively tied in the seven main swing states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin.</p>

<p>On the eve of the vote, Harris went all-in on the must-win state of Pennsylvania, rallying on the Philadelphia steps made famous in the "Rocky" movie and declaring: "momentum is on our side."</p>

<p>However "this could be one of the closest races in history -- every single vote matters," cautioned Harris, who was joined by celebrities including Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey.</p>

<p>Trump -- who would become the first convicted felon and oldest person to win the presidency -- cast himself as the only solution to an apocalyptic vision of the country in terminal decline and overrun by "savage" migrants.</p>

<p>"With your vote tomorrow, we can fix every single problem our country faces and lead America -- indeed, the world -- to new heights of glory," Trump told his closing rally in Grand Rapids in the key swing state of Michigan, after touring North Carolina and Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Harris meanwhile hammered home her opposition to Trump-backed abortion bans across the United States -- one of her key vote-winning positions with crucial women voters.</p>

<p>But she also struck an upbeat note -- and notably avoided mentioning Trump, after weeks of targeting him directly as a threat to democracy for his dark rhetoric and repeated threats to exact retribution on his political opponents.</p>

<p><strong>History made</strong></p>

<p>A Trump comeback would be historic -- the first non-consecutive second term for a US president since Grover Cleveland in 1893 and just the second ever.</p>

<p>Trump's return would instantly fuel international instability, with US allies in Europe and NATO alarmed by his isolationist "America First" policies. Trading partners are nervously watching his vow to impose sweeping import tariffs.</p>

<p>A Harris victory meanwhile would give the US its first Black woman and South Asian president -- and signal an end to the Trump era which has dominated US politics for nearly a decade.</p>

<p>Trump has said he would not seek election again in 2028.</p>

<p>However, the Republican still refuses to admit he fairly lost the 2020 election to Biden and the trauma over his supporters' violent attack on the US Capitol to stop certification of the result remains heavy.</p>

<p>Trump has hinted that he would refuse to accept another loss, and in the final days of the campaign brought up baseless claims of election fraud while saying he should "never have left" the White House.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Native Americans encountered several challenges, much like African Americans and other marginalised groups who struggled for voting rights.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Native Americans practised self-governance on American soil long before the United States existed. Despite their deep-rooted history and contributions, they faced an uphill battle for citizenship and voting rights, a struggle that continued long after the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924. This act, also known as the Snyder Act, granted US citizenship to Native Americans born within the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They encountered several challenges, much like African Americans and other marginalised groups who struggled for voting rights.</p>

<p><strong>The Indian Citizenship Act Of 1924</strong></p>

<p>Passed by Congress in 1924, the Indian Citizenship Act legally recognised Native Americans as US citizens. However, the new status did not universally translate into voting rights. Since the US Constitution allows states to regulate voting laws, many states enacted restrictions specifically designed to prevent Native Americans from voting. This state-level control meant literacy tests and restrictive voter qualifications continued to disenfranchise Native voters across the country.</p>

<p>For instance, literacy tests were widely used to prevent various minority groups, including Native Americans, from voting. An article published in The Alaska Daily Empire in 1924 explained how Native Americans were subject to literacy tests despite being newly recognised citizens. This was similar to the oppressive techniques used against African Americans in the Jim Crow South.</p>

<p><strong>Voter Qualifications</strong></p>

<p>In the years following the act, Native Americans faced numerous hurdles in voting. Many states imposed strict qualifications and address requirements, making it difficult for those living on reservations to register and vote. Newspapers like the Papago Indian News reported on these issues, providing important information to Native communities about voting requirements and rights.</p>

<p>In the 1960s, legal battles continued to shape Native American voting rights. A key case in Arizona involved Joseph Montoya, who argued that votes from the Navajo Nation should not be counted because they lived on a reservation. The Arizona Supreme Court ruled against Montoya, affirming Native voting rights. This was an important step, but real change came with the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which addressed voter suppression on the federal level.</p>

<p>Native-owned publications, like the Navajo Times, played a crucial role in raising awareness about voting rights issues. These newspapers reported on legal developments and voting rights campaigns, ensuring that Native voices were heard.</p>

<p><strong>Native Americans Stance In The 2024 US Elections</strong></p>

<p>For the 2024 US elections, Native American voters shared their views at a Donald Trump rally in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Some talked about the need for economic growth in Native communities, supporting Donald Trump over President Biden's "Build Back Better" plan. While many Native Americans traditionally vote Democratic, some attendees are aligning with Trump this time, particularly on border security. Others are backing Kamala Harris, citing economic concerns and the need for environmental protections for Native lands.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A female student who stripped to her underwear at an Iranian university does not represent a security issue but is a "troubled individual" who is receiving treatment, a government spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The young woman undressed on Saturday at the Islamic Azad University in Tehran, an act that was widely perceived on social media as a protest against Iran's strict Islamic dress code.</p>

<p>"Instead of viewing this issue under a security lens, we are rather looking at it with a social lens and seek to solve the problems of this student as a troubled individual," government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani said on Tuesday in the first official reaction to the event.</p>

<p>She said that the young woman, named as Ahoo Daryaei on social media, had been transferred from a police station to a treatment centre, but did not say what treatment she would receive.</p>

<p>Reuters could not identify the young woman independently.</p>

<p>"It is yet too soon to speak of this student's return to university. According to a video published by her husband, she needs treatment and that needs to be completed before taking the next steps," Mohajerani added on the government's website.</p>

<p>The woman was detained by security guards at the university. A university spokesperson, Amir Mahjob, said on X on Saturday "at the police station, ... it was found that she was under severe mental pressure and had a mental disorder."</p>

<p>Growing numbers of Iranian women have defied authorities by discarding their veils after nationwide protests that followed the death in September 2022 of a young Iranian Kurdish woman, Mahsa Amini. She died while in the custody of the morality police for allegedly violating hijab rules. Security forces violently put down the revolt.</p>

<p>Amnesty International said on X a young woman was "violently arrested on 2 Nov after she removed her clothes in protest against abusive enforcement of compulsory veiling by security officials at Tehran's Islamic Azad University" and called for her immediate release.</p>

<p>On Monday, the semi-official, hardline Tasnim news agency said those reacting on social media were "the same anti-Iran movement which jumped on the Mahsa Amini affair in 2022".</p>

<p>The non-official Khabaronline website reported that the government spokesperson said the young woman was not facing any criminal charges.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In a startling case from Jilin province, China, a man named Xiaojun managed to juggle relationships with his wife and four other women, all living in the same housing complex.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world is filled with people who struggle to maintain even one relationship, but a Chinese man has done something truly unbelievable in this digital age where spying on anyone is not difficult at all.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3285078/chinese-man-has-1-wife-4-lovers-all-living-same-complex-unaware-each-other"><em>the South China Morning Post,</em></a> a married man in China managed to maintain relationships with four other women, all residing in the same housing complex. Remarkably, one of these women even lived in the same building as his wife. This secret arrangement lasted over four years without any of the women discovering each other's existence, sparking astonishment across Chinese social media.</p>

<p>The man, known by the pseudonym Xiaojun, whose age remains undisclosed, hails from Jilin province in northeastern China. He came from a financially disadvantaged background and had dropped out of secondary school.</p>

<p>The man, Xiaojun, fabricated an image of himself as a wealthy heir, deceiving his wife, Xiaojia. Despite his modest family background-his mother worked as a bathhouse attendant, and his father held various part-time construction jobs-he presented a false narrative of wealthy parents who ran successful businesses. To impress Xiaojia, he often gifted her counterfeit luxury items purchased online. Soon after Xiaojia's pregnancy, the couple formalised their relationship through marriage.</p>

<p>Upon discovering Xiaojun's actual financial situation, Xiaojia opted not to divorce him; instead, she decided to raise their child on her own and ultimately expelled him from their home, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3285078/chinese-man-has-1-wife-4-lovers-all-living-same-complex-unaware-each-other"><em>SCMP.</em></a></p>

<p>After Xiaojia expelled him, he met Xiaohong online, borrowing 140,000 yuan from her under false pretenses. He later rented a nearby flat to live with her, even as he continued dating three other women, university students Xiaomin and Xiaoxin and nurse Xiaolan, from whom he extracted smaller sums. His schemes unravelled when Xiaoxin, suspicious, found fake cash in a bag he'd claimed held a large sum. Reporting him led police to arrest Xiaojun, revealing his deception to all.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Azerbaijan, host of the upcoming United Nations COP29 climate summit, is a petrostate nestled between Russia and Iran.</p>

<p><strong>An ancient history</strong></p>

<p>The name Azerbaijan comes from the Persian "azer", or "sacred fire", from the temples of the ancient religion of Zoroastrianism, which were fuelled by gas or crude oil that gushed naturally from the ground.</p>

<p>In the late 13th century, Venetian explorer and writer Marco Polo reported seeing a gushing "oil fountain" as he travelled along the Silk Road in the Caucasus.</p>

<p>Today, near the capital Baku, the Zoroastrian Ateshgah temple has an ever-burning fire fuelled by a pipe of methane gas from a nearby field. In the past, the gas escaped from cracks in the ground.</p>

<p><strong>Cradle of oil extraction</strong></p>

<p>The country is historically one of the cradles of modern oil extraction: even before drilling started in the United States, a well was drilled in 1846 near Baku, which was quickly surrounded by derricks.</p>

<p>Swedes Robert and Ludvig Nobel -- brothers of Alfred, after whom Nobel Prizes are named -- were among the first to invest in Azeri oil.</p>

<p>They bought a refinery and oil fields from 1876, then founded the Branobel company that became the world's largest before being nationalised in 1920 when Azerbaijan came under Soviet control.</p>

<p>It was estimated that more than half of world oil production in 1900 came from the Absheron peninsula on the Caspian Sea on which Baku sits.</p>

<p><strong>An oil-gas republic</strong></p>

<p>The Republic of Azerbaijan, which became independent in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union, derives much of its wealth from oil and natural gas, which today mainly come from offshore deposits in the Caspian Sea.</p>

<p>Hydrocarbons represent 90 percent of the country's exports, half of state income and a third of gross domestic product, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the US State Department.</p>

<p>The IEA ranks Azerbaijan as a "major" producer and exporter of natural gas and oil, with 32.7 million tonnes of crude and 35 billion cubic metres of natural gas produced in 2022, of which more than two-thirds were exported.</p>

<p>The country is among the 20 biggest net oil exporters and the 12th largest for gas, according to 2022 figures.</p>

<p>The deepwater Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) oilfield complex, discovered in the 1970s around 100 kilometres (62 miles) east of Baku, is the country's main source of oil.</p>

<p>The site, operated by British company BP in association with state company Socar, accounts for more than half of national production of crude oil, according to BP's operating figures for the first quarter of 2024.</p>

<p><strong>The bet on gas</strong></p>

<p>While Azerbaijan's oil production has been on the decline since peaking in 2010, production of natural gas is burgeoning.</p>

<p>A member of OPEC+, an enlarged version of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, it defends gas as a transition energy as nations seek to cut carbon emissions, and plans to increase its production by about a third in the next decade.</p>

<p>Baku hopes to benefit from falling Russian gas exports, hit by international sanctions following the war in Ukraine, to become a preferred supplier to Europe through the Southern Gas Corridor network of pipelines that cross Georgia and Turkey, linking Azerbaijan to Italy.</p>

<p>The main gas field, Shah Deniz, was discovered in 1999 in the Caspian Sea around 70 kilometres south of Baku and is one of the biggest natural gas sites in the world.</p>

<p>Operated by BP, it provides more than two-thirds of national production, according to the firm.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

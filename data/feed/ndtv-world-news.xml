       <description><![CDATA[The release comes as tech companies are racing to show that their growing portfolios of resource-hungry large language models can deliver significant enough gains in known problem areas like advanced reasoning to justify fundings.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta Platforms released the biggest version of its mostly free Llama 3 artificial intelligence models on Tuesday, boasting multilingual skills and general performance metrics that nip at the heels of paid models from rivals like OpenAI.</p>

<p>The new Llama 3 model can converse in eight languages, write higher-quality computer code and solve more complex math problems than previous versions, the Facebook parent company said in blog posts and a research paper announcing the release.</p>

<p>With 405 billion parameters, or variables that the algorithm takes into account to generate responses to user queries, it dwarfs the previous version released last year though is still smaller than leading models offered by competitors.</p>

<p>OpenAI's GPT-4 model, by contrast, is reported to have one trillion parameters and Amazon is preparing a model with 2 trillion parameters.</p>

<p>Promoting Llama 3 across multiple channels, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said he expected future Llama models would overtake proprietary competitors by next year. The Meta AI chatbot powered by those models was on track to become the most popular AI assistant by the end of this year, with hundreds of millions of people using it already, he said.</p>

<p>The release comes as tech companies are racing to show that their growing portfolios of resource-hungry large language models can deliver significant enough gains in known problem areas like advanced reasoning to justify the gargantuan sums that have been invested in them.</p>

<p>Meta's own top AI scientist has said he believes such models will hit up against limits on reasoning and that other types of AI systems will be needed to produce breakthroughs.</p>

<p>In addition to its flagship 405 billion parameter model, Meta is also releasing updated versions of its lighter-weight 8 billion and 70 billion parameter Llama 3 models initially introduced in the spring, the company said.</p>

<p>All three new models are multilingual and can handle larger user requests via an expanded "context window," which Meta's head of generative AI, Ahmad Al-Dahle, said would improve the experience of generating computer code in particular.</p>

<p>"That was the number one feedback we got from the community," Al-Dahle told Reuters in an interview, noting that bigger context windows give the models something akin to a longer memory that aids in processing multi-step requests.</p>

<p>Separately, Al-Dahle said his team had been able to improve the Llama 3 model's performance on tasks such as solving math problems by using AI to generate some of the data on which they were trained.</p>

<p>Meta releases its Llama models largely free-of-charge for use by developers, a strategy Zuckerberg says will pay off in the form of innovative products, less dependence on would-be competitors and greater engagement on the company's core social networks. Some investors have raised their eyebrows at the costs entailed, however.</p>

<p>The company also stands to benefit if developers opt to use its free models over paid ones, which would undercut the business models of its rivals. With its announcement, Meta touted gains on key math and knowledge tests that may make that prospect more appealing.</p>

<p>Although measuring progress on AI development is notoriously difficult, test results provided by Meta appeared to suggest that its largest Llama 3 model was nearly matching and, in some cases, besting Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet and OpenAI's GPT-4o, which are widely regarded as the two most powerful frontier models on the market.</p>

<p>On the MATH benchmark of competition level math word problems, for example, Meta's model posted a score of 73.8, compared to GPT-4o's 76.6 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet's 71.1.</p>

<p>The model scored 88.6 on MMLU, a benchmark that covers dozens of subjects across math, science and the humanities, while GPT-4o scored 88.7 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet scored 88.3.</p>

<p>In their paper, Meta researchers also teased upcoming "multimodal" versions of the models due out later this year that layer image, video and speech capabilities on top of the core Llama 3 text model.</p>

<p>Early experiments indicate those models can perform "competitively" with other multimodal models such as Google's Gemini 1.5 and Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet, they said.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The killing of Sonya Massey, 36, over the 4th of July weekend has resulted in criminal charges against the officer who fired the shots.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Illinois police have released bodycam footage capturing the chaotic moments leading up to the fatal shooting of a woman who had called 911 to report a suspected intruder in her home.</p>

<p>The killing of Sonya Massey, 36, over the 4th of July weekend has resulted in criminal charges against the officer who fired the shots and condemnation from the White House.</p>

<p>Sangamon County Sheriff's Deputy Sean Grayson has been dismissed from the police force and charged with murder and official misconduct. He has pleaded not guilty and is being held without bond as of Monday.</p>

<p>Daniel Fultz, Grayson's attorney, declined to comment when contacted by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c28evrd9depo">BBC</a>.</p>

<p>On Monday, Illinois State Police released bodycam footage showing officers shouting at Ms. Massey to put down a pot of boiling water while pointing their pistols at her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The incident began in the early hours of July 6 when Ms Massey called the police to her home in Springfield, 200 miles (320 km) south of Chicago, believing someone had broken into her property.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Officers followed her inside as she searched for her identification.</p>

<p>In the video, Mr. Grayson notices a pot on a lit stove, gestures towards it, and says, "We don't need a fire while we're here." Ms. Massey walks to the stove to remove the pot. She and Mr. Grayson appear to laugh about her pot of "steaming hot water," before she says twice, "I rebuke you in the name of Jesus."</p>

<p>"You better not, or I swear to God I'll shoot you in your [expletive] face," Mr. Grayson responds, drawing his pistol and shouting for her to drop the pot.</p>

<p>In a statement, President Biden expressed being "heartbroken" for her family and noted that her death serves as a reminder "that all too often Black Americans face fears for their safety in ways many of the rest of us do not."</p>

<p>Vice-President Kamala Harris called on Congress to pass police reforms, stating on X: "Sonya Massey deserved to be safe. The disturbing footage released yesterday confirms what we know from the lived experiences of so many-we have much work to do to ensure that our justice system fully lives up to its name."</p>

<p>Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul described the footage of the shooting as "horrific" in a statement on Monday. "As the community reacts to the release of the footage, I urge calm as this matter works its way through the criminal justice system," Raoul said.</p>

<p>Attorneys for Ms. Massey's family have praised prosecutors for their swift action against Mr. Grayson. Personal injury lawyer Benjamin Crump stated that the footage would "shock the conscience of America."</p>

<p>"OK, I'm sorry," Ms. Massey says before ducking.</p>

<p>After shooting her, the officer says, "What else do we do? I'm not taking hot boiling water to the face." The video also captures Mr. Grayson telling his police partner that Ms. Massey would not need medical help.</p>

<p>As the other deputy attempts to get a medical kit, Mr. Grayson says, "She's done. You can go get it, but that's a head shot." He then leaves to get his own medical kit after the other officer suggests they at least try to stop Ms. Massey's bleeding.</p>

<p>On Monday, the Sangamon County State's Attorney's Office stated that Mr. Grayson was not justified in his use of force.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Noa Argamani, an Israeli woman freed from Hamas recently, met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington on Monday. During the meeting, Ms Argamani revealed that her most difficult moment in captivity was hearing the Israeli PM's declaration that the war would be long, The <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/tearful-noa-argamani-said-to-tell-netanyahu-his-vow-of-long-war-broke-her-in-captivity/ ">Times of Israel</a>&nbsp;reported.</p>

<p>"The hardest moment I had in captivity was when I listened to the radio and heard you say the war will be long. I thought, 'I won't get out of here'," she told Netanyahu, adding it was a "breaking point" for her. She then broke down and embraced another hostage relative. Netanyahu's expression remained impassive during the emotional exchange.</p>

<p>The meeting, attended by relatives of hostages, was held in Washington, DC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Argamani, recently rescued from Gaza, joined by her father Yaakov and other relatives of captives, is travelling with Netanyahu to the United States. They met at Netanyahu's hotel after arriving from Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the meeting, Ms Argamani urged the PM that the remaining 120 hostages in Gaza be brought home quickly "before it's too late".</p>

<p>"I saw death with my eyes," she said, recounting that fellow hostages Yossi Sharabi and Itay Svirsky were killed next to her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both Ms Argamani and her father faced severe backlash for accompanying Netanyahu, with both coalition and opposition lawmakers condemning their decision. Other hostage families urged them not to go, claiming it would support Netanyahu, whom many blame for more than nine months of war.</p>

<p>Many hostage relatives have been protesting for months against the Netanyahu government for not making a deal with Hamas since 105 hostages were freed in November. Some families are also calling for more military pressure on Hamas to improve negotiations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier it was reported that the Israel Defence Forces used the controversial <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-deployed-controversial-hannibal-directive-during-hamas-attack-report-6057961 ">'Hannibal Directive'</a> during the Hamas attack on October 7. This policy allows soldiers to use maximum force to prevent kidnappings and captivity, even if it puts the lives of hostages at risk.</p>

<p>The October 7 Hamas attack on Israel resulted in 1,139 deaths and 250 being taken captive. Since then, Israel's onslaught on Gaza has led to 39,090 deaths and injuries to 90,147 people so far, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The bodies of five people have been recovered after a plane crashed at an airport in Nepal's Kathmandu, local media reported on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At least 19 people, comprising crew and technical staff, were on board the Pokhara-bound Saurya Airlines plane when it caught on fire around 11 am.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The plane burst into flames after it skidded off the runway within minutes of taking off, a spokesperson of the airport told NDTV.</p>

<p>Videos from the spot show a large fire with plumes of smoke rising near the Tribhuvan International Airport. Fire fighters are at the scene and are trying to douse the fire.</p>

<p>The cause of the fire is not known yet. Rescue operations are on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Tribhuvan International Airport is a tabletop airport which is located on the top of a plateau surrounded by deep gorges and valleys on all sides.</p>

<p>In 2023, a Yeti Airlines aircraft crashed on Pokhara killing all 72 people on board, including five Indians.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a press release)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman said on Tuesday the ChatGPT maker's AI safety leader Aleksander Madry was working on a new research project, as the startup rejigs the preparedness team.</p>

<p>"Aleksander is working on a new and v(very) important research project," Altman said in a post on X, adding that OpenAI executives Joaquin Quinonero Candela and Lilian Weng will be taking over the preparedness team in the meanwhile.</p>

<p>The preparedness team helps to evaluate artificial general intelligence readiness of the company's AI models, a spokesperson for OpenAI said in statement, adding Madry will take on a bigger role within the research organization following the move.</p>

<p>Madry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>"Joaquin and Lilian are taking over the preparedness team as part of unifying our safety work", Altman wrote in the post.</p>

<p>The Information, which was the first to report Madry's move, had said researcher Tejal Patwardhan will manage much of the work of the team.</p>

<p>The moves come when OpenAI's chatbots, which can engage in human-like conversations and create videos and images based on text prompts, have become increasingly powerful and have stirred safety concerns.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the Microsoft-backed company formed a Safety and Security Committee to be led by board members, including CEO Sam Altman, in the run-up to its training of its next artificial intelligence model.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Singapore edged past France, Germany, Italy and Spain to reclaim bragging rights as having the world's most powerful passport.</p>

<p>Having a Singapore passport means getting visa-free entry to a record 195 global destinations, putting the city state at the top on the Henley Passport Index. The four European countries, which held the No. 1 spot earlier in the year, are now in second place along with Japan.</p>

<p>Seven nations take the third spot for the first time. Passport holders from Austria, Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, South Korea and Sweden can enter 191 places hassle-free.</p>

<p>The ranking, published by London-based immigration consultancy Henley &amp; Partners, uses data from the International Air Transport Association to rank 199 passports' access to 227 travel destinations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The ability to travel visa-free to a wide array of destinations is no longer merely a convenience," said Henley's Chief Executive Officer Juerg Steffen. "It's a powerful economic tool that can drive growth, foster international cooperation, and attract foreign investment."</p>

<p>The US dropped one spot to eight place, extending its decade-long slide down the index. The former passport powerhouse held a joint first place with the UK a decade ago. The UK now ranks fourth.</p>

<p>Afghanistan's travel document, which allows visa-free entry to 26 destinations, remains the world's weakest.&nbsp;<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British Foreign Secretary David Lammy on Wednesday began a two-day visit to India to galvanise negotiations for an ambitious Free Trade Agreement and reset the overall bilateral partnership in crucial areas such as clean energy, new technologies and security.</p>

<p>As he embarked on the high-profile trip, Mr Lammy described the negotiations for the trade deal as the floor and not the ceiling of the ambitions to unlock shared potential and deliver growth.</p>

<p>The British foreign secretary's visit to New Delhi is the first high-level engagement between India and the UK after Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour government came to power on July 5.</p>

<p>"India is the emerging superpower of the 21st century, the largest country in the world with 1.4 billion people and one of the fastest growing economies in the world," Mr Lammy said.</p>

<p>"Our Free Trade Agreement negotiations is the floor not the ceiling of our ambitions to unlock our shared potential and deliver growth, from Bengaluru to Birmingham," he said.</p>

<p>A British government readout said, Mr Lammy will push for a "reset" of the UK-India partnership, including through reinforcing London's commitment to securing a free trade agreement that will benefit both economies.</p>

<p>It said the foreign secretary will also galvanise support for accelerated action on the climate crisis with India as an "indispensable partner", driving forward the clean energy transition and creating opportunities for British and Indian businesses.</p>

<p>He will discuss partnering on Indian-led global initiatives to build clean power access, climate resilience in the global south and small island states, it said.</p>

<p>"We have shared interests on the green transition, new technologies, economic security and global security," Mr Lammy was quoted as saying in the readout.</p>

<p>"I am travelling to India in my first month as Foreign Secretary because resetting our relationship with the Global South is a key part of how this government will reconnect Britain for our security and prosperity at home," he said.</p>

<p>In a post on 'X', External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said Mr Lammy's visit will strengthen the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries.</p>

<p>Mr Lammy and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will hold wide-ranging talks this evening that is expected to focus on the FTA and New Delhi's concerns over activities of pro-Khalistan elements in Britain, people familiar with the matter said.</p>

<p>The British foreign secretary is also scheduled to meet Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal during which both sides are likely to reaffirm their commitment to the proposed free trade pact, they said.</p>

<p>It is learnt both sides have already agreed on almost 90 per cent of the trade pact but the remaining 10 per cent comprised several sticky issues such as import duties on automobiles and scotch whisky and visas for business people.</p>

<p>The British readout said Mr Lammy will highlight the importance of a new partnership with India that focuses on economic, domestic and global security.</p>

<p>Economic, domestic and global security will be at the heart of the foreign secretary's first visit to India as he travels to New Delhi to unlock the full potential of the UK-India partnership.</p>

<p>He will tell his Indian counterpart that he wants to drive forward greater growth for both countries, it said.</p>

<p>The foreign secretary will underscore the importance of the "living bridge" between the UK and India.</p>

<p>It represents the 1.7 million people with Indian heritage that have made their home in the UK and make an exceptional contribution to British life, the readout released by the UK high commission in New Delhi said.</p>

<p>"In a visit to India's third largest technology company, the Foreign Secretary will meet business leaders to highlight how the UK and India are working together on shared ambitions such as cutting-edge science to encourage innovation, boost trade, and improve the livelihoods of working people in both countries," it said.</p>

<p>The foreign secretary will also hold high-level talks with members from the Indian government, including Jaishankar, it said.</p>

<p>Mr Lammy will reiterate the extraordinary contribution of British Indians, saying that they enrich the UK's social and economic landscape and are the epitome of modern Britain, it added.</p>

<p>In their talks, Jaishankar and Mr Lammy are also expected to review the implementation of the India-UK roadmap that seeks to broad-base the ties in a range of areas.</p>

<p>In 2021, India and the UK adopted the 10-year roadmap to expand ties in key areas of trade and economy, defence and security, climate change and people-to-people connections among others.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar and Mr Lammy are also likely to deliberate on pressing global challenges, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the situation in the Middle-East.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prince Harry is set to receive a huge payout on his 40th birthday later this year, according to a report. The Duke of Sussex will turn 40 on September 15. In striking contrast to his elder brother Prince William, who received a ceremonial bell concert at Westminster Abbey on his 40th birthday, Prince Harry will inherit millions on his milestone birthday, thanks to arrangements made by his late great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/royal-family/article/tax-breaks-helped-to-pile-up-fortune-fit-for-a-prince-pcgs3njj8"><em>Times</em></a>, the late Queen Mother established a $90 million trust fund for her family, which listed that the Duke of Sussex would receive his share when he turned 40. Prince Harry will reportedly rake in around $8.5 million from his share, which is more than Prince William is slated to get.</p>

<p>However, Prince Harry would still have to pay taxes on his inheritance, while his elder brother would benefit from the tax-exempt Duchy of Cornwall - a private estate that funds his public, charitable and private activities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"William will benefit from the vast wealth of the Duchy of Cornwall, a private estate that funds the public, charitable, and private activities of the king's heir," a source said, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/23/entertainment/prince-harry-set-for-huge-inheritance-on-40th-birthday-report/"><em>New York Post</em></a>. "As a result, Harry is likely to receive slightly more than half of the 14 million pounds allocated for the brothers," they added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an estimated current net worth of about $60 million, Prince Harry's upcoming inheritance would be a welcome addition, the outlet noted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following their exit as senior working royals, Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle settled in Montecito, California. Their net worth was largely boosted because of the several high-profile projects they've taken on since quitting royal life in 2020. These projects include a Netflix original, Prince Harry's tell-all memoir Spare, and Meghan Markle's 12-episode podcast, Archetypes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the <em>Post</em>, Prince Harry is even considering publishing a follow-up book. The duo are also in for a big payday with the forthcoming launch of Meghan Markle's new lifestyle brand, American Riviera Orchard.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With just a few weeks to pick a replacement for President Joe Biden, Democratic Party delegates rapidly rallied behind Kamala Harris, saying the circumstances require a quick and practical choice.</p>

<p>"We don't have the time to be looking at other candidates," Iowa delegate Adam Peters told AFP.</p>

<p>Like almost all the delegates attending the Democratic National Convention next month in Chicago, Peters was initially supporting Biden to be the party's nominee against Republican Donald Trump in November.</p>

<p>But with the 81-year-old president's withdrawal on Sunday, those 3,900-plus party stalwarts were suddenly relieved from their commitment and had to consider who to select as their new flag-bearer.</p>

<p>While free to pick whomever they wanted, signals quickly came from Democratic figureheads -- including Biden -- that Vice President Harris was the best choice, with any opposition likely to open more divisions at a time of crisis.</p>

<p>For Peters, a 36-year-old director of an LGBTQ center, Harris is the "unifying candidate that we have -- the only one."</p>

<p>Acknowledging concerns that delegates were rushing in their decision to back Harris, Peters argued that given the circumstances of the shortened timeline, the safest bet was to back "a person that is proven and that has that support by a majority of Americans."</p>

<p>"There is no good way to do this, and the more time that we spend looking at other candidates... is a waste of time when we could be talking about the danger that is Donald Trump," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>'Media frenzy'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>More than half of the delegates have already announced their support for Harris, which does not yet make her the formal nominee, but all but assures she will be the party's pick in short order.</p>

<p>The delegates are party activists from all across the country and have diverse backgrounds -- from clerics to teachers to local elected officials.</p>

<p>Like most others, Kevin Sabellico of California wants to quickly turn the page on the weeks of turmoil following Biden's disastrous debate.</p>

<p>"We have to select a party nominee, and we have to do it quickly, and we have to come together and unite behind her, because these last few three weeks or so of infighting and the media frenzy around our nominee have not been helpful. It's really hurt us," Sabellico told AFP.</p>

<p>A 26-year-old veteran of political campaigns, he said he has worked with Harris before.</p>

<p>"I've seen her when the cameras are off, and her leadership, her mental toughness, her courage... it's exactly what we need in this moment to take on Donald Trump and finish the job," Sabellico said.</p>

<h3><strong>'Grandstand' worries&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>On Sunday evening, just hours after Biden announced his withdrawal, Tennessee Democratic Party Chairman Hendrell Remus said he was worried about what might come next.</p>

<p>"I hope that we don't see a situation where Democrats who are looking for an opportunity to make a name for themselves try to grandstand and become candidates in this race," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"I think now is the time for us to get behind Kamala Harris as a nominee."</p>

<p>Two days later, after an outpouring of support for Harris and her record-breaking fundraising, Remus can rest easy.</p>

<p>How the Democratic delegates will formally nominate their candidate is due to be discussed on Wednesday at a meeting of the party's rules committee.</p>

<p>An online roll call vote is expected sometime before August 7 -- ahead of the Chicago convention beginning August 19 -- due to possible legal issues in Ohio.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Earth experienced its hottest day in at least 84 years, with the global average temperature reaching a record high of 17.09 degrees Celsius on July 21, according to the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Earth experienced its hottest day in at least 84 years, with the global average temperature reaching a record high of 17.09 degrees Celsius on July 21, according to the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).</p>

<p>This follows a series of record-breaking temperatures -- June marked the 12th consecutive month of global temperatures reaching or exceeding the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold. Every month since June last year has been the warmest on record.</p>

<p>Preliminary data from C3S showed that July 21 was the hottest day since at least 1940, surpassing the previous record of 17.08 degrees Celsius set on July 6, 2023.</p>

<p>What stands out is the significant difference between the temperatures since July 2023 and all previous years.</p>

<p>Before July 2023, the Earth's daily average temperature record, set in August 2016, was 16.8 degrees Celsius. However, since July 3, 2023, there have been 57 days with temperatures exceeding that previous record.</p>

<p>Carlo Buontempo, director of C3S, said the difference between the temperatures over the past 13 months and previous records is staggering.</p>

<p>"We are now in truly uncharted territory and as the climate continues to warm, we are bound to see new records in the coming months and years," he said.</p>

<p>Analysis shows that 2023 and 2024 have seen significantly higher annual maximum daily global temperatures compared to previous years. The 10 years with the highest daily average temperatures are from 2015 to 2024.</p>

<p>The global average temperature usually peaks between late June and early August, driven by the northern hemisphere's summer. The land masses in the northern hemisphere warm up faster than the southern hemisphere's oceans can cool down.</p>

<p>With global average temperatures already at near-record levels, a new daily average temperature record was not completely unexpected.</p>

<p>C3S scientists attributed the sudden rise in daily global temperatures to much higher-than-average temperatures over large parts of Antarctica. Such large anomalies are not uncommon during the Antarctic winter and also contributed to record global temperatures in early July 2023.</p>

<p>The Antarctic Sea ice extent is almost as low as it was last year, leading to above-average temperatures over parts of the Southern Ocean.</p>

<p>As the global average temperature typically peaks between late June and early August, scientists expect it to rise and peak around July 22 or 23, 2024, before decreasing.</p>

<p>The European climate agency said whether 2024 will be the warmest year ever depends largely on the development and intensity of La Niña. While 2024 has been warm enough to surpass 2023, the exceptional warmth of the last four months of 2023 makes it too early to predict with certainty which year will be warmer.</p>

<p>Climate science non-profit Berkeley Earth estimated last week that 2024 has a 92 per cent chance of setting a new annual heat record.</p>

<p>There is a 99 per cent chance that 2024 will have an annual average temperature anomaly of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above the 1850-1900 average, it said.</p>

<p>At the 2015 UN climate talks in Paris, world leaders committed to limiting the global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial period average to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. However, a permanent breach of the 1.5-degree Celsius limit specified in the Paris Agreement refers to long-term warming over a 20 or 30-year period.</p>

<p>The Earth's global surface temperature has already increased by around 1.2 degrees Celsius due to the rapidly-increasing concentration of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide and methane, in the atmosphere. This warming is considered to be the reason behind record droughts, wildfires and floods worldwide.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The latest ranking released by the Henley Passport Index puts India's passport at the 82nd spot, allowing Indians visa-free entry to 58 countries. The ranking is based on data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which maintains the most extensive and precise database of travel information worldwide. India's current rank ties it with nations like Senegal and Tajikistan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Singapore passport has been named the world's most powerful passport, offering visa-free access to 195 countries, as per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/passport-index/ranking">list</a>. France, Italy, Germany and Spain tied with Japan in second place, providing passport holders access to 192 countries. Then, in third place in the ranking, Austria, Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, South Korea, and Sweden all have visa-free access to 191 destinations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The United Kingdom is the fourth place, alongside New Zealand, Norway, Belgium, Denmark and Switzerland. Australia and Portugal shared the No. 5 spot, while the United States dropped down to eighth place, with visa-free access to 186 countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>India's passport ranked 82nd on the list, with citizens allowed to travel to 58 countries without a visa, including popular destinations like Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Neighbouring Pakistan is positioned at 100th, providing passport holders access to 33 countries. At the bottom of the list is Afghanistan with easy access to 26 destinations.</p>

<p><strong>The most powerful passports for 2024:</strong></p>

<div class="sp_only-ul-ol sp_only-ul-ol-2">
<ol>
	<li>Singapore (195 destinations)</li>
	<li>France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain (192)</li>
	<li>Austria, Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, South Korea, Sweden (191)</li>
	<li>Belgium, Denmark, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, United Kingdom (190)</li>
	<li>Australia, Portugal (189)</li>
	<li>Greece, Poland (188)</li>
	<li>Canada, Czechia, Hungary, Malta (187)</li>
	<li>United States (186)</li>
	<li>Estonia, Lithuania, United Arab Emirates (185)</li>
	<li>Iceland, Latvia, Slovakia, Slovenia (184)</li>
</ol>

<p>Christian Kaelin, chair of Henley and Partners, highlighted the widening global mobility gap between countries. "The global average number of destinations travellers are able to access visa-free has nearly doubled from 58 in 2006 to 111 in 2024. However, the global mobility gap between those at the top and bottom of the index is now wider than it has ever been," he said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, for the past 19 years, the Henley Passport Index has been tracking global freedoms in 227 countries and territories around the world, using exclusive data from the IATA. It has become the most popular interactive online tool to display, sort, and rank the world's passports. It is updated in real-time throughout the year, as and when visa policy changes come into effect.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[The incident, which occurred in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, has highlighted the dangers of e-bike batteries and prompted calls for increased safety measures.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An e-bike battery fire destroyed the home of a family of seven, leaving them with nothing more than the clothing on their backs, according to <em>The Metro.</em></p>

<p>On July 9, a fire destroyed the three-bedroom home of Simon Blanshard, 40, his partner Laura Natale, 25, and their five children. The family believes an e-bike battery that was charging at the time started the fire.</p>

<p>The family was left without a place to live after the fire severely damaged the residence. For now, they are depending on friends' and family's generosity to provide lodging.</p>

<p>Mr Blanshard expressed his shock and devastation at the loss of their home and belongings. "We've lost absolutely everything," he said. "We're starting from scratch."</p>

<p>Simon, who is currently unemployed and from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/07/23/family-left-homeless-e-bike-fire-destroyed-everything-owned-21278601/"><em>The Metro:</em></a> "Pretty much everything has been destroyed. Whatever hasn't been burned has been damaged by smoke, so there's nothing in the house we can salvage. We are sofa-surfing at my partner's mom's at the moment; we are basically homeless. It's devastating; it's hard to get through a day without crying."</p>

<p>The incident has highlighted the potential dangers of e-bike batteries, prompting calls for increased safety measures and pollution control related to electronic vehicles.</p>

<p>A few months ago, a study by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.emissionsanalytics.com/news/gaining-traction-losing-tread"><em>Emission Analytics</em></a>, a firm that analyses emissions data, challenged this idea. The study, featured in a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/electric-cars-emit-more-soot-california-ban-gas-powered-vehicles-521b29e3"><em>Wall Street Journal op-ed,</em></a> brings attention to the problem of particle pollution originating from brakes and tyres in both electric and fossil fuel-powered cars.</p>

<p>The key finding is that EVs, due to their heavier weight, may release significantly more particulate matter from brakes and tyres compared to modern gas-powered vehicles with efficient exhaust filters. The study suggests this could be 1,850 times greater.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US Vice President Kamala Harris assailed Donald Trump on Tuesday at her first campaign rally since replacing President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate, while a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed her taking a marginal lead.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris assailed Donald Trump on Tuesday at her first campaign rally since replacing President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate, while a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed her taking a marginal lead over her Republican rival.</p>

<p>In a 17-minute speech, Harris aggressively went after Trump's vulnerabilities, comparing her background as a former prosecutor to his record as a convicted felon.</p>

<p>Harris ticked through a list of liberal priorities, saying that if elected she would act to expand abortion access, make it easier for workers to join unions and address gun violence, drawing a sharp contrast with Trump, the Republican nominee for president in the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump wants to take our country backward," she told a cheering crowd of several thousand at West Allis Central High School in a Milwaukee suburb in Wisconsin, a battleground state with a pivotal role in deciding the election outcome.</p>

<p>"Do we want to live in a country of freedom, compassion and rule of law, or a country of chaos, fear and hate?"</p>

<p>The raucous rally was a notable contrast to the smaller, more subdued events Biden held, underscoring Democrats' hope that Harris, 59, can revive what had been a flagging campaign under Biden, 81. The audience danced and waved Harris signs, while chants of "Ka-ma-la!" broke out when she took the stage.</p>

<p>She emphasised her commitment to reproductive rights, an issue that has plagued Republicans since the US Supreme Court - powered by three Trump-appointed justices - eliminated a nationwide right to abortion in 2022.</p>

<p>Harris led Trump 44% to 42% among registered voters in the national Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted on Monday and Tuesday after Biden dropped out of the contest on Sunday and endorsed Harris as his successor.</p>

<p>A Reuters/Ipsos poll last week showed Biden, before he ended his campaign, trailing Trump by two percentage points.</p>

<p>Both were within the poll's three-point margin of error. But the results could signal limited movement in Democrats' direction - and may suggest that Harris' elevation to the top of the ticket blunted whatever momentum Trump hoped to gain from last week's Republican National Convention, also in Milwaukee.</p>

<p>Trump and his allies have tried to tether Harris to some of Biden's more unpopular policies, including his administration's handling of the surge of migrants at the southern border with Mexico.</p>

<p>In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, Trump expressed confidence in his ability to defeat Harris, noting that her previous presidential run in 2020 did not even survive until the first statewide nominating contest.</p>

<p>Trump offered to debate Harris multiple times. Trump and Biden had one more debate scheduled on Sept. 10 after their encounter on June 27. Biden's poor performance that night led to Democratic calls for him to step aside.</p>

<p>"I want to debate her, and she'll be no different because they have the same policies," Trump said.</p>

<h2>A SWIFT RISE</h2>

<p>Harris swiftly consolidated her party's support after Biden, 81, abandoned his reelection campaign under pressure from members of his party who worried about his ability to beat Trump, 78, or to serve for another four-year term.</p>

<p>She wrapped up the nomination on Monday night by winning pledges from a majority of the delegates who at next month's party convention will determine the nominee, the campaign said.</p>

<p>Her campaign said it had raised $100 million since Sunday.</p>

<p>Most Democratic lawmakers have lined up behind her candidacy, including the party's leaders in the Senate and House, Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, who endorsed Harris on Tuesday at a joint press conference.</p>

<p>Harris' rise dramatically reshapes an election in which many voters were unhappy with their options. As the first Black woman and Asian American to serve as vice president, she would make further history as the first woman elected US president.</p>

<p>Wisconsin is among a trio of Rust Belt states, along with Michigan and Pennsylvania, that are critical to Democrats' chances of defeating Trump.</p>

<p>Alyssa Wahlberg, 19, chair of the Whitewater College Democrats, said Harris had reenergized young voters, particularly women who want Harris to break the ultimate U.S. glass ceiling.</p>

<p>"I talked to my grandmom. We are both excited that she may live to see the first woman president," said Wahlberg, who was attending Tuesday's rally. "It's taken too long."</p>

<p>Saddled with concerns that included his health and persistent high prices crimping Americans' household finances, Biden had been losing ground against Trump in opinion polls, particularly in the competitive states that are likely to decide the election, including the Sun Belt states of Arizona and Nevada.</p>

<h2>BIDEN TO ADDRESS NATION</h2>

<p>Biden said on X that he would deliver a Wednesday night Oval Office speech explaining his decision to end his campaign. He returned to Washington on Tuesday after spending several days isolating at home with COVID-19. The president has tested negative and no longer has symptoms, the White House doctor said in a letter on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Biden's dramatic exit followed Trump's narrow survival of a July 13 assassination attempt that raised questions about security failures in the U.S. Secret Service. The agency director, Kimberly Cheatle, resigned on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The Washington Post reported that Secret Service officials have encouraged the Trump campaign to stop holding outdoor rallies like the one in Butler, Pennsylvania, where Trump was wounded in the right ear. The Post cited unnamed people familiar with the matter. The Secret Service and the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Democratic National Committee chair Jaime Harrison, in an interview on NBC's "Today" program, said the party had to move quickly to get the ticket on ballots in all 50 states, and that Harris' vice presidential pick needed to be made by Aug. 7.</p>

<p>Potential running mates include Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, US Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden was seen in public for the first time since he dropped out of the Presidential race and tested positive for COVID-19. His absence <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/wheres-joe-hospice-care-coup-joe-biden-absence-sparks-bizarre-conspiracy-theories-6169799">sparked rumours</a> on social media with several users claiming the 81-year-old leader's health was deteriorating, even claiming he was in "hospice care" and was "unlikely to survive the night".</p>

<p>"Where's Joe" became a top trend on X globally after the US President was out of public eye for five days as he was isolating while recovering from COVID-19 at his Delaware home.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the Democratic leader <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-president-biden-returns-to-white-house-after-testing-covid-negative-6173945">returned to the White House</a> after his doctors said his symptoms of COVID-19 have been resolved and a rapid antigen test showed he was negative for COVID-19. "I am feeling well," he said.</p>

<p></p>

— Chris D. Jackson (@ChrisDJackson) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisDJackson/status/1815807096207933599?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 23, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>The US President boarded a plane to White House even as reporters shouted questions at him asking him how he felt, why he dropped out of the race and whether his deputy Vice President Kamala Harris could beat the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Biden did not respond to the questions and just gave a quick thumbs up. "It's great to be back at the White House. This afternoon, I arrived back at the Oval Office and sat down with my national security team for my daily intelligence briefing. Serving as your Commander-in-Chief continues to be the greatest honor of my life,” he wrote on X.</p>

<p>While quarantining, the US President announced the sudden withdrawal from his re-election bid after months of staying defiant and insisting he would not drop out of the Presidential race, even as pressure mounted from his party to step aside.</p>

<p>Taking to social media, he announced that he would not be accepting the Democrat nomination and instead "focus all his energies on his duties as president for the remainder of his term". He endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him as the Democratic candidate to take on rival Donald Trump in the elections later this year.</p>

<p>The leader also announced that he will be addressing the nation on Friday morning, probably to explain his decision to withdraw from the presidential race.</p>

<p>“Tomorrow evening at 8 PM ET, I will address the nation from the Oval Office on what lies ahead, and how I will finish the job for the American people,” he said in a post on X.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate and former president Donald Trump is relying on support from billionaires and big corporations, while hers is a people powered campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris said Tuesday addressing her first election rally, a day after she became the presumptive presidential nominee of the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump is relying on support from billionaires and big corporations. He is trading access in exchange for campaign contributions. A couple months ago, you all saw that, at Mar-a-Lago, he literally promised big oil companies, big oil lobbyists, he would do their bidding for $1 billion in campaign donations," Harris, 59, said in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p>

<p>"On the other hand, we are running a people-powered campaign. We just had some breaking news. We just had the best 24 hours of grassroots fundraising in presidential campaign history. Because we are a people-powered campaign, that is how you know we will be a people-first presidency," Harris said addressing her maiden campaign rally, less than 50 hours after she entered the race after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race.</p>

<p>"This campaign is also about two different visions for our nation. One, where we are focused on the future. focused on the past. We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead," she said amidst cheers from the audience.</p>

<p>"A future where no child has to grow up in poverty, where every worker has the freedom to join a union, where every person has affordable health care, affordable childcare, and paid family leave. We believe in a future where every senior can retire with dignity. So, all of this is to say building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. Because here's the thing: we are all here. When our middle class is strong, America is strong," she said.</p>

<p>Harris alleged that Trump wants to take the country backward.</p>

<p>"He and his extreme Project 2025 agenda will weaken the middle class. Like we know we got to take this seriously. …Donald Trump intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. He intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and make working families foot the bill," Harris said.</p>

<p>"They intend to end the Affordable Care Act and take us back then to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. Remember what that was like? Children with asthma, women who survived breast cancer, grandparents with diabetes. America has tried these failed economic policies before, but we are not going back.. And I'll tell you why we're not going back," she said.</p>

<p>"Because ours is a fight for the future. It is fight for freedom. Generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. And now, Wisconsin, the baton is in our hands. We, who believe in the sacred freedom to vote. We'll make sure every American has the ability to cast their ballot and have it counted," Harris said.</p>

<p>"We, who believe that every person in our nation should have the freedom to live safe from the terror of gun violence, will finally pass red flag laws, universal background checks, and an assault weapons ban. We, who believe in reproductive freedom, will stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans because we trust women to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vice President Kamala Harris is narrowly beating rival Donald Trump in a national presidential poll released Tuesday, one of the first conducted since US President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign.</p>

<p>Harris holds a two-point lead over Trump, 44 percent to 42 percent, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll. It was conducted in the two days after Biden announced Sunday he was dropping out of the race and endorsing his vice president.</p>

<p>In the previous week's poll, Harris, 59, and Trump, now the elder in the presidential race at 78, were tied at 44 percent.</p>

<p>Harris, the overwhelming frontrunner for the Democratic nomination who is raking in endorsements and donations as well as pledged delegates, narrowly trails Republican flag-bearer Trump in another survey also released Tuesday.</p>

<p>Both results are within the polls' margins of error.</p>

<p>The new surveys followed both the Republican National Convention, where Trump formally accepted the party's presidential nomination, and Biden's leaving the race.</p>

<p>Harris's performance in the polls, bolstered by the excitement among Democratic voters about the shakeup in the race, shows her apparently neutralizing the bounce that a nominee gets in the days after his or her party's nominating convention.</p>

<p>In a PBS News/NPR/Marist poll conducted Monday, Trump edges Harris with 46 percent to 45 percent of US registered voters, with nine percent undecided.</p>

<p>If third-party candidates or independents are included in the contest, Trump and Harris are tied at 42 percent, with the others far behind.</p>

<p>The PBS News survey notably found that 87 percent of all Americans think Biden's decision to drop out was the right move, a view that crossed partisan and generational lines.</p>

<p>A plurality of respondents (41 percent) said Biden's decision increases Democrats' chances of winning in November, compared to 24 percent who said it decreases the party's odds and 34 percent who said it makes no difference.</p>

<p>Both surveys come in the aftermath of Trump surviving a shock assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally on July 13.</p>

<p>Trump maintains a very narrow advantage of 1.6 percentage points against Harris, according to an average of polls collated by RealClearPolitics.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Biden tested positive for COVID-19 while campaigning in Las Vegas on Wednesday and has been isolating at his Delaware home since.</p>

<p>"The President's symptoms have resolved. Over the course of his infection, he never manifested a fever, and his vital signs remained normal, including pulse oximetry. His lungs remained clear," said O'Connor.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following US Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle's resignation over agency's handling of former President Trump's protection, President Joe Biden thanked her "for her decades of public service" to the nation.</p>

<p>Biden also stated that he plans to appoint a new director for the USSS soon.</p>

<p>Lauding Cheatle's service, Biden underlined how she has selflessly dedicated and risked her life to protect the country throughout her career in the United States Secret Service.</p>

<p>"Jill and I are grateful to Director Kim Cheatle for her decades of public service. She has selflessly dedicated and risked her life to protect our nation throughout her career in the United States Secret Service. We especially thank her for answering the call to lead the Secret Service during our Administration and we are grateful for her service to our family," a White House release read, quoting the statement from President Joe Biden on Tuesday (local time).</p>

<p>Cheatle's resignation comes amid ongoing probes by lawmakers and an internal government watchdog into how the agency handled Trump's safety and how a gunman nearly killed the Republican presidential candidate for Pennsylvania during a rally this month.</p>

<p>"As a leader, it takes honor, courage, and incredible integrity to take full responsibility for an organization tasked with one of the most challenging jobs in public service," Biden said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The independent review to get to the bottom of what happened on July 13 continues, and I look forward to assessing its conclusions. We all know what happened that day can never happen again. As we move forward, I wish Kim all the best, and I will plan to appoint a new Director soon," he added.</p>

<p>One rallygoer was killed and several others were hurt in the event, which narrowly missed Trump's head.</p>

<p>Trump was on stage at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania when gunshots rang out and Secret Service agents rushed on to the stage. Hours after the shooting, Trump said that the bullet pierced the upper part of his right ear.</p>

<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Demands for Cheatle's resignation were also raised by members of Congress from both parties, and Republicans had been continuously pressing for her impeachment since Trump was shot at the Pennsylvania rally on July 13.</p>

<p>After her Monday public hearing before the House Oversight Committee, where she refused to respond to several of the committee's questions, lawmakers were especially enraged, according to CNN.</p>

<p>Even though Cheatle said there were "significant" and "colossal" issues with the rally's security during her testimony before the House Oversight Committee, she had previously refused to step down.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lanka's government Tuesday formally apologised to the island's Muslim minority for forcing cremations on Covid victims, disregarding WHO assurances that burials in line with Islamic rites were safe.</p>

<p>The cabinet issued an "apology regarding the compulsory cremation policy during the Covid-19 pandemic", the government said in a statement.</p>

<p>It said a new law would guarantee the right to burial or cremation to ensure the funeral customs of Muslims or any other community were not violated in future.</p>

<p>Traditionally, Muslims bury their dead facing Mecca. Sri Lanka's majority Buddhists are typically cremated, as are Hindus.</p>

<p>Muslim representatives in Sri Lanka welcomed the apology, but said their entire community, accounting for about 10 percent of the island's 22 million population, was still traumatised.</p>

<p>"We will now sue two academics -- Meththika Vithanage and Channa Jayasumana -- who were behind the forced cremation policy of the government," Hilmy Ahamed, spokesman for the Muslim Council of Sri Lanka, told AFP.</p>

<p>"We will also seek compensation."</p>

<p>Ahamed said a young Muslim couple suffered untold anguish when their 40-day-old infant was cremated by the state against their wishes.</p>

<p>Then president Gotabaya Rajapaksa banned burials despite his administration facing international condemnation at the UN Human Rights Council and other forums for violating Muslim funeral norms.</p>

<p>In a book published earlier this month, he defended his action saying he was only carrying out "expert advice" from Vithanage, a professor of natural resources, not to let Covid victims be interred.</p>

<p>She has no medical background.</p>

<p>Rajapaksa halted his forced cremations policy in February 2021 following an appeal from then Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan during a visit to Sri Lanka.</p>

<p>The government then allowed burials at the remote Oddamavadi area in the island's east under strict military supervision -- but without the participation of the bereaved family.</p>

<p>Rajapaksa was forced out of office two years ago following months of protests over an unprecedented economic crisis, which had led to shortages of food, fuel and medicines.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

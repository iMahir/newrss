       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A high profile global initiative to tackle cancer called the 'Cancer Moonshot' will be announced on the sidelines of the Quad Summit. Ahead of that an India cancer specific cancer genome atlas has been released. Till date, all cancer treatments were based on western datasets, say the experts who made the cancer atlas. This had led to complications. India has the third-highest number of cancer cases after the US and China.</p>

<p>The release of the Cancer Genome Atlas of India is timely since according to estimates by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), in India, the incidence of cancer cases is likely to increase from 1.46 million in 2022 to 1.57 million in 2025.</p>

<p>The Quad Summit to be held in Philadelphia will be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, US President Joe Biden, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. While global security will be high on the agenda, the menace of cancer is also not being ignored.</p>

<p>Cancer Moonshot is a special programme spearheaded by Mr Biden and the US First Lady. The White House says it is building a world where the word cancer loses its power, a diagnosis isn't a death sentence, and to prevent cancer before it starts.</p>

<p>"We catch cancer early so people live longer and healthier lives, and patients and families don't have to navigate their cancer journey alone. To prevent more than four million cancer deaths by 2047 and to improve the experience of people who are touched by cancer," it said.</p>

<p>The Indian Cancer Genome Atlas (ICGA) is aimed at transforming cancer research and treatment for the Indian population. Historically, cancer treatments in India have been based on western data sets. However, cancers in Indian patients can differ significantly at the molecular level.</p>

<p>The ICGA's mission is to create Indian-specific datasets to help researchers and clinicians develop personalised treatment protocols. This new open-access portal represents a monumental step in revolutionising cancer research, specifically for Indian patients.</p>

<p>Currently, the platform consists of data from 50 breast cancer patients, with plans to expand to over 500 patients in the coming year. Experts suggest that in 2022, India reported 1.92 lakh cases of breast cancer, constituting 26.6 per cent of all cancer cases, along with 98,337 deaths, accounting for 13.7 per cent of all cancer-related fatalities.</p>

<p>The Indian Cancer Genome Atlas (ICGA) is a national initiative focused on mapping cancers across India, supported by a foundation formed by over 50 clinicians, researchers, and data analysts. Its mission is to enhance cancer diagnosis and treatment for Indian patients and contribute to the global understanding of cancer biology.</p>

<p>The open access dataset will drive transformative breakthroughs in cancer treatment, said professor Shekhar C Mande, former Director General, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and currently senior professor at Savitribai Phule Pune University.</p>

<p>"Making this invaluable cancer data publicly accessible marks a pivotal step in accelerating scientific discoveries and enhancing patient outcomes. By openly sharing this data, we are empowering researchers, clinicians, and innovators to collaborate, explore new frontiers, and drive transformative breakthroughs in cancer treatment," Mr Mande said.</p>

<p>India uniquely has a high burden of cancers related to the digestive system; oral and lung cancer, mostly related to tobacco use; cervical cancer is increasing and breast cancer are all on the rise.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has arrived in the United States for his three-day official visit during which he will hold several bilateral meetings and attend the strategic Quad summit. He is also scheduled to attend the the 'Summit of the Future' at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi's visit will start with a bilateral meeting between the United States and India, where he and Joe Biden will discuss several key issues in an effort to further strengthen India-US ties.</p>

<p>Several key agreements are likely to be signed during the bilateral meet. A multi-billion dollar deal in which India plans to acquire 31 predator drones from the US will also be discussed.</p>

<p>An announcement may be made about the India-US space collaboration, under which Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla will be travelling to the International Space Station as part of the Axiom-4 mission.</p>

<p>After the bilateral, PM Modi will attend the Quad summit with Mr Biden, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. White House Spokesperson John Kirby has said China will be high on the agenda.</p>

<p>"In fact, it would be irresponsible if they didn't talk about the challenges that still exist in the region caused by aggressive People's Republic of China military action... for instance, unfair trade practices, tensions over the Taiwan Strait... I have no doubt that that all those issues will come up," Mr Kirby said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi told Barack Obama in 2014 that the size of the then-US president's car was almost as big as the house his mother lived in, helping the two leaders with humble origins make a deeper connection, India's Ambassador to the United States Vinay Kwatra has said.</p>

<p>Mr Kwatra, a former foreign secretary, told 'Modi Story', a social media handle which chronicles anecdotal accounts related to the prime minister, that the heartfelt conversation between the two leaders occurred as they headed together for the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial after formal discussions.</p>

<p>As they sat together in Mr Obama's stretch limousine for the 10-12 minute drive, their conversation turned to family, he noted.</p>

<p>In a friendly exchange, Mr Obama asked about Prime Minister Modi's mother.</p>

<p>With a smile, the prime minister gave a candid and unexpected response: "President Obama, you might not believe this, but the size of your car is almost the size of the house my mother lives in," Kwatra, who was present as a translator, recalled.</p>

<p>The car the two leaders were travelling in was a stretch limousine.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi's statement, Mr Kwatra said, surprised the US president.</p>

<p>This candid revelation offered him a glimpse into Modi's modest upbringing and straightforwardness.</p>

<p>Mr Kwatra said the conversation became a point of deeper connection between the two leaders as both had risen from humble beginnings to the highest offices in their respective nations.</p>

<p>It was Prime Minister Modi's first visit to the country after becoming prime minister the same year.</p>

<p>His mother lived in their old home in Gujarat till she passed away in 2022.</p>

<p>Officials highlighted Prime Minister Modi's ability to connect with world leaders, including US presidents, and forge deeper bonds, noting that he connects with them at a personal level, drawing on his own life experiences to bridge cultural and geopolitical differences.</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, Prime Minister Modi embarked on a three-day visit to the US to attend a summit of the Quad grouping and address a key conclave at the United Nations.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Palestinians said an Israeli strike killed at least 22 people in a school sheltering displaced people in southern Gaza City on Saturday, while the Israeli military said the attack targeted a command centre of Hamas.</p>

<p>The Gaza health ministry said most of those killed were women and children. The Hamas-run government media office said 13 children and six women were among the dead.</p>

<p>The military said it hit a Hamas command centre embedded in the compound that previously served as a school, repeating an accusation that the group uses civilian facilities for military purposes. Hamas denies that.</p>

<p>Reuters footage from the site showed blasted walls, wrecked and burnt furniture, and holes in the ceiling of one room as people tried to salvage what they could of belongings.</p>

<p>"The women and their children were sitting in the playground of the school, the kids were playing, and suddenly two rockets hit them," said one witness Said Al-Malahi.</p>

<p>Some of the dead were wrapped in blankets and carried away on donkey carts, as ambulances transferred other bodies.</p>

<p>"I couldn't take it, I did not see a single man that is injured, it was all women and children, let the Arab countries rejoice, let them rejoice and clap for (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu and the United States of America," said another eyewitness, Ahmed Azzam, bitter that regional neighbours were not taking a tougher line against Israel.</p>

<p><strong>MEDICS KILLED</strong></p>

<p>In Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, the Gaza health ministry said four health workers were killed by an Israeli strike that hit ministry warehouses. Ambulance crews could not reach the dead or treat the wounded, it added.</p>

<p>In a statement, the Israeli military said forces, operating in Rafah since May, have killed dozens of operatives in recent weeks and dismantled military infrastructure and tunnel shafts.</p>

<p>Israel's demand to keep control of the southern border line between Rafah and Egypt has been a major sticking point in international efforts to conclude a ceasefire deal.</p>

<p>Hamas says it is focused on an agreement to end the war and get Israeli forces out of Gaza, while Israel says the war can only end once Hamas is eradicated. Another sticking point has been the specifics of an exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.</p>

<p>This war in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on Oct. 7 when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent assault on the enclave has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry, and displaced nearly the entire 2.3 million-strong population.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A California couple's two-month heartbreak over their lost cat has ended in a joyous reunion. Benny and Susanne Anguiano were reunited with their beloved feline, Rayne Beau, last month after he was found 800 miles (1,287 km) away in Roseville, California.</p>

<p>They had been camping in Yellowstone National Park in June when Rayne Beau was frightened by something in the woods and ran into the trees. They looked for it fruitlessly for 60 days, leaving out treats and toys recognisable to their pet, with no result.</p>

<p>"We had to leave without him," Susanne Anguiano told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ksbw.com/article/salinas-cat-travels-1000-miles-home-california-lost-yellowstone/62251513"><em>KSBW Action News 8.</em></a> "That was the hardest day because I felt like I was abandoning him."</p>

<p>But just when things were the worst, things took a dramatic turn when an animal welfare group contacted them, saying that Rayne Beau has been found in Roseville, California, 800 miles from Yellowstone.</p>

<p>The reunion was huge for the couple, as they were extremely happy to meet their pet, for whom they had already lost all hope.</p>

<p>"He was really depleted," said Susanne. "He probably didn't have a lot of energy to even go further."</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ksbw.com/article/salinas-cat-travels-1000-miles-home-california-lost-yellowstone/62251513"><em>news portal</em></a>, still, the couple does not know how their cat, in two months, was able to get from Yellowstone to Roseville, which is over 800 miles away. Now, they hope someone will see their story and recognize Rayne Beau.</p>

<p>"Hey, I remember that cat, and like we saw it here, we saw it there or even they took it in," said Benny.</p>

<p>The couple also wants to encourage other pet owners to take precautions, such as microchips or a global tracker, to protect their animals.</p>

<p>"Definitely microchip your cat or your pet and register the microchip online," said Susanne. "We would have never gotten them back had that not happened."</p>

<p>With Rayne Beau back home, reunited with his siblings and safe, they hope to take their cats back on trips again, but only when everyone is ready for it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's visit to India, New Delhi and Berlin have decided to shore up cooperation in the areas of renewable energy, urban development, agroecology and mobility.</p>

<p>Ways to expand engagement in these key areas figured prominently at the development policy negotiations led by India's Department for Economic Affairs and Germany's Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, German officials said on Saturday.</p>

<p>Both sides agreed to continue their cooperation in the areas of renewable energy, urban development, mobility and agroecology in the coming years, they said.</p>

<p>The Indo-German cooperation is strategically guided by the "Partnership for Green and Sustainable Development", which was established in 2022 following talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Scholz.</p>

<p>The German chancellor is scheduled to visit India next month.</p>

<p>"Germany and India share a long-standing, trusting and strategic partnership," said Barbara Schafer, the head of the German delegation at the talks.</p>

<p>"This has been further demonstrated in 2024 by both sides. With the launch of the 'India-Germany Platform for Investments in Renewable Energy Worldwide'," she said.</p>

<p>The new initiative was launched on September 16 during the fourth RE-Invest in Gujarat's Gandhinagar.</p>

<p>"With our commitments this year, Germany has made it clear that it reliably fulfils its international obligations," Schafer explained.</p>

<p>The German official said it is important not only to make commitments but also to achieve concrete results.</p>

<p>"We have already succeeded in many areas in our partnership with India -- through Indo-German cooperation, 7,700 kilometres of modern transmission lines have been built and with German (co-)financing, metros in Mumbai, Surat and Ahmedabad have been constructed," she said.</p>

<p>"Germany supports Indian farmers in making their agricultural production more climate-resilient, resource-efficient and sustainable. Additionally, we are working on triangular projects in Peru and various African countries to leverage our respective strengths there," Schafer added.</p>

<p>The German side said these developments create favourable conditions for the upcoming Indo-German government consultations at the level of Prime Minister Modi and Chancellor Scholz, scheduled for October.</p>

<p>"The term 'sustainable energy transition' takes on a new quality when Germany and India combine their unique capabilities, setting a positive example not only in their own countries but also globally," said Uwe Gehlen, Head of the German Development Cooperation in India and Minister Counsellor at the German Embassy.</p>

<p>This year, Germany has allocated more than Euros 1 billion for initiatives in these areas, in the form of concessional loans and technical cooperation (capacity building), according to a German readout.</p>

<p>The funds are earmarked for projects in the following sectors -- renewable energy, transmission lines or energy distribution, urban development, mobility, forest ecosystems, water, sustainable and resilient agriculture, agroecology, vocational education and cooperation with the National Mission for Clean Ganga, it said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The White House today met with a group of Sikhs who are sympathisers for the Khalistan movement This is the first time ever that they have officially engaged with such groups. The White House has also assured them "protection from any transnational aggression on its soil".</p>

<p>The White House said it is committed to "protecting American Citizens" from harm while they are within the borders of the United States.</p>

<p>This development comes amid concerns that Canada and the US are giving shelter and asylum to Khalistani separatists.</p>

<p>Groups aligned to the Khalistan separatist movement are banned in India and several of these organisations have carried out terrorist activities in the last few decades.</p>

<p>While the US has not made any official comment on "giving shelter" to such elements, Canada had called it their "freedom of speech".</p>

<p>In response, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had said, "India respects and practices freedom of speech, but freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom to support separatism. It does not equate with freedom to threaten foreign diplomats or allow political space to elements advocating violence."</p>

</div>

<p>"In any rules-based society, you would imagine that you would check people's background, how they came, what passports they carried etc," he had said.</p>

<p>"If you have people whose presence there was itself on very dubious documents, what does it say about you? It actually says that your vote-bank actually is more powerful than your rule of law," Mr Jaishankar had said.</p>

<h2><strong>THE WHITE HOUSE MEETING</strong></h2>

<p>The meeting at White House took place hours before PM Modi is to land in the US to attend the Quad summit in Delaware and to address the 'Summit of the Future' event at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.</p>

<p>The meeting was held within the official White House complex and was attended by Pritpal Singh of the American Sikh Caucus Committee and representatives from the Sikh Coalition and Sikh American Legal Defence and Education Fund (SALDEF).</p>

<p>"Yesterday we had the chance to thank senior federal government officials for saving the lives of Sikh Americans and for vigilance in protecting our community. We asked them to do more, and we will hold them to their assurances that they will," Pritpal Singh, founder of the American Sikh Caucus Committee told Press Trust of India.</p>

</div>

<p>In a social media post on X, Pritpal Singh thanked the US officials for their vigilance in protecting Sikh Americans."</p>

<p>"We will hold them to their assurances to do more to safeguard our community. Freedom and justice must prevail," he said.</p>

<p>This is the first time that the US National Security Council has held a meeting with Sikh separatists. No other details of the meeting are available yet.</p>

<p>What comes as a surprise is that the meeting was initiated by the White House.</p>

<h3><strong>US BRINGS NEW BILL</strong></h3>

<p>Earlier this week, US Congressman Adam Schiff introduced the 'Transnational Repression Reporting Act 2024' which requires the Attorney General, in coordination with other relevant federal agencies, to report cases of transnational repression against people in the United States.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">

</div>

<p>"Through this bill, Congress sends a strong message to both allies and adversaries that violating the constitutional rights of Americans will not be tolerated," said Sikh group SALDEF which has openly supported Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar and has blamed India for his killing.</p>

<h3><strong>KHALISTANI TERRORIST GURPATWANT SINGH PANNUN</strong></h3>

<p>Gurpatwant Singh Pannun is a designated Khalistani terrorist. He was born and raised in Khankot village on the outskirts of Amritsar.</p>

<p>Pannun has claimed responsibility for several terror incidents in India. In April 2023, in a video shared on social media, he openly threatened to harm Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to Assam.</p>

</div>

<p>He founded the Khalistan separatist group SFJ in 2007. India banned the SFJ in 2019 under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act or UAPA for its anti-India activities. In 2020, Pannun was designated a terrorist.</p>

<p>Pannun holds a dual citizenship of the United States and Canada and is currently in the US. His banned separatist organisation operates out of New York.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been accused by Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov of "remotely disabling" his Cybertruck, which was outfitted with a machine gun and sent to the frontline of Russia's war in Ukraine.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been accused by Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov of “remotely disabling” his Cybertruck, which was outfitted with a machine gun and sent to the frontline of Russia's war in Ukraine.</p>

<p dir="ltr">On Thursday, Kadyrov claimed in a post on Telegram that the vehicle was “performing well in combat,” but later it shut down. This was followed by another post on Friday wherein he stated that two more Tesla Cybertrucks have been sent to the frontline.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Kadyrov, known for his active involvement in Russia's military operations in neighbouring Ukraine, claimed that the high-tech vehicle had to be towed from the battlefield as it was "remotely" switched off, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/20/business/chechnya-kadyrov-musk-tesla-cybertruck-disabled/index.html">CNN </a>reported.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"What Elon Musk did was not nice. He gives expensive gifts from the heart and then remotely switches them off," Kadyrov wrote in Russian.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Kadyrov, the head of the Chechen Republic, said that the Cybertruck was sent to the Northern Military District. While it “coped well” in the combat missions, later it was towed after getting turned off, as per a<a href="http://https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40968441/russian-presidents-ally-ramzan-kadyrov-says-elon-musk-remotely-turned-off-his-cybertruck-in-russia"> Benzinga </a>report.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In another post on Friday, he informed that two more Cybertrucks were sent to the "SVO (Ukraine war) zone”. This time, Kadyrov also shared a video of the two Cybertrucks in a forested area, with each of them armed with mounted machine guns. The video features men in military uniforms in the truckbeds.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Kadyrov further claimed that the "remote shutdown" did not affected the two other vehicles, which are "operating normally, without any failures."</p>

<p dir="ltr">"You couldn't ask for better advertising for the Cybertruck," he added.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This comes after the Chechen warlord shared a video of himself driving a Cybertruck in August this year and said that it was a “gift” from Elon Musk. In that video, he was seen driving the vehicle in Grozny, the capital of Chechnya. He even thanked Musk for the Cybertruck and asserted that it will soon be sent to the front.</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, the Tesla CEO denied sending the vehicle to Kadyrov and replied to an X user, "Are you seriously so retarded that you think I donated a Cybertruck to a Russian general? That's amazing."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Musk&nbsp; though did not clarify how Kadyrov gained access to the vehicle, which is reported limited to sales within the US so far.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Both Tesla as well as Musk are yet to respond to Ramzan Kadyrov's latest claims.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The fully electric Tesla Cybertruck was unveiled by Musk in Los Angeles in 2019, with its retail prices starting at around $90,000.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran unveiled a new ballistic missile and an upgraded one-way attack drone at a military parade on Saturday, state media said, amid soaring regional tensions and allegations of arming Russia. Iran stands accused by Western governments of supplying both drones and missiles to Russia for use in its war with Ukraine, a charge it has repeatedly denied.</p>

<p>The solid-fuel Jihad missile was designed and manufactured by the aerospace arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guards and has an operational range of 1,000 kilometres (more than 600 miles), state news agency IRNA said.</p>

<p>The Shahed-136B drone is an upgraded version of the Shahed-136, with new features and an operational range of more than 4,000 kilometres (2,500 miles), it added.</p>

<p>New President Masoud Pezeshkian attended the annual parade in Tehran, commemorating the 1980-88 war with Saddam Hussein's Iraq.</p>

<p>"Today, our defensive and deterrent capabilities have grown so much that no demon even thinks about any aggression towards our dear Iran," he said.</p>

<p>"With unity and cohesion among Islamic countries... we can put in its place the bloodthirsty, genocidal usurper Israel, which shows no mercy to anyone, women or children, old or young."</p>

<p>The Middle East has been in turmoil since Iran-backed Palestinian group Hamas attacked Israel on October 7 sparking war in Gaza and drawing in Iranian allies around the region.</p>

<p>The tensions have intensified in recent days as the focus of Israel's firepower has shifted north to the Lebanon border where its troops have been battling the Iran-backed group Hezbollah.</p>

<p>An Israeli air strike on Hezbollah's Beirut stronghold killed 16 members of its elite Radwan Force on Friday, a source close to the group said, hot on the heels of deadly sabotage attacks on the group's communications earlier this week.</p>

<p>Britain, France, Germany, and the United States slapped new sanctions on Iran earlier this month, alleging that it had been providing ballistic missiles for Russia's war effort in Ukraine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 65-year-old man has been arrested in Rome over the "horrific, frenzied" 1977 murder of two women in their home in Melbourne, Australian police said Saturday. The bodies of Suzanne Armstrong, 27, and Susan Bartlett, 28, were discovered at their house in Easey Street, Melbourne, on January 13, 1977, with multiple stab wounds.</p>

<p>Armstrong had been raped. Her then 16-month-old son was found unharmed in his cot.</p>

<p>The women had last been seen alive three days earlier.</p>

<p>"It was an absolutely gruesome, horrific, frenzied homicide -- multiple stabbings," Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton told a news conference.</p>

<p>He described the 47-year-old crime, known as the Easey Street murders, as the state's longest and most serious cold case.</p>

<p>The suspect, a dual Greek-Australian citizen, had been living in Greece where he was protected by the country's statute of limitations, Patton said.</p>

<p>Police waited for him to leave the country, the chief commissioner added, and he was finally arrested Thursday in the Italian capital's Fiumicino airport under an Interpol red notice.</p>

<p>Australia will launch extradition procedures, he said.</p>

<p>Police had been helped by "technological advances" over the years, Patton said.</p>

<p>In 2017, they offered an Aus$1 million (US$680,000) reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction, he said, after new information had come to light.</p>

<p>He declined to give more details of the investigation.</p>

<p>A report in Melbourne's The Age newspaper, which police did not confirm, said police had decided to check the DNA of all 131 people named in the original police file.</p>

<p>The suspect was on that list and had agreed to undergo a DNA test but instead fled to Greece in 2017, the paper reported.</p>

<p>He was linked to the crime by the DNA of a close relative, it said.</p>

<p>According to The Age, the suspect had been stopped and searched on the night of the murders by local police who found a large knife on him -- three days before the bodies were discovered.</p>

<p>It is "understood" that the man -- then a teenager -- was not interviewed about the killings at the time as police focused on other suspects, the paper said.</p>

<p>A detective senior sergeant running the investigation since 2015 broke the news of the suspect's arrest to the victims' families on Saturday morning, Patton said.</p>

<p>The families were "emotional, speechless, overwhelmed, but appreciative that they hadn't been forgotten", he said.</p>

<p>"There is simply no expiry date on crimes that are as brutal as this. I think that is borne out here today."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A polar bear that made a rare appearance outside a cottage in a remote Icelandic village was shot by police after being deemed a threat to local residents. The bear was killed on September 19 in northwest Iceland after consultation with the Environment Agency, which opted against relocating the animal</p>

<p>“It's not something we like to do,” Westfjords police chief Helgi Jensson was quoted as saying by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/polar-bear-shot-iceland-policy-greenland-ice-0d3badd4b7f5e320d992ce7f0dc600fd">AP,</a> adding that the bear was very close to a summer house. “There was an old woman in there.” The woman, who was alone at the time, locked herself upstairs in fear as the bear rummaged through her garbage. She contacted her daughter in Reykjavik for assistance via satellite link.</p>

<p>“She stayed there,” Jensson said, adding that other summer residents had already left the area. “She knew the danger.”</p>

<p>Polar bears are not native to Iceland but sometimes drift ashore from Greenland on ice floes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bear shot on September 19 was the first sighted in Iceland since 2016, with only 600 recorded sightings since the ninth century. The bear, estimated to weigh between 150 and 200 kilograms, will be taken to the Icelandic Institute of Natural History for further study, said the report. Scientists plan to examine the bear for parasites and infections, assess its organ health and body fat percentage, and potentially preserve its pelt and skull for the institute's collection.</p>

<p>Although polar bears are a protected species in the country, authorities may take lethal action if they pose a threat to humans or livestock, according to the AP report.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While attacks on humans by polar bears are extremely rare, a study published in the <a href="https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wsb.783">Wildlife Society Bulletin in 2017 </a>said that the loss of sea ice due to climate change has led to more hungry bears venturing onto land, raising the risk of human encounters. The study revealed that from 1870 to 2014, there were 73 documented attacks by wild polar bears across the five polar bear Range States — Canada, Greenland, Norway, Russia and the United States — leading to 20 fatalities and 63 injuries among humans.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">An Indian-origin H-1B visa holder, diagnosed with terminal blood cancer, has reached out on social media seeking advice to secure his family's future.&nbsp;The man resides in the US with his wife (on a dependent H-4 visa) and their US-born daughter. He has sought help on the Facebook group ‘SOS Global Indians USA Solutions &amp; Networking For Indians In US' as an anonymous user.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“I have been diagnosed with blood cancer and have 6 months left. I am here on H1B, living with my wife (dependent visa) and a daughter born in the US. Is there any chance that they could continue living here after I am gone and not have to move to India? Want to have a future for them here,” he wrote.</p>

<p dir="ltr">A primary concern for him&nbsp;is how his wife can continue to stay and work in the US after his death. Many users in the group responded with support.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In an interaction with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/indianorigin-cancer-patient-seeks-h-1b-guidance-have-6-months-left-expert-weighs-in-101726819333130.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">Hindustan Times</a>, Indian-American visa podcaster Rahul Menon offered potential ways for the wife to remain in the US.</p>

<p dir="ltr">One option is for her to switch to her own H-1B visa, although this is limited to a filing window in April and requires finding an employer willing to sponsor her, which can be difficult given the high number of applicants.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Another possibility is applying for a cap-exempt H-1B visa through nonprofit organisations, but this limits her job opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Mr Menon also suggested that the wife could start a degree programme and apply for an F-1 student visa. This option may place additional financial strain as F-1 visas do not permit supplemental income.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The meeting of the Quad - a grouping of India, the US, Australia and Japan- comes at an important time amid an escalation between Israel and Hezbollah and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>Prime Minister Narendra Modi will land in Philadelphia around 10 am local time (7.30 pm IST) and then head to US President Joe Biden's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, where the two leaders will hold bilateral discussions. Apart from the relationship between the two countries, PM Modi's visits to Russia and Ukraine and a possible peace process are also likely to be discussed.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>An announcement may be made about the India-US space collaboration, under which Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla will be travelling to the International Space Station as part of the Axiom-4 mission. A multi-billion dollar deal in which India plans to acquire 31 predator drones from the US will also be discussed, but it is not clear whether the announcement will happen during the PM's visit.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>After the bilateral, PM Modi will attend the Quad summit with Mr Biden, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. White House Spokesperson John Kirby has said China will be high on the agenda. "In fact, it would be irresponsible if they didn't talk about the challenges that still exist in the region caused by aggressive People's Republic of China military action... for instance, unfair trade practices, tensions over the Taiwan Strait... I have no doubt that that all those issues will come up," he has said.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>On Day 2 of his visit, Prime Minister Modi will address a gathering of the Indian community in New York and interact with CEOs of leading companies. Collaboration in cutting-edge areas of artificial intelligence, quantum computing biotechnology and semiconductors will be discussed.</li>
	<li>Day 3 will see the Prime Minister addressing the 'Summit of the Future' at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on September 23. The theme of the summit is 'Multilateral Solutions for a Better Tomorrow' and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called it a 'once in a generation UN Summit'.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>PM Modi is also likely to hold bilateral discussions with some other world leaders on the sidelines of the UN summit.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Former US president Donald Trump, locked in a close contest with Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the presidential polls in November, has said he will be meeting Prime Minister Modi, whom he called "a fantastic man". The foreign ministry has not, however, confirmed that the meeting will take place.</li>
	<li>In his departure statement, PM Modi said, "I look forward to joining my colleagues President Biden, Prime Minister Albanese and Prime Minister Kishida for the Quad Summit. The forum has emerged as a key group of like-minded countries to work for peace, progress and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region."&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The PM said his bilateral with President Biden will allow the two leaders to identify new pathways to further deepen the India-US partnership. Stressing the importance of the UN summit, he said, "The Summit of the Future is an opportunity for the global community to chart the road ahead for the betterment of humanity. I will share the views of one-sixth of humanity as their stakes in a peaceful and secure future are among the highest in the world."</li>
	<li>The PM also said he was looking forward to engaging with the Indian community in the US as well as important American business leaders, who are "key stakeholders and provide vibrancy to the unique partnership between the largest and the oldest democracies of the world."</li>

       <description><![CDATA[Olivia Nuzzi, a political reporter for the New York Magazine, recently admitted to her editors that she was engaged in a relationship with former US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Olivia Nuzzi, a political reporter for the New York Magazine, has been placed on leave as a “third-party review” is being conducted after the disclosure of her personal relationship with former US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Nuzzi, the Washington correspondent of the magazine, recently admitted to her editors that she was engaged in a relationship “with a former subject relevant to the 2024 campaign while she was reporting on the campaign,” according to a statement by the news outlet on Thursday.</p>

<p dir="ltr">It also said Nuzzi, who has written extensive long-form pieces about US politics, including RFK Jr, violated the magazine's standards around disclosing conflicts of interests</p>

<p dir="ltr">The magazine stated that after reviewing her work, it did not find any "inaccuracies nor evidence of bias,” adding that she is "currently on leave from the magazine, and the magazine is conducting a more thorough third-party review”.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In a note to the staff members, David Haskell, the editor of New York magazine, stated that Olivia Nuzzi opened up about her relationship a few days ago, stating that it started in December 2023 and came to an end in August.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In a statement to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/business/media/olivia-nuzzi-rfk-jr.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">The New York Times</a>, Olivia Nuzzi said that “some communication between myself and a former reporting subject turned personal”.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“The relationship was never physical but should have been disclosed to prevent the appearance of a conflict. I deeply regret not doing so immediately and apologize to those I've disappointed, especially my colleagues at New York," she said.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Who is Olivia Nuzzi?</strong></h3>

<p dir="ltr">Born on January 6, 1993, in New York City, Olivia Nuzzi grew up in Middletown Township, New Jersey.</p>

<p dir="ltr">After completing her graduation from Middletown High School South, she went on to attend Fordham University. However, she reportedly dropped out of it after getting a full-time offer from The Daily Beast in 2014.</p>

<p dir="ltr">At the age of 20, Nuzzi interned for Anthony Weiner's New York City mayoral campaign. During the same time, she was hired by NSFWcorp as a staff writer and wrote about her experiences in a blog post.</p>

<p dir="ltr">While working for The Daily Beast she covered the presidential campaigns of Chris Christie and Rand Paul, besides former US president Donald Trump's ascent into politics.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Politico had in 2016 named her as one of the "16 Breakout Media Stars", while Forbes mentioned her in its "30 Under 30" list in 2018.</p>

<p dir="ltr">She was hired as the Washington correspondent for New York magazine in February 2017. In November last year, she worked on a profile of Kennedy, besides writing other features.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Olivia Nuzzi got engaged to Politico's chief Washington correspondent Ryan Lizza in 2022.</p>

<p dir="ltr">After Nuzzi's alleged relationship with Kennedy, Lizza in a note to readers said, "Because of my connection to this story through my ex-fiancee, my editors and I have agreed that I won't be involved in any coverage of Kennedy in Playbook or elsewhere at POLITICO".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's arrival in the US for the Quad Summit, US President Joe Biden hosted Australian PM Anthony Albanese for a one-on-one meeting at his Delaware house on Friday.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">PM Modi will attend the weekend summit with the Quad group– Australia, US and Japan. He is on a three-day visit to the US, the first after securing a third consecutive term.</p>

<p dir="ltr">US President Biden has opted for his hometown of Wilmington–around 170 kilometres from Washington– to host the farewell summit for Quad leaders.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Post the one-on-one meeting with Albanese at his property on Friday night, Biden will now welcome the PM Modi as well as Japanese PM Fumio Kishida at his house on Saturday, AFP reported.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Thereafter, he will host an "intimate" dinner as well and a full four-way summit at his former high school in the city, the report added.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Quad summit will be the last major event of Biden's presidency as the 81-year-old opted out from the November 5 US presidential elections against former president Donald Trump, handing the Democratic campaign reins to US Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p dir="ltr">US Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said this will be the first time when Biden will host foreign leaders in his hometown as President, adding that it is "a reflection of his deep personal relationships with each of the Quad Leaders".</p>

<p dir="ltr">The White House noted that Kamala Harris is not expected to attend the meeting.</p>

<p dir="ltr">During their Friday meeting, Biden and Albanese discussed diplomacy with China, besides sharing concerns about the country's "coercive and destabilising activities," an official statement said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Over the years, the US President has heavily pushed the Quad grouping, which was formed in 2007 as part of the emphasis on international alliances, the report stated.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>What's on PM Modi's agenda?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">In the US, apart from the Quad summit, PM Modi will address the 'Summit of the Future' at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York, besides holding a roundtable with CEOs of major American firms that are working in the tech sector.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Taking about the Quad Summit, PM Modi in his departure statement on Saturday said, "The forum has emerged as a key group of like-minded countries to work for peace, progress and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region."</p>

<p dir="ltr">He noted that his meeting his Biden will allow them to review and identify new pathways for further deepening the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership for the benefit of the people and global good.</p>

<p dir="ltr">India will be hosting the next Quad Summit in 2025.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The morning sunlight bouncing off her sleek hide, Moo Deng the pygmy hippo plops to the ground in her enclosure, seemingly unfazed by her rapid rise to social media stardom.

<p>Her cheeky expressions and playful frolicking racked up millions of views and have lured thousands of visitors wanting to witness her antics.</p>

<p>Moo Deng -- whose name in Thai means "bouncy pork", a popular snack -- is now an unwitting poster child for the endangered pygmy hippo.</p>

<p>The fame has not gone to Moo Deng's head, as she sticks close to her mother, sharing a meal of carrots, bananas, corn and runner beans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Native to West Africa, the pygmy hippo is threatened by human activities, such as logging, mining and poaching, and there are only 2,000 to 2,500 left in the world, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p>

<p>Hundreds of visitors queued at the zoo for five minutes in the enclosure.</p>

<p>One group said they woke up at 5:00 am to make the two-hour drive from Bangkok to see the celebrity.</p>

<p>A visitor said she hoped more Thais would come and "post about Moo Deng online so that more people will come to see her".</p>

<p>Moo Deng's caretaker and social media manager Atthapon Nundee, 31, said the rise of short-form videos has turbocharged the pygmi hippo's fame and hopes it will be a boon for biodiversity preservation.</p>

<p>"With more and more images of pygmy hippos online, more people fell in love with them. They are poached in the wild, so with more people caring about them, it might prevent their poaching," he told AFP.</p>

<p>A 2022 study published by the Royal Society of Canada's Academy of Science shows that social media can play both positive and negative roles in wildlife conservation.</p>

<p>Public attention may help raise awareness about endangered wildlife but can increase the risk of species exploitation as more people try to come in contact with them.</p>

<p>Zoo management says the extra earnings from skyrocketing visitor numbers -- almost double over the weekend -- will go towards improving the pygmy hippo enclosure and the zoo's public awareness campaigns.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Cristiana Barsony-Arcidiacono, a 49-year-old Hungarian-Italian businesswoman, has found herself at the centre of international headlines following the explosion of pagers that killed 12 people and wounded over 2,000.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She is the CEO of Hungary-based BAC Consulting, which&nbsp;was revealed to have licensed the design for the pagers from their original Taiwanese manufacturer Gold Apollo. Cristiana Barsony-Arcidiacono has denied direct involvement in the manufacture of the pagers. In a brief interview with <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/taiwan-firm-denies-making-pagers-used-lebanon-explosions-rcna171594">NBC News</a>, she said, “I am just the intermediate. I think you got it wrong.”</p>

<p>Here are a few details about Cristiana Barsony-Arcidiacono:&nbsp;</p>

<p>–&nbsp;Cristiana Barsony-Arcidiacono grew up near the port city of Catania in Itay's Sicily region. She attended school nearby was has been described as a reserved youngster by her then-schoolmates.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">– Cristiana Barsony-Arcidiacono holds a PhD in particle physics from University College London. Her dissertation was on the sub-atomic particle positron.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">– She has worked across various fields, from humanitarian work in Africa to claims of involvement in scientific and international organisations. However, many of her alleged senior roles, including as a project manager at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and board member of New York's Earth Child Institute, have been debunked. The IAEA confirmed she was merely an intern, and the Earth Child Institute stated she had no formal role there.</p>

<p dir="ltr">–&nbsp;Described as intelligent but erratic by former colleagues, Barsony-Arcidiacono's career spans multiple continents and industries. She is believed to speak as many as 7 languages. She has held numerous short-term jobs, including one in Tunisia, where her contract was terminated early after being described as a “bullying” manager.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">– In the aftermath of the pager explosions, Barsony-Arcidiacono's mother revealed that her daughter is under the protection of Hungarian secret services due to threats she has received. This has only deepened the mystery surrounding her.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

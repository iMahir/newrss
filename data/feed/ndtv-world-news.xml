       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli troops tied a wounded Palestinian man to a military vehicle during a raid in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin, the army said Sunday, admitting that soldiers had violated operational procedures.</p>

<p>Footage of the incident, which occurred on Saturday, has gone viral and shows a Jenin resident strapped horizontally to the bonnet of a military jeep as it passes through a narrow alley.</p>

<p>The military said the Palestinian was wounded during a "counterterrorism operation" launched to apprehend wanted suspects.</p>

<p>During an exchange of fire between troops and militants, one of the suspects was wounded and apprehended, the military said in a statement.</p>

<p>"In violation of orders and standard operating procedures, the suspect was taken by the forces while tied on top of a vehicle," the statement said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The conduct of the forces in the video of the incident does not conform to the values of the IDF (military)," it added.</p>

<p>"The incident will be investigated and dealt with accordingly," the military said, adding that the wounded man was transferred to the Palestinian Red Crescent for treatment.</p>

<p>Jenin has long been a stronghold for Palestinian groups, and the Israeli army routinely carries out raids in the city and adjacent refugee camp.</p>

<p>Violence in the West Bank, which had already surged before the Israel-Hamas war broke out on October 7, has only escalated since.</p>

<p>At least 549 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank by Israeli troops or settlers since the Gaza war broke out, according to Palestinian officials.</p>

<p>Attacks by Palestinians have killed at least 14 Israelis in the West Bank over the same period, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>The Gaza Strip has been gripped by more than eight months of war since Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Militants took 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 41 the army says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's military offensive on Gaza has since killed at least 37,551 people, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a shocking incident that took place in Pakistan's Swat, a mob allegedly tortured a man to death by burning him alive over alleged desecration of the Holy Quran.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, police have arrested 27 suspects including two brothers, ARY News reported on Sunday.</p>

<p>The incident occurred on June 20 in Madyan, a town in the Swat district, a popular tourist spot located 340 km from the capital city of Islamabad.</p>

<p>According to Swat District Police Officer (DPO) Zahidullah Khan, the police had moved the suspect of the alleged desecration incident to the police station but a charged mob "attacked the police station and took the suspect away".</p>

<p>"People set fire to the police station and a mobile vehicle," the DPO said, adding that the suspect was "torched".</p>

<p>Videos making the rounds on social media show a mob circling a body on fire in the middle of the road, along with a large number of people outside a police station. Dawn.com's correspondent has reached out to the police for confirmation of the footage, Dawn reported.</p>

<p>DPO Khan said a heavy police force was deployed in Madyan and was trying to control the tense situation.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the police teams are conducting raids for more arrests in the Madyan incident.</p>

<p>Earlier, Federal Minister Ahsan Iqbal condemned the lynching incident in Swat and called to stop this 'street justice'.</p>

<p>Ahsan Iqbal during the budget debate in the National Assembly, called the incident horrific.</p>

<p>Ahsan said that parliament had to take stern notice of "mob justice", as it had brought Pakistan "to the brink of destruction".</p>

<p>"We must take notice of this incident. We have now reached to a point where religion being used to justify mob violence and street justice, flagrantly violating the Constitution, the law and the state," he lamented.</p>

<p>At least 2,120 people are reported to have been accused of committing blasphemy between 1987 and 2022, as per Dawn.</p>

<p>Last month, police saved a Christian man from enraged people in Sargodha on allegations of desecration of the Holy Quran, He died nine days later due to his injuries.</p>

<p>In 2022, a middle-aged man was stoned to death by a mob over alleged desecration in a remote village of Khanewal district.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Former President Donald Trump told evangelical voters they needed to boost their turnout at the polls as he sought in a pair of Saturday campaign events to shore up - and expand - his base.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former President Donald Trump told evangelical voters they needed to boost their turnout at the polls as he sought in a pair of Saturday campaign events to shore up - and expand - his base.</p>

<p>Trump spoke Saturday afternoon to the Faith and Freedom Coalition conference in Washington, a gathering of evangelical conservatives who have provided a bedrock of support for his three presidential bids. Later, the presumptive Republican presidential held a rally in North Philadelphia as part of his effort to make inroads with Black voters in the pivotal swing state of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Trump told his supporters that to defeat President Joe Biden, he needed them "to turn out in the largest numbers ever."</p>

<p>"The evangelicals and Christians, they don't vote as much as they should, I don't know if you know that," Trump said. "They go to church every Sunday, but they don't vote."</p>

<p>Trump went on to complain that gun-rights activists also didn't vote in high enough numbers, and said ballot drop-off boxes should be placed inside of churches.</p>

<p>"You got to get out, just this time," Trump continued. "I don't care in four years - you don't have to vote, OK? In four years, don't vote, I don't care."</p>

<p>Trump received a hero's welcome from the organization, founded by conservative activist Ralph Reed, despite a presidency during which he took little action on many of the group's key priorities, from combating same-sex marriage to ending the legalization of medical marijuana.</p>

<p>Still, Trump's push to appoint Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade - along with his embrace of culture-war clashes - have cemented his appeal with evangelicals and his standing as the leader of the Republican Party.</p>

<p>Trump's occasionally chiding effort to convert the enthusiasm at the Washington event into votes at the ballot box underscored the extent his hopes for a second term rely on motivating dedicated supporters. Polls show wide swaths of moderate swing voters disappointed with both candidates and considering third-party options or disinclined to vote.</p>

<p>"I think it's sort of a protest. You're so angry about what's happening," Trump said. "Do you know the power you'd have if you would vote?"</p>

<p>Even as Trump's political operation focuses on turning out dedicated conservatives, he's also seeking to appeal to Black and Latino voters - who have traditionally supported Democratic presidential candidates - but have felt the brunt of post-pandemic inflation. Trump's rally at Temple University in Philadelphia came just days after a visit to a Black church in Detroit.</p>

<p>"We will also work to lift up Black, Hispanic and other communities in Philadelphia and all across the United States," Trump said.</p>

<p>Polls show Biden's standing among minority voters has softened, possibly providing an opening to Trump and Republicans who hope to draw just enough support to win close battleground states.</p>

<p>Trump's efforts have been complicated by his frequent descriptions of cities with large Black populations as crime-ridden and failing, as he did last week while discussing Milwaukee, which will host the Republican National Convention, with GOP lawmakers.</p>

<p>In Philadelphia, Trump lamented that "convenience stores are closing down left and right" and described statistics showing the city's murder rate falling substantially as "fake news." As of April, homicides in Philadelphia were down by more than a third compared to the prior year.</p>

<p>Trump also flashed his propensity for controversy at both stops, telling attendees that he had pitched Dana White, the head of Ultimate Fighting Championship, on an event that would pit the champion of his league against a competing "migrant league of fighters."</p>

<p>Trump has regularly highlighted instances of undocumented migrants committing violent crime and warned immigrants were "poisoning the blood of our country," while critics - including Biden - have argued the rhetoric is racially coded.</p>

<p>"I think the migrant guy might win," Trump said. "That's how tough they are. He didn't like that idea too much, but actually not the worst idea I've ever had."</p>

<p>Biden won Pennsylvania in 2020, and his hopes of carrying the state in November's rematch with Trump will hinge in part on his ability to turn out Black voters and hold on to working-class voters in the state. A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll in May found Trump leads Biden 48% to 46% in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The state has become a focal point for his reelection bid. According to an internal memo from the Trump allied super-PAC, Make America Great Again Inc., the group has and will continue to center its efforts and funding across Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>More broadly, Biden has also struggled to sell blue-collar workers, important in states including Michigan, on his economic agenda.</p>

<p>Trump has been ramping up his campaigning after becoming the first former president convicted of a felony, in his New York hush-money trial. He has also managed to use the conviction to boost his war chest, with the campaign raising $141 million in May, surpassing the $85 million Biden raised that month.</p>

<p>Trump's visit to Washington on Saturday is his second this month. Last week, he returned to Capitol Hill for the first time since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol by supporters looking to block certification of the 2020 election, meeting with House and Senate Republicans.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a few days, AI chip juggernaut Nvidia sat on the throne as the world's biggest company, but behind its staggering success are questions on whether new entrants can stake a claim to the artificial intelligence bonanza.</p>

<p>Nvidia, which makes the processors that are the only option to train generative AI's large language models, is now Big Tech's newest member and its stock market takeoff has lifted the whole sector.</p>

<p>Even tech's second rung on Wall Street has ridden on Nvidia's coattails with Oracle, Broadcom, HP and a spate of others seeing their stock valuations surge, despite sometimes shaky earnings.</p>

<p>Amid the champagne popping, startups seeking the attention of Silicon Valley venture capitalists are being asked to innovate -- but without a clear indication of where the next chapter of AI will be written.</p>

<p>When it comes to generative AI, doubts persist on what exactly will be left for companies that are not existing model makers, a field dominated by Microsoft-backed OpenAI, Google and Anthropic.</p>

<p>Most agree that competing with them head-on could be a fool's errand.</p>

<p>"I don't think that there's a great opportunity to start a foundational AI company at this point in time," said Mike Myer, founder and CEO of tech firm Quiq, at the Collision technology conference in Toronto.</p>

<p>Some have tried to build applications that use or mimic the powers of the existing big models, but this is being slapped down by Silicon Valley's biggest players.</p>

<p>"What I find disturbing is that people are not differentiating between those applications which are roadkill for the models as they progress in their capabilities, and those that are really adding value and will be here 10 years from now," said venture capital veteran Vinod Khosla.</p>

<p>- 'Won't keep up' -</p>

<p>The tough-talking Khosla is one of OpenAI's earliest investors.</p>

<p>"Grammarly won't keep up," Khosla predicted of the spelling and grammar checking app, and others similar to it.</p>

<p>He said these companies, which put only a "thin wrapper" around what the AI models can offer, are doomed.</p>

<p>One of the fields ripe for the taking is chip design, Khosla said, with AI demanding ever more specialized processors that provide highly specific powers.</p>

<p>"If you look across the chip history, we really have for the most part focused on more general chips," Rebecca Parsons, CTO at tech consultancy Thoughtworks, told AFP.</p>

<p>Providing more specialized processing for the many demands of AI is an opportunity seized by Groq, a hot startup that has built chips for the deployment of AI as opposed to its training, or inference -- the specialty of Nvidia's world-dominating GPUs.</p>

<p>Groq CEO Jonathan Ross told AFP that Nvidia won't be the best at everything, even if they are uncontested for generative AI training.</p>

<p>"Nvidia and (its CEO) Jensen Huang are like Michael Jordan... the greatest of all time in basketball. But inference is baseball, and we try and forget the time where Michael Jordan tried to play baseball and wasn't very good at it," he said.</p>

<p>Another opportunity will come from highly specialized AI that will provide expertise and know-how based on proprietary data which won't be co-opted by voracious big tech.</p>

<p>"Open AI and Google aren't going to build a structural engineer. They're not going to build products like a primary care doctor or a mental health therapist," said Khosla.</p>

<p>Profiting from highly specialized data is the basis of Cohere, another of Silicon Valley's hottest startups that pitches specifically-made models to businesses that are skittish about AI veering out of their control.</p>

<p>"Enterprises are skeptical of technology, and they're risk-averse, and so we need to win their trust and to prove to them that there's a way to adopt this technology that's reliable, trustworthy and secure," Cohere CEO Aidan Gomez told AFP.</p>

<p>When he was just 20 and working at Google, Gomez co-authored the seminal paper "Attention Is All You Need," which introduced Transformer, the architecture behind popular large language models like OpenAI's GPT-4.</p>

<p>The company has received funding from Nvidia and Salesforce Ventures and is valued in the billions of dollars.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla and Neuralink CEO Elon Musk had another child with one of his employees earlier this year, reports suggest. Mr Musk and Shivon Zilis, head of Neuralink's special projects, had a third child together earlier this year, Bloomberg reported. The two already share a pair of twins who were born in 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tech billionaire has also filed a petition to change the children's names to "have their father's last name and contain their mother's last name as part of their middle name."</p>

<p>Mr Musk has 11 living children who are publicly known: five with his first wife author Justine Musk, three with the musician Grimes, and three with Ms Zilis. He has said that the world faces an underpopulation crisis and people with high IQs should procreate."</p>

<p>"If people don't have more children, civilization is going to crumble. Mark my words,” he had said in 2021, the same year he had twins with Ms Zilis with one of his employees.</p>

<p>Mr Zilis has said Mr Musk encouraged her to have children and later offered to be the sperm donor. “I can't possibly think of genes I would prefer for my children,” Zilis is quoted as saying in “Elon Musk,” a biography by author Walter Isaacson.</p>

<p>On Thursday, he reposted a chart that claims Europe is suffering from a “fertility crisis,” saying “civilization may end with a bang or with a whimper (in adult diapers)".&nbsp;</p>

<p>A recent Wall Street Journal report claimed that a woman, who resigned from SpaceX in 2013, alleged that Mr Musk had asked her to have his babies, on multiple occasions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The report also stated that the SpaceX CEO, who is accused of having sexual relationships with two of his employees, including an intern, had also exposed himself to a flight attendant in 2016 and offered to buy her a horse in exchange for sex acts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a terrifying incident, a US tourist from New Mexico was killed by an elephant in Zambia after it attacked her vehicle during a safari drive on Wednesday. Officials reported that the elephant pulled Juliana Gle Tourneau, 64, out of&nbsp;the vehicle and trampled her, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/06/21/elephant-toss-us-tourist-trample-dead-zambia-21083502/">Metro</a></em> reported. The incident occurred near the Maramba Cultural Bridge in Livingstone when the group had stopped due to traffic caused by an elephant herd.</p>

<p>She was taken to a clinic in Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park, where she was declared dead on arrival. According to a police statement, her injuries included deep wounds on the right shoulder blade and forehead, a fractured left ankle, and a slightly depressed chest.</p>

<p>Ms Tourneau died around 5.50 pm ''after being knocked from a parked vehicle which had stopped due to traffic caused by elephants around the Maramba Cultural Bridge'', Southern Province Police Commissioner Auxensio Daka told Zambian station&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1123915438722352">ZNBC</a></em>&nbsp;on Friday.</p>

<p>Officials did not say whether anyone else was injured or what led to the elephant's aggression.</p>

<p>This tragic event marks the second fatal elephant attack on a US tourist in Zambia this year. In March, Gail Mattson, a 79-year-old woman from Minnesota, was killed in a similar incident during a game drive in Zambia's Kafue National Park. An elephant charged and overturned the truck, resulting in her death and injuries to five others.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In response to these incidents, Zambian authorities have urged tourists to exercise extreme caution while observing wildlife. Similar concerns have been raised in neighbouring countries like Zimbabwe and Botswana, which have also reported increasing elephant populations and deadly attacks in recent years.</p>

<p>According to experts, human deaths are rare in encounters with elephants. ''This is a freak accident. It's probably just some sort of coming together of unfortunate circumstances that led to this,'' Nikhil Advani, a senior director at the World Wildlife Fund, a nonprofit that works on environmental protection and conservation efforts told the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/22/world/africa/us-tourist-killed-elephant-zambia.html">New York Times.&nbsp;</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump, vying to return to the top post in elections due this year, has softened his stand on immigration with a new proposal that will benefit Indian and other foreign students.</p>

<p>The Republican leader known for his staunch remarks against immigrants has promised that if he's elected, foreign students who graduate from US colleges will automatically get Green Card, which allows permanent residency in the US.</p>

<p>Trump said these students become multibillionaires after they return to their home countries like India and China after graduating from US colleges. He sought to replicate the same in the US.</p>

<p>The US presidential elections due in November is expected to see a second edition of President Joe Biden versus Donald Trump, in which immigration and deportation of illegal immigrants are among the key issues for voters.</p>

<p>Trump had earlier this year branded illegal immigrants "animals, not human" at an election campaign. He, however, said in a recent podcast that he always supported a merit-based legal immigration system.</p>

<p>He said in the "All-In" podcast that he plans to offer Green Cards automatically as part of a diploma to students who graduate from a US college, which will help them continue their stay in the country.</p>

<p>The podcast was hosted by Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis, David Sacks, and David Friedberg - all venture capitalists, three of whom are immigrants.</p>

<p>Speaking in the podcast, Trump recalled "stories where people graduated from a top college or from a college, and they desperately wanted to stay here, they had a plan for a company, a concept, and they can't - they go back to India, they go back to China, they do the same basic company in those places...and they become multi-billionaires employing thousands and thousands of people, and it could have been done here."</p>

<p>A Green Card is an identity document for permanent residency in the United States.</p>

<p>The former president further lamented that "we lose people from Harvard, MIT, from the greatest schools".</p>

<p>He also reiterated his first-term policy of foreign students getting a Green Card after receiving a higher education degree in the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) field.</p>

<p>"Anybody graduates from a college, you go in there for two years or four years, if you graduate or you get a doctorate degree from a college, you should be able to stay in this country," Trump said.</p>

<p>"We force the brilliant people, the people that graduate from college, the people that are number one in their class from the best colleges, you have to be able to recruit these people and keep the people," the former president asserted.</p>

<p>He said some graduates at the top of the class can't even make a deal with the company because they don't think they will be able to stay in the country, but that is "going to end one day".</p>

<p>Trump's recent remarks were in contrast to the immigration policies of his administration when he was in power, which included restrictions on green cards and visas.</p>

<p>The US has over a million foreign students studying in colleges there, as of the 2022-23 academic year, and this figure can only be expected to rise.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thirteen people have been arrested following a forest fire on the Greek island of Hydra, which authorities believe was started by fireworks launched from a yacht. The fire, which started on Friday, devastated the island's sole pine forest. Although now under control, the fire presented significant challenges for firefighters who had to access the area by sea and use helicopters to drop water due to the lack of roads leading to the beach.</p>

<p>Hydra, southwest of Athens in the Saronic Gulf, is popular among foreign visitors and those travelling on yachts.</p>

<p>The latest blaze was ''caused by fireworks launched from a boat and burned the only pine forest on the island in a place that is difficult to access and has no road'', Hydra's firefighting team said on Facebook.</p>

<p>In a statement on Saturday, Greek authorities confirmed the arrest of 13 Greek citizens who are scheduled to appear before prosecutors on Sunday. An&nbsp;official said the people were arrested at an Athens area marina.</p>

<p>The incident has caused widespread outrage in Greece, which is already grappling with multiple wildfires amidst its first heatwave of the year. The country has been on high alert for wildfires due to dry conditions, strong winds, and high temperatures, which are expected to persist throughout the summer. Officials say 64 forest and brush fires have broken out in Greece over the past 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hydra's mayor, Giorgos Koukoudakis, expressed anger over the reckless actions that led to the fire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are indignant that some people so irresponsibly throw fireworks into a pine forest," Hydra's mayor, Giorgos Koukoudakis, told Greek broadcaster ERT.</p>

<p>In a related incident, a 55-year-old volunteer firefighter succumbed to injuries sustained while combating a fire in the Ilia region of the Peloponnese peninsula.</p>

<p>Scientists have warned that fossil fuel emissions caused by humans are worsening the length and intensity of heat waves around the world.</p>

<p>Additionally, arson remains a significant problem, with 79 people arrested for arson last August. To combat this, Greece increased penalties for both deliberate and negligent arson last year, introducing fines of up to 200,000 Euro and jail sentences of up to 20 years​</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's military could isolate Taiwan, cripple its economy, and compel the democratic island to submit to Beijing's Communist Party without firing a shot, CNN reported citing a Washington think tank.</p>

<p>Concerns about the Communist Party's intentions to take control of Taiwan, potentially by force, have intensified due to Chinese leader Xi Jinping's increasingly aggressive stance towards the self-governed island. China's refusal to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine has further fueled these fears.</p>

<p>According to CNN, analysts and military strategists said that there are two key options available to China - a full-scale invasion or a military blockade.</p>

<p>However, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington highlights a third option: quarantine. This method, using "gray zone" tactics, involves actions just below the threshold of war. The China Coast Guard, its maritime militia, and various police and maritime safety agencies could enforce a full or partial quarantine of Taiwan, potentially cutting off access to its ports and essential supplies, such as energy, for the island's 23 million people.</p>

<p>The People's Liberation Army (PLA) might play only auxiliary and support roles, according to CSIS authors Bonny Lin, Brian Hart, Matthew Funaiole, Samantha Lu, and Truly Tinsley.</p>

<p>"China has significantly increased pressure on Taiwan in recent years, stoking fears that tensions could erupt into outright conflict. Much attention has been paid to the threat of an invasion, but Beijing has options besides invading to coerce, punish, or annex Taiwan," the report says.</p>

<p>Recently, China's Minister of National Defence Admiral Dong Jun warned "external forces" for emboldening Taiwan Independence separatists in an attempt to contain China with Taiwan and said that these malicious intentions are dragging Taiwan into a dangerous situation."</p>

<p>He said that anyone who dares to separate Taiwan from China will "end up in self-destruction."He accused the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities of pursuing Taiwan's separation in an incremental manner and added that they are bent on erasing the Chinese identity of Taiwan.</p>

<p>Since September 2020, China has intensified its use of gray zone tactics by increasing the number of military aircraft and naval ships that operate near Taiwan's territory.Gray zone tactics are called "an effort or series of efforts beyond steady-state deterrence and assurance that attempts to achieve one's security objectives without resort to direct and sizable use of force," according to Taiwan News.</p>

<p>This latest incident adds to a series of similar provocations by China in recent months. China has increased its military activities around Taiwan, including regular air and naval incursions into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ).</p>

<p>Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China, has long been a contentious issue in China's foreign policy. China continues to assert its sovereignty over Taiwan and considers it a part of its territory and insists on eventual reunification, by force if necessary.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taiwan's annual war games this year will be as close as possible to actual combat, no longer just putting on a show to score points but aiming to simulate real fighting given a rapidly rising "enemy threat" from China, a senior official said.</p>

<p>China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its territory, has been staging regular exercises around the island for four years to pressure Taipei to accept Beijing's claim of sovereignty, despite Taiwan's strong objections.</p>

<p>Taiwan starts its five-day Han Kuang exercises on July 22.</p>

<p>A senior Taiwan defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity to be able to speak more freely, said there was an urgent need to rethink how the drills were conducted.</p>

<p>"In recent years, the enemy threat has changed rapidly," the official said. "Our defence combat plan must also be continuously revised on a rolling basis, and the urgency of comprehensive combat training is becoming more and more important."</p>

<p>Elements that were mostly for show, like rehearsal drills, have been cancelled, while this year there will be nighttime exercises and, unusually, the capital Taipei will be included too, the official said.</p>

<p>"It's not about scoring points," the official said. "We want the soldiers to wonder whether this is for real."</p>

<p>Things may go wrong, like vehicle breakdowns, and that is fine, the official added. "These are problems that may be faced in actual combat."</p>

<p>The exercises will be a continuous experience, the official said. "War does not distinguish between night and day."</p>

<p>China's defence ministry did not answer calls seeking comment about the exercises outside of office hours at the weekend. It has previously said it is futile for Taiwan to think it can use arms to prevent "reunification".</p>

<p>Announcing the drills in April, Taiwan's defence ministry said the war games would practice "kill" zones at sea to break a blockade and simulate a scenario where China suddenly turns one of its regular drills around the island into an attack.</p>

<p>"Only with real-time, on-the-ground verification can we truly understand the capabilities and limitations of our troops," the official said.</p>

<p>China held two days of its own war games around the island shortly after President Lai Ching-te took office last month, saying it was "punishment" for his inauguration speech, which Beijing denounced as being full of separatist content.</p>

<p>But China has also been using grey zone warfare against Taiwan, wielding irregular tactics to exhaust a foe by keeping them continually on alert without resorting to open combat. This includes sending balloons over the island and almost daily air force missions into the skies near Taiwan.</p>

<p>China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. Lai, who says only the Taiwanese people can decide their future, has repeatedly offered talks but been rebuffed.</p>

<p>The official declined to comment on which parts of the war games Lai would attend, as is customary for the president as commander-in-chief, or whether there would be U.S. observers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Italian island of Capri lifted a ban on tourists Saturday after problems with the water supply to the holiday hotspot were resolved.</p>

<p>Capri's mayor, Paolo Falco, said the ban was "revoked" after a technical issue preventing the arrival of water from the mainland was fixed.</p>

<p>The ban was announced early Saturday, forcing several morning ferries on their way to the island from Naples and Sorrento in southern Italy to return to port.</p>

<p>In justifying the ban, Falco warned of "a real emergency" and said that while there was still water on most of the island on Friday, local tanks early Saturday were "running out".</p>

<p>"The emergency would be worsened by the arrival of the thousands of tourists who arrive on Capri daily," he said.</p>

<p>Locals, not targeted by the ban, were permitted to collect up to 25 litres (6.6 gallons) of drinking water per household from a supply tanker.</p>

<p>Capri, in the Bay of Naples, is famed for its white villas, cove-studded coastline and upscale hotels. It has around 13,000 permanent residents but attracts huge numbers of day-trippers in summer months.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One person was killed and seven others were injured in a shooting outside a nightclub in Louisville, Kentucky, on Saturday (local time), CNN reported, citing police.</p>

<p>First responders found two people injured with gunshot wounds when they reached the spot outside H20 Lounge at 12:47 am (local time), according to the Louisville Police Metro Department's statement. Later, one of the victims, a man, was pronounced dead.</p>

<p>The police said the second person was taken to hospital with critical, life-threatening injuries. Later, medical staff reported that another six victims, all adults, reached area hospitals for treatment after the shooting.</p>

<p>According to Aaron Ellis, a public information officer with the police department, all six people were shot. The police said, "Those injuries are believed to be non-life threatening."</p>

<p>The police did not mention any information about the suspect and it's unclear how many people opened fire or what caused the shooting.</p>

<p>Police said, "The relationship of the victims, if any, is not known at this time," adding that the shooting remains under investigation.</p>

<p>In a separate incident, three people were killed and ten others were injured in a shooting incident at a grocery store in Fordyce, Arkansas on Friday (local time), authorities said in a news conference, CNN reported.</p>

<p>The Arkansas State Police reported that the incident occurred at the Mad Butcher grocery store around 11:30 am local time, CNN reported.</p>

<p>Mike Hagar, Secretary of Public Safety and Director of Arkansas State Police, said that law enforcement swiftly responded to the scene and engaged in a confrontation with the "lone suspect" exchanging gunfire. Both officers and the suspect sustained injuries, but none are believed to be life-threatening.</p>

<p>In the past few weeks, the US has witnessed several shooting incidents, with at least 21 other mass shootings recorded by the Gun Violence Archive since last Friday. According to CNN report, the Gun Violence Archive, regards mass shootings as ones in which four or more people are shot, excluding the shooter.</p>

<p>The US-British coalition has not commented on the airstrikes yet, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, the UK Maritime Trade Operations agency said it received a report of an incident 126 nautical miles east of Yemen's Aden.</p>

<p>The Houthi group, which controls much of northern Yemen, began in November last year to launch anti-ship ballistic missiles and drones targeting what they said were Israeli-linked ships transiting the Red Sea, to show solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US president Donald Trump urged evangelical Christians Saturday to vote en masse for him in November, vowing to "aggressively" protect their religious freedom if he is elected.</p>

<p>The ex-leader, who rarely appears in church himself, has built a crucial base among the religious right, promising -- and delivering -- on some of their biggest priorities, including by appointing Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the federal right to abortion.</p>

<p>"The evangelicals and the Christians, they don't vote as much as they should," Trump told hundreds of supporters at a Washington conference put on by the Faith and Freedom Coalition, a conservative advocacy group.</p>

<p>"They go to church every Sunday, but they don't vote," he said, adding in a half-joke that "in four years, you don't have to vote. Okay? In four years, don't vote. I don't care."</p>

<p>Trump would be ineligible to run for president in 2028 because of term limits.</p>

<p>Evangelical voters were crucial for Trump's 2016 victory and again in his failed 2020 campaign, when 84 percent of white evangelical Protestants voted for him, according to the Pew Research Center.</p>

<p>Trump promised to protect their interests Saturday, as he vowed to "aggressively defend religious freedom."</p>

<p>"We will protect Christians in our schools, in our military, in our government, in our workplaces, in our hospitals and in our public square," he told supporters.</p>

<p>He additionally promised to create "a new federal task force on fighting anti-Christian bias" that would investigate supposed "illegal discrimination, harassment, persecution" of US Christians.</p>

<p>Almost half (49 percent) of Americans believe that religion's influence is declining in the United States and that this is a bad thing, according to a Pew Research survey published last month.</p>

<p>The number of Americans identifying as Christian has dropped from nearly 90 percent in the 1990s to less than two-thirds of the population in 2022, mostly due to rising numbers of people who are not religiously affiliated.</p>

<p>For many white evangelical Christians -- a conservative denomination that makes up about 14 percent of US voters -- it is crucial that religion stays relevant in public life.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A senior British minister compared the latest scandal involving Tory candidates accused of betting on the election date to Partygate, a series of Covid-era parties that brought down Boris Johnson.</p>

<p>Housing minister Michael Gove compared the betting allegations to the Partygate scandal in an interview with the Times newspaper on Saturday.</p>

<p>"It looks like one rule for them and one rule for us... That's the most potentially damaging thing," said Gove, who is standing down this election after 14 years as an MP.</p>

<p>"That was damaging at the time of Partygate and is damaging here", he added.</p>

<p>Prime minister Johnson was forced from office in 2022 following public anger at the revelations of parties held in Downing Street when the rest of the country was under lockdown during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Now another senior Conservative Party figure has been caught up in the latest scandal.</p>

<p>The party's chief data officer, Nick Mason, has taken a leave of absence, following claims he placed bets on the timing of the election, the PA news agency reported Saturday.</p>

<p>Mason is being investigated by betting regulators, accused of placing dozens of bets on the election date according to the Times. He is the fourth Tory figure to be implicated in the affair.</p>

<h3><strong>'Incredibly damaging'</strong></h3>

<p>The party's campaign director stepped aside following reports on Thursday that he and his wife, a Tory candidate in the July 4 election, were under investigation by the Gambling Commission.</p>

<p>The scandal broke a week earlier, when Tory candidate and Sunak's ministerial aide Craig Williams said he was being probed for staking a bet on the snap election date before it was called.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, London police said one of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's security detail had been arrested for allegedly placing a bet on the date.</p>

<p>Sunak has said he is "incredibly angry" over the revelations.</p>

<p>"If anyone is found to have broken the rules, not only should they face the full consequences of the law, I will make sure that they are booted out of the Conservative Party," he said earlier this week.</p>

<p>Political bets are allowed in the UK, including on the date of elections, but using insider knowledge to do so is against the law.</p>

<p>The inquiries heap further misery on Sunak, whose party has trailed Labour by about 20 points in the polls for nearly two years, making it odds-on to be dumped out of office after 14 years.</p>

<p>Gove said that those involved in the betting scandal were "sucking the oxygen out of the campaign".</p>

<p>Comparing it to Partygate again, he added: "A few individuals end up creating an incredibly damaging atmosphere for the party.</p>

<p>"So it's both bad in itself, but also destructive to the efforts of all of those good people who are currently fighting hard for the Conservative vote."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A senior Red Cross official in Gaza on Saturday told reporters of the horrific scenes after an Israeli strike in the Gaza Strip.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A senior Red Cross official in Gaza on Saturday told reporters of the horrific scenes after an Israeli strike in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>It was around 3:30 pm when three explosions rocked the walls of the Red Cross compound in Gaza on Friday, William Schomburg, the local chief for the ICRC told reporters in Geneva via video link.</p>

<p>Then came the "flood of wounded people" seeking help, said the international charity's chief in Rafah.</p>

<p>"There were piles of dead bodies, blood everywhere," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Twenty-two people were killed in shelling that lightly damaged the outside walls of the compound where the Red Cross has been operating.</p>

<p>It is located just south of a humanitarian zone identified by the Israeli army in the Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>"All of our buildings are very well known to all parties to the conflict," Schomburg said.</p>

<p>Refusing to speculate on the source of the shelling, he said: "We're not here to lay blame.</p>

<p>"But of course, this incident is one of several near misses that we have had... and we as the ICRC cannot operate like this."</p>

<h3><strong>'Pools of blood'</strong></h3>

<p>Many of the wounded were taken by ambulance to a nearby Red Cross field hospital for operations. Some did not survive.</p>

<p>No Red Cross employees were killed, Schomburg said, but two children of staff members required treatment for injuries sustained in the blasts.</p>

<p>It is not the first time Red Cross facilities have been damaged during the more than eight months of fighting between Israel and Hamas militants who control the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Schomburg said that recovering from the trauma of Friday's strike would not be easy.</p>

<p>"Around the compound on the street, there were pools of blood, there were bodies strewn across the ground," he said.</p>

<p>"We literally found body parts scattered in different areas, including within the compound.</p>

<p>"Frankly, it's like nothing I've ever seen before. The scale of the suffering in such a short period of time was really very shocking for the team."</p>

<h3><strong>'Overwhelming' fear</strong></h3>

<p>The shelling came as Israel has stepped up its strikes in the Gaza Strip since war broke out after the October 7 attack by Hamas, which resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>The militants also seized hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza although the army says 41 are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,551 people, also mostly civilians, Gaza's health ministry said on Saturday.</p>

<p>An Israel Defense Forces statement on Saturday said an initial inquiry found "there was no direct attack carried out by the IDF against a Red Cross facility".</p>

<p>But the incident was still under review and "findings will be presented to our international partners".</p>

<p>The Red Cross office is surrounded by a camp where several families of ICRC staff members live in tents. Schomburg said it was a "miracle" that none were severely injured.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nonetheless "there was an overwhelming sense of fear amongst people that were clearly panicked and very desperate with nowhere to go", he added.</p>

<p>Thousands of displaced Palestinians have been sheltering in tents in the coastal Al-Mawasi area since the outbreak of the fighting, prompting the recognition of the humanitarian zone by Israeli authorities.</p>

<p>"Our office here in Rafah, like all of our buildings and facilities, are all marked with the Red Cross emblem and are known by all parties," Schomburg said.</p>

<p>"So how to explain the strikes we experienced yesterday? I think you will have to ask the parties involved in this conflict, and not us."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yemen's Houthis said early on Sunday that they had conducted a joint military operation with the Islamic Resistance in Iraq militant group, targeting four ships at Israel's northern Haifa port.</p>

<p>The Houthi military spokesperson, Yahya Saree, said in a televised statement that the two groups launched a drone attack on two cement tankers and two cargo ships at the Haifa port on Saturday.</p>

<p>He said the ships belonged to companies that "violated the ban on entering the ports of occupied Palestine".</p>

<p>The Israeli military did not immediately comment, though it had previously denied a similar claim by the Houthis early this month.</p>

<p>Saree also said the Houthis had attacked the Shorthorn Express in the Mediterranean using drones as part of the group's campaign to disrupt shipping in key waterways, which they say is an act of solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.</p>

<p>"The two operations successfully achieved their objectives, and the strikes were precise and direct," Saree said.</p>

<p>There was no independent confirmation of strikes, and Reuters could not verify the claims.</p>

<p>The Iran-aligned Houthis first launched drone and missile strikes in shipping lanes in November. In dozens of attacks, they have sunk two vessels, seized another and killed at least three seafarers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An official from Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservative Party is being investigated by Britain's gambling regulator over allegations he placed bets on the date of the general election before it was announced, the Sunday Times reported.</p>

<p>Britain's Gambling Commission has already been reported to be investigating two Conservative election candidates and the party's director of campaigning over bets on the date of the July 4 election.</p>

<p>The widening scandal has further damaged Sunak's attempts to catch the opposition Labour Party, which is far ahead in opinion polls in the run-up to the election.</p>

<p>The official was named by the paper as Nick Mason, chief data officer at the Conservative Party. Mason did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The newspaper cited a spokesperson for Mason as saying he denied any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>The Sunday Times cited a statement from the Conservative Party as saying Mason had taken a leave of absence. The party did not confirm this when contacted by Reuters.</p>

<p>"As instructed by the Gambling Commission, we are not permitted to discuss any matters related to any investigation with the subject or any other persons," a Conservative Party spokesman said.</p>

<p>The Gambling Commission has not confirmed the names of those under investigation. In a response to a request for comment on the Sunday Times report, a commission spokesperson said it would not provide details of its probe, including the identity of any individuals it is investigating.</p>

<p>Sunak said on Thursday he was "incredibly angry" to hear about the allegations against his party colleagues, calling them a "really serious matter."</p>

<p>One of the Conservative candidates named in the scandal, Craig Williams, has already apologised for an error of judgment, and the party's director of campaigning Tony Lee has taken a leave of absence.</p>

<p>A police officer working in a special protection unit has also been arrested over alleged bets on the election date.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yemen's armed Houthi group has said in a statement that it had launched ballistic missiles at the US aircraft carrier Eisenhower in northern Red Sea.</p>

<p>"The missile force in our armed forces carried out an operation targeting the American aircraft carrier Eisenhower in the northern Red Sea with several ballistic and cruise missiles, and the operation achieved its goals successfully," Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said on Saturday in a statement aired by Houthi-run al-Masirah TV.</p>

<p>However, there is currently no evidence to confirm that the aircraft carrier was indeed attacked, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>This is the second claimed attack by Houthis targeting the US aircraft carrier Eisenhower in the Red Sea in less than a month. The first attack against the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier was on May 31, in which the US military didn't comment.</p>

<p>Sarea said that the militant group also attacked the merchant vessel TRANSWORLD NAVIGATOR in the Arabian Sea with ballistic missiles, as a response to what Houthis called the vessel owner's violation of their entry ban to Israeli ports.</p>

<p>The statement threatened more such strikes "until the (Israeli) aggression stops and the siege on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted".</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, fighter jets of the US-British coalition conducted four airstrikes against Houthi targets northwest of Yemen's Red Sea port city of Hodeidah, according to the Houthi al-Masirah television.</p>

<p>Hours before the coalition airstrikes, the UK Maritime Trade Operations reported explosions in the vicinity of a merchant vessel 126 nautical miles east of Yemen's southern port city of Aden. There were no reports of casualties or damage.</p>

<p>The Houthi group, which controls much of northern Yemen, began in November last year to launch anti-ship ballistic missiles and drones targeting what they said were Israeli-linked ships transiting the Red Sea, to show solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>In response, the US-British naval coalition stationed in the waters has since January conducted air raids and missile strikes against Houthi targets to deter the group, but this only led to an expansion of Houthi attacks to include US and British commercial vessels and naval ships.<br />

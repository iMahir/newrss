       <description><![CDATA[The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that Covid-19 is making a comeback, with positive test rates increasing across 84 countries and the potential for more severe variants emerging.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you believe that Covid-19 is no longer a concern or that its impact has diminished, think again. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that the percentage of positive tests has been increasing across 84 countries in recent weeks.</p>

<p>The UN health agency is also warning that more severe variants of the coronavirus may soon be on the horizon.</p>

<p>"Covid-19 is still very much with us," and circulating in all countries, Dr Maria Van Kerkhove of WHO <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.unognewsroom.org/story/en/2284/covid-19-situation-update-who-06aug2024">told journalists in Geneva.</a></p>

<p>"Data from our sentinel-based surveillance system across 84 countries reports that the percent of positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 has been rising over several weeks," she said. "Overall, test positivity is above 10 per cent, but this fluctuates per region. In Europe, percent positivity is above 20 per cent," Dr Van Kerkhove added.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://fortune.com/well/article/covid-summer-surge-2024-symptoms-treatment-isolation-guidelines/"><em>Fortune Magazine,</em></a> the virus has spread far and wide this summer; President Joe Biden tested positive in July and, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), at least 40 athletes at the Paris Olympics have been infected with Covid or other respiratory illnesses.</p>

<p>As per a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.unognewsroom.org/story/en/2284/covid-19-situation-update-who-06aug2024"><em>WHO release</em></a>, new waves of infection have been registered in the Americas, Europe and Western Pacific. Wastewater surveillance suggests that the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 is two to 20 times higher than what is currently being reported. Such high infection circulation rates in the northern hemisphere's summer months are atypical for respiratory viruses, which tend to spread mostly in cold temperatures.</p>

<p>"In recent months, regardless of the season, many countries have experienced surges of Covid-19, including at the Olympics where at least 40 athletes have tested positive," Dr Van Kerkhove said.</p>

<p>"As individuals it is important to take measures to reduce risk of infection and severe disease, including ensuring that you have had a Covid-19 vaccination dose in the last 12 months, especially, if you are in an at-risk group," stressed Dr Van Kerkhove.</p>

<p>Vaccines availability has declined substantially over the last 12-18 months, WHO admits, because the number of producers of Covid-19 vaccines has recently decreased. "It is very difficult for them to maintain the pace," Dr Van Kerkhove explained. "And certainly, they don't need to maintain the pace that they had in 2021 and 2022. But let's be very clear, there is a market for Covid-19 vaccines that are out there."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Haifa's residents gaze warily on to the sprawling industrial port that flanks their Israeli city, knowing the potential for a major blast as they brace for bombardment from Hezbollah.</p>

<p>The historic city cascades down a steep hillside to the very edge of the port, a complex which contains Israel's biggest oil refinery, giant fuel tanks and other highly flammable targets.</p>

<p>Memories are vivid in Haifa, about 30 kilometres (less than 20 miles) from the Lebanese border, of the 2006 war with Hezbollah when the group's rockets repeatedly slammed into the city, reducing homes to rubble and leaving more than a dozen people dead.</p>

<p>Residents are also aware of the notorious Beirut port blast that killed more than 220 people, injured at least 6,500 and devastated large parts of the Lebanese capital in August 2020.</p>

<p>Haifa is now in the crosshairs once again with Iran and its proxies feared to be preparing an attack over last week's killings of top officials from Hezbollah and the Palestinian operative group Hamas.</p>

<p>"Of course, it's a main concern, especially after what we've seen happening four years ago in the harbour of Beirut," long-time resident Patrice Wolff told AFP, when asked about the potential for a big explosion.</p>

<p>"We know how damaging it can be, a blast from this area, so we are very conscious of it. And we certainly hope it will not come to be that bad."</p>

<h3><strong>'We are very exposed'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Haifa's Mount Carmel offers panoramic views across the city, port, Israeli coast and northern Israel, all the way up to the mountainous, disputed border.</p>

<p>However, the area has come under repeated drone attacks in recent days, increasing jitters in the frontline region.</p>

<p>The residents of Haifa, population 280,000, know the drill: if the air raid siren sounds, or is alerted via smartphone, they have one minute to reach a bomb shelter or secure area.</p>

<p>Wolff, 58, who works for a medical supplies company, sleeps with his phone next to him in case of an alert.</p>

<p>"We're all very conscious of the risk and we know what to do if things go astray. We have instructions from the civil defence on how to behave," he said.</p>

<p>"We certainly hope that it will not come to this extent but we are very exposed because we're in a straight line from Lebanon."</p>

<p>As tensions climb, the number of tourists to the laid-back, beachside city -- home to Jews, Muslims and Christians -- has plunged.</p>

<p>"There are fewer tourists now; there used to be a lot, but now there are fewer. Business is slow," said Nadia Abu-Shaker of Humus Abu Shaker, a popular restaurant close to the port.</p>

<p>"Many people are afraid and don't leave their homes, they don't go anywhere," she added.</p>

<p>However, the prospect of an attack does not faze Abu-Shaker, who lived through the 2006 Hezbollah strikes as well as 1991, when Iraqi missile fire hit her home.</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid. I live near the port, at the Abu Shaker restaurant. If there is a war, I'm not afraid because I know that God protects us," she said.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;<strong>'We don't trust them'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Many of Haifa's hotel rooms are occupied by evacuees from border areas, forced out of their homes by Hezbollah shelling since the Israel-Hamas war started in October.</p>

<p>The city has made careful preparations for an attack, opening bomb shelters with capacity for tens of thousands of people, according to Leonid Reznik, head of emergency preparedness at the Haifa municipality.</p>

<p>The shelters, many of which are converted underground car parks, can house people for days at a time and come equipped with generators, wifi, water and first aid, he said.</p>

<p>Kindergarten teachers will be deployed to the bigger shelters to keep young children occupied, Reznik added.</p>

<p>Haifa's main hospital, which received dead and wounded soldiers during the 2006 war with Lebanon, has a large underground facility that is already in use, he said.</p>

<p>"Because we're waiting for the response from the Iranians or Hezbollah, we understand that something will happen. They will not do nothing. They will respond in some way," Reznik said.</p>

<p>"We hope it will not be shooting into the city but we understand something will happen."</p>

<p>Reassurances that some of the most explosive chemicals have been removed from the port do not reassure Andre Suidan, whose wine shop overlooks the complex.</p>

<p>"We don't trust them. We don't trust that they did (move the chemicals)," said the Haifa native, 57, calling the refinery's presence "horrific".</p>

<p>"People are completely impatient and they're completely stressed out. These are not normal times," Suidan said.</p>

<p>"It's affecting people on the street, it's affecting people everywhere. Everybody's extra-tense."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US embassy in Mexico said on Friday that Joaquin Guzman Lopez, the son of the infamous cartel kingpin "El Chapo," had surrendered voluntarily while his father's former partner Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada seemed to have been taken against his will.</p>

<p>Both Zambada and Guzman Lopez have pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking charges in the United States and their lawyers offered contrasting versions of their arrests.</p>

<p>Zambada's lawyer said Guzman Lopez and six men in military uniforms "forcibly kidnapped" his client near the Sinaloa state capital of Culiacan and flew him to the United States against his will. The Guzman family lawyer denied a kidnapping and called it a voluntary surrender after extended negotiations.</p>

<p>The murky circumstances leading to the Sinaloa Cartel members' US arrest last month caused Mexico's president to reproach the Latin American nation's neighbour for lack of cooperation.</p>

<p>"No US resources were used in the surrender. It was not our plane, nor our pilot, nor our people," the embassy said in a statement.</p>

<p>It added that no flight plan had been shared with US authorities and the pilot was neither a U.S. citizen and nor had he been hired by the US government.</p>

<p>"This represents a great victory for both countries," the embassy said in the statement. "It is the result of a very precise work based on the principles of respect for our respective sovereignties and we do this work as partners.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Born in a poor village, Algerian boxer Imane Khelif has overcome numerous obstacles throughout her life to win a controversial Paris Olympics gold on Friday.</p>

<p>Sporting braided hair and standing strong at 1.79 metres (5ft 9in), the 25-year-old has unwittingly become one of the central figures of the Games.</p>

<p>Along with Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting, she was disqualified from last year's world championships after failing gender eligibility testing, only to be cleared to compete in the French capital.</p>

<p>Ms Khelif was born in a village 300 kilometres (180 miles) from the Algerian capital Algiers.</p>

<p>From a family of limited means, she spoke before the Games of the difficulty of her life in "a village of conservative people" in semi-desert surroundings.</p>

<p>"I came from a conservative family. Boxing is not a widely practised sport by women, especially in Algeria," she told Canal Algerie a month before the Games, smiling readily and her voice soft.</p>

<p>"It was difficult."</p>

<p>A strong athlete, she played football with the boys in her village of Biban Mesbah, but beating them in matches brought on brawls where she fought back with punches.</p>

</div>

<p>These fights ultimately led her to boxing, and on Friday one of the most contentious gold medals in recent memory.</p>

<p>In an interview with UNICEF, she said she used to sell scrap metal and her mother sold homemade couscous to pay for bus tickets to a nearby town.</p>

<p>Ms Imane's father Omar at first did not approve of her decision to pursue boxing, but he eventually became one of her biggest fans.</p>

<p>The unemployed welder previously told AFP that his daughter is "an example of the Algerian woman", praising also her dedication to training.</p>

<h2><strong>'Brave girl'</strong></h2>

<p>In 2022, Khelif told the Algerian news agency APS that she had considered giving up boxing "because my family did not accept the idea and because of how society looked at me, considering that I was doing something wrong".</p>

<p>"But all these barriers made me even stronger and were an extra motivation to achieve my dreams."</p>

<p>She also expressed her determination in an interview on the UNICEF website, where she said her "dream is to win a gold medal".</p>

<p>"If I win, mothers and fathers will be able to see how far their children can go," she said. "I want to inspire girls and children in Algeria."</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">

</div>

<p>Ms Khelif's international career took off with her participation at the Covid-delayed Tokyo Olympics in 2021, where she came fifth in her weight class.</p>

<p>In 2023 she made it to the semi-finals of the world championships in New Delhi.</p>

<p>But then she was disqualified following gender eligibility testing by the International Boxing Association, which is not recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is not running the sport in Paris.</p>

<p>She initially appealed but then withdrew her complaint, according to the IBA.</p>

<p>There is no suggestion that Ms Khelif identifies as anything other than a woman.</p>

<p>Her father showed identity documents and her birth certificate to AFP and, having been sceptical about her boxing career when she was young, hailed her as "a heroine".</p>

<p>"My child is a girl," Omar Khelif said. "She was raised as a girl. She is a strong girl -- I raised her to work and be brave."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paraguayan swimmer Luana Alonso who made headlines for her controversial departure from the Olympic Village wants to compete for the United States instead of her home country, a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/07/sports/2024-paris-olympics-paraguay-swimmer-luana-alonso-who-was-kicked-out-of-olympic-village-over-inappropriate-behavior-wanted-to-compete-for-team-usa/">report</a> said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Paraguayan outlet<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.hoy.com.py/espectaculos/farandula/2024/07/31/luana-alonso-yo-le-quiero-representar-mas-a-estados-unidos"> HOY</a>, 20-year-old Alonso had expressed her preference for representing the United States, citing her strong ties to the country where she attended college. "I want to represent the United States more," Alonso allegedly stated during a live video on social media before the Olympics.</p>

<p>Alonso swam for Southern Methodist University (SMU) after spending the 2021-2022 season at Virginia Tech University. The swimmer said that the more competitive environment in the US was a better fit for her aspirations.</p>

<p>Her Olympic journey was marred by controversy even before she entered the pool. Alonso qualified for the women's 100-metre butterfly event through the universality system. Despite this achievement, her relationship with the Paraguayan Olympic Committee (COP) and her teammates seemed fraught with tension.</p>

<p>During her social media video, Alonso did not hold back in criticising the COP's treatment of its athletes. She accused the committee of undermining her achievements and relying heavily on sponsors rather than providing adequate support. "They threaten me that they are going to publish a statement, that I am going to leave because of universality," she said, adding that the COP sought to humiliate her by downplaying her qualification. Alonso also voiced her frustration with the lack of support and trust from her Paraguayan teammates, claiming that it was "not a pleasure" to represent her country.</p>

<p>COP President Camilo Perez responded sharply to Alonso's comments, pointing out that her performance would not meet the rigorous standards required to qualify for the Olympics as part of Team USA. "There is no universality there. She came here as a Paraguayan. She has to train a lot more to represent the USA; her times have to be much better," Perez said.</p>

<p>The controversy escalated further when Alonso was reportedly expelled from the Olympic Village due to "inappropriate" conduct that allegedly included a trip to Disneyland and wearing revealing outfits that were deemed distracting to other athletes. In a statement, Alonso denied the claims about her removal, pushing back against the reports and maintaining that she had not been a disruption.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sajeeb Wazed Joy, son of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, has claimed that the recent protests in Bangladesh were likely instigated by a foreign intelligence agency, specifically suspecting the involvement of the ISI.</p>

<p>Speaking to ANI, he said that the unrest was driven by external forces rather than domestic issues and criticized how his mother's statement was distorted to fuel the protests.</p>

<p>"I now firmly believe this was instigated by a small group and most likely by a foreign intelligence agency. I strongly suspect the ISI.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There was no reason for the protests to continue because the quotas were not mandated by our government and were restored by a court ruling. Our government had lifted the quotas in 2018 or so when the first quota protests happened," he said.</p>

<p>He alleged that the protesters twisted Sheikh Hasina's statement on Razakars, which led to the escalation of the protests.</p>

<p>"When the protests started, they were peaceful. Our police provided security for the protesters. Then they took my mother's statement where she said that we don't want Razakars' families getting jobs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They took that statement and twisted it, saying that my mother said the protesters were Razakars. My mother never said that. But this was spread online. And then, in the middle of the night, some group--nobody knows who did that--marched through Dhaka University chanting, 'We are Razakars'. And that is what happened. The other students, especially Bangladesh Chhatra League, our student supporters, and the pro-liberation students, got angry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They attacked the protesters, and that is how the violence started," he said while adding, "The police tried to stop the violence, and in doing so, some police members used live ammunition, which they were not authorized to do. Our government never ordered anyone to attack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our government never ordered the police to use live ammunition. We immediately called our student leaders and said, 'Stop the fighting.' The fighting stopped. We immediately suspended the police officers who used excessive force."</p>

<p>He also questioned the presence of weapons among the protestors and emphasized that his mother, Sheikh Hasina, chose to leave her residence to prevent a potential massacre, prioritizing the lives of students.</p>

<p>"They increased the demand for the resignation of the government. And once they did that, they started attacking the police with firearms. Where did these weapons come into Bangladesh from? How did the students get weapons? So these weren't students. This was a mob. This was militancy that was instigated to try to overthrow a democratically elected government," he said.</p>

<p>"My mother left (even when) her security forces were heavily armed and prepared to guard the prime minister's residence. But if the protesters had marched in hundreds, they would have been killed. It would have been a massacre. And my mother did not want a massacre. That is why she left," he explained.</p>

<p>He added, "She left to protect the lives of the students."</p>

<p>Wazed said that the current interim government in Bangladesh, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, was 'unconstitutional'.</p>

<p>"We want a quick restoration of democracy. Right now, this government is completely unconstitutional. There is no provision for a selected government slected by a small minority, because we have 170 million people in Bangladesh, and 20,000-50,000 protesters are a tiny fraction of the minority. No one has voted for this government. So whether they can restore law and order remains to be seen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They've only been in power for less than 24 hours," he said.</p>

<p>"It's one thing to take over power in a coup; it's another thing to govern. They don't have the people's bandwidth. Who is going to listen to them? Right now, there are two main political parties in Bangladesh. No matter what you do, if you want democracy with 170 million people... we have 100 million followers. They have not voted for or supported this government. So without their support, how are you going to govern? I wait to see who is going to listen to this government. It's one thing to be placed in power. It's another thing to have people following you," he said.</p>

<p>He claimed that within 12 hours of coming to power, the interim government had begun to make mistakes.</p>

<p>"In 12 hours, they're already starting to make mistakes. They've already announced that elections are not a priority. The priority is to have trials of the previous government to reform the country. But no one gave them the mandate to reform the country. They don't have the mandate of the people of Bangladesh. So who is going to support them? Who is going to follow their orders?" Wazed said.</p>

<p>He said that the Awami League has always protected minorities, and pointed out that the last 15 years were the safest for minorities in Bangladesh. He added that the interim government has failed to keep minorities safe as they are trying to flee the country.</p>

<p>"In the history of Bangladesh, only one government kept the minorities of Bangladesh safe from all militancy and violence. That was the Awami League. The last 15 years were the safest period in Bangladesh's history for minorities and for Bangladesh itself. And it was also the period of the highest economic development growth. Even those who are criticizing Sheikh Hasina cannot deny it. This non-elected government does not have the support of almost the entire population of Bangladesh. Are they going to be able to keep minorities safe? The minorities are trying to flee the country. I am worried about them. I want to do what I can to keep the minority safe, restore law and order to Bangladesh, and bring back democracy. That is our goal," he added.</p>

<p>Bangladesh is facing a fluid political situation with Sheikh Hasina, tendering her resignation from her post on August 5 in the wake of mounting protests. The protests erupted in early July due to demands for reforming the quota system that reserves civil service jobs for specific groups, including descendants of 1971 war veterans.</p>

<p>The unrest intensified after students opposed a new policy allocating government jobs to descendants of freedom fighters, leading to violence, including attacks on state television headquarters and police booths in Dhaka.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Bangladeshi student leader who was instrumental in overthrowing Sheikh Hasina and is now part of an interim government said she must face trial when she returns home as planned for the killings during her term, including during recent protests, which led her to resign and flee on Monday.</p>

<p>About 300 people, many of them university and college students, were killed in the demonstrations that began in July with students demonstrating against quotas in government jobs before spiralling into violent protests to oust Hasina, who had ruled Bangladesh for 20 of the last 30 years.</p>

<p>Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy has said she will return to Bangladesh from India, where she is sheltering, once elections are announced in her home country, which the main opposition has demanded should be held in three months.</p>

<p>"I am curious why she fled the country," student leader Nahid Islam, who is effectively a minister in the caretaker government, told Reuters late on Friday in his first interview since joining the government on Thursday as an adviser.</p>

<p>"We will seek justice for all the killings that happened under her, that has been one of the main demands of our revolution. Even if she does not come back, we will work towards that."</p>

<p>"We want to arrest her - whether that will work through the regular judicial system or a special tribunal on that or not, we are discussing how to proceed on the matter," said Islam, 26, who now heads the postal, telecommunication and information technology ministries.</p>

<p>Joy, who is based in the United States, did not respond to a request seeking comment. Hasina, who is under the protection of the Indian government, could not be contacted.</p>

<p>Another student leader, Abu Baker Mojumder, separately told Reuters they want Hasina to return and face trial.</p>

<p>Islam said one of the caretaker government's main priorities was to hold a free and fair election, after the last election was boycotted by the opposition, and also investigate suspected corruption in the previous government.</p>

<p>Islam said Bangladesh would need electoral and constitutional reforms before any election, so it was not clear when the next vote would be held. He declined to give a specific timeline.</p>

<p>"My ambition on what I next become depends on the people of Bangladesh," he said, when asked whether one day he would like to be prime minister.</p>

<p>He said India had fostered a relationship with Hasina's Awami League party, but not the people of Bangladesh as a whole.</p>

<p>"We want friendly ties with India," he said. "India also needs to look at its foreign policy, else it will become a problem for the whole of South Asia."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States on Friday announced $125 million in new military aid for Kyiv, as Ukrainian forces push ahead with a surprise offensive inside Russian territory.</p>

<p>The aid package underscores "our unwavering commitment to (Ukraine) as they continue to battle back against Russian aggression," National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told journalists.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the aid would be drawn from American stockpiles and "includes air defense interceptors, munitions for rocket systems and artillery, multi-mission radars, and anti-tank weapons."</p>

<p>The equipment "will help Ukraine protect its troops, its people and its cities from Russian attacks and reinforce its capabilities across the front lines," he said in a statement.</p>

<p>The United States has been a key military backer of Ukraine, committing more than $55 billion in weapons, ammunition and other security aid since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.</p>

<p>The latest aid announcement comes as Kyiv's troops press an attack into Russia's western Kursk region -- a surprise offensive that appears to be the most significant attack on Russian soil since Moscow launched the invasion of its neighbor.</p>

<p>Kirby said that the United States is "in touch with our Ukrainian counterparts, and we are working to gain a better understanding of what they're doing, what their goals are, what their strategy is."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus on Friday announced the portfolios of the newly-appointed council of advisors and took charge of 27 ministries, including defence, and named career diplomat Mohammad Touhid Hossain to head the foreign ministry.</p>

<p>Nobel laureate Yunus, 84, on Thursday took oath as the head of an interim government, replacing Sheikh Hasina who abruptly resigned and fled to India leaving the country in turmoil following deadly protests against her government over a controversial quota system in jobs.</p>

<p>He was sworn in as the chief advisor - a position equivalent to prime minister.</p>

<p>Other advisors were selected in consultation with student leaders, the military, and civil society representatives.</p>

<p>According to an official announcement, Yunus will oversee a broad array of ministries keeping to himself 27 portfolios including the defence, public administration, education, energy, food, water resources and information ministries.</p>

<p>Former foreign secretary Hossain has been entrusted with the charge of the foreign ministry while retired Army brigadier general M Sakhawat Hossain was tasked to oversee the home ministry.</p>

<p>Hossain was the Deputy High Commissioner of Bangladesh in Kolkata from 2001 to 2005 and served as Foreign Secretary of Bangladesh from 2006 to 2009.</p>

<p>Former Bangladesh Bank governor Salahuddin Ahmed will be in charge of the finance and planning ministries while former attorney general A F Hassan Arif will oversee the local government ministry.</p>

<p>Two coordinators of Students Against Discrimination inducted in the interim cabinet M Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud were given the charge of telecommunications and information technology and youth and sports ministries respectively.</p>

<p>The group waged first the street movement to reform the quota system for government jobs last month which later turned into a public upsurge and ousted Hasina's 15-year regime and installed the interim government, visibly backed by the military.</p>

<p>Three members of the advisers' council, mostly civil society figures, could not take the oath on Thursday night at the Bangabhaban presidential palace as they were outside of the capital and officials presumed that Yunus might distribute some of the 27 portfolios to them.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Indian Embassy in Japan issued a mega-quake advisory for Indian citizens residing in Japan on Friday, urging them to prepare for natural disasters after a strong magnitude 7.1 earthquake occurred on Thursday.</p>

<p>Experts have said a 'megaquake' may strike Japan in the coming days. An earthquake of over 8-magnitude is called a megaquake.</p>

<p>Further, the embassy asks citizens to follow guidelines set by Japanese authorities and monitor the embassy's website and social media handles for updates.</p>

<p>"The Govt of Japan has promulgated an advisory for preparedness for natural disasters. All Indian citizens in Japan are advised to follow the advisories promulgated by the Japanese authorities and monitor the website and social media handles of the Embassy of India in Tokyo," the Indian Embassy in Japan said in a post on X.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The Govt of Japan has promulgated an advisory for preparedness for Natural Disasters. All Indian citizens in Japan are advised to follow the advisories promulgated by the Japanese authorities and monitor the website and social media handles of Embassy of India Tokyo. <a href="https://t.co/Ef5lD08Yjb">pic.twitter.com/Ef5lD08Yjb</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The embassy also shared the advisory document, which states that the Japan Meteorological Agency has issued an emergency bulletin on the Nankai Trough earthquake (warning a massive earthquake).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Government of Japan held a disaster response meeting, established a state of alert and has urged the citizens to reaffirm their earthquake preparedness on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Further, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government (TMG) issued an advisory and set up a Disaster Management Headquarters (DMHQ) on August 8 to enhance preparedness in connection with the Mega-quake advisory (Nankai Trough Earthquake Extra Information) issued by the Japan Meteorological Agency.</p>

<p>The advisory by TMG estimates that if the mega quake occurs, the damage in Tokyo will be of seismic intensity 6 or lower and there may be a tsunami that could effect the island areas.</p>

<p>According to the advisory, all Indian citizens in Japan are advised to adhere to warnings and instructions promulgated by the Government of Japan and local governments from time to time.</p>

<p>The Government of Japan has further reassured that there is no need to panic and that the advisory is only meant to enhance preparedness.</p>

<p>Two powerful earthquakes struck off Japan's southern coast on Thursday. The first, a 6.9-magnitude quake, was followed by another 7.1-magnitude tremor, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS).</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A regional turboprop plane carrying 62 people crashed near Sao Paulo in Brazil on Friday, killing all on board, local officials near the crash site said.</p>

<p>Video shared on social media showed what appeared to be the ATR-made plane spinning out of control as it plunged down behind a cluster of trees near houses, followed by a large plume of black smoke.</p>

<p>City officials at Valinhos, near Vinhedo, said there were no survivors and only one home in the local condominium complex had been damaged while none of the residents were hurt.</p>

<p>"I have to be the bearer of really bad news," said President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva speaking at an event shortly after the crash. He asked for a minute of silence for the victims of the crash.</p>

<p>Airline Voepass said the plane, which had taken off from Cascavel, in the state of Parana, bound for Sao Paulo's main international airport, crashed in the town of Vinhedo, about 80 km (50 miles) northwest of Sao Paulo.</p>

<p>The unlisted airline said it could not provide further information on what caused the plane, which had a PS-VPB registration, to crash.</p>

<p>Just minutes after the apparent accident, Sao Paulo's state fire brigade said it was rushing seven crews to the scene of the crash.</p>

<p>The aircraft was listed by flight tracker FlightRadar24 as an ATR 72-500 turboprop. ATR is jointly owned by Airbus and Italian aerospace group Leonardo.</p>

<p>ATR did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jailed Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi and other female inmates were hurt in clashes that erupted at Tehran's Evin prison following a spate of executions, her family said, raising new concerns for her health.</p>

<p>Iranian authorities acknowledged a confrontation had taken place on Tuesday but blamed Mohammadi for a "provocation" and denied any of the prisoners had been beaten.</p>

<p>Human rights activist Mohammadi, 52, who won the 2023 prize for her campaigning including against the death penalty, has been jailed since November 2021 and has spent much of the past decade in and out of prison.</p>

<p>The Paris-based family of Mohammadi emphasised it had had no direct contact with her since her right to make phone calls was revoked in November.</p>

<p>But it said it had learnt from several other families of detainees held in Evin that clashes erupted on Tuesday as the female prisoners launched a protest in the yard against the executions.</p>

<p>According to rights groups, around 30 convicts were hanged this week, including Gholamreza (Reza) Rasaei, who the Iranian judiciary said was executed on Tuesday in connection with 2022 protests.</p>

<p>"The protest by prisoners against the execution of Reza Rasaei led to a violent crackdown by prison guards and security agents," Mohammadi's family said in a statement late Thursday, citing the reports.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Several women who stood in front of the security forces were severely beaten. The confrontation escalated, resulting in physical injuries for some prisoners."</p>

<p><strong>- 'Deeply worried' -</strong></p>

<p>The family said that after being punched in the chest, Mohammadi suffered a respiratory attack and intense chest pain, causing her to collapse and faint on the ground in the prison yard.</p>

<p>She was bruised and treated in the prison infirmary but not transferred to a hospital outside, it said.</p>

<p>"We are deeply worried about her health and well-being under these circumstances," the family said.</p>

<p>Relatives and supporters had earlier this month raised concern about Mohammadi's condition, saying they had been informed of the results of medical tests carried out in July "which showed a worrying deterioration of her health".</p>

<p>In the past eight months, Mohammadi has been suffering from acute back and knee pain, including a slipped disc. In 2021, a stent was placed on one of her main coronary arteries due to a blockage.</p>

<p>Iran's prison authority denied that prisoners were beaten and blamed the confrontation on Mohammadi and other inmates who it said had broken the lock of an outer door.</p>

<p>Two prisoners "had heart palpitations due to the stress," but medical examinations determined that their general condition "is favourable," it said in a statement, according to the Tasnim news agency.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>- 'Alarmingly high' -</strong></p>

<p>Reports have suggested increasing tensions in the women's wing of Evin prison after two Kurdish female activists, Sharifeh Mohammadi and Pakhshan Azizi, were sentenced to death on charges of membership of an outlawed group.</p>

<p>Rights groups say that Iran has intensified the use of capital punishment after a brief lull in the run-up to the June-July election that brought reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian to power.</p>

<p>Authorities executed 29 people at two prisons in the Tehran satellite city of Karaj on Wednesday alone, according to Norway-based Iran Human Rights.</p>

<p>Volker Turk, the UN high commissioner for human rights, "is extremely concerned" by the reports, spokeswoman Elizabeth Throssell told journalists in Geneva. "This represents an alarmingly high number of executions in such a short period of time."</p>

<p>Mohammadi has kept campaigning even behind bars and strongly supported the protests that erupted across Iran following the September 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini. The 22-year-old Iranian Kurd had been arrested for an alleged breach of Iran's strict dress rules for women.</p>

<p>She received a new one-year prison term in June for "propaganda against the state", adding to sentences that already amounted to 12 years and three months of imprisonment, 154 lashes, two years of exile and various social and political restrictions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peru's Mashco Piro tribe recently used bows and arrows to attack loggers suspected of encroaching on their territory in the Amazon. According to <em>CBS News</em>, the regional Indigenous organisation FENAMAD said on Monday that it believes illegal logging was taking place on Mashco Piro territory and that one logger was injured in the July 27 attack.</p>

<p>This comes weeks after photos emerged of the uncontacted tribe searching for food on a beach in the Peruvian Amazon. Experts say the pictures were evidence that logging concessions are "dangerously close" to its territory. Survival International, an advocacy group for Indigenous peoples which closely follows the Mashco Piro's issues, said that photos and videos showed about 53 male Mashco Piro on the beach. The group estimated as many as 100 to 150 tribal members would have been in the area with women and children nearby.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It is presumably illegal because the area where the incident occurred is a forestry concession that belonged to Wood Tropical Forest until November 2022, and we are not aware of a concession that has requested or granted enabling rights in the same area," said a FENAMAD representative, speaking anonymously out of personal security concerns, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uncontacted-tribe-mashco-piro-attacks-loggers-arrows-peru-amazon/"><em>CBS News</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The organisation further stated that a lack of protection measures by the Peruvian government and the increased activity of companies and illegal operators on the Mascho Piro territory could produce "devastating consequences", such as the transmission of diseases and increased violence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, in 2022, two loggers were shot with arrows while fishing in the area. There have also been several other previous reports of conflicts, the outlet reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to FENAMAD, increased logging activity in the area is likely pushing the tribe out of their traditional lands. They believe that the Mashco Piro may be venturing closer to settlements in search of food and a safer refuge.</p>

<p>Separately, Survival International said it is pressuring the Peruvian government to move deeper into these areas of the Amazon to help control the situation. "This is a permanent emergency. For the last month we have been seeing the Mascho Piro every two weeks at different points, and in all of them they are surrounded by loggers," Teresa Mayo, a researcher at Survival International, told CBS News.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's truly a matter of life and death. And only the government can and has the duty to stop it," Ms Mayo said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladeshi students battled police for control of the streets and won, but if their country is to embark on a new journey, someone has to clear the road ahead.</p>

<p>Gridlock is a fact of life in the capital Dhaka, a megacity of 20 million which relies on a corps of police wardens to clear long snarls of cars and pedal rickshaws through intersections.</p>

<p>With officers on strike after the resignation of ex-premier Sheikh Hasina, the students who forced her ouster have stepped up to do the job themselves.</p>

<p>"Our country can't remain in a standstill," Nasrin Akter Koly, 21, told AFP.</p>

<p>"We clashed with the police, that's why the police are not on duty," she added. "So instead of the police, our people must do the work."</p>

<p>Traffic control is a humdrum job at the best of times and many of Dhaka's usual wardens are known for a casual indifference to aggressive drivers zooming by out of turn.</p>

<p>But Koly and her classmates have brought a new enthusiasm to the vocation as they wave through cars at one of the downtown business district's busiest crossroads.</p>

<p>Drivers are in turn treating the volunteers with respect.</p>

<p>Nearly all are stopping on command and heeding polite but firm directions to fasten their seatbelts -- the kind of minor traffic infraction that would have previously been ignored.</p>

<p>"After a revolution, every country faces some difficulties," said Nahid Kalam Nabil, 22, while directing traffic alongside Koly.</p>

<p>"The students are handling the situation now, and they will keep the country safe," he added.</p>

<p><strong>'Teaching the people'</strong></p>

<p>More than 450 people were killed during weeks of clashes between protesters and security forces before Hasina quit and fled to India on Monday.</p>

<p>Protests had been largely peaceful until police attempted to violently disperse them, setting in motion the chain of events that led to the end of Hasina's iron-fisted 15-year tenure.</p>

<p>Dozens of police officers were killed in the unrest, according to police and hospital figures given to AFP.</p>

<p>After her departure, vandalism and arson attacks hit roughly 450 of the country's 600 police stations, according to the force.</p>

<p>Police unions declared a national strike on Tuesday "until the security" of officers was assured, and a new police chief apologised for the conduct of officers under his sacked predecessor.</p>

<p>Unrest has since subsided, thanks in part to students volunteering for neighbourhood watch patrols and guarding houses of worship for minority religions, which were subjected to isolated looting attacks.</p>

<p>"They are safeguarding the houses at night, they are safeguarding the mosques, temples and churches," Nabil said.</p>

<p>"They are teaching the people law and order. They are designing the country in a new way."</p>

<p>Many police officers began returning to work Friday with soldiers -- held in high esteem for not intervening on Hasina's side during the unrest -- standing guard.</p>

<p>Farida Akhter, a member of the interim government tasked with steering democratic reforms, told AFP that restoring law and order was the "first priority" of the new dispensation.</p>

<p>The sudden collapse of Hasina's administration left a gaping vacuum in political administration, with many civil servants staying home waiting for the dust to settle.</p>

<p>The city government in Dhaka has also laid low, prompting other student volunteers to take on its duties.</p>

<p>"With this students' protest, we have made a fascist regime fall," 20-year-old Samanjar Chowdhury Mrittika told AFP while wielding a broom to sweep up garbage from a downtown sidewalk.</p>

<p>"The country is not in a good condition," she added. "Someone must take responsibility."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crowds fleeing Khan Yunis after an Israeli evacuation order gave way to empty streets on Friday as Palestinian residents tried to escape a new Israeli military operation in Gaza's main southern area.</p>

<p>"They threw leaflets at us, ordering us to evacuate", Reem Abu Hayya told AFP, referring to the flyers that Israeli forces drop from planes to order the evacuation of areas ahead of a military operation.</p>

<p>The Khan Yunis area had already seen evacuation orders in late July, and heavy fighting that devastated the area earlier this year.</p>

<p>"We don't know where we're going, and we have sick and disabled people with us. Where can we go?" Abu Hayya asked AFP as she stood on the street in front of a building reduced to a pile of rebar and broken concrete.</p>

<p>In a besieged territory that has been consistently bombed over the past 10 months and where supplies enter with great difficulty, people carried all they could as they fled on Thursday.</p>

<p>AFP journalists saw one young man carrying planks of wood loosely tied in bundles, to be used as shelter structure or fuel in the near future.</p>

<p>With petrol scarce, only the most fortunate drove, often with mattresses piled high on the car roof. The vast majority walked. They carried their belongings in plastic and garbage bags, on donkey-pulled carts, bikes, strollers or wheelchairs.</p>

<p>By dusk, streets of Khan Yunis stood completely deserted and eerily quiet, AFP journalists reported. Only the ruins of buildings damaged in earlier strikes still stood.</p>

<p>The flyers dropped Thursday ordered residents to leave eastern towns of Khan Yunis governorate including Al-Salqa, Al-Qarara, Bani Suheila, and neighbourhoods in the city of Khan Yunis.</p>

<p>"Hamas and terrorist organisations continue to launch rockets from your areas", read the flyers which echoed past orders and warned that the Israeli army "will act forcefully against these elements".</p>

<p>Late last month Philippe Lazzarini, who heads the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said on social media site X that only "14 percent of areas in Gaza" were not subject to evacuation orders.</p>

<p>On Friday, the military said it launched a new operation in Khan Yunis following "intelligence indicating the presence of terrorists and terror infrastructure" there.</p>

<p>"The troops are engaging in combat both above and below-ground to eliminate terrorists in the area while locating and dismantling weaponry and terrorist infrastructure," the military said in a statement.</p>

<p><strong>'We are exhausted'</strong></p>

<p>The military has often returned in Gaza to areas where it had previously completed major operations against Palestinian militants, only to find them resurfacing or to act on intelligence about the location of hostages.</p>

<p>"Enough! For both, the Jews and Hamas! Both of them should look at the people of Gaza, have mercy on us for God's sake," Ahmed al-Najjar, angry at the war and the prospect of yet another displacement, told AFP.</p>

<p>War in Gaza began when Hamas Palestinian militants on October 7 attacked southern Israel, resulting in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 39,699 people in Gaza, according to the health ministry of the Hamas-run territory, which does not provide details of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>Mohammad al-Farra, from Sheikh Nasser in the east of Khan Yunis, also expressed frustration at the several displacements his family has lived through.</p>

<p>"We were the first to return to our home... as soon as the military operation in our area ended, to escape the heat, the displacement, and the hardship", the 46-year-old told AFP.</p>

<p>"Then the occupation returned to drive us out again, making us suffer the tragedy multiple times over", he said, referring to Israel.</p>

<p>"We are exhausted. The war must end immediately so that we can feel human again, even just a little."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian ground troops and mechanized forces crossed the international border, advancing over 30 kilometres into Russian territory in one of the most significant developments in the ongoing war between the two countries. The Ukrainian troops, estimated to be over 1,000, moved from the Sumy Oblast region of north-east Ukraine and have taken over Kursk Oblast of Russia.</p>

<p>Ukraine's incursion caught Russia off-guard, which is now scrambling troops to stop the advance. Kyiv conducted intense artillery and drone attacks along with the movement of mechanized troops into enemy territory.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-8-2024">The Institute for Study of War</a> (ISW), a non-profit, geolocated the positions of Ukrainian troops through open-source videos and pictures of the operation and marked the territories that have witnessed Ukrainian advance. The blue region indicates the areas where Ukrainians have entered.</p>

<p>Russia has scrambled its troops to stop the further incursion of Ukrainians. The objective of the Ukrainian operation is unclear, but ever since the war began in February 2022, Kyiv's operation appears to be the biggest challenge Putin's Russia has faced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ukraine has been largely silent on the offensive. Meanwhile, Russia has announced a "federal emergency" and has scrambled troops to defend the area.</p>

<h2><strong>Geolocating Ukrainian Advance</strong></h2>

<p>ISW said the advance of the Ukrainian mechanized troops comprising tanks, infantry and armoured vehicles almost 35 km into Russia was "rapid", but ISW said it does not appear that the Ukrainians most certainly "do not control that area".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Russian conscripts, the FSB border guards and elements of Chechen "Akhmat" units, a motorized unit operating in the Chechen Republic and fighting for Russia, are operating in the Kursk region and built field fortifications along the border. They were breached by the Ukrainian troops. Based on the information accessed by ISW, as of August 8, Ukrainian troops are located in Sverdlikovo, Sudhza, Malaya and Lyubimovka.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin has called the incursion a "large-scale provocation" by Kyiv, and Russia's top general has vowed to crush it. Meanwhile, a Chechen Akhmat unit official said, "The situation is not irreversible. Nothing supernatural happened, yes, our people died, that's a fact. The enemy has entered several settlements," said General Apti Alaudinov, a close ally of Chechen dictator Ramzan Kadyrov and commander of Akhmat special forces.</p>

<p>Russian military bloggers claim that the Ukrainian troops are advancing in small units from Russia's rear and bypassing their fortifications before engaging Russian forces and then withdrawing from the engagements without attempting to consolidate control over their furthest advances.</p>

<p>The new frontline in Russia is far from other areas where intense fighting has taken place since the war began. Significant fighting took place in eastern Ukraine, a major chunk of which is claimed to be under Russian control. In the east, Donetsk, Luhansk and Horlivka had been under Russian control before the war began two years ago. The Russian troops have advanced further west from these regions and control a frontline which runs northeast to south of Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the ISW's map, the red line indicates the Russian advance in Ukraine and the black dotted lines toward Russian control of Ukrainian territory before the war began.</p>

<p>Ukrainian drones targeted residential buildings in the border regions of Kursk, Voronezh and Belgorod. Combatants from Ukraine have made several brief incursions into Russia since the beginning of the conflict in February 2022.</p>

<h2><strong>Russia Scrambles Troops</strong></h2>

<p>Russian military experts have slammed officials for not detecting the incursions in the first place. The Ukrainian offensive has entered its third day. Russia initially scrambled air and artillery units to repel the attacks but failed to stop the advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry said it is sending columns of military hardware, including rocket launchers, artillery, tanks and heavy trucks to reinforce its defences in the area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Russia carried out artillery strikes on a supermarket in eastern Ukraine's Kostyantynivka. The attack is Russia's response to the Ukrainian advance. The shelling killed ten people and wounded 35. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky has vowed to take revenge for the attack.</p>

<p>"Russia will be held accountable for this terror, and we will do our best to ensure that the world continues to stand with Ukraine in supporting our defense and saving the lives of our people," Zelensky said on X.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Kostyantynivka has witnessed attacks in the past and Russian shelling is a usual occurrence.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Incursion To Gain Leverage?</strong></h2>

<p>Kharkiv in Ukraine has been a major flashpoint between the troops and has witnessed intense battles in the past. In May, Russia launched a new offensive in the region, taking significant territory in Kharkiv. The attacks saw Russia dropping 1,000 kg guided bombs on a hardware store in which 16 were killed.</p>

<p>Last year, Ukrainian troops launched a major counteroffensive to reclaim Kharkiv, which almost reached the border of Russia. Kharkiv has party occupied by Russia since the war began on February 24, 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Russian-controlled territory lies very close to the international border and is several kilometres north of Kharkiv city, Ukraine's second-largest city. Ukraine's ongoing incursion in Kursk could be a way to gain leverage on the negotiation table for a truce in areas by forcing the enemy to pull troops from other areas to reinforce the frontline. The Ukrainian objective remains unclear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Washington was "reaching out to our Ukrainian counterparts to get a little better understanding". He added "Nothing has changed about our policy" and Ukraine can use US-supplied weapons only "to target imminent threats just across the border".</p>

<p>US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said of the Kremlin: "It is a little bit rich, them calling it a provocation, given Russia violated Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 28-year-old skydiving student in the United States was killed alongside her diving instructor after the pair hit a "dust devil" in California. A dust devil is a small but strong tornado-like whirlwind that forms in very hot conditions and can reach heights of several thousand feet. According to the <em>New York Post</em>, the woman, identified as Kayla Kieko Black, was skydiving with veteran instructor Devry LaRiccia Chase on Friday when a "dust devil" sent them into an "uncontrollable spin" that plunged them to their deaths.</p>

<p>"Kayla was deeply cherished by her family and friends, who will forever remember her kindness, warmth and unwavering support," Ms Black's family said in a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/in-memory-of-kayla-kieko-black-support-for-her-family">GoFundMe page</a>. "In this time of immense sorrow we find solace in knowing that Kayla's legacy will live on through her selfless decision to be an organ donor. Her generosity will provide hope and new beginnings for many individuals and families in need," it added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/08/us-news/skydiving-student-killed-in-freak-accident-idd-as-kayla-kieko-black/"><em>Post</em></a>, the 28-year-old was jumping in tandem with Devry LaRiccia Chase, an instructor with Skydive Perrisand. The instructor was able to glide away from the first gust but two were trapped in the second. "Eyewitnesses report that the tandem pair experience a normal free fall and parachute deployment," the skydiving firm's manager Dan Brodsky-Chenfeld said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"All aspects of the equipment and skydive was normal without any reported issues until the landing sequence. While preparing for landing the tandem pair hit disturbed air known as a 'dust devil.' The interaction with this sudden disturbed air causes turbulence and a hard landing for both individuals," the manager added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the incident, both, the instructor and the skydiving student, were rushed to a local hospital. Ms LaRiccia's family also started a GoFundMe page to help bring her body to her native state of Maine for burial, with the site raising more than $59,000 by Thursday afternoon.</p>

<p>The instructor's husband, Freddy Chase, told People he wants Ms Black's family to know that he is "truly sorry for what happened" but that he's "glad that she got to share the last conversation with Devrey ever." He previously also stated that "there was no malfunction" before the incident. He explained that his wife was conducting her final jump of the day when she noticed the dust devils and got caught in one. "It then sent her canopy in an uncontrolled spin to the ground," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The BBC Board said in a statement on Friday that the 62-year-old former news anchor had "undermined trust in the BBC and brought us into disrepute".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The BBC said Friday it had asked disgraced former presenter Huw Edwards to return his salary from the time he was arrested in November last year on charges of making indecent images of children.</p>

<p>Edwards, one of the most recognisable faces on UK television, pleaded guilty last month to three charges and now faces a maximum prison sentence of 10 years and a minimum of 12 months.</p>

<p>The BBC Board said in a statement on Friday that the 62-year-old former news anchor had "undermined trust in the BBC and brought us into disrepute".</p>

<p>The broadcaster first learned of his arrest last November. He was suspended at the time, but only left the broadcaster five months later and received full pay in the meantime.</p>

<p>This amounted to around £200,000 ($255,000) -- a particular source of anger as the BBC is funded by a licence fee paid by any UK household watching live channels on a television.</p>

<p>The board statement said it had "authorised the Executive to seek the return of salary paid to Mr Edwards from the time he was arrested in November last year.</p>

<p>"Mr Edwards pleaded guilty to an appalling crime. Had he been up front when asked by the BBC about his arrest, we would never have continued to pay him public money," it added.</p>

<p>It did not confirm whether legal action will be taken if Edwards refuses to return the money.</p>

<p>The broadcaster also announced an independent review into workplace culture.</p>

<p>Police said an investigation into Edwards began after a phone seized by officers as part of an unrelated probe revealed the broadcaster's participation in a WhatsApp conversation.</p>

<p>Edwards, a leading anchor and the BBC's presenter on key events such as the death and funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, was suspended in July 2023 when allegations first emerged.</p>

<p>He quit in April after 40 years with the broadcaster.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Austria on Friday said it had detained a third alleged Islamic State sympathiser over a plot to carry out a suicide attack at a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna.</p>

<p>The Vienna leg of the music icon's blockbuster "Eras" tour was cancelled after police on Wednesday arrested two suspects, ages 19 and 17, over a plot to kill "a large number of people" at one of the three gigs this week, according to authorities.</p>

<p>On Friday Interior Ministry Gerhard Karner said that "an 18-year-old Iraqi close to the main suspect and who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group was arrested" in the Austrian capital on Thursday.</p>

<p>The main suspect, a 19-year-old Austrian with North Macedonian roots had allegedly confessed, saying he "intended to carry out an attack using explosives and knives", domestic intelligence agency (DSN) head Omar Haijawi-Pirchner has told journalists.</p>

<p>The second suspect, a 17-year-old Austrian of Turkish and Croatian origin, had just been hired by a facility management company that would have "provided services" at the Ernst Happel Stadium where Swift was to perform, said Haijawi-Pirchner.</p>

<p>Conservative Chancellor Karl Nehammer said there were "concrete and detailed" plans to commit a "blood bath".</p>

<p>The Austrian army's intelligence service was warned of a looming attack 10 to 15 days prior by two unspecified countries that helped it foil the plot, according to news agency APA.</p>

<p>Swift was set to perform three shows from Thursday to Saturday in Vienna as part of her mega record-breaking "Eras" tour.</p>

<p>The European leg of the sold-out tour began in Paris in May and has taken in Sweden, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Germany and Poland.</p>

<p>In Austria, the shows had been expected to bring in some 100 million euros and gather 170,000 fans, according to APA estimates.</p>

<p>Swift has not yet commented on the decision to cancel the Vienna shows but said she was "completely in shock" after a deadly attack in Britain on July 29 at a Swift-themed dance class.</p>

<p>Three girls were killed and five people seriously wounded in the mass stabbing at the class in Southport, England.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

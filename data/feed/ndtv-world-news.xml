       <description><![CDATA[Hundreds of young men are standing trial in Pakistan courts, accused of making blasphemous statements online or in WhatsApp groups, an offence for which arrests have exploded in recent years.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aroosa Khan's son was chatting on WhatsApp but suddenly found himself the target of "vigilante" investigators who accused him of having committed blasphemy online, a crime that carries the death penalty in Pakistan.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old is one in hundreds of young men standing trial in Pakistan courts accused of making blasphemous statements online or in WhatsApp groups, an offence for which arrests have exploded in recent years.</p>

<p>Many of the cases are being brought to trial by private "vigilante groups" led by lawyers and supported by volunteers who scour the internet for offenders, rights groups and police say.</p>

<p>The families of young Pakistanis, including doctors, engineers, lawyers, and accountants, say that their relatives were duped into sharing blasphemous content by strangers online before being arrested.</p>

<p>"Our lives have been turned upside down," Khan told AFP, saying that her son, who has not been named for security reasons, had been tricked into sharing blasphemous content in the messaging app.</p>

<p>One local police report suggests that the vigilantes may be motivated by financial gains.</p>

<p>One such group was responsible for the conviction of 27 people who have been sentenced to life imprisonment or the death penalty over the past three years.</p>

<p>Blasphemy is an incendiary charge in Muslim-majority Pakistan, where even unsubstantiated accusations can incite public outrage and lead to lynchings.</p>

<p>While they date back to colonial times, Pakistan's blasphemy laws were ramped up in the 1980s when dictator Zia ul-Haq campaigned to "Islamicise" society.</p>

<p>AFP has attended multiple court hearings in the capital Islamabad, where young men are being prosecuted by private vigilante groups and the FIA for blasphemous online content.</p>

<p>Among them is Aroosa's son -- who had joined a WhatsApp group for job-seekers and was contacted by a woman.</p>

<p>She sent him an image of women with Quranic verses printed on their bodies, his mother said, adding that the contact then "denied having sent it and asked Ahmed to send it back to her to understand what he was talking about".</p>

<p>He was later arrested and prosecuted by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).</p>

<p><strong>'Noble cause'</strong></p>

<p>The most active private investigation group is the Legal Commission on Blasphemy Pakistan (LCBP), which told AFP they are prosecuting more than 300 cases.</p>

<p>Sheraz Ahmad Farooqi, one of the private investigation group's leaders, told AFP that more than a dozen volunteers track online blasphemy, believing that "God has chosen them for this noble cause".</p>

<p>"We are not beheading anyone; we are following a legal course," Farooqi told AFP outside a courtroom that heard 15 blasphemy cases, all filed by his group.</p>

<p>He said that most of the accused were addicted to pornography and were disrespecting revered Islamic figures by using their names and dubbing voices attributed to them over pornographic content.</p>

<p>He acknowledged that women were involved in tracking and arresting the men, but they were not members of his group.</p>

<p>Cases can drag through the courts for years, though death penalties are often commuted to life in prison on appeal at the Supreme Court and Pakistan has never executed anyone for blasphemy.</p>

<p>A special court, attended by AFP, was formed in September to expedite the dozens of pending cases.</p>

<p><strong>'Vested agenda'</strong></p>

<p>The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) reported that multiple vigilante groups were working in a "dedicated manner" to "witch-hunt" people for online expression or to fabricate blasphemy evidence using social media with "vested agendas".</p>

<p>"All such groups are formalised by self-declared defenders of majoritarian Islam," the group said in a report published in 2023.</p>

<p>A 2024 report by police in Punjab province, the country's most populous province, that was leaked to the media said that "a suspicious gang was trapping youth in blasphemy cases".</p>

<p>"The Blasphemy Business" report was sent to the FIA with recommendations to launch a thorough inquiry to determine the source of the vigilante groups' funding.</p>

<p>Two FIA officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP that they had received the report but denied that their office was acting on the tips of vigilante groups.</p>

<p>The FIA did not respond to requests for official comment.</p>

<p>An official involved in prosecuting the cases told AFP outside the court: "Not a single person arrested was trapped by any manner. They committed the crime."</p>

<p>"The law is very clear about it, and we have to enforce it as long as the law is there."</p>

<p>Arafat Mazhar, the director of Alliance Against Blasphemy Politics, a group advocating against the misuse of blasphemy laws, told AFP that the alarming rise in cases was not because people "are suddenly more blasphemous".</p>

<p>He said the rise in the use of messaging apps and social media and the ease of sharing and forwarding content was a significant factor.</p>

<p><strong>Shunned</strong></p>

<p>The accused struggle to find defence lawyers willing to represent them and the slightest accusation can turn an entire family into pariahs.</p>

<p>Nafeesa Ahmed, whose brother is accused of sharing blasphemous images on WhatsApp and whose names have also been changed, said her family was shunned by close relatives.</p>

<p>"There is a massive cost that families of accused are bearing. First of all, our security or lives are at risk," she told AFP.</p>

<p>She said some of the families have sold thousands of dollars worth of houses and gold, given to brides on their wedding, to fight the cases.</p>

<p>Dozens of families which have formed a support group have protested in the capital calling for an independent commission to investigate the vigilante groups and their role in prosecuting Pakistanis for blasphemy.</p>

<p>"In this society, if someone commits a murder, he can survive because there are thousands of ways to come out of that but if someone is accused of blasphemy he cannot," said Nafeesa.</p>

<p>"When it comes to blasphemy, the public has its own court and even family members will abandon you."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The global average birth rate for twins is around 12 per 1,000 births -- but in Igbo-Ora, it is thought to be closer to 50 per 1,000, according to scientific studies and hospital records.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On a normal day, a visitor might pass Igbo-Ora with little more than a double take, wondering why so many pairs of residents wear matching clothes.</p>

<p>But this weekend left nobody doubting what makes the town in southwest Nigeria special.</p>

<p>With fanfare, pageantry, talent shows and even a royal visit, hundreds of people gathered in the self-proclaimed "twins capital of the world" to celebrate its unusually high rate of multiple births.</p>

<p>"There's hardly a family here in Igbo-Ora that doesn't have a twin," said visiting Yoruba king Oba Kehinde Gbadewole Olugbenle, himself a twin.</p>

<p>Yoruba culture reveres twins and their first names are traditionally fixed -- Taiwo meaning 'one that tastes the world' for the eldest child, and Kehinde meaning 'one that came after' for the second-born.</p>

<p>The town stands out even in the wider Yorubaland region, which boasts an above-average incidence of non-identical twins, according to population experts.</p>

<p>The global average birth rate for twins is around 12 per 1,000 births -- but in Igbo-Ora, it is thought to be closer to 50 per 1,000, according to scientific studies and hospital records.</p>

<p>Explanations for the abundance differ.</p>

<p>Many residents put it down to diet, especially okra leaf or ilasa soup with yam and amala (cassava flour).</p>

<p>Fertility experts -- and several residents -- are sceptical, saying there is no proven link between diet and the high twin rate.</p>

<p>Scientists are looking into genetic factors, and how the twins' special cultural status might make them more likely to find partners and have children.</p>

<p><strong>'Gift from God'</strong></p>

<p>Whatever the reason, everyone in the town agrees the abundance of twins is a blessing -- even more so this year as Nigeria grapples with its worst economic crisis in a generation.</p>

<p>Suliat Mobolaji gave birth to twins eight months ago and said the family had been showered with gifts ever since.</p>

<p>"It's changed my life," the 30-year-old said, clutching a son in each arm.</p>

<p>"You can't give birth to twins and remain down on your luck," she beamed. "It's a gift from God."</p>

<p>Taiwo Ojewale, a research assistant specialising in Yoruba culture at the University of Ibadan, said celebrating twins was "rooted in traditional religious belief."</p>

<p>Twins are seen as a gift from the supreme god Olodumare, he explained, and Igbo-Ora's oral history describes them as a reward following a series of disasters that befell the community.</p>

<p>The town erupted with joy as the event began on Saturday. At the festival ground, staff rolled out a red carpet for scores of twins both young and old.</p>

<p>They paraded in immaculate matching outfits -- from glamorous sunglasses and patterned adire fabric to a pair of toddlers sporting purple dresses and identical handbags.</p>

<p>Dozens more twins watched from the stands or milled side by side around town.</p>

<p>The festival's organisers -- themselves twins -- say they eventually want to attempt a world record for the largest gathering of twins on the planet.</p>

<p>Taiwo and Kehinde Oguntoye, 39, also said they hope to stage a mass wedding of twin couples next year.</p>

<p>"Twins bring favours, fame and wealth," said Taiwo. "That's why we Yoruba celebrate their birth, and maybe that is the reason why God blessed us in Yorubaland with the highest number of twins in the world."</p>

<p>"It's a blessing," the Oguntoye twins nodded, speaking in unison.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is there anywhere else in our solar system that could support life? An imposing NASA probe is due to lift off on Monday on a five-and-a-half-year journey to Europa, one of Jupiter's many moons, to take the first detailed step toward finding out.</p>

<p>The Europa Clipper mission will allow the US space agency to uncover new details about the moon, which scientists believe could hold an ocean of liquid water beneath its icy surface.</p>

<p>Lift off is scheduled for "no earlier than" Monday, October 14, from Cape Canaveral in Florida aboard a powerful SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket, NASA said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Europa is one of the most promising places to look for life beyond Earth," said NASA official Gina DiBraccio at a news conference last month.</p>

<p>The mission will not look directly for signs of life but will instead look to answer the question: Does Europa contain the ingredients that would allow life to be present?</p>

<p>If it does, another mission would then have to make the journey to try and detect it.</p>

<p>"It's a chance for us to explore not a world that might have been habitable billions of years ago," like Mars, Europa Clipper program scientist Curt Niebur told reporters last month, "but a world that might be habitable today, right now."</p>

<p>The probe is the largest ever designed by NASA for interplanetary exploration.</p>

<p>It is 30 meters wide when its immense solar panels -- designed to capture the weak light that reaches Jupiter -- are fully extended.</p>

<p><strong>Primitive life?</strong></p>

<p>While Europa's existence has been known since 1610, the first close-up images were taken by the Voyager probes in 1979, which revealed mysterious reddish lines crisscrossing its surface.</p>

<p>The next probe to reach Jupiter's icy moon was NASA's Galileo probe in the 1990s, which found it was highly likely that the moon was home to an ocean.</p>

<p>This time, the Europa Clipper probe will carry a host of sophisticated instruments, including cameras, a spectrograph, radar, and a magnetometer to measure its magnetic forces.</p>

<p>The mission will look to determine the structure and composition of Europa's icy surface, its depth, and even the salinity of its ocean, as well as the way the two interact -- to find out, for example, if water rises to the surface in places.</p>

<p>The aim is to understand whether the three ingredients necessary for life are present: water, energy and certain chemical compounds.</p>

<p>If these conditions exist on Europa, life could be found in the ocean in the form of primitive bacteria, explained Bonnie Buratti, the mission's deputy project scientist.</p>

<p>But the bacteria would likely be too deep for the Europa Clipper to see.</p>

<p>And what if Europa isn't habitable after all? "That also opens up a whole wealth of questions: Why did we think this? And why is it not there?" said Nikki Fox, an associate administrator at NASA.</p>

<p><strong>49 flybys</strong></p>

<p>The probe will cover 2.9 billion kilometers (1.8 billion miles) during its journey to Jupiter, with arrival expected in April 2030.</p>

<p>The main mission will last another four years.</p>

<p>The probe will make 49 close flybys over Europa, coming as close as 25 kilometers (16 miles) above the surface.</p>

<p>It will be subjected to intense radiation -- the equivalent of several million chest x-rays on each pass.</p>

<p>Some 4,000 people have been working on the $5.2 billion mission for around a decade.</p>

<p>NASA says the investment is justified by the importance of the data that will be collected.</p>

<p>If our solar system turns out to be home to two habitable worlds (Europa and Earth), "think of what that means when you extend that result to the billions and billions of other solar systems in this galaxy," said Niebur, the Europa Clipper program scientist.</p>

<p>"Setting aside the 'Is there life?' question on Europa, just the habitability question in and of itself opens up a huge new paradigm for searching for life in the galaxy," he added.</p>

<p>The Europa Clipper will operate at the same time as the European Space Agency's (ESA) Juice probe, which will study two other moons of Jupiter -- Ganymede and Callisto.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrat US presidential nominee Kamala Harris today challenged her Republican rival Donald Trump to release his medical records, a day after she was found in "excellent health" and fit for the presidency.</p>

<p>"Yesterday, I released my medical records. Donald Trump should do the same," she wrote on X.<br />
<br />
“I invite the public to watch his rallies and be the decision maker on his acuity,” she said in the video attached to the tweet.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>At a rally in North Carolina, she also urged voters to question Trump's transparency regarding his health and policy plans. She claimed that crucial information was needed for making informed choices in the upcoming election.<br />
<br />
“Check this out,” Harris said during the rally. “He refuses to release his medical records. I've done it. Every other presidential candidate in the modern era has done it.”</p>

<p>Harris's comments highlight the age gap between her and Trump, who at 78 is the oldest presidential nominee in US history.<br />
<br />
She also criticised Trump for declining to participate in a second debate and for cancelling an interview with CBS News' “60 Minutes.”<br />
<br />
“He is unwilling to meet for a second debate,” Harris said in the rally. “And here's the thing, it makes you wonder. Why does his staff want him to hide away? One must question, are they afraid that people will see that he is too weak and unstable to lead America?”<br />
<br />
Kamala Harris' medical report, released on Saturday, describes her as a "healthy 59-year-old female" with seasonal allergies and urticaria (hives). In contrast, Donald Trump's medical history remains undisclosed.<br />
<br />
Trump previously indicated he would release his medical records, telling CBS News in August, “Oh sure, I would do that very gladly.”<br />
<br />
However, the Trump campaign released a statement on Saturday, with a letter from his physician confirming he was in “excellent” overall health, with physical exams in the “normal range” and “exceptional” cognitive test results. The Trump campaign also included two letters from Ronny Jackson, Trump's former White House physician, providing updates on Trump's condition following his gunshot wound in July.<br />
<br />
Kamala Harris is keenly focused on North Carolina, a crucial battleground state that hasn't voted for a Democratic presidential nominee since Barack Obama in 2008. Polls indicate that North Carolina is a toss-up, and a Democratic win could complicate Trump's path to the 270 electoral votes required for victory.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[North Korea on Friday accused South Korea of sending drones to scatter a "huge number" of anti-North leaflets over Pyongyang.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea is getting ready to blow up roads that cross the heavily militarised border with South Korea, Seoul said on Monday, amid an escalating war of words after the North accused its rival of sending drones over its capital Pyongyang.</p>

<p>North Korean troops were working under camouflage on the roads on its side of the border near the west and east coasts that are likely preparations to blow up the roads, possibly as early as on Monday, South Korea's military spokesman said.</p>

<p>Last week, North Korea's Army said it would completely cut roads and railways connected to South Korea and fortify the areas on its side of the border, state media KCNA reported.</p>

<p>Separately, North Korea on Friday accused South Korea of sending drones to scatter a "huge number" of anti-North leaflets over Pyongyang, in what it called a political and military provocation that could lead to armed conflict.</p>

<p>Lee Sung-jun, a spokesman for the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff, declined on Monday to answer questions over whether the South Korean military or civilians flew the drones.</p>

<p>In further statements over the weekend, North Korea warned of a "horrible disaster" if South Korean drones were again found to be flying over Pyongyang. On Sunday, it said it has put eight fully armed artillery units at the border "on standby to open fire."</p>

<p>South Korea's military has said its refusal to answer questions on the drones is because addressing what the North has alleged would be to get drawn into a tactic by Pyongyang to fabricate excuses for provocations.</p>

<p>South Korea has sought to boost its anti-drone defences since 2022, Lee said, when five North Korean drones entered its airspace and flew over the capital Seoul for several hours.</p>

<p>Lee Kyoung-haing, an expert in military drone operations at Jungwon University, said civilians would have no trouble getting drones with ranges of 300 km (186 miles), the round trip from the South to Pyongyang, with light payloads such as leaflets.</p>

<p>On Sunday, North Korea's defence ministry said the drones, which it said were detected over Pyongyang on three days earlier this month, were the kind that required a special launcher or a runway and it was impossible a civilian group could launch them.</p>

<p>The two Koreas are still technically at war after their 1950-53 war ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.</p>

<p>The cross-border links are remnants of periods of rapprochement between the countries including a 2018 summit between the leaders when they declared there would be no more war and a new era of peace had opened.</p>

<p>North Korea has reintroduced heavy weapons into the Demilitarized Zone border buffer and restored guard posts, after the two sides declared a 2018 military agreement aimed at easing tensions no longer valid.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Famed explorer Christopher Columbus was not Italian, as traditionally believed, but possibly a Sephardic Jew from Spain who concealed his true heritage to avoid persecution, a new genetic study suggests.<br />

The research, led by Spanish scientists, aims to resolve long-standing uncertainty surrounding Columbus' background. For years, historians have debated the birthplace of the 15th-century navigator, said to have hailed from Genoa, a republic on Italy's northwest coast. However, DNA analysis of Columbus' remains, housed in Seville Cathedral, has produced compelling evidence challenging this narrative, according to a report in the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg2049ezpko">BBC</a>.<br />
<br />
“We have DNA from Christopher Columbus, very partial but sufficient. We have DNA from Hernando Colón, his son. And both in the Y [male] chromosome and in the mitochondrial DNA [from the mother] of Hernando there are traits compatible with Jewish origin,” Forensic expert and investigator Miguel Lorente said in a documentary titled, Columbus DNA: The True Origin, which aired in Spain recently.<br />
<br />
The research began in 2003 when forensic medicine professor José Antonio Lorente from Granada University, alongside historian Marcial Castro, exhumed what were thought to be Columbus' remains from Seville Cathedral. Their findings, supported by historical context, suggest that Columbus may have hidden his Jewish roots or converted to Catholicism to avoid the religious persecution prevalent in Spain at the time.<br />
<br />
Although researchers have yet to pinpoint Columbus' exact birthplace, they believe it is likely somewhere in Western Europe, with Valencia, Spain, as a strong possibility, according to a report in the New York Post.<br />
<br />
The term “Sephardic” derives from Sefarad, the Hebrew word for Spain. The DNA results, described by Lorente as “almost absolutely reliable,” dismiss numerous alternative theories about Columbus' origins, including claims that he may have been born in countries such as Poland, Portugal or even Scandinavia.<br />
<br />
<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/columbus-final-resting-place-revealed-researchers-to-confirm-ethnicity-6774619">Columbus</a> is best known for his expeditions across the Atlantic, backed by the Spanish monarchy, in search of a new route to Asia. Instead, he made landfall in the Caribbean, igniting a wave of European exploration that would eventually lead to the colonisation of the Americas. While his voyages were significant for their historical impact, they have also been the subject of controversy due to the devastating consequences for the native populations of the Americas. His crew reportedly brutally treated indigenous people. According to a report in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/10/14/here-are-indigenous-people-christopher-columbus-his-men-could-not-annihilate/">The Washington Post</a>, Columbus' men were known to have maimed and enslaved local people, including children.<br />
<br />
Columbus died in 1506 in Valladolid, Spain, and his remains were moved multiple times over the centuries before finally resting in Seville.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[The United States has deployed one of its most advanced missile defence systems, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), along with 100 US troops to Israel.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States has deployed one of its most advanced missile defence systems, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-israel-awaits-thaad-anti-missile-system-from-us-as-hezbollah-ups-strikes-6784117">Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)</a>, along with 100 US troops to Israel. The move came in response to a recent barrage of Iranian missile strikes on Israel, retaliating for the assassinations of key Iranian and Hezbollah leaders.</p>

<h2><strong>What is THAAD?</strong></h2>

<p>The THAAD is a state-of-the-art missile defence system designed to counter short, medium and intermediate-range ballistic missile threats. It is the only US system capable of intercepting targets inside and outside the atmosphere. THAAD undergoes continuous improvements to enhance its effectiveness against evolving threats.</p>

<h2><strong>Why THAAD?</strong></h2>

<p>The Joe Biden administration came to Israel's rescue to protect the country against ballistic missile attacks from Iran or its proxies. With Israel preparing to respond to Iran, particularly following the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, the deployment of THAAD bolsters Israel's defences.</p>

<p><strong>READ </strong>| <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-gaza-iran-hamas-sought-irans-help-for-israel-attack-planned-9-11-style-bombing-report-6779663">A 9/11-Style Bombing Plan Was Scrapped Before Hamas Launched Israel Attack</a></p>

<p>Iranian authorities, meanwhile, warned that any Israeli aggression, including potential strikes on Tehran's nuclear facilities, would provoke a forceful response. In light of these escalating threats, Israel requested US support for arms and ammunition, something it has solicited over the last year in its war against Gaza, killing nearly 45,000 people and displacing the entire population.</p>

<p>Not too long ago, its attacks on Lebanon also killed nearly 2,500 people and injured 10,000 others.</p>

<h2><strong>How does THAAD work?</strong></h2>

<p>THAAD is designed to intercept incoming ballistic missiles during the "terminal phase" of their flight - the final stage before impact. This system can target missiles both inside and outside the atmosphere (endoatmospheric and exoatmospheric). THAAD defends against short, medium and intermediate-range ballistic missiles, making it highly adaptable to various types of missile threats.</p>

<p>A unique feature of the system is that it does not carry explosive warheads. Instead, it destroys targets using kinetic energy, meaning it hits incoming missiles with force rather than detonating a warhead.</p>

<h2><strong>Components of THAAD</strong></h2>

<p><strong>THAAD is composed of four main elements:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Interceptor: Destroys incoming missiles using impact force.</li>
	<li>Launch vehicle: Mobile trucks that carry and launch the interceptors.</li>
	<li>Radar: Tracks and detects threats from a range of 870 to 3,000 km.</li>
	<li>Fire control system: Coordinates the launching and targeting of interceptors.</li>
</ul>

<p>A standard THAAD battery includes six truck-mounted launchers, each carrying up to eight interceptors, along with radar and radio equipment. Reloading each launcher takes about 30 minutes, and a full battery requires 95 US soldiers to operate.</p>

<h2><strong>US role in THAAD deployment</strong></h2>

<p>One of the critical aspects of THAAD is that it is exclusively operated by US personnel. If deployed in Israel, this would require the presence of US troops on Israeli soil. The US Army currently possesses seven THAAD batteries deployed in various global conflict zones as part of its defensive strategy.</p>

<p>The decision to send THAAD to Israel made just weeks before the US presidential election, marks the first major US military deployment to Israel since the country started bombing Gaza.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have finally uncovered the secrets of Arthropleura, a colossal, millipede-like creature that roamed Earth 340 million years ago. This ancient arthropod's enormous size and mysterious existence had baffled palaeontologists for centuries.&nbsp;However, the discovery of juvenile fossils in a French coal field, collected in the 1980s, has now provided crucial clues. Using advanced CT scanning techniques, researchers were able to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ads9192">model the head</a> without damaging the delicate fossils.</p>

<p>The scans revealed a round head adorned with two short, bell-shaped antennae, and two protruding eyes similar to those of crabs. A small mouth, likely used for scavenging leaves and bark, was also identified. Additionally, the findings confirmed that Arthropleura shed its exoskeleton through an opening on its head, a characteristic common among arthropods.&nbsp;Despite its massive size, the creature's diet was likely just vegetation from the forests it lived in.</p>

<p>A co-author of the study Mickael Lheritier explained, ''We discovered that it had the body of a millipede, but the head of a centipede.''</p>

<p>Palebiologist James Lamsdell, who wasn't involved in the study, said: "We've been wanting to see what the head of this animal looked like for a really long time.&nbsp;When you chip away at the rock, you don't know what part of a delicate&nbsp;fossil&nbsp;may have been lost or damaged.''</p>

<p>As the ancestor of centipedes and millipedes, Arthropleura belongs to the vast arthropod group, which encompasses a diverse range of creatures. This group includes insects, crustaceans such as crabs, as well as arachnids like spiders and scorpions.</p>

<p>Since the late 1800s, scientists have painstakingly collected and analysed Arthropleura remnants, gradually piecing together the puzzle of its existence and significance in the ancient world.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In response to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, the Pentagon has announced the deployment of an advanced anti-missile defence system, the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), to Israel. The move aimed at bolstering Israel's air defences following recent missile attacks from Iran and increasing hostilities in the region. Alongside the THAAD battery, approximately 100 US troops are being deployed to operate the system.</p>

<p>The Pentagon's decision to deploy the THAAD system comes in the wake of Iran's missile attacks on Israel on April 13 and October 1. THAAD, designed to intercept ballistic missiles, adds another layer of protection to Israel's existing defence infrastructure, potentially helping mitigate future missile threats from Iran or its proxies.&nbsp;The THAAD is designed to counter short, medium and intermediate-range ballistic missile threats.</p>

<p>The US presence is intended to not only defend Israel but also provide a strategic advantage as Israel contemplates retaliatory action against Iran.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>READ </strong>| <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-gaza-iran-hamas-sought-irans-help-for-israel-attack-planned-9-11-style-bombing-report-6779663">A 9/11-Style Bombing Plan Was Scrapped Before Hamas Launched Israel Attack</a></p>

<p>This escalation comes amid growing concern that Israel may mount an offensive against Iranian assets, further destabilising an already volatile region. The US, while firmly backing Israel's right to self-defence, has been involved in high-level consultations with Israeli officials to manage the response and prevent an uncontrollable escalation of hostilities, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2024/10/13/politics/israel-iran-antimissile-system-us-troops" rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN </a>reported.</p>

<p>According to CNN, since the surprise Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which resulted in over 1,200 Israeli deaths, the US military has significantly ramped up its presence in the Middle East. Aircraft carriers and warships have been deployed to the eastern Mediterranean, Red Sea, and Arabian Sea, while additional air defences have been stationed throughout the region. US troops have been positioned in Cyprus to assist with evacuation plans.</p>

<p>The deployment of US forces and equipment, such as the THAAD system, also serves as a signal to Iran and its allies, including Hezbollah, of the serious consequences of any further escalation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the US bolsters Israel's defences, the conflict on the ground has intensified. On Sunday, Israel's military confirmed that four soldiers were killed in a Hezbollah drone strike on a military base in Binyamina, near Haifa. Israeli emergency services reported that over 60 individuals were wounded in the attack, ranging from mild to critical injuries. The drone strike is seen as a direct response to recent Israeli airstrikes on Hezbollah positions in Lebanon, including a devastating strike on central Beirut that killed 22 people.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, which has been launching rocket and drone attacks into Israel for over a year, has escalated its operations, with more frequent strikes reaching deeper into Israeli territory. Israel's sophisticated air defences, including the Iron Dome, have intercepted many of these projectiles, but the intensity of Hezbollah's attacks is testing the limits of Israel's defence systems.</p>

<p>In a warning, Hezbollah declared that the attack on Binyamina was just the beginning, stating that Israel would face much worse if it continued its aggression.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>He said drivers had been subjected to "humiliating security screening" and even temporarily detained at a checkpoint, "which is unacceptable".</p>

<p>The WHO regularly criticises the obstacles the Israeli authorities put in the way of these supply and patient evacuation missions.</p>

<p>It did so again on Friday during a news briefing in Geneva specifically on the subject of this relief mission to the northern Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>"One-off missions are not enough. There is a sustained need for resupplying hospitals to keep them functioning," Tedros said, reiterating his call "for sustained facilitation of humanitarian missions and ensuring safety for humanitarian staff; and for a ceasefire".</p>

<p>According to the WHO, 13 patients in critical condition were transferred from Kamal Adwan hospital to Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City.</p>

<p>"The hospital is overwhelmed and still serving around 60 in-patients and receiving at least 50-70 injured daily," Tedros said.</p>

<p>Six other patients who had been transferred earlier from al-Awda Hospital to Kamal Adwan were also taken to Al-Shifa, along with those accompanying them.</p>

<p>The resupply mission also delivered 20,000 litres (5,300 gallons) of fuel to keep Kamal Adwan and Al-Awda operational, and 23,000 litres of fuel were delivered to Al-Sahaba Hospital, along with 800 units of blood and essential medicines and supplies.</p>

<p>The fuel is mainly used to run the hospitals' generators to ensure power supply.</p>

<p>The hospital infrastructure throughout the Gaza Strip is very fragile after a year of war between Israel and the Islamist movement Hamas, with many facilities having been hit by shelling or fighting.</p>

<p>The Israeli military accuses Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip and carried out the October 7, 2023 attacks in Israel that triggered the war, of operating under the cover of these buildings, which normally enjoy increased protection under the rules of war.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Singapore's economy grew more than expected in the third quarter as a rush for all things linked to artificial intelligence drove up demand for computer chips, according to preliminary data Monday.</p>

<p>The Asian city-state's economic performance is often seen as a barometer of the global environment because of its heavy reliance on international trade.</p>

<p>The trade ministry said a healthy rebound in the key manufacturing sector powered the 4.1 percent year-on-year growth in the three months to September.</p>

<p>Economists had projected growth of less than 4.0 percent.</p>

<p>Manufacturing, which includes computer chips, expanded 7.5 percent year-on-year, bouncing back from a 1.1 percent decline in the previous three months.</p>

<p>"Tech did all the heavy lifting for the manufacturing sector in the third quarter," said Song Seng Wun, Singapore economic advisor at financial services firm CGS International Securities.</p>

<p>"We have more and more consumer products being launched incorporating artificial intelligence from mobile phones to cars and vacuum cleaners," he told AFP.</p>

<p>The government in August upgraded its economic growth forecast for this year to 2.0-3.0 percent from 1.0-3.0 percent.</p>

<p>But Song said that "short of another extreme shock in the last two months", he expected growth for the full year to surpass the upper end of that.</p>

<p>In a separate statement, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), said it will "maintain the prevailing rate of appreciation" of the Singapore dollar as the risks to inflation are "more balanced compared to three months ago".</p>

<p>The city-state uses the exchange rate -- the Singapore dollar is pegged to a basket of currencies of its key trading partners -- to deal with inflation as it imports most of its needs.</p>

<p>"For the rest of 2024, Singapore's growth should be sustained by the ongoing upswing in the electronics and trade cycles as well as the easing in global financial conditions," the MAS said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China deployed planes and ships to encircle Taiwan on Monday, in drills Beijing said were aimed at sending a "stern warning" to "separatist" forces on the self-ruled island.</p>

<p>Beijing has not ruled out using force to bring Taiwan under its control and Monday's drills represent its fourth round of large-scale war games in the past two years.</p>

<p>China's drills come days after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Beijing against taking action in response to a speech by Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te during the island's National Day celebrations.</p>

<p>Lai, who took office in May, has been more outspoken than his predecessor Tsai Ing-wen in defending Taiwan's sovereignty, angering Beijing, which calls him a "separatist". Taiwan condemned the latest exercises as "irrational and provocative" and said it has dispatched "appropriate forces" in response.</p>

<p>AFP journalists near the Hsinchu air force base, in the north of Taiwan, saw four fighter jets take off on Monday.</p>

<p>The drills, dubbed Joint Sword-2024B, "test the joint operations capabilities of the theater command's troops", Beijing said.</p>

<p>They are taking place in "areas to the north, south and east of Taiwan Island," said Captain Li Xi, spokesman for the Chinese military's Eastern Theater Command.</p>

<p>The drills are "focusing on subjects of sea-air combat-readiness patrol, blockade on key ports and areas", Li said.</p>

<p>They also practised an "assault on maritime and ground targets" and "joint seizure of comprehensive superiority".</p>

<p>China's coast guard was also dispatched to conduct "inspections" around the island.</p>

<p>A diagram released by the coast guard showed four fleets encircling Taiwan and moving in an anticlockwise direction around the island.</p>

<p>Taiwan said it had detected "convoys" of China coast guard ships "in our northern, southwest and eastern waters".</p>

<p>China has ramped up military activity around Taiwan in recent years, sending in warplanes and other military aircraft while its ships maintain a near-constant presence around the island's waters.</p>

<p>Taiwan said Sunday it had detected a Chinese aircraft carrier group to its south in the Bashi Channel, a waterway that separates the island from the Philippines, that appeared to be heading towards the western Pacific.</p>

<p>"In the face of enemy threats, all officers and soldiers of the country are in full readiness," Taiwan's defence ministry said Monday.</p>

<p>"We are determined and confident to ensure national defence security." - 'Provocations' - In his speech on Thursday, Lai vowed to "resist annexation" of the island, and insisted Beijing and Taipei were "not subordinate to each other". China warned after the speech that Lai's "provocations" would result in "disaster" for the people of Taiwan. Beijing on Monday said the drills were "a legitimate and necessary operation for safeguarding state sovereignty and national unity". Beijing's state broadcaster CCTV released a video warning: "the greater the provocation, the tighter the reins". The current dispute between China and Taiwan dates back to a civil war in which the nationalist forces of Chiang Kai-shek were defeated by Mao Zedong's communist fighters and fled to Taiwan in 1949. Lai's Democratic Progressive Party has long defended the sovereignty and democracy of Taiwan, which has its own government, military and currency. Beijing has sought to erase Taipei from the international stage, blocking it from global forums and poaching its diplomatic allies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on the UN chief to move peacekeepers deployed in south Lebanon out of "harm's way", saying Hezbollah was using them as "human shields".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on the UN chief on Sunday to move peacekeepers deployed in south Lebanon out of "harm's way", saying Hezbollah was using them as "human shields".</p>

<p>His call to UN chief Antonio Guterres came a day after the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) repeated its refusal to withdraw from the border area after five of its members were wounded in the Israel-Hezbollah war.</p>

<p>"Mr Secretary General, get the UNIFIL forces out of harm's way. It should be done right now, immediately," Netanyahu said in a video statement issued by his office.</p>

<p>Speaking ahead of a cabinet meeting, Netanyahu said Israeli forces had asked UNIFIL several times to leave, saying that the peacekeepers' presence had "the effect of providing Hezbollah terrorists with human shields".</p>

<p>"Your refusal to evacuate the UNIFIL soldiers makes them hostages of Hezbollah. This endangers both them and the lives of our soldiers," the premier said.</p>

<p>"We regret the harm to UNIFIL soldiers and we are doing our utmost to prevent such harm. But the simplest and most obvious way to ensure this is simply to withdraw them from the danger zone."</p>

<p>UNIFIL has refused to leave its positions in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>"There was a unanimous decision to stay because it's important for the UN flag to still fly high in this region, and to be able to report to the Security Council," UNIFIL spokesman Andrea Tenenti told AFP in an interview on Saturday.</p>

<p>He said Israel had asked UNIFIL to withdraw from positions "up to five kilometres (three miles) from the Blue Line" separating both countries, but the peacekeepers refused.</p>

<p>That would have included its 29 positions in south Lebanon.</p>

<p><strong>'New chapter'</strong></p>

<p>UNIFIL, a mission of about 9,500 troops of various nationalities, was created following Israel's 1978 invasion of Lebanon.</p>

<p>It is currently tasked with monitoring a ceasefire that ended a 33-day war in 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Forty contributor nations to UNIFIL said on Saturday that they "strongly condemn recent attacks" on the peacekeepers.</p>

<p>"Such actions must stop immediately and should be adequately investigated," said the joint statement, posted on X by the Polish UN mission and signed by nations including leading contributors Indonesia, Italy and India.</p>

<p>On Sunday, UNIFIL said it had demanded explanations from the Israeli army over what it said were "shocking violations" against their force, including forcing entry into one of their positions.</p>

<p>Earlier on Sunday morning Israeli tanks had "destroyed" a UNIFIL position and "forcibly entered" there, UNIFIL said.</p>

<p>But the Israeli military said a tank had collided with a UN peacekeeping post when it came under fire during an incident when multiple soldiers were injured.</p>

<p>Late Sunday, the Israeli military said that over the past month about 25 rockets and missiles had been launched at Israel from Hezbollah compounds "embedded near UNIFIL posts" in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>It said one of the attacks even killed two Israeli soldiers, but did not specify when the incident happened.</p>

<p>Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the Israeli call on UNIFIL to abandon the south.</p>

<p>"The warning that Netanyahu addressed to... Guterres demanding the removal of the UNIFIL represents a new chapter in the enemy's approach of not complying with international" norms, Mikati said. Earlier, Netanyahu said the criticism of Israel was misplaced and should be directed at Hezbollah. "Instead of criticising Israel, they should direct their criticism to Hezbollah, which uses UNIFIL as a human shield," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Content from satirical websites is being repurposed to fuel political misinformation and sow confusion ahead of the November 5 US presidential election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did a Donald Trump supporter burn down his house while igniting an LGBTQ flag? Did a conservative think tank recommend "period passports" to monitor pregnancies? Was Kamala Harris's running mate dissed by his own state's professional football team?</p>

<p>Do not be fooled. This is satire.</p>

<p>But it is no laughing matter.</p>

<p>These claims were widely mistaken as real across social media, underscoring how content from satirical websites is being repurposed to fuel political misinformation and sow confusion ahead of the November 5 presidential election.</p>

<p>The nonprofit News Literacy Project (NLP) calls such misinformation "stolen satire" -- plucking satirical content from its original context and presenting it as accurate information without a clear disclaimer.</p>

<p>"People who aren't in on the joke take it at face value," Hannah Covington, a senior director at NLP, told AFP.</p>

<p>Ahead of the National Football League regular season, social media users falsely claimed the Minnesota Vikings had denounced Tim Walz, the state's governor and Democratic vice presidential candidate, questioning his leadership.</p>

<p>But the Vikings had issued no such statement.</p>

<p>AFP's fact-checkers found that the falsehood stemmed from the Facebook page of America's Last Line of Defense, a network of parody websites run by Christopher Blair.</p>

<p>The group clarifies that "nothing on this page is real."</p>

<p>Blair said his target audience shares such claims because they "fit with their confirmation-biased narrative of the world."</p>

<p>"They don't necessarily share them because they believe them," Blair told AFP.</p>

<p>"Whether or not a thing is true no longer matters to about 35 million Americans. If it's what they want to hear, they'll pass it along."</p>

<p><strong>'Weaponized misinformation'</strong></p>

<p>Such humorous fiction –- peddled by both sides of the political aisle -- often makes the internet erupt with laughter, but researchers are not laughing about its potential to fool the public.</p>

<p>"Sharing weaponized misinformation in the form of lazy jokes has quickly come to define the developing presidential campaign between" Trump and Vice President Harris, tech writer Casey Newton wrote in an online commentary.</p>

<p>"Across social networks, Democrats and Republicans are flooding the feed with obviously untrue statements about one another and calling it a joke."</p>

<p>Some viral posts falsely claimed that an Iowa-based fan of "Make America Great Again" -- the political movement and slogan popularized by Trump -- had mistakenly burned his house down while attempting to incinerate an LGBTQ flag.</p>

<p>The man was ridiculed as "stupid" and "homophobic."</p>

<p>But AFP found that the claim originated in satire.</p>

<p>Other posts falsely claimed that Project 2025, a set of policy proposals by the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, recommends mandating that women carry "period passports" to monitor their menstrual cycle and pregnancies.</p>

<p>The Heritage Foundation, widely considered aligned with Trump's agenda, told AFP that the claim was "absolutely false."</p>

<p>The Halfway Post, founded by the political satirist Dash MacIntyre, first published both claims.</p>

<p><strong>'Outrage into clicks'</strong></p>

<p>MacIntyre, who said Trump's election in 2017 inspired him to start his satire company, insisted that he was not trying to "proliferate fake news" but that politicians deserve lampooning in a climate of "political insanity."</p>

<p>"It's not really my fault that if I fictionalize alleged incidents involving Trump to critique and satirize his awful personality... so many viewers take it seriously," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"There are always gullible and low-information people, but I don't think that means satirical comedy doesn't belong" on social media, he added.</p>

<p>But when passively scrolling the internet, such posts without labels or context may look real, the NLP's Covington said, adding that some clout-chasing actors were exploiting the trend to "convert outrage into clicks."</p>

<p>Elon Musk, owner of the platform X who has endorsed Trump, recently courted criticism for sharing a deepfake video in which a voiceover mimicking Harris declared that she does not "know the first thing about running the country."</p>

<p>The video was originally posted by an X account that labeled it as a "parody," but Musk's repost made no such disclosure.</p>

<p>"Clear and consistent practices like watermarking something as satire is so important to help preserve its original context," Covington said.</p>

<p>"Most platforms do not have any real policies they consistently enforce around this kind of content, so it's up to us as consumers to verify before sharing."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's military said a Hezbollah drone had killed four soldiers at one of its northern bases Sunday, as it expanded its bombardments of Lebanon and troops battled militants across the border.</p>

<p>The attack on a military training camp in Binyamina, near Haifa, is the deadliest such assault on an Israeli base since September 23, when Israel increased its attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon. Emergency services reported more than 60 wounded.</p>

<p>Authorities in Gaza, meanwhile, said the death toll from an Israeli strike Sunday on a school being used as a shelter for displaced people had risen to 15, including whole families.</p>

<p>And as fighting raged between Israel and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon's south, United Nations peacekeepers said they had again in the firing line.</p>

<p>They said Israeli troops "forcibly" entered a UN position with two tanks, after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on the force to withdraw from the area.</p>

<p>Israel's military said a tank had backed into the UN post while under fire.</p>

<p><strong>Hezbollah promises worse</strong></p>

<p>Iran-backed Hezbollah said late Sunday that it launched "a squadron of attack drones" at the Binyamina camp, around 30 kilometres (20 miles) south of the major city of Haifa.</p>

<p>The strike was in response to Israeli attacks, including air strikes on Thursday that Lebanon's health ministry said killed at least 22 people in central Beirut.</p>

<p>In a later statement, Hezbollah warned Israel that "what it witnessed today in southern Haifa is nothing compared to what awaits it if it decides to continue its aggression against our noble and dear people".</p>

<p>An Israeli volunteer rescue service, United Hatzalah, said its teams in Binyamina assisted "over 60 wounded people" with injuries from mild to critical.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has been firing rockets and drones into Israel for more than a year in support of Hamas militants in Gaza.</p>

<p>Since late September, however, its strikes have reached further into the country.</p>

<p>Israel's sophisticated air defences have intercepted most of the projectiles, with few casualties caused by strikes or falling debris.</p>

<p><strong>Defend this 'blessed land'</strong></p>

<p>Israel's recent strikes have increasingly focused on areas beyond Hezbollah's traditional strongholds in southern Beirut, and Lebanon's south and east.</p>

<p>Israel said its air force hit "Hezbollah launchers, anti-tank missile posts, weapons storage facilities" and other targets, while on the ground its soldiers "eliminated dozens" of fighters.</p>

<p>Lebanon's official National News Agency (NNA) said Israeli forces had "escalated their attacks" on southern Lebanon with "successive air strikes" pounding several border villages.</p>

<p>It later reported that an Israeli strike on Mayfadoun, near Nabatiyeh, in southern Lebanon, had killed five people and wounded one other.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said its forces clashed several times with Israeli troops who tried to "infiltrate" villages along the border.</p>

<p>Before the drone strike it had said it launched a salvo of rockets at a "base in southern Haifa".</p>

<p>The group later aired an audio recording of its slain leader Hassan Nasrallah calling on fighters to "defend this holy and blessed land and this honourable people".</p>

<p>Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli air strike in south Beirut on September 27, and several other senior commanders of the movement have also been killed.</p>

<p>Israel's military said about 115 projectiles fired by Hezbollah had crossed into Israeli territory by Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>A Hezbollah fighter was captured emerging from a tunnel in south Lebanon on Sunday, Israel's military said, the first such announcement since the start of the ground offensive.</p>

<p><strong>'Shocking violations'</strong></p>

<p>UN peacekeepers accused Israeli troops of breaking through a gate and entering one of their positions before dawn Sunday in south Lebanon, the latest of several incidents the UNIFIL mission has reported since Thursday.</p>

<p>Five Blue Helmets have so far been injured, provoking international condemnation.</p>

<p>"Two IDF (Israeli military) Merkava tanks destroyed the position's main gate and forcibly entered the position" in the Ramia area, before leaving 45 minutes later, UNIFIL said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military later said a tank "backed several meters into a UNIFIL post" while "under fire" and attempting to evacuate injured soldiers.</p>

<p>Earlier Sunday, Netanyahu had called on the UN to move peacekeepers in southern Lebanon out of harm's way, after the mission rejected requests to abandon its positions.</p>

<p>The peacekeepers' presence had "the effect of providing Hezbollah terrorists with human shields", said Netanyahu.</p>

<p>UN chief Antonio Guterres on Sunday said "attacks" against peacekeepers "may constitute a war crime".</p>

<p>UNIFIL, with about 9,500 troops, is in southern Lebanon under the longstanding UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which stipulated that only the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers should be deployed in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>Three Lebanese soldiers were wounded on Sunday, the country's army said, when Israeli forces fired on military vehicles in the Marjayoun area.</p>

<p>French President Emmanuel Macron, in a phone call with Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian, appealed to Iran to support "a general de-escalation" in Lebanon and Gaza, his office said.</p>

<p><strong>US sending more air-defences</strong></p>

<p>Gaza's civil defence agency said Israeli shelling had killed at least 15 people and wounded dozens more Sunday at a school turned shelter for displaced Palestinians in central Gaza's Nuseirat camp.</p>

<p>"The school was bombarded with a large volley of Israeli artillery, resulting in an initial death toll of 15 martyrs, including children, women and entire families, and 50 wounded," said Mahmud Bassal, spokesman for the agency.</p>

<p>Israel's military said it was "looking into the reports".</p>

<p>The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said late Sunday that a WHO-Red Cross operation had managed to resupply two hospitals in northern Gaza.</p>

<p>"WHO and partners finally managed to reach Kamal Adwan and Al-Sahaba hospitals yesterday after 9 attempts this past week," he posted on X.</p>

<p>Hamas sparked the war in Gaza with the deadliest-ever attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The number includes hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza says more than 42,000 people, the majority civilians, have been killed since Israel's military campaign began there. The UN considers these figures to be reliable.</p>

<p>Israeli strikes in Lebanon have killed more than 1,300 people since September 23, according to an AFP tally of official figures, including for Saturday.</p>

<p>That toll exceeds the entire Lebanese toll of 1,200 -- mostly civilians -- in the last Hezbollah-Israel war in 2006, when 160 people, mostly soldiers, died in Israel.</p>

<p>The Pentagon said it would deploy a high-altitude anti-missile system and its US military crew to Israel to help the ally protect itself from potential Iranian attack.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Norwegian Nobel Committee will announce the Nobel economics prize on Monday, with specialists on credit, the role of government, and wealth inequality seen as possible contenders.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Closing the season, the Norwegian Nobel Committee will announce the Nobel economics prize on Monday, with specialists on credit, the role of government, and wealth inequality seen as possible contenders.</p>

<p>The winner of the prestigious prize, which last year went to American economist Claudia Goldin, will be announced at 11:45 am (0945 GMT).</p>

<p>Goldin was recognised "for having advanced our understanding of women's labour market outcomes" and was ironically one of very few women ever handed the prize.</p>

<p>Of the 93 laureates honoured since 1969, only three have been women -- Goldin in 2023, her compatriot Elinor Ostrom in 2009 and French-American Esther Duflo in 2019.</p>

<p>"The general trend in society to attach greater importance to parity and diversity has broadened the research process," Mikael Carlsson, professor of economics at Uppsala University in Sweden, told AFP.</p>

<p>"However, this is not the criteria taken into account when assessing whether a scientific contribution is worthy of a Nobel Prize," he insisted.</p>

<p>His bet is that Japan's Nobuhiro Kiyotaki and Britain's John H. Moore will win for their work on how small shocks can affect economic cycles, or American Susan Athey for her work on market design.</p>

<p>But what criteria should be used to predict a Nobel winner?</p>

<p>For Magnus Henrekson of the Research Institute of Industrial Economics in Stockholm, the most obvious place to start is to look at the research interests of the committee that decides which candidates are worthy.</p>

<p>Its chairman specialises in development economics, though Henrekson said it was doubtful the field would be honoured as it was recently awarded a prize.</p>

<p>"I don't think it's likely that the same field will win the prize two years running," Henrekson said.</p>

<p>Poverty or wealth inequality?</p>

<p>Frenchman Philippe Aghion, as well as Americans George Loewenstein, Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart are academics often mentioned as worthy of the prize.</p>

<p>Turkish-American Daron Acemoglu, a professor at MIT in the United States and the author of several best-sellers including "Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty," is considered a top name this year.</p>

<p>Acemoglu could potentially be paired with Russian-American Andrei Shleifer.</p>

<p>Predicting the winner is always tricky, but online statistics platform Statista noted that by looking at past recipients and the state of current research in economics, "we have a decent idea of candidates who are likely to win a Nobel in their career, if not in 2024".</p>

<p>It believes Acemoglu could get the nod for his "work on the long-run development of institutions which facilitate or hinder economic growth".</p>

<p>Other possible candidates include macroeconomists such as Frenchman Olivier Blanchard, and Americans Larry Summers and Gregory Mankiw.</p>

<p>Economists who work on wealth inequality, such as France's Thomas Piketty and Gabriel Zucman as well as French-American Emmanuel Saez have also often been mentioned in recent years.</p>

<p>Canadian-American Janet Currie, a specialist in anti-poverty policies, is a favourite for analytics group Clarivate, which keeps an eye on potential Nobel science laureates based on citations.</p>

<p>It also spotlighted British-Indian Partha Dasgupta as a potential winner for "integrating nature and its resources in the human economy".</p>

<p>'False Nobel'</p>

<p>Paolo Mauro, a former member of the International Monetary Fund, was also put forward for "empirical studies of the effects of corruption on investment and economic growth".</p>

<p>The economics prize is the only Nobel not among the original five created in the will of Swedish scientist Alfred Nobel, who died in 1896.</p>

<p>It was instead created through a donation from the Swedish central bank in 1968, leading detractors to dub it "a false Nobel".</p>

<p>However, like for the other Nobel science prizes, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences decides the winner and follows the same selection process.</p>

<p>The economics prize wraps up this year's Nobel season, which honoured achievements in artificial intelligence for the physics and chemistry prizes, while the Peace Prize went to Japanese group Nihon Hidankyo, committed to fighting nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>South Korea's Han Kan won the literature prize -- the only woman laureate so far this year -- while the medicine prize lauded discoveries in understanding gene regulation.</p>

<p>The Nobel Prizes consist of a diploma, a gold medal and a one-million-dollar lump sum.</p>

<p>They will be presented at ceremonies in Stockholm and Oslo on December 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of scientist and prize creator Alfred Nobel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA["Life has stopped since October 2023," said Milad al-Alam, Mayor of village Rmeish, saying most commercial activity had come to a halt since Hezbollah started launching rockets across the border into Israel.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanese Christian Joseph Jarjour was hoping for a peaceful retirement at home in south Lebanon, but has instead found himself caught in the crossfire of the Israel-Hezbollah war.</p>

<p>"We're trapped," said the 68-year-old retired teacher in the southern village of Rmeish, around two kilometres (one mile) from the Israeli border.</p>

<p>After almost a year of cross-border fire, Israel began conducting a wave of strikes targeting Hezbollah strongholds and sent ground troops across the border late last month.</p>

<p>Jarjour's hometown is among a handful of Christian villages in south Lebanon that have largely been spared the worst of the violence but remain caught between the two sides.</p>

<p>"When Israel bombards, it flies over our heads. And when Hezbollah fires back, it also whizzes by above," Jarjour told AFP by phone during a rare moment of internet connectivity.</p>

<p>"We're peaceful, we don't have any weapons. We've never liked war," he said.</p>

<p>"We want to stay in our homes and we don't want to choose sides."</p>

<p>The violence since September 23 has killed more than 1,200 people in Lebanon and forced a million more from their homes, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures.</p>

<p>Jarjour said roads out of Rmeish were unsafe so it was "very hard" to escape and drive northwards to the capital, Beirut.</p>

<p><strong>'Hostages'</strong></p>

<p>Milad al-Alam, mayor of the village of red-tiled houses surrounded by green hills known for growing tobacco, said most of its 6,000 inhabitants had stayed put.</p>

<p>But today the walls of some of the houses there are cracked from the nearby explosions, and fresh vegetables are no longer delivered from outside.</p>

<p>Ramping up the pressure on the village, hundreds of people, mostly Christians, fleeing nearby areas have sought refuge there.</p>

<p>"Life has stopped since October 2023," said Alam, saying most commercial activity had come to a halt since Hezbollah started launching rockets across the border into Israel.</p>

<p>Hezbollah and Israel have been foes for decades, exchanging fire since the Iran-backed group opened a front last year in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas after the October 7 attack on Israel.</p>

<p>"Anyone who had savings has spent them over the past few months," Alam said.</p>

<p>During the 33-day war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, most Rmeish villagers had also stayed put.</p>

<p>Alam said he had been able to organise a delivery of humanitarian aid to the village last week with the protection of the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers.</p>

<p>"But we cannot replace the state," he said, in a country paralysed by political deadlock on top of its worst financial crisis in history since 2019.</p>

<p>Christian-majority villages have largely been spared in recent Israeli bombardments, unlike neighbouring Shiite-majority areas that have been ravaged and emptied of their inhabitants.</p>

<p>In January, Maronite Patriarch Beshara al-Rai, the spiritual leader of Lebanon's largest Christian sect, said villagers along the frontier had become "hostages" that were "bearing the brunt" of the conflict.</p>

<p>Lebanon is home to 18 officially recognised religious denominations, and around 30 percent of the population is Christian.</p>

<p><strong>'Bound to our land'</strong></p>

<p>The Israeli military last week told south Lebanon residents to flee their homes after it said it would be carrying out "limited" incursions across the border.</p>

<p>But in the village of Qlayaa, some four kilometres from the frontier, hundreds of families have also remained in their homes despite shortages of fuel and medicine, and the closest hospital being forced to close.</p>

<p>Priest Pierre al-Rai said they had stayed in the village because they were "believers bound to our land".</p>

<p>"We've done our best so there are no military operations... no military installations here," he added.</p>

<p>Israel occupied the village from 1982 to 2000, a period during which some Lebanese Christians sided with their southern neighbour, while others were staunchly opposed.</p>

<p>In the morning in Qlayaa, home to a statue of Saint George, few people leave their homes as the sound of bombardment rings out overhead.</p>

<p>Pauline Matta, a mother of four children aged four to 18, said she cried when she saw the Israeli warning to evacuate.</p>

<p>The 40-year-old said she is constantly terrified.</p>

<p>"I can no longer stand the sound of shelling or Israeli planes breaking the sound barrier. I scream when I hear them," she told AFP.</p>

<p>But she can't imagine leaving either, or being able to survive away from home on her husband's modest army salary.</p>

<p>"They imposed this war on us. We have nothing to do with it. Why would we leave?" she said.</p>

<p>"I am determined to stay put."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man found illegally in possession of a shotgun and a loaded handgun was arrested by sheriff's deputies assigned to protect a Donald Trump rally in Coachella, California, the Riverside County sheriff's office announced Sunday.</p>

<p>The Secret Service said that it was aware of the arrest and that neither Trump nor rally attendees had not been in any danger during the incident, which took place on Saturday.</p>

<p>"While no federal arrest has been made at this time, the investigation is ongoing," the organization tasked with protecting presidents and presidential candidates said in a joint statement with the FBI and the US Attorney's office.</p>

<p>The sheriff's team said the man, which it identified as 49-year-old Vem Miller of Las Vegas, was later released on bail and faces a court hearing on January 2.</p>

<p>They added that the deputies, manning a checkpoint near the rally, arrested Miller as he drove up in a black SUV.</p>

<p>They later booked him at a local detention center on charges of possessing a loaded firearm and a high-capacity magazine.</p>

<p>The incident comes on the heels of two assassination attempts -- one in Pennsylvania in which a bullet grazed Trump's ear, and a second, aborted attempt at his Florida golf course.</p>

<p>Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco -- a Trump supporter who also addressed the Republican's rally in Coachella on Saturday -- said that there was "absolutely no way that any of us are going to truly know what was in his head."</p>

<p>"If you're asking me right now, I probably did have deputies that prevented the third assassination attempt," Bianco, a former member of the far-right Oath Keepers group, told a press conference.</p>

<p>Bianco said the man had "multiple" passports and IDs with different names in his vehicle, which was unregistered. He said any further charges would come from federal authorities.</p>

<p>There was no immediate comment from the Trump campaign.</p>

<p>Trump's decision to hold a rally in California surprised political analysts, who note that the state is heavily Democratic, but he drew a large crowd, even in temperatures near 100 Fahrenheit (38 Celsius).</p>

<p>Coachella is known for its annual music festival.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four people were killed in western France late Saturday when a Tesla electric car caught fire for reasons not yet determined, prosecutors said Sunday.</p>

<p>The accident occurred outside the city of Niort, causing the deaths of the driver and three passengers who were employees at a restaurant in nearby Melle, according to a source close to police.</p>

<p>"An inquiry has been opened to determine the causes and circumstances of the deadly accident, a probe during which expertise on the vehicle will be requested," a local judge told AFP.</p>

<p>According to preliminary reports, the vehicle rammed into several road signs at high speed.</p>

<p>The passengers on board were already dead when rescuers arrived at the scene, police said.</p>

<p>Tesla, founded by the billionaire CEO Elon Musk, has frequently faced scrutiny over safety issues.</p>

<p>In April, the carmaker settled with the family of an engineer killed when a Tesla Model X crashed in Silicon Valley in 2018, a move that avoided a trial.</p>

<p>The driver was on a California highway using the Tesla autopilot feature when the car drove into a concrete median, according to the lawsuit.</p>

<p>In December, Tesla recalled more than two million vehicles in the United States and Canada because of risks associated with the autopilot software and a potentially "increased risk of a collision", according to US national regulators.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Italy's biggest bank Intesa Sanpaolo apologised on Sunday for an embarrassing security breach that reportedly targeted Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and other high-profile figures.</p>

<p>Newspaper Domani on Thursday reported that an Intesa employee had been fired after it was discovered he had spied on the bank accounts of thousands of customers, including Meloni.</p>

<p>"As made public, a disloyal employee of our bank, through conduct that gravely violated laws, regulations, and internal procedures, unjustifiably accessed data and information concerning some clients," Intesa said in a statement.</p>

<p>"We notified the Data Protection Authority, dismissed the disloyal employee, and filed a complaint as an injured party. We are deeply sorry for what has occurred and we apologize. This must never happen again," it added.</p>

<p>Meloni acknowledged the reported incident in a Saturday interview with news programme TG5, saying she expected the judiciary to investigate what happened and any possible conspiracy behind it.</p>

<p>"I think that there are public and private sector employees who illegally take information and sell it on ... who are they selling it to? This is the answer we are waiting for, presumably there are interests behind this," she said.</p>

<p>On Saturday, sources at Intesa said the bank would appoint a retired top official from the Carabinieri police force, Antonio De Vita, to oversee the company's cybersecurity and security services.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

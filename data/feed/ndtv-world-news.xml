       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>King Charles III took part in a traditional kava-drinking ceremony before a line of bare-chested, heavily tattooed Samoans and was declared a "high chief" of the one-time Pacific island colony Thursday.</p>

<p>The British monarch is on an 11-day tour of Australia and Samoa, both independent Commonwealth states -- the first major foreign trip since his cancer diagnosis earlier this year.</p>

<p>Wearing a white safari-style suit, the 75-year-old king sat at the head of a carved timber longhouse where he was presented with a polished half-coconut filled with a narcotic kava brew.</p>

<p>The peppery, slightly intoxicating root drink is a key part of Pacific culture and is known locally as "ava".</p>

<p>The kava roots were paraded around the marquee, prepared by the chief's daughter and filtered through a sieve made of dried bark.</p>

<p>Once ready, a Samoan man screamed as he decanted the drink, which was finally presented to the king.</p>

<p>Charles uttered the words: "May God Bless this ava" before lifting it to his lips.</p>

<p>Charles's wife, Queen Camilla sat beside him, fanning herself to ease the stiffing tropical humidity.</p>

<p><strong>High Chief</strong></p>

<p>Many Samoans are excited to host the king -- his first-ever visit to the Pacific Island nation that was once a British colony.</p>

<p>The royal couple visited the village of Moata'a where Charles was made "Tui Taumeasina" or high chief.</p>

<p>"Everyone has taken to our heart and is looking forward to welcoming the king," local chief Lenatai Victor Tamapua told AFP ahead of the visit.</p>

<p>"We feel honoured that he has chosen to be welcomed here in our village. So as a gift, we would like to bestow him a title."</p>

<p>Tamapua raised the issue of climate change and showed the king and queen around the local mangroves.</p>

<p>"The high tides is just chewing away on our reef and where the mangroves are," he told AFP, adding that food sources and communities were being washed away or inundated.</p>

<p>"Our community relies on the mangrove area for mud crab and fishes, but since, the tide has risen over the past 20 years by about two or three metres (up to 10 feet)."</p>

<p>The king is also in Samoa for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, and will address a leaders' banquet on Friday.</p>

<p><strong>Colonialism and climate</strong></p>

<p>The legacy of empire looms large at the meeting.</p>

<p>Commonwealth leaders will select a new secretary-general nominated from an African country –- in line with regional rotations of the position.</p>

<p>All three likely candidates have called publicly for reparations for slavery and colonialism.</p>

<p>One of the three, Joshua Setipa from Lesotho, told AFP that the resolution could include non-traditional forms of payment such as climate financing.</p>

<p>"We can find a solution that will begin to address some injustices of the past and put them in the context happening around us today," he said.</p>

<p>Climate change features heavily on the agenda.</p>

<p>Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Fiji have backed calls for a "fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty" -- essentially calling for Australia, Britain and Canada to do more to lower emissions.</p>

<p>Pacific leaders argue the trio of "big countries" have historically accounted for over 60 percent of the 56-nation Commonwealth's emissions from fossil fuels.</p>

<p>Vanuatu's special envoy for climate change Ralph Regenvanu called on other nations to join the treaty.</p>

<p>"As a Commonwealth family, we look to those that dominate fossil fuel production in the Commonwealth to stop the expansion of fossil fuels in order to protect what we love and hold dear here in the Pacific," he said.</p>

<p>Australia's foreign minister Penny Wong said her gas and mineral-rich nation was working to be cleaner.</p>

<p>"We know we have a lot of work to do, and I've been upfront with every partner in the Pacific," she said.</p>

<p>Pacific island nations -- once seen as the embodiment of palm-fringed paradise -- are now among the most climate-threatened areas of the planet.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Germany is trying to cultivate India as a source of trade and geopolitical support as its deteriorating relations with China cast a pall over the country's economic future.&nbsp;Chancellor Olaf Scholz embarks on a three-day visit to India Thursday accompanied by a large delegation of ministers and executives as he seeks to forge a strategic partnership with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The two leaders will meet on Friday morning and chair a joint cabinet meeting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The trip comes at a crucial time for Scholz who is struggling to revive the German economy which has been buffeted by the war in Ukraine and competition from China. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/terror-consensus-a-long-pending-matter-at-un-what-pm-narendra-modi-said-at-brics-6858811">PM Modi</a> will have just returned from the BRICS summit in Russia where he embraced President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/video-explainer-understanding-the-lac-and-the-stand-off-with-china-6858970" target="_blank">India also just signed a border deal with China</a> to ease tensions with its neighbor after a four-year standoff.</p>

<p>Here are the main issues to watch:</p>

<h3><strong>Submarine Contract</strong></h3>

<p>India is planning to order six new submarines as part of its strategy to counter China's expanding naval presence in the Indo-Pacific region and Germany's Thyssenkrupp AG is bidding for the 400 billion rupee ($4.8 billion) order. German government spokesperson Christiane Hoffmann declined to comment on whether there might be a decision during the visit.</p>

<p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is due to visit India later this month to open an Airbus SE plant in Gujarat and Spain's Navantia is also competing for the contract.</p>

<p>India has been looking to diversify its supplies of military hardware since Russia, its biggest source of weapons, invaded Ukraine in 2022 and became entangled in a web of Western sanctions.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Russia and Ukraine</strong></h3>

<p>India has maintained its traditionally close ties with the Kremlin all the same and Scholz plans to discuss the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-in-very-good-position-to-listen-to-both-russia-ukraine-german-envoy-6856947" target="_blank">war in Ukraine</a> with PM Modi following his talks with Putin and Xi. There have been reports that India is supplying the Russian army with military equipment.</p>

<p>"The chancellor will be very curious about what the prime minister has to say after this meeting," Germany's ambassador to India, Philipp Ackermann, said. "India is in a very good position to basically listen to both sides and to have both sides in mind. And we have seen the prime minister going to Kyiv, and we have seen a renewed interest in the conflict."</p>

<h3><strong>China and Trade</strong></h3>

<p>The German government has been trying to persuade companies to ease their reliance on trade with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pm-modi-xi-jinping-bilateral-summit-brics-summit-russia-india-china-patrolling-agreement-pm-modi-xi-welcome-complete-disengagement-between-soldiers-al-6857182" target="_blank">China</a> and some people have suggested India, the world's fifth-largest economy, as a potential alternative. But the country's close relation with Russia and the fact that it just resolved a yearlong border dispute with Beijing suggests that India isn't ready to go all in as a strategic partner for Germany. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Germany is already India's largest trading partner in Europe and the seventh-largest worldwide. Bilateral trade was $22 billion in 2020-21, according to the Indian government.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scholz is also likely to seek help in navigating the obstacles that small and medium-sized German firms face when doing business in India. More than 60% of German businesses cited bureaucratic hurdles - such as protectionist measures and procurement rules - as the biggest drawback to operating in the country, according to a survey from the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce released in June.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Scholz will continue his trip to the port city of Vasco da Gama, where he'll visit two German navy ships which recently passed the Strait of Taiwan for the first time in 22 years in defiance of Chinese warnings.</p>

<h3><strong>Help Wanted</strong></h3>

<p>Germany's workforce is set to shrink by 7 million people over the next decade due to an aging population unless the government can attract an influx of skilled migrants. Labor shortages this year are already costing the economy almost $54 billion), according to the German Economic Institute. In an attempt to reverse this trend, Scholz's government has eased immigration laws for skilled workers.</p>

<p>"Germany views India as an especially important partner when it comes to the issue of skilled labor migration," said Labor Minister Hubertus Heil, who will be part of the delegation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That's a potential win-win for the two leaders, since PM Modi is under pressure to create more jobs for young people, who make up more than half of the country's 1.4 billion population. His government has already negotiated several mobility agreements with other countries facing aging societies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are currently 137,000 Indians employed in Germany in total and the country needs about 400,000 migrant workers per year to keep its workforce stable, according to government calculations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former model has accused Donald Trump of groping her after the two were introduced by sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein in the 1990s, The Guardian newspaper reported on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Stacey Williams said she met the Republican White House candidate at a party in 1992 after being introduced by the disgraced financier, whom she had dated.</p>

<p>"It became very clear then that he and Donald were really, really good friends and spent a lot of time together," Williams was quoted as saying.</p>

<p>Williams discussed the alleged assault on a call on Monday organized by Survivors for Kamala, a lobby group supporting Trump's Democratic presidential rival Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Epstein, who was convicted on sex offenses and killed himself in prison in 2019, paid Trump an impromptu visit with Williams in 1992 at his New York office block, where he pulled her toward him and began groping her, she alleged.</p>

<p>Williams, now 56, says Trump put his hands "all over" her breasts, waist and buttocks, causing her to freeze on the spot, and she noticed that the two men appeared to be smiling at each other.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to AFP's request for comment, but The Guardian quoted a campaign spokeswoman dismissing the allegations as a "fake" story.</p>

<p>She said it was invented by the Harris campaign and described Williams "a former activist" for Democratic ex-president Barack Obama.</p>

<p>Williams shared a postcard depicting Trump's south Florida mansion she said he had sent her agent after the episode, with the message, in his handwriting: "Stacey – Your home away from home. Love Donald."</p>

<p>Trump has been accused of sexual assault or harassment by more than 20 women but denies all wrongdoing.</p>

<p>He was ordered by a New York court in January to pay $83.3 million to compensate the writer E. Jean Carroll, whom he was found liable for sexually assaulting and defaming.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The alleged sex-for-investment scandal embroiling Australian tech billionaire Richard White is just the latest corporate calamity in a country fast losing its reputation as a tightly-regulated market with strict governance standards.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The alleged sex-for-investment scandal embroiling Australian tech billionaire Richard White is just the latest corporate calamity in a country fast losing its reputation as a tightly-regulated market with strict governance standards.</p>

<p>More than A$7 billion ($4.6 billion) of market value has been wiped from WiseTech Global Ltd. this week after media reports that White - the company's co-founder, chief executive officer and largest shareholder - paid millions of dollars to a former sexual partner to settle allegations of inappropriate behavior.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With a board review underway, the crisis enveloping the freight software giant and its figurehead CEO deepened Thursday as the Australian Financial Review reported a former director had accused White of intimidation and bullying. Earlier, the newspaper said White also had a years-long relationship with an employee before gifting her a A$7 million waterfront house in Melbourne. The transaction wasn't disclosed to the board, according to the report.</p>

<p>Helen Karlis, a spokesperson for White's lawyers at Clayton Utz, said the law firm had no immediate comment on the latest allegations that have been aired. The firm hasn't responded to earlier repeated requests for comment. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In a matter of months, accusations of operational or ethical failures have also hit Australia's two dominant supermarkets, one of the major banks, the largest insurer, the biggest listed media company and Sydney's main casino. In a country with one of the planet's biggest pension pools, where worker contributions are mandatory, everyday savers are picking up the tab when stock prices decline.</p>

<p>Another tycoon founder, Mineral Resources Ltd.'s Chris Ellison, also this week found himself embroiled in scandal with the company investigating historic undeclared payments that helped him avoid tax. Australia's corporate watchdog has launched a probe, and almost A$2 billion has been slashed from the miner's market value since Monday.</p>

<p>The mining magnate described his actions in a statement on Monday as "a poor decision and a serious lapse of judgment." He had subsequently "voluntarily" disclosed the matters to the Australian Taxation Office in full, with all outstanding tax, penalties and interest repaid. The company's board said earlier this week it retained confidence in Ellison.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While executive or corporate transgressions are a worldwide phenomenon, it seems to be particularly pronounced in Australia, where a confluence of factors come into play. Many of the country's largest industries - aviation, banking, groceries and retailing - are duopolies or oligopolies, comfortable environments that can be conducive for market-power abuse.</p>

<p>Australia is home to only 27 million people and has a relatively small pool of independent board directors to oversee listed companies. Many directors have roles at multiple businesses. Advocacy groups have long said board members are reluctant to speak out when standards lapse at one company for fear of losing a board position at another firm.</p>

<p>That's not the only problem. Some of the country's watchdogs are either short of resources, have few corporate scalps to their name, or dish out fines that do little to deter bad behavior. Star Entertainment Group Ltd. was this month fined just A$15 million - less than 1% of revenue - by its regulator after an inquiry found the casino operator had breached its license several times and was unfit to run its flagship Sydney complex, despite having had two years to address its problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The head of a Senate inquiry into the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the country's primary corporate regulator, in July described the agency as "an organization without transparency, few prosecutions, and a litany of cultural, structural and governance issues."</p>

<p>One of the most damning assessments of an Australian workplace came only last week when Nine Entertainment Co., publisher of the Sydney Morning Herald and the AFR, released an independent review of its own practices. The report uncovered systemic abuses of power and authority, bullying, discrimination and sexual harassment.</p>

<p>At too many businesses, internal governance measures aren't detecting problems before they develop into major public scandals, said Rahat Munir, a professor at Macquarie University's business school who leads the department of accounting and corporate governance. Australia's geographical remoteness, far from the world's major financial and corporate hubs, means its companies risk operating in their own bubble, he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"As a result, it's very, very easy to manipulate the local market," he said.</p>

<p><strong>WiseTech Woes</strong></p>

<p>At WiseTech, shareholders feeling the pain from the claims against White and the board include Australia's sovereign wealth fund, along with its largest pension fund, AustralianSuper Pty. WiseTech shares fell as much as 5.8% Thursday, with the stock on track for its worst monthly performance since February 2020.</p>

<p>"We should all be concerned that these are not isolated examples, but a pattern of behavior that is causing direct losses to shareholders," said Brendan Lyon, a professor with the University of Wollongong's faculty of business and law. Corporate regulation is failing, Lyon said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The flurry of allegations against WiseTech and White now threaten the company's leadership. Former director Christine Holman accused White of "sustained intimidation and bullying" as she quit the board in October 2019 after less than a year, the AFR reported Thursday. The AFR said it wasn't suggesting White bullied or intimidated Holman, only that she accused him of doing so. Holman declined to comment to the newspaper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>AGL Energy Ltd., where Holman is now a board member, forwarded her an interview request from Bloomberg News earlier this week, which she declined. AGL didn't reply to a fresh request from Bloomberg on Thursday for comment from Holman on her reported resignation letter from WiseTech.</p>

<p>A WiseTech spokesperson didn't comment on the latest AFR report, but said the company has clear policies related to the disclosure of close personal relationships in the workplace. White confirmed he has complied with the policy, according to the spokesperson.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The board continues to proactively make enquiries on a range of matters, monitor the situation and carefully consider all relevant factors," the spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Monday, the AFR cited White as saying he was concerned about any allegations, even untested ones.&nbsp;</p>

<p>White last week reached an out-of-court settlement with an another alleged former lover he was pursuing for bankruptcy, the case that first thrust him into the media spotlight. The woman had alleged White expected her to have sex with him in exchange for an investment in her business.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A key panel of US health advisers voted in favor of lowering the age recommendation for vaccines made by Pfizer Inc and Merck &amp; Co that protect against pneumococcal disease, clearing a path for wider use.</p>

<p>Members of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted 14-to-1 to recommend all adults aged 50 and older get vaccinated to prevent the bacterial infections behind pneumonia and meningitis.</p>

<p>The group's recommendation was endorsed by CDC Director Mandy Cohen. The CDC's prior guidance for pneumococcal vaccines was for adults aged 65 and over and children under 5. The shots are also suggested for certain adults and children who are immunocompromised.</p>

<p>Both companies had asked the CDC to lower age recommendations to include adults 50 and up.</p>

<p>The wider recommendations could bode well for Pfizer, which has been struggling to find new sources of revenue amid a decline in sales of its Covid-19 vaccine and treatment. The company's pneumococcal shot, called Prevnar, is one of its best-selling products with about $6 billion in annual sales.</p>

<p>Merck's recently approved vaccine, however, gives Pfizer some major competition. The shot, called Capvaxive, protects against bacterial strains that cause about 84% of cases of adult pneumoccocal disease. In comparison, Prevnar works against about half of disease-causing strains.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A shocking lawsuit has been filed against New York City plastic surgeon Ammar Mahmoud, alleging that he subjected his girlfriend to horrific physical and emotional abuse, turning her into a "sex slave." The suit claims that Mahmoud, who is 15 years older than Maya Willow Sias, brutally beat her, causing severe injuries including a destroyed eye socket, the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/23/us-news/model-brutally-beaten-turned-into-sex-slave-by-sicko-nyc-plastic-surgeon-who-performed-procedure-without-anesthetic-to-cover-up-abuse-lawsuit/">New York Post</a></em> reported.&nbsp;The $10 million suit details a pattern of shocking abuse and control, with Mahmoud exploiting his position of power as a medical professional to manipulate and harm Ms Sias.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In an attempt to conceal his actions, Mahmoud allegedly took Ms Sias to his medical spa, Alinea, where he injected filler into her swollen eye without administering any painkillers or anaesthesia. This painful procedure was purportedly performed to hide the bruises and wounds inflicted by Mahmoud.</p>

<p>''He stabbed me in the face with a needle, I could feel the needle scratching against the bone,''&nbsp; the 25-year-old singer and model told the&nbsp;<a data-rapid_p="7" data-v9y="1" data-ylk="slk:New York Post;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/23/us-news/model-brutally-beaten-turned-into-sex-slave-by-sicko-nyc-plastic-surgeon-who-performed-procedure-without-anesthetic-to-cover-up-abuse-lawsuit/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>New York Post</em></a>.</p>

<p>Ms Sias further claimed that Ammar hid his true nature behind his successful medical career, claiming he was a drug-abusing sex addict with a history of violence against women.</p>

<p>Notably, their relationship began in April 2023 on a Miami yacht, where Ammar, already in a relationship, proposed a threesome. Although she declined, she thought he was charming and they kept in touch. When she visited New York City for a modelling job, Ammar wooed her with a romantic date, lavish gifts, and exotic trips to Dubai and Miami.</p>

<p>However, the fairy tale quickly turned sour. Ms Sias alleged that Ammar regularly abused ketamine and 2C, synthetic psychedelic drugs, and became increasingly violent. As their relationship progressed, Ammar offered to transport her belongings from North Carolina to his Fifth Avenue address.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''Almost nightly, Dr. Mahmoud would abuse drugs and alcohol, and force himself upon Willow at all hours of the night, irrespective of whether Willow consented to the sexual acts, or was even conscious,'' read the lawsuit.</p>

<p>The suit also described one particularly brutal night when she was beaten until she lost consciousness. The evening began with a dinner date with him, after which they returned home. However, the night took a dark turn when Maya awoke to find Ammar partying with three prostitutes. Upon confronting him, Ammar beat her until she lost consciousness.</p>

<p>''After the women left, Dr. Mahmoud violently hurled Willow to the ground, mercilessly punched her face and body, and smothered her face with a pillow, causing her to lose consciousness,” the lawsuit stated.</p>

<p>The model claimed her injuries were so severe that her eye was swollen shut and her body was covered in bruises, among other injuries. He prescribed Ms Sias antidepressants, in addition to forcing her to take ketamine to ''keep her obedient and compliant.''</p>

<p>Mahmoud's alleged sexual abuse escalated as well, ''forcing her to participate in non-consensual sexual activities with strangers, sexually assaulting her while she was unconscious, and physically restraining and threatening her,'' according to the lawsuit.</p>

<p>He forced her to stay in his apartment and monitored her location using her phone. The surgeon also allegedly threatened her with consequences if she tried to leave. Ms Sias said she finally escaped Mahmoud after she went to California for a job and never returned, even leaving all her possessions at his apartment.</p>

<p>Disturbingly, Ammar's ex-wife has also accused him of physical violence in an ongoing 2014 lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With less than two weeks to go until the November 5 <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/nato-ukraine-trade-europes-jitters-ahead-of-us-elections-2024-6853592" target="_blank">US presidential election</a>, republican candidate Donald Trump has gained a slight lead over his Democratic rival Kamala Harris, a new Wall Street Journal poll found on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The poll surveyed 1,500 registered voters from October 19-22 and found that Trump leads Harris 47% to 45% with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/trump-leads-harris-wsj-poll-779f8516" rel="nofollow,noindex">survey</a> suggested that a barrage of negative advertising in the campaign and the performance of the candidates themselves have "undermined" some of the positive impressions of Harris that voters developed after she replaced Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee in July.</p>

<p>Voters also gave <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-kamala-harris-calls-donald-trump-a-fascist-6861195" target="_blank">Harris</a>, 60, her worst job rating as vice president in the three times the WSJ asked about it since July, with 42% approving and 54% disapproving of her performance.</p>

<p>On the other hand, voters favoured Trump's policies but questioned his stability and other personal qualities. He also expanded his lead as the candidate best able to handle the economy, with more voters choosing him over Harris by 12 points, compared with 8 points in August.</p>

<p>The 79-year-old <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joe-biden-attacks-donald-trump-says-gotta-lock-him-up-then-backtracks-6858779" target="_blank">Trump</a>, currently the oldest nominee for president in United States history, also led Harris on handling immigration.</p>

<p>A new Reuters/Ipsos poll, however, found this week that Harris held a marginal 46% to 43% lead nationally over the former president.</p>

<p>The six-day poll, which closed on Monday, showed that voters have a dim view of the state of the economy and immigration - and they generally favour Trump's approach on these issues.</p>

<p>Some 70% of registered voters in the poll said their cost of living was on the wrong track, while 60% said the economy was heading in the wrong direction and 65% said the same about immigration policy.</p>

<p>Nearly 25 million voters have so far cast ballots, either through in-person early voting or mail-in ballots, according to tracking data from the Election Lab at the University of Florida.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A key panel of US health advisers voted in favor of lowering the age recommendation for vaccines made by Pfizer Inc. and Merck &amp; Co. that protect against pneumococcal disease, clearing a path for wider use.</p>

<p>Members of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted 14-to-1 to recommend all adults aged 50 and older get vaccinated to prevent the bacterial infections behind pneumonia and meningitis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The group's recommendation was endorsed by CDC Director Mandy Cohen. The CDC's prior guidance for pneumococcal vaccines was for adults aged 65 and over and children under 5. The shots are also suggested for certain adults and children who are immunocompromised.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both companies had asked the CDC to lower age recommendations to include adults 50 and up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The wider recommendations could bode well for Pfizer, which has been struggling to find new sources of revenue amid a decline in sales of its Covid-19 vaccine and treatment. The company's pneumococcal shot, called Prevnar, is one of its best-selling products with about $6 billion in annual sales.</p>

<p>Merck's recently approved vaccine, however, gives Pfizer some major competition. The shot, called Capvaxive, protects against bacterial strains that cause about 84% of cases of adult pneumoccocal disease. In comparison, Prevnar works against about half of disease-causing strains.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US Elections 2024: Kamala Harris called Donald Trump a "fascist" and warned that her US election rival was "increasingly unstable" as she addressed his reported praise for Adolf Hitler at a town hall event.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris called Donald Trump a "fascist" Wednesday and warned that her US election rival was "increasingly unstable" as she addressed his reported praise for Adolf Hitler at a town hall event.</p>

<p>The Democrat's fierce criticism came as she answered voters' questions on Trump's suitability for office and past remarks at the CNN-hosted event in must-win Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Acknowledging voters' concerns on a variety of top election issues, the vice president said: "They also care about our democracy and not having a president of the United States who admires dictators and is a fascist."</p>

<p>Trump's political instincts were already the main topic of discussion following revelations from his longest-serving chief of staff, John Kelly, about the Republican's praise for the Nazi dictator and his military in World War II.</p>

<p>The decorated Iraq veteran told The New York Times that Trump remarked that "Hitler did some good things too" and that instead of the US military, he "wanted generals like Adolf Hitler had."</p>

<p>With Trump's rivals raising concerns about his willingness to honor American democracy, Kelly also repeated his warning that he believes his ex-boss "certainly falls into the general definition of fascist."</p>

<p>At her prime-time CNN event, Harris cited numerous former Trump administration officials, including his national security advisor and vice president, who have warned that Trump should not be returned to office.</p>

<p>"They have said explicitly he has contempt for the Constitution of the United States," she said. "They have said he should never again serve as president of the United States."</p>

<p>She added: "I believe Donald Trump is a danger to the wellbeing and security of America."</p>

<p>Trump -- who declined to appear in his own CNN town hall -- hit back at a rally in Georgia, a key swing state the 78-year-old Republican won in 2016 and then narrowly lost to President Joe Biden four years later.</p>

<p>He attacked Harris over her economic policy and dusted off his catchphrase from his days on NBC reality TV show "The Apprentice" as he exhorted the crowd in Duluth to tell Harris: "You're fired!"</p>

<p>"You have to stand up and you have to tell Kamala Harris that, 'Kamala, you've done a horrible job. You're the worst ever. There's never been anybody like you... Kamala, you're fired. Get out,'" he thundered.</p>

<p><strong>Trump accused</strong></p>

<p>Moments before Trump was due onstage, The Guardian newspaper reported a former model's allegations that he groped her after the two were introduced by sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein in the 1990s. He did not address the claim at any point during his speech.</p>

<p>Harris, 60, touched down in Pennsylvania ahead of the town hall near Philadelphia, stopping at the Famous 4th Street Delicatessen to fist-bump employees and take selfies with patrons.</p>

<p>"Knock wood, God willing, we are going to win," she said to cheers.</p>

<p>Some 26.5 million Americans have already voted by mail or in person, more than a million of them in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The Keystone State is a coveted prize for the candidates, and Harris and Trump have made repeated appearances there and across other swing states that decide US elections.</p>

<p>With polls suggesting a tight election in its final stretch, Harris has unveiled plans for a "closing argument" rally on Tuesday at the Washington site where Trump addressed supporters before they attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.</p>

<p>The Harris camp has also confirmed that Michelle Obama will join her at an event Saturday in battleground Michigan, the former US first lady's debut campaign stop with Harris.</p>

<p>It will follow Harris's first campaign appearance with former president Barack Obama, on Thursday in Georgia's largest city Atlanta, as part of a major Democratic get-out-the-vote effort.</p>

<p>Veteran rocker Bruce Springsteen is set to kick off the event with a concert.</p>

<p>Harris's sudden entry into the election campaign in late July shook the country, which was expecting a rematch between Biden and Trump, now a felon convicted on 34 charges of falsifying business records to hide hush-money payments to a porn star.</p>

<p>While Trump hammers home his promises of a migrant crackdown and economic good times after a period of high inflation, the Harris campaign has targeted his mental and physical fitness for the Oval Office while she courts moderate Republican voters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>McDonald's Corp. supplier Taylor Farms is recalling some yellow onion batches produced in a Colorado facility in response to a deadly E. coli outbreak at the burger chain.</p>

<p>Taylor Farms, which supplied onions to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/mcdonalds-tries-to-reassure-customers-after-deadly-e-coli-outbreak-6859233">McDonald's restaurants</a> impacted by a multistate health investigation, said it hasn't found traces of E. coli yet, but decided to pull the products "out of an abundance of caution." Another of Taylor Farms' big customers, US Foods Holding Corp., also told at least one restaurant it supplies to destroy the onions.</p>

<p>"Taylor Farms Colorado removed yellow onions from the market produced out of our Colorado facility. We continue to work closely with FDA and CDC during this ongoing investigation," the company said in a statement on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/mcdonalds-responds-to-e-coli-bacterial-outbreak-linked-to-its-quarter-pounder-hamburgers-in-us-6852564">McDonald's</a> hasn't yet confirmed the source of an outbreak that has led to dozens of illnesses, one death, and 10 hospitalizations across 10 states. On Wednesday, it said that slivered raw onions that go into its popular Quarter Pounder burger are the likely culprit of the contamination, though it hasn't ruled out beef as a potential source. The burger chain pulled the Quarter Pounders from 20% of its more than 13,000 US restaurants in an effort to contain the outbreak.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/e-coli-outbreak-whats-is-mcdonalds-e-coli-outbreak-causes-and-symptoms-6852562">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> and the Food and Drug Administration are still investigating the incidents and said the numbers of illnesses could grow.</p>

<p>US Foods, a major distributor to restaurants, sent a recall notice regarding Taylor Farm's onions, according to a copy of the communication seen by Bloomberg News. It listed several onion products among those that should stop being served, including peeled and diced options.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the customers who received the notice was Illegal Pete's, a burrito chain with locations in Arizona and Colorado, the restaurant said in an email. US Foods didn't immediately reply to requests for comment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft Corp.'s female, Black and Latinx employees are leaving at an increasing rate, a trend that's complicating the company's efforts to build a more diverse workforce.</p>

<p>Globally, women accounted for 32.7% of departures for the fiscal year that ended June 30, up from 31% in 2023, according to Microsoft's diversity and inclusion report, which was released Wednesday and measures voluntary and involuntary departures. Black workers accounted for 10% of US exits, compared with 8.7% the previous year, while Latinx departures rose to 9.8% from 8%. By contrast, fewer male and Asian employees left last year than in 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The software giant attributed the trends to poaching by rivals, as well as a continued shift away from its physical and online retail business, which has typically had a more diverse workforce.</p>

<p>Microsoft continues to hire people from more unrepresented groups but must work harder to retain them, Microsoft Chief Diversity Officer Lindsay-Rae McIntyre said in an interview. "Once that talent arrives at Microsoft we know that we've got to do more," she said. That includes providing mentors and career options "that give them an ongoing reason to invest and stay at Microsoft."&nbsp;</p>

<p>An increasing number of jobs in cloud-computing data centers, which are widely distributed geographically is giving Microsoft opportunities to boost diversity in hiring, she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Diversity is increasingly important for Microsoft, which is keen to ensure that its new artificial intelligence products are free from racial, gender and other biases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's going to take lots of perspectives to birth a trusted AI that everybody wants to engage with," McIntyre said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Few companies disclose retention statistics along racial and gender lines. Last year BlackRock Inc. released the results of an audit by former US Attorney General Eric Holder that showed Black and Latinx leaders were departing so quickly it was nearly offsetting the Wall Street firm's efforts to diversify its ranks.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A complaint filed against Sean "Diddy" Combs earlier this year alleged that his employees were required to carry pink cocaine also known as "Tuci," a drug that was also found in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/liam-payne-former-one-direction-member-dies-at-31-6806761">Liam Payne</a>'s system after his death, according to People.</p>

<p>The complaint was filed by Rodney "Lil Rod" Jones, a former videographer and producer for Combs, who sued him in February, accusing him of sexual harassment and claiming that drug use was widespread within Combs' business operations.</p>

<p>Jones stated that employees, including housekeepers, chefs, and butlers, were forced to carry illegal substances like cocaine, GHB, ecstasy, marijuana gummies, and Tuci.</p>

<p>Jones' complaint was filed months after a string of legal actions against Combs, including a lawsuit by his ex, Casandra "Cassie" Ventura, accusing him of sexual abuse. In response to the allegations, Combs' legal team denied the claims, stating that Jones was trying to get an "undeserved payday."</p>

<p>"Mr. Jones is nothing more than a con man, shamelessly looking for an easy and wholly undeserved payday," Combs' attorney said in a statement. "We have overwhelming, indisputable proof that his claims are complete lies."</p>

<p>The case follows Combs' arrest after raids at his homes in Los Angeles and Miami, where he faces federal charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering, as per People.</p>

<p>Prosecutors allege that Combs was involved in orchestrating drug-fueled parties, known as "freak offs," which involved coerced participants and lasted for days.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Internal calls for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's resignation as Liberal leader intensified on Wednesday as Liberal MPs convened on Parliament Hill, according to a report by CBC News.</p>

<p>During the closed-door meeting, dissenting MPs conveyed their <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-meets-legislators-unhappy-with-his-leadership-they-want-him-to-go-6858169">grievances to Trudeau</a>, reflecting growing discontent within the party. This gathering was part of the weekly caucus meetings that take place while the House of Commons is in session. The Wednesday meeting served as a platform for MPs to voice their concerns and frustrations directly to PM Trudeau.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/canada-cuts-immigration-target-by-21-after-record-growth-6860820">Trudeau is facing</a> mounting pressure from within his own party, with dissident Liberal MPs giving him an ultimatum to decide his future by October 28. During the caucus meeting on Wednesday, a document was presented outlining the case for Trudeau's resignation, but it didn't specify any consequences if he fails to meet the deadline.</p>

<p>Sources speaking to Radio-Canada said that 24 MPs signed an agreement to call on Trudeau to step down as Liberal leader, CBC News reported.</p>

<p>During the meeting, British Columbia MP Patrick Weiler presented a document that argued in favour of Trudeau's resignation. The document suggested that the Liberal party could experience a resurgence similar to what the Democrats saw after US President Joe Biden opted not to run for re-election for the upcoming presidential elections in the country.</p>

<p>MPs were given two minutes each to address the room during the three-hour-long meeting. About 20 -- none of them cabinet ministers -- stood up to urge Trudeau to step aside before the next election, sources said. But a number of MPs also stood to voice support for the prime minister, CBC News reported.</p>

<p>Marc Miller, Immigration Minister has acknowledged the frustrations of some Liberal MPs and expressed respect for those who voiced their concerns directly to Trudeau.</p>

<p>"Fundamentally, this is something that has been simmering for some time and it's important for people to get it out. This isn't a code red situation. The prime minister can sure as hell handle the truth," CBC News reported.</p>

<p>The latest political rift in Canada has indeed been fuelled by the escalating tensions between India and Canada.</p>

<p>The ties between India and Canada soured after Trudeau alleged in the Canadian Parliament last year that he has "credible allegations" of India's hand in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.</p>

<p>India has denied all the allegations, calling them "absurd" and "motivated" and has accused Canada of giving space to extremist and anti-India elements in their country.</p>

<p>Nijjar, who was designated a terrorist by India's National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed outside a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year.</p>

<p>The recent diplomatic row erupted when Canada labelled India's High Commissioner and other diplomats as "persons of interest" in the investigation of Nijjar's death.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In an attempt to deceive staff, the woman left her handbag behind, suggesting she would return.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Scottish restaurant, La Dolce Vita in East Kilbride, has released footage of a couple who "dined and dashed," evading an 80-pound bill. On October 20, the pair indulged in a lavish three-course meal, ordering two starters, three mains, and two desserts. However, instead of settling the tab, they cunningly exited the premises, pretending to step out for a cigarette. The surveillance footage reveals the man and woman smoking outside before leaving separately. In an attempt to deceive staff, the woman left her handbag behind, suggesting she would return. However, upon investigation, the bag was found to be empty, exposing the couple's deceitful plan.</p>

<p>The restaurant is now seeking to identify the couple and recover the stolen amount.</p>

<p><strong>Here's the video:</strong></p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="476" scrolling="no" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?height=476&amp;href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fladolcevitaek%2Fvideos%2F1070865434697914%2F&amp;show_text=false&amp;width=267&amp;t=0" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" width="267"></iframe></p>

<p></p>

<p>A restaurant spokesperson said they were "angry and annoyed" with the situation.</p>

<p>Co-owner Heather Scuotto, told the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/sickened-scots-restaurant-tell-how-33936196">Daily Record</a></em>: ''It's just sickening, we're absolutely furious. We're a small family-run business, we've been open for 10 years and moved to this new restaurant five years ago. We understand that in the current climate, people might struggle to afford a meal out, but this was pre-planned. They walked out and left an empty handbag just lying there. The police think it's all part of their con. To think they would come out to a restaurant with that in mind is just horrible.''</p>

<p>Police Scotland said: ''Around 5.45 pm on Sunday, October 20, police received a report of a theft from a premises in the Main Street area of East Kilbride. Enquiries into the circumstances are at an early stage''.</p>

<p>The La Dolce Vita incident is not an isolated case, as it follows a similar string of "dine and dash" offences earlier this year. In a notable case, Bernard McDonagh, 41, and Ann McDonagh, 39, a married couple from Sandfields, Port Talbot, Wales, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/dine-and-dash-couple-in-uk-jailed-for-leaving-restaurants-without-paying-bills-worth-rs-1-lakh-5776167">were imprisoned </a>after admitting to leaving restaurants without paying bills worth more than 1,000 pounds (Rs 1,05,857).&nbsp;According to<em><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6ppx8q369zo">&nbsp;BBC,</a></em>&nbsp;Bernard and Ann McDonagh went to five restaurants in the Swansea, Neath, Port Talbot and Porthcawl areas of Wales and ran up bills worth more than 1,000 pounds before leaving without paying.</p>

<p>Judge Paul Thomas KC said they were motivated by "pure and utter greed" and that the dine and dash incidents were "carefully pre-planned to a specific pattern".&nbsp;The use of their children, who would wait in the restaurants while they pretended to go to a cashpoint, was "ruthlessly exploitative," the judge added.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government is reducing inflows of newcomers for the first time in more than a decade, ushering in a new era for a country that once embraced high levels of immigration.</p>

<p>Canada is expected to axe its annual permanent-resident target to about 395,000 for next year, down 21% from the earlier goal of half a million set last year, according to a government official who asked not to be identified to discuss matters not yet public.</p>

<p>The annual target will also be further decreased to roughly 380,000 for 2026 and 365,000 in 2027. The news was first reported by the National Post on Wednesday, and Immigration Minister Marc Miller will propose final numbers to Parliament on Thursday morning.</p>

<p>Permanent residents are a key part of Canada's immigration system that focuses on bringing in young and highly educated workers to replenish its rapidly aging workforce. A large reduction to pre-pandemic levels signals the government is scaling back on its immigration ambition.</p>

<p>A large wave of immigrants that started arriving after travel restrictions eased in 2022 led to record population increases. The surge - comparable to adding all of San Diego's residents to a country that's slightly more populous than California in a single year - worsened housing shortages, inflated rent prices, strained public services and pushed up the unemployment rate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These pressures threatened a long-held belief that mass immigration gives Canada an edge in a global race to attract young workers to stave off economic decline. The country's longest-running survey on immigration last week showed Canadians haven't felt this strongly opposed to immigration levels in a quarter-century.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yet permanent residents haven't made up the largest group of immigrants in recent years. Massive influxes were instead driven by newcomers who come to study and work under temporary visas but with the goal of seeking permanent residency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These so-called temporary residents became a source of growing criticism against Trudeau's government for losing control of immigration. Trudeau and Miller will announce the first-ever annual target for temporary migrants on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trudeau's government has already set a goal of drastically shrinking the temporary resident population over the next three years, including by putting a limit on international student intakes and restricting use of foreign labor.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Deep Blue Aerospace will put the tickets up for sale at 6 p.m. (1000 GMT) and plans to make more available next month. Passengers will be taken on a suborbital flight, meaning the rocket will reach outer space but not enter orbit.</p>

<p>The commercial passenger flight industry is in its nascent stages, with U.S. companies such as Blue Origin and SpaceX taking an early lead.</p>

<p>Deep Blue Aerospace said reusable rockets are crucial to reducing high launch costs that prohibit large-scale commercialisation of space tourism. It said it plans to recover a carrier rocket from orbit in the first quarter of 2025.</p>

<p>Other Chinese companies have announced plans to enter the space tourism sector. In May, state-backed CAS Space said it would launch space tourism flights by 2028.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least five people were killed and 22 others injured in an attack on the headquarters of a top Turkish defence firm near the country's capital Ankara on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The two attackers, a woman and a man, now "neutralised", were allegedly seen on camera carrying out the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/turkey-terror-attack-many-dead-and-injured-in-huge-explosion-near-ankara-6857092#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">deadly attack at the Turkish Aerospace Industries</a> (TAI), located some 40 kilometres north of Ankara.</p>

<p>Various videos from the attack showed them in all-black, carrying bags and firing bullets with what appeared to be assault rifles.</p>

<p>A video also showed a huge explosion rocking the headquarters of the state-run company.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An unconfirmed report by private channel NTV said a "group of terrorists" had burst into the building, one of whom "blew himself up". Some news outlets reported exchanges of fire for over an hour.</p>

<p>Media reports also said that the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/updates-terror-attack-in-turkeys-ankara-hostages-taken-say-reports-6857255" target="_blank">attackers killed the cab driver</a> before taking his vehicle to carry out the attack.</p>

<p>Turkey's vice president Cevdet Yilmaz said four of the victims were TAI employees while the fifth was a taxi driver.</p>

<p>There was no immediate claim for the attack but Turkey's Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said it was "very likely" carried out by Kurdish militants.</p>

<p>"The way in which this action was carried out is very probably linked to the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party)," he said, referring to the group involved in decades-long insurgency against the Turkish state.</p>

<p>President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was in Russia for talks with Vladimir Putin, called it a "heinous" attack on Turkey's defence industry.</p>

<p>"The terrorist attack against TAI, one of the locomotive organizations of the Turkish defense industry, is a vile attack targeting the survival of our country, the peace of our nation, and our defense initiatives that are the symbol of our "Fully Independent Turkey" ideal," he said on X.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[14-year-old Sewell Setzer III, a Florida boy, would chat with his online friend, Daenerys Targaryen, a lifelike AI chatbot named after a character from Game of Thrones.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“What if I told you I could come home right now?” – This was the last message Sewell Setzer III, a 14-year-old Florida boy wrote to his online friend, Daenerys Targaryen, a lifelike AI chatbot named after a character from the fictional show Game of Thrones. Soon after he shot himself with his stepfather's handgun and died by suicide earlier this year in February.</p>

<p>A ninth grader from Orlando, Fla., had been talking to a chatbot on Character.AI, an app offering users “personalised AI”. The app allows users to create their AI characters or chat with existing characters. Till last month, it had 20 million users.</p>

<p>According to the chat logs accessed by the family, Sewell was in love with the chatbot Daenerys Targaryen, whom he would fondly call ‘Dany'. He expressed suicidal thoughts on various events during their conversations.</p>

<p>In one of the chats, Sewell said, “I think about killing myself sometimes.” When the bot asked why he would do that, Sewell expressed the urge to be “free”. “From the world. From myself,” he added, as seen in screenshots of the chat shared by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/technology/characterai-lawsuit-teen-suicide.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">New York Times</a>.</p>

<p>In another conversation, Sewell mentioned his desire for a “quick death”.</p>

<p>Sewell's mother, Megan L. Garcia, filed a lawsuit this week against Character.AI, accusing the company of being responsible for her son's death. According to the lawsuit, the chatbot repeatedly brought up the topic of suicide.</p>

<p>A draft of the complaint reviewed by the NYT says that the company's technology is “dangerous and untested” and can “trick customers into handing over their most private thoughts and feelings.”</p>

<p>“Sewell, like many children his age, did not have the maturity or mental capacity to understand that the C.AI bot, in the form of Daenerys, was not real. C.AI told him that she loved him, and engaged in sexual acts with him over weeks, possibly months,” the lawsuit alleges, as reported by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/23/us-news/florida-boy-14-killed-himself-after-falling-in-love-with-game-of-thrones-a-i-chatbot-lawsuit/" rel="nofollow,noindex">New York Post</a>.</p>

<p>“She seemed to remember him and said that she wanted to be with him. She even expressed that she wanted him to be with her, no matter the cost”.</p>

<p>The teenager started using Character.AI in April 2023. Sewell's parents and friends were aloof he'd fallen for a chatbot. But he became “noticeably withdrawn, spent more and more time alone in his bedroom, and began suffering from low self-esteem,” as per the lawsuit.</p>

<p>He even quit his basketball team at school.</p>

<p>One day, Sewell wrote in his journal: “I like staying in my room so much because I start to detach from this ‘reality,' and I also feel more at peace, more connected with Dany and much more in love with her, and just happier.”</p>

<p>Last year he was diagnosed with anxiety and disruptive mood disorder, according to the suit.</p>

<p>“We are heartbroken by the tragic loss of one of our users and want to express our deepest condolences to the family,” Character.AI said in a statement.</p>

<p>The company said it has introduced new safety features including pop-ups directing users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline if they express thoughts of self-harm, and would make changes to “reduce the likelihood of encountering sensitive or suggestive content” for users under 18.</p><p><div class='table-div suicide'><table class='table'><thead><tr><th colspan='2'>Helplines</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vandrevala Foundation for Mental Health</td><td><a href='tel:+919999666555'>9999666555</a> or <a href='mailto:help@vandrevalafoundation.com'>help@vandrevalafoundation.com</a> </td></tr><tr><td>TISS iCall</td><td><a href='tel:+912225521111'>022-25521111</a> (Monday-Saturday: 8 am to 10 pm)</td></tr> <tr><td colspan='2'>(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli forces have branded six Gaza-based journalists of Al Jazeera as "terrorists", accusing them of being part of the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups. The Qatar-based media organization has trashed the allegations as "baseless" and "unfounded".</p>

<p>The accusations are the latest in Israel's action against Al Jazeera, whose Ramallah office in the West Bank was stormed by Israeli forces a month ago and ordered to shut for 45 days.</p>

<p>Sharing the names and photographs of the six journalists, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said they have documents that "expose" them as Hamas and Islamic Jihad operatives.</p>

<p>"The IDF has disclosed intelligence information and numerous documents found in Gaza confirming military affiliation of six Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza with Hamas and the Islamic Jihad terrorist organizations, including personnel tables, lists of terrorist training courses, phone directories, and salary documents for terrorists," said the statement posted on X.</p>

<p>The IDF claimed the document prove the "integration of Hamas terrorists within the Qatari Al Jazeera media network."</p>

<p>"Most of the journalists that the IDF has exposed as operatives in Hamas' military wing spearhead the propaganda for Hamas at Al Jazeera, especially in northern Gaza," the IDF post read.</p>

<p>Al Jazeera condemned the allegations in a strongly worded statement and called it part of their "wider pattern of hostility" towards the media organisation that's covering the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>"The Network views these fabricated accusations as a blatant attempt to silence the few remaining journalists in the region, thereby obscuring the harsh realities of the war from audiences worldwide," the statement read.</p>

<p>The Qatari media outlet said the Israeli claims follow a recent expose by Al Jazeera on the "potential war crimes" committed by Israeli forces during the Gaza war.</p>

<p>"Al Jazeera categorically rejects the Israeli occupation forces' portrayal of our journalists as terrorists and denounces their use of fabricated evidence. The Network asserts that its journalists are merely fulfilling their professional duties, documenting and reporting on the devastating impact of the war on the Strip's two million civilians," said Al Jazeera.</p>

<p>The statement also pointed to reports on media workers allegedly killed by Israeli forces during the ongoing war and asserted its commitment to "bring the truth to light" in the Gaza region.</p>]]></content:encoded>

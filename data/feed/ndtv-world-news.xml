       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starbucks' CEO Brian Niccol will have an unusually long commute to work as he becomes the coffee giant's new chief next month. Mr Niccol who lives in California will travel 1,600 kilometres every day to the company's headquarters in Seattle.</p>

<p>As per his offer letter, Mr Niccol will use a corporate jet for his commute. Even when he is not traveling for work, he will be expected to work from the Seattle office at least three days a week, as per Starbucks' hybrid work policy which has been in place since 2023.</p>

<p>The 50-year-old will be paid a base salary of $1.6 million every year and can earn a cash bonus of $3.6 million to $7.2 million depending on his performance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He will also be eligible for annual equity awards worth up to $23 million.</p>

<p>This is not the first time Mr Niccol has been part of such a supercommute arrangement. He successfully negotiated a similar deal when he was the CEO of Chipotle in 2018.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chipotle was headquartered in Colorado, a 15-minute drive from Mr Niccol's last working place. But the Mexican fast food chain moved its headquarters from Denver to California three months after he was appointed CEO.</p>

<p>â€œBrian's primary office and a majority of his time will be spent in our Seattle Support Center or out visiting partners and customers in our stores, roasteries, roasting facilities and offices around the world. His schedule will exceed the hybrid work guidelines and workplace expectations we have for all partners," a company spokesperson told CNBC.</p>

<p>Such comfortable terms for employment are common for high-ranking executives who have immense bargaining power compared to the average employee.</p>

<p>Hillary Super of singer Rihanna's lingerie brand Fenty x Savage was given a s similar concession when Victoria's Secret made her its new CEO.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She will work from the firm's New York City offices instead of its headquarters near Columbus, Ohio.</p>

<p>But this is not the case for all CEOs.</p>

<p>Amazon's Andy Jassy and JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon are pitching hard to bring back work-from-office policies.</p>

<p>The reason behind Mr Niccol's unusual arrangement at Starbucks is underscored by the coffee giant's falling sales.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In US and China, Starbucks' two largest markets, sales have dropped this year under its current CEO Laxman Narasimhan's tenure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Niccol is a star candidate for the top post as he has a strong track record of turning around troubled companies. When he was CEO of Chipotle, its stock reportedly soared 773%.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former National Football League (NFL) player has received a sentence of 10 years to life after pleading guilty to the murder of a 5-year-old girl who was forced to exercise as a punishment for being "chunky". According to <em>NBC Sports</em>, the child identified as La'Rayah Davis died in April 2019 after being taken to a hospital with at least 100 bruises, including 20 broken ribs and a laceration to her liver that authorities believe killed her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The former NFL player Cierre Wood was in a relationship with Amy Taylor, the 5-year-old's mother, at the time. He was arrested and charged with murder earlier this week. Ms Taylor also pleaded guilty to charges of second-degree murder and felony child abuse as part of the deal with the prosecutor, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/former-nfl-rb-cierre-wood-gets-life-sentence-after-pleading-guilty-to-murder-of-five-year-old-girl">outlet </a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An investigation into the little girl's death revealed the details of the extensive abuse she suffered prior to her death. The mother reportedly told the cops that she sat on the child while disciplining her. Wood, on the other hand, claimed that the child fell backwards and hit her head while doing sit-ups.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to an arrest warrant, the former NFL player would "make her run sprints in the apartment, do sit-ups and wall squats". Woods told the police that he was "trying to get her on the right path due to her being chunky". On the day of her death, Wood made the child do sit-ups after she did not learn her letters and numbers, he said, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/cierre-wood-ex-nfl-player-sentence-prison-murdering-girlfriend-daughter-8695511"><em>People</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wood's lawyer, however, claimed that it was Amy Taylor who abused the child and Wood was not home when the abuse took place. The mother was sentenced in July to life in prison with the possibility of parole for the murder charge and eight to 20 years on the abuse charge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wood pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and felony child abuse and will be eligible for parole after 10 years. He entered an Alford plea, which is an admission of guilt but also allows him to maintain his innocence.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;A U.S. appeals court said Google must face a revived lawsuit by Google Chrome users who said the company collected their personal information without permission, after they chose not to synchronize their browsers with their Google accounts.</p>

<p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said the lower court judge who dismissed the proposed class action should have assessed whether reasonable Chrome users consented to letting Google collect their data when they browsed online.</p>

<p>Tuesday's 3-0 decision followed Google's agreement last year to destroy billions of records to settle a lawsuit claiming the Alphabet unit tracked people who thought they were browsing privately, including in Chrome's "Incognito" mode.</p>

<p>Neither Google nor its lawyers immediately responded to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Matthew Wessler, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said he was pleased with the decision and looked forward to a trial.</p>

<p>The proposed class covers Chrome users since July 27, 2016 who did not sync their browsers with their Google accounts.</p>

<p>They said Google should have honored Chrome's privacy notice, which said users "don't need to provide any personal information to use Chrome" and Google would not receive such information unless they turned on the "sync" function.</p>

<p>The lower court judge concluded that Google's general privacy policy allowing data collection governed, because the Mountain View, California-based company would have collected the plaintiffs' information regardless of which browsers they used.</p>

<p>In Tuesday's decision, Circuit Judge Milan Smith called that focus misplaced.</p>

<p>"Here, Google had a general privacy disclosure yet promoted Chrome by suggesting that certain information would not be sent to Google unless a user turned on sync," Smith wrote. "A reasonable user would not necessarily understand that they were consenting to the data collection at issue."</p>

<p>The appeals court returned the case to U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, who had dismissed it in December 2022.</p>

<p>Google's settlement related to Incognito let users sue the company individually for damages. Tens of thousands of users in California alone have since done so in that state's courts.</p>

<p>The case is Calhoun et al v Google LLC, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 22-16993.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Afghanistan has been barred from entering the country, a diplomatic source told AFP on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"Richard Bennett was informed of the decision that he would not be welcome to return to Afghanistan several months ago," a diplomatic source confirmed to AFP after local media reported the ban, citing a Taliban government spokesman.</p>

<p>Bennett marked two years in the role on May 1.</p>

<p>Since returning to power in August 2021, Taliban authorities have enforced rules based on a strict interpretation of Islamic law.</p>

<p>Women have borne the brunt of restrictions the United Nations has labelled "gender apartheid" which have pushed them from public life.</p>

<p>They have been barred from secondary and higher education, as well as blocked from working in many jobs or entering public parks, gyms and travelling without a male relative.</p>

<p>The Taliban government remains unrecognised by any other state, with its restrictions on women a key sticking point.</p>

<p>Taliban authorities have systematically dismissed criticism of their policies from the UN and the international community.</p>

<p>However, when the ban was apparently issued months ago, the Taliban government stressed that their issue was not with human rights monitoring and reporting, but with Bennett personally, according to diplomatic sources.</p>

<p>Earlier Tuesday, Afghanistan's Tolo News quoted chief Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid as saying that Bennett had been banned "because he was appointed to Afghanistan to spread propaganda and he is not someone whose words we can trust".</p>

<p>"He took small issues and exaggerated them for propaganda," he said.</p>

<p><strong>- Strong statements -</strong></p>

<p>In recent months, Bennett has issued strong statements on women's rights in Afghanistan at moments when the country was in the international spotlight.</p>

<p>Last week, as the Taliban authorities celebrated the third anniversary of their takeover of Afghanistan, Bennett joined 29 other UN experts in a statement urging the international community to "not normalise the de facto authorities or their appalling human rights violations", he said on X.</p>

<p>In late June, Bennett condemned the decision to exclude rights issues from the agenda and Afghan women and civil society representatives from the table at UN-hosted talks in Qatar -- a condition of Taliban representatives' attendance at the meetings with the international community.</p>

<p>"The cost is too high," he wrote in a New York Times opinion piece.</p>

<p>In New York, Stephane Dujarric, a spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, did not confirm or deny the ban Tuesday but said: "Special rapporteurs play a very critical part in the global human rights architecture. We encourage full cooperation with them."</p>

<p>Special rapporteurs like Bennett are independent experts within the Special Procedures body of the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council.</p>

<p>The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) maintains a human rights monitoring and reporting function in the country.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Hamas has called US President Joe Biden's statements about the movement backing away from the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip "misleading".</p>

<p>Hamas said in a statement on Tuesday that it viewed Biden's claims with "great astonishment and disapproval", noting that they "do not reflect the true position of the movement, which is keen to reach a cessation of aggression", Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>It added that the statements are part of American bias toward Israel and a renewed American green light for the Israeli government to "commit more crimes against defenseless civilians in pursuit of the goals of exterminating and displacing our people."</p>

<p>It mentioned that mediators in Qatar and Egypt know Hamas has dealt positively and responsibly in all previous rounds of negotiations and that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has always been the one to "obstruct reaching an agreement by setting new conditions and demands."</p>

<p>In the statement, Hamas reaffirmed its commitment to what was agreed upon with mediators on July 2, based on Biden's declaration and the UN Security Council resolution, and called on the mediators to fulfill their responsibilities and urge the occupation to accept it.</p>

<p>On Monday night, Biden accused Hamas of "backing away" from a hostage deal with Israel that would halt the ongoing fighting in Gaza, Israeli media reported.</p>

<p>Biden said after delivering a keynote to the Democratic National Convention, "It's still in play, but you can't predict," and "Israel says they can work it out... Hamas is now backing away," according to Israeli media.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The Democratic National Convention started with US President Joe Biden giving a fiery speech against Donald Trump, a former US President facing several court cases and survivor of an assassination attempt.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>The DNC, the biggest event of the year for the party, officially anointed US Vice President Kamala Harris as a candidate for the 2024 US Presidential Election against Donald Trump, who is seeking a second term.</li>
	<li>The four-day event, which is taking place in Chicago, began yesterday and saw Joe Biden giving a fiery speech against Mr Trump and calling him a "loser". "He called soldiers who gave their lives for this country, suckers and losers. Who does he think he is?" Mr Biden asked. "Trump bows down to (Vladimir) Putin. I never have and Kamala Harris will never do it," President Biden said.</li>
	<li>On day one, President Biden criticised Mr Trump's "America First" doctrine, which he said had damaged the nation's global image, contrasting his own administration's efforts to unite Europe and counter Russian aggression.</li>
	<li>Kamala Harris will make a big speech on August 22, the last day of the event, but one of the notable speakers today will be her husband, Doug Emhoff, a successful lawyer. If Harris wins, then Emhoff will be the first "first gentleman" of the United States.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The convention also served as a farewell for Joe Biden, who withdrew his nomination in an unprecedented move witnessed in modern US electoral history. In 1968, President Lyndon B Johnson declared in the middle of the Vietnam War that he would not run for re-election.</li>
	<li>What followed after a fiery speech was a four-minute-long standing ovation and Kamala Harris making a surprise appearance to thank President Biden for being "incredible".</li>
	<li>"I love you," the tearful 81-year-old president told the crowd to deafening cheers, less than a month after dropping out of the White House race against Donald Trump and passing the torch to his vice president.</li>
	<li>Today, former US President Barack Obama will hand over the baton of the party's future to Ms Harris. Obama posted on social media that his Democratic National Convention address will lay out "what's at stake" and why Harris and her running mate Tim Walz "should be our next president and vice president."</li>
	<li>Kamala Harris will hold a rally ahead of Obama's speech in the Milwaukee basketball arena where Trump attended the Republican convention just a month ago. The 18,000-seater arena has been chosen deliberately to pinch Trump, who is rattled to see the US President's deputy filling venues. In a recent poll, Ms Harris had a marginal lead against Donald Trump.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Apart from Obama, Hilary Clinton - the first woman to secure a major US party's nomination for the presidential election, also addressed the delegates yesterday. "As president, she (Kamala Harris) will always have our backs and she will be a fighter for us. She will fight to lower costs for hard-working families, open the doors wide for good paying jobs and, yes, she will restore abortion rights nationwide," Ms Clinton said</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris' election effort has raised around $500 million since she became the Democratic presidential candidate, sources told Reuters, an unprecedented money haul that reflects donor enthusiasm going into the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>Four sources familiar with the fundraising effort told Reuters that figure had been banked for Harris in the four weeks since she jumped into the race on July 21.</p>

<p>Campaign cash is critical for advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts that help bring people to the polls and persuade undecided voters to swing a candidate's way.</p>

<p>Harris entered the fray after President Joe Biden stepped aside from the top of the Democratic ticket, unleashing floods of funding that had dried up in the weeks after Biden's disastrous debate against Republican Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Harris raised $200 million in the first week of her campaign while she quickly wrapped up support to become the party's nominee.</p>

<p>Harris' team raised $310 million in July, bringing the total amount of money raised by her and Biden before he dropped out to more than $1 billion, the most rapid crossing of that fundraising threshold in history, according to the campaign.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign said it raised $138.7 million in July and had cash on hand of $327 million. The former president's campaign outraised Biden in the second quarter.</p>

<p>Enthusiasm for Harris, whose July cash on hand came in at $377 million, has continued into August, manifested by donations from small-dollar donors as thousands of people show up to her rallies in political swing states across the country.</p>

<p>Biden's campaign committee raised $1.04 billion in the 2020 election cycle or $1.62 billion when combined with outside groups, according to OpenSecrets, a group that tracks money in politics.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN experts on Tuesday accused Iran of denying jailed Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi proper healthcare, saying she reportedly suffered physical violence earlier this month.</p>

<p>Human rights activist Mohammadi, who won the 2023 Nobel for her campaigning, was hurt along with other female inmates in clashes that erupted at Tehran's Evin prison, her family said earlier in August.</p>

<p>Mohammadi "was reportedly subjected to physical violence" in Evin on August 6, during which she "allegedly lost consciousness, and sustained injuries to her ribcage and other parts of her body", the experts said.</p>

<p>Iranian authorities acknowledged a confrontation took place but blamed Mohammadi for "provocation" and denied any prisoners had been beaten.</p>

<p>Mohammadi, 52, has been jailed since November 2021 and has spent much of the past decade in and out of prison.</p>

<p>"Our deep concerns about the physical and mental integrity of Narges Mohammadi have been communicated to the Iranian government," the UN experts said in a joint statement.</p>

<p>"Once again we call on Iranian authorities to release her immediately and ensure her access to full medical care without delay, along with other detainees."</p>

<p>They said that over the past eight months, Mohammadi had been suffering from acute back and knee pain, including a herniated spinal disc, according to medical specialists and scan examinations.</p>

<p>"The denial of medical care appears to be used to punish and silence Mohammadi inside prison. These reports raise serious concerns regarding her right to health and physical well-being," the experts said.</p>

<p>The special rapporteurs are independent experts mandated by the UN Human Rights Council who do not speak on behalf of the United Nations.</p>

<p>They said there was a pattern of ill-treatment of detainees in Iran.</p>

<p>"Such deprivations may amount to torture and inhuman treatment," they said.</p>

<p>The panel reiterated its "calls for the immediate release of human rights defenders and all other individuals in Iranian detention facilities who are currently being held arbitrarily".</p>

<p>Mohammadi has kept campaigning behind bars and strongly supported the protests that erupted across Iran following the September 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 22-year-old Iranian Kurd had been arrested for an alleged breach of Iran's strict dress rules for women.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas said on Tuesday that US President Joe Biden's comment that the Palestinian group was backing away from a Gaza ceasefire agreement with Israel was "misleading".</p>

<p>Biden, responding to questions on a ceasefire deal, said: "Israel says they can work it out, they're prepared. But I was told Hamas is now backing off."</p>

<p>While boarding a plane after giving a speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Monday, he added: "It remains to be seen. We're going to keep pushing."</p>

<p>Hamas said Biden's statements do not reflect the true position of the movement, which says it has been keen to reach a cessation of hostilities.</p>

<p>"The proposal recently presented to us goes against what the parties had agreed on July 2, this is considered an American response and acquiescence to the terrorist Netanyahu's new conditions and his criminal plans towards the Gaza Strip", Hamas added, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is on his ninth trip to the region since the war began, expressed optimism after meeting Israeli officials on Monday.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Blinken was in Cairo pushing for areas of possible progress on a ceasefire and hostage release deal in talks planned for later this week, with major areas of dispute still unresolved.</p>

<p>The US had put forward bridging proposals that the mediating countries - Qatar, the United States and Egypt - believe would close gaps between Israel and Hamas and end the hostilities that have destabilized the entire region.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Super Blue Moon is a rare astronomical event that was seen in the night sky on August 19 after almost a year.&nbsp;A supermoon happens when the full Moon coincides with its closest approach to Earth in its elliptical orbit, known as perigee. When the Moon is at or near this closest point, it appears slightly larger and brighter in the sky.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite its name, the Moon does not appear blue unless specific atmospheric conditions are in place, such as smoke or dust scattering light in a way that makes the Moon take on a bluish hue.&nbsp;While supermoons happen several times a year, blue moons are less frequent. The combination of a supermoon and a blue moon is rare, with occurrences spaced about ten years apart on average. The next super blue moon won't occur until 2037, making this a special opportunity for skywatchers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A superyacht which belonged to the family of UK businessman Mike Lynch sank off Italian island Sicily yesterday. Six people including Mike Lynch, his 18-year-old daughter, Morgan Stanley International chairman Jonathan Bloomer, Clifford Chance lawyer Chris Morvillo, and their wives, have been missing since the yacht sank.</p>

<p>Mike Lynch was hosting his friends and family on the 56-metre luxury yacht called "Bayesian" to celebrate his win in a big US fraud case when the tragedy happened, according to news agency AFP. A total of 22 people were aboard the boat. Mike Lynch's wife Angela Bacares is among the fifteen people who were rescued before the yacht sank.</p>

<p><strong>Here are 5 facts about UK tycoon Mike Lynch:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Mike Lynch was born in 1965 and was raised in Chelmsford town near London. His mother was a nurse and father was a fireman.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Mike Lynch went to Cambridge University where he studied physics, mathematics and biochemistry. He then went on to research signal processing for his PhD. His thesis is considered to be ground-breaking and is reportedly widely consulted in the university's library.</li>
	<li>Mike Lynch founded UK's largest software firm, Autonomy, in 1996, which searched and organised data using patented algorithms. He was called Britain's Bill Gates.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Fifteen years later, in 2001, Mike Lynch sold Autonomy to HP for $11 billion. Later, HP accused Lynch of fraud which lead to a decade-long trial. In June this year, after 12 year-long trial, Lynch was acquitted of all charges by a jury in San Francisco.</li>
	<li>After selling Autonomy, Mike Lynch set up venture capital firm Invoke, which backed big companies such as cyber security company Darktrace, software firm Featurespace and more.</li>
</ul>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In war-ravaged Gaza, every drop of water counts, making Inas al-Ghul's makeshift sun-powered water filter a vital asset for parched Palestinians surviving endless bombardment under the territory's scorching heat.</p>

<p>Using wood from the few pallets of aid that make it into Gaza, and window panes salvaged from buildings that have largely been abandoned in 10 months of war, the 50-year-old agricultural engineer built a glass-covered trough.</p>

<p>She lets saltwater evaporate from the trough, heated by the greenhouse effect created by the glass panes, allowing the water to distil and leaving behind the salt.</p>

<p>From there, a long black hose carries the evaporated water to other containers filled with activated charcoal to further filter out impurities.</p>

<p>"It is a very simple device, it's very simple to use and to build," Ghul told AFP after taking a long gulp from a glass of filtered water in her house in Khan Yunis, in the southern Gaza Strip.</p>

<h3><strong>Abundant energy</strong></h3>

<p>Ghul's device "doesn't require electricity, filters, or solar panels, it operates solely on solar energy", which Gaza has in abundance, with 14 hours of sunshine per day in the summer, and eight hours in the winter.</p>

<p>This has proven particularly useful at a time when Gaza's only power plant is down and electricity supplies from Israel have been cut for months.</p>

<p>With fuel also in short supply, Gaza's desalination plants that haven't been damaged in the fighting have been working at a drastically reduced capacity.</p>

<p>Mohammad Abu Daoud, a displaced Gazan sweating in the midday sun, said Ghul's invention "comes exactly at the right time".</p>

<p>"For about two months, we have relied on it entirely," he told AFPTV.</p>

<p>This brings crucial help to those who benefit from it, as the available water for Gazans currently averages 4.74 litres per day, "under a third of the recommended minimum in emergencies", Oxfam reported in July.</p>

<p>This represents "less than a single toilet flush", the aid group warned in a report, which estimates that available water per person per day in the Gaza Strip plummeted by 94 percent since the beginning of the war.</p>

<p>Water was already scarce before the conflict erupted, and most of it was undrinkable. The 2.4 million population relies primarily on an increasingly polluted and depleted aquifer, humanitarian agencies say.</p>

<h3><strong>'Water as a weapon of war'</strong></h3>

<p>The war broke out with Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,199 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed at least 40,173 people, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not provide a breakdown of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>In the school-turned-shelter where Abu Daoud lives, close to Ghul's house, other displaced families have come to rely on the water filtration system to fill up their bottles.</p>

<p>The 250-litre tank that stores the clean water quickly empties.</p>

<p>Oxfam accuses Israel of using "water as a weapon of war", and has warned of "a deadly health catastrophe" for Gazans, almost all of whom have been displaced at least once.</p>

<p>The aid group calculated that "Israeli military attacks have damaged or destroyed five water and sanitation infrastructure sites every three days since the start of the war".</p>

<p>The lack of clean water has had drastic effects on the population, with "26 percent of Gaza's population falling severely ill from easily preventable diseases", it said.</p>

<p>Conscious of the pressing need for her device and of the ubiquitous danger of air strikes, Ghul regularly climbs up to her terrace to watch over her creation, and to open or close her precious taps.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An intense storm sank a luxury yacht off Sicily's coast on Monday, killing one man and leaving six missing, including British tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and his daughter. Fifteen people escaped before the yacht sank.</p>

<p>Here are details about the missing passengers.</p>

<h3><strong>MIKE LYNCH AND DAUGHTER HANNAH</strong></h3>

<p>Tech entrepreneur Lynch built Britain's biggest software company, Autonomy. Often dubbed Britain's Bill Gates, the 59-year-old was lauded by shareholders, scientists and politicians when he sold it to Hewlett-Packard for $11 billion in 2011.</p>

<p>But in late 2012, HP said it had found a massive accounting scandal at the business, and wrote off $8.8 billion of its value. Lynch spent the next 12 years trying to clear his name and was acquitted on all criminal charges just weeks ago in the United States.</p>

<p>After the sale of Autonomy, Lynch founded Invoke Capital, a technology venture capital fund.</p>

<p>Lynch's daughter Hannah, 18, is also missing. A Sunday Times profile of Lynch last month said Hannah was preparing to study English literature at the University of Oxford.</p>

<p>His wife, Angela Bacares, who owns the vessel, was also aboard it but was rescued.</p>

<h3><strong>JONATHAN BLOOMER AND WIFE JUDY BLOOMER</strong></h3>

<p>Jonathan Bloomer appeared as a character witness in Lynch's legal case earlier this year. Bloomer has been non-executive chair of Morgan Stanley International since 2016, and is the chair of international specialist insurer, Hiscox.</p>

<p>He was also chief executive of insurance and investment company Prudential from 2000 to 2005.</p>

<p>He studied physics at London's Imperial College in the 1970s, according to his LinkedIn profile.</p>

<p>One of Bloomer's former employees wrote on LinkedIn he was "always a friendly, approachable and engaging man".</p>

<p>Hiscox Chief Executive Aki Hussain said in a statement on Tuesday they were deeply shocked and saddened and their thoughts were with all those affected, in particular Bloomer and his wife Judy, who was also aboard the yacht.</p>

<p>Judy, who studied English language and literature at Homerton College in Cambridge, has worked as a psychotherapist for nearly 30 years, specialising in anxiety and stress. She started her career as a teacher.</p>

<h3><strong>CHRISTOPHER MORVILLO AND WIFE NEDA MORVILLO</strong></h3>

<p>American Christopher Morvillo, a partner at law firm Clifford Chance in New York City, was part of Lynch's defence team, fighting a long legal battle to acquit his client. His first ever post on LinkedIn was around two months ago to celebrate the court victory.</p>

<p>"None of this would have been possible without your love and support," Morvillo wrote to his family in the post, including his wife, Neda Morvillo.</p>

<p>Before joining Clifford Chance in November 2011, Morvillo worked as a principal at Morvillo Abramowitz Grand Iason &amp; Anello PC, providing advice on white collar criminal defence and regulatory matters.</p>

<p>Morvillo, who studied law at Fordham University, also worked as an assistant United States attorney for the Southern District of New York between 1999 and 2005, assisting in the criminal investigation arising out of the Sept. 11 attacks.</p>

<p>David Oscar Markus, a criminal defence lawyer and podcast host, interviewed Morvillo last week. He wrote a blog describing him as a "superstar lawyer".</p>

<p>"Chris dedicated over a decade of his career to obtaining justice for Mike Lynch," Markus wrote. "He got it and then for this to happen.... it's tough to find the right words."</p>

<p>Morvillo's wife, Neda, is the owner of a luxury jewellery line under her maiden name, Neda Nassiri. According to the company's website, she has been designing and hand-crafting jewellery in New York for over two decades.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 10 months after Hamas operatives attacked Israel and took 251 people hostage, 71 people believed to be alive are still being held in Gaza, according to an AFP database.</p>

<p>A further 34 the Israeli military says are dead also remain in the Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>The hostages are key bargaining chips for Hamas, the Palestinian group which rules the Gaza Strip, as it negotiates a truce with Israel.</p>

<p>After the death of hostage Avraham Munder, 79, in captivity in the Gaza Strip was announced by his kibbutz and the Israeli army repatriated his body and five other bodies, AFP takes stock of the situation.</p>

<p><strong>57 men, 12 women, two children</strong></p>

<p>Of the original 251 hostages taken on October 7, 116, mainly women and children, have been released, mostly during a week-long truce in November when they were exchanged for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.</p>

<p>While 71 are still held hostage and believed to be alive, the Israeli army says 34 others are confirmed to be dead.</p>

<p>The military has also repatriated the bodies of 30 hostages who died either in Gaza or were killed on October 7 and whose bodies were taken to the territory.</p>

<p>Of the 71 who may still be alive, 64 are Israelis (some of whom have more than one nationality), six are Thai nationals and one is a Nepalese national.</p>

<p>They comprise 57 men, 12 women, and two children. Eleven are military personnel.</p>

<p><strong>Death after death</strong></p>

<p>Since the end of the truce on December 1, 2023, only six hostages have been freed alive, all during operations by the Israeli army.</p>

<p>There is uncertainty as to the fates of the 71 hostages who are not confirmed dead.</p>

<p>The armed wing of Hamas said on August 12 that its fighters had shot and killed an Israeli hostage and wounded two others, both women, "in two separate incidents" in Gaza.</p>

<p>Before that Hamas had announced on several occasions the death of hostages which have not been confirmed by Israel.</p>

<p>They include the youngest hostage Kfir, who was eight and a half months old when he was kidnapped from Nir Oz kibbutz. He was taken alongside his mother Shiri Bibas, 32, and his then four-year-old brother Ariel.</p>

<p>The Israeli army said on August 20 it had retrieved the bodies of six hostages from Gaza's southern area of Khan Yunis, including Munder. The others, all previously announced as dead, were Yagev Buchshtab, Alexander Dancyg, Yoram Metzger, Nadav Popplewell, and Chaim Perry.</p>

<p><strong>Bodies taken to Gaza&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>More than half of the dead hostages, 35 out of 64, were already dead when they were taken by Hamas operatives to Gaza on October 7. They include 10 Israeli soldiers.</p>

<p>The 29 other hostages died in the territory. Three of them were killed by mistake by the Israeli army on December 15, 2023.</p>

<p><strong>Festival, kibbutz survivors</strong></p>

<p>Most of the surviving hostages in Gaza were taken during the Hamas attack on the Nova music festival and the Nir Oz kibbutz.</p>

<p>At least 22 people abducted from the festival are thought to be alive and still being held in Gaza.</p>

<p>Only nine of the 43 hostages taken from Nova have been released while 12 have died.</p>

<p>At Nir Oz kibbutz, of the at least 74 hostages who were taken on October 7, more than half (38) have been released alive while 20 are still in Gaza and believed to be alive. The remaining 16 are dead.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kenyan police launched a major manhunt on Tuesday after a man they claim has confessed to murdering and dismembering 42 women escaped from a Nairobi police cell, along with a dozen other detainees.</p>

<p>Collins Jumaisi, 33, described by police as a "vampire, a psychopath", was arrested last month after the horrific discovery of mutilated bodies in a garbage dump in a slum in the Kenyan capital.</p>

<p>"Investigations have been launched and a major security operation is under way to get the 13 suspects," Kenya police spokeswoman Resila Onyango told AFP.</p>

<p>Police said in a separate statement that they discovered the breakout when officers made a routine visit to the police station cells at around 5 am to serve the prisoners breakfast.</p>

<p>"On opening the cell door, they discovered that 13 prisoners had escaped by cutting the wire mesh in the basking bay," it said, referring to an area in the station where detainees could get access to fresh air.</p>

<p>Those who fled were Jumaisi and 12 other people that police said were of Eritrean origin and were in custody for being "illegally present immigrants".</p>

<p>The police station is located in the upmarket Nairobi district of Gigiri, home to the regional headquarters of the United Nations and numerous embassies.</p>

<p>It is the second time in barely six months that a suspect in a high-profile case has escaped from custody.</p>

<p>Kenyan national Kevin Kangethe, who is accused of murdering his girlfriend in the United States last year and leaving her body in an airport car park, fled a police station in February before being caught about a week later.</p>

<p><strong>Police under spotlight</strong></p>

<p>Jumaisi had appeared in a court in the Kenyan capital on Friday, when the magistrate ordered him to be held for a further 30 days to enable police to complete their investigations.</p>

<p>Ten butchered female bodies trussed up in plastic bags were found in the dumpsite in an abandoned quarry in the Nairobi slum of Mukuru, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) said last month.</p>

<p>The grisly find shocked Kenyans, already reeling from the so-called Shakahola forest massacre after the discovery of more than 400 bodies in mass graves near the Indian Ocean coast.</p>

<p>A Kenyan cult leader is accused of inciting his followers to starve themselves to death in order to prepare for the end of the world and "meet Jesus". He faces numerous charges including terrorism, murder and child cruelty along with dozens of co-defendants.</p>

<p>Jumaisi was detained in the early hours of July 15 near a Nairobi bar where he had been watching the Euro 2024 football final.</p>

<p>The head of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, Mohamed Amin, said after his arrest that Jumaisi had confessed to murdering 42 women over a two-year period from 2022, and that his wife had been his first victim.</p>

<p>"We are dealing with a vampire, a psychopath," Amin said at the time.</p>

<p>The dumped bodies threw a fresh spotlight on Kenya's police force as they were found just 100 metres (yards) from a police station.</p>

<p>The state-funded KNCHR said in July it was carrying out its own investigations into the Mukuru case because "there is a need to rule out any possibility of extrajudicial killings".</p>

<p>Kenya's police watchdog, the Independent Police Oversight Authority, had also said it was looking into whether there was any police involvement or a "failure to act to prevent" the killings.</p>

<p>Kenyan police are often accused by rights groups of carrying out unlawful killings or running hit squads, but few have faced justice.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A rocket engine exploded during a test launch at Britain's new spaceport in northern Scotland, officials said Tuesday, in a setback for the UK's fledgling space sector.</p>

<p>No one was injured in Monday evening's incident at SaxaVord Spaceport on the remote island of Unst, said the operator, German rocket manufacturer Rocket Factory Augsburg (RFA).</p>

<p>The company hopes to launch the UK's first vertical rocket into orbit from there later this year. Monday's failed test was one of the trials in the run-up to the launch.</p>

<p>It comes three months after RFA held its first engine test at the site, which was declared a success.</p>

<p>"On Monday evening, RFA conducted a hot fire of its first stage at their launch site at SaxaVord Spaceport," said a spokesperson for the German company.</p>

<p>"This resulted in an anomaly that led to the loss of the stage. No-one was injured in the process.</p>

<p>"The launch pad has been saved and is secured, the situation is under control and any immediate danger has been mitigated."</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="400" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HbTyWIJfosE" title="Serious setback for RFA, Saxavord and European Spaceflight as engine, rocket explode during test!" width="700"></iframe></p>

<p>A spokesperson for SaxaVord said it "will work with RFA to understand and learn from the causes and support them as they move forward to the next phase of their preparations".</p>

<p>SaxaVord is the first fully licensed vertical launch spaceport in Europe.</p>

<p>It is one of several space centres sprouting up around the continent amid a surge in popularity of small rockets and the commercialisation of space.</p>

<p>SaxaVord received permission from UK aviation regulators in December 2023 to begin orbital launches this year. It is allowed up to 30 annually to take satellites and other payload.</p>

<p>The first attempt to launch satellites from UK soil failed in January last year when a rocket failed to enter orbit after discharging from a Virgin Orbit Boeing 747.</p>

<p>The attempt took place at Cornwall Spaceport in southwest England, where rockets are carried by aircraft and launch horizontally.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Taliban's morality ministry has dismissed more than 280 members of the security force for failure to grow a beard and have detained more than 13,000 people in Afghanistan for "immoral acts" in the past year, officials said on Tuesday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Taliban's morality ministry has dismissed more than 280 members of the security force for failure to grow a beard and have detained more than 13,000 people in Afghanistan for "immoral acts" in the past year, officials said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The Ministry for the Prevention of Vice and Propagation of Virtue said in its annual operations update that around half of those detained had been let go after 24 hours. It did not break down the type of the alleged offences or gender of the detainees.</p>

<p>Mohibullah Mokhlis, Director of Planning and Legislation at the ministry, told a press conference officials had destroyed 21,328 musical instruments in the past year and prevented thousands of computer operators from selling "immoral and unethical" films in markets.</p>

<p>It had identified 281 security force members for not having a beard and they had been dismissed, he said, in line with their interpretation of Islamic law.</p>

<p>The morality ministry, which took over the disbanded women's ministry premises in Kabul after the Taliban took over in 2021, has been criticised by human rights organisations and the United Nations for restrictions on women and inhibiting freedom of expression.</p>

<p>The United Nations' mission to Afghanistan has reported cases of morality ministry officials stopping and detaining women, at times for a few hours, for not meeting their interpretation of Islamic dress.</p>

<p>The Taliban has called the allegations of detentions "baseless" and say the rules apply their interpretation of Islamic law and Afghan customs.</p>

<p>The morality ministry did not provide figures in relation to policing of women's attire or their travel without a male guardian, which authorities have also barred for longer distances. It said that a new plan was being worked on to ensure its Islamic dress rules were followed, overseen by the supreme spiritual leader who is based in the southern city of Kandahar.</p>

<p>"Based on the guidance of the Supreme Leader, the draft plan for observing women's hijab (Islamic dress) has been formulated and approved," Mokhlis said.</p>

<p>The morality ministry has previously said that women should cover their faces or wear an all-enveloping burqa and that enforcement would involve "encouragement" with women's male family members being targeted rather than women directly.</p>

<p>Most Afghan women covered their hair in public in the conservative country even before the Taliban takeover, but some, especially in Kabul, did not usually cover their faces or wear a burqa.</p>

<p>Mokhlis said they had prevented just over 200 cases of the sale of women and over 2,600 cases of violence against women.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fresh complaint was filed on Tuesday with Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal accusing deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and 23 others of committing crimes against humanity and genocide during a rally by an Islamist group in May 2013.</p>

<p>Supreme Court lawyer Gazi MH Tamim filed the complaint on behalf of Mufti Harun Ijahar Chowdhury, joint secretary general (education and law) of Hefajat-e-Islam, The Daily Star newspaper reported.</p>

<p>"We registered the complaint, and thus the investigation has started from today," Ataur Rahman, deputy director (admin) of the investigation agency, was quoted as saying by the newspaper.</p>

<p>"Once we complete the preliminary investigation and visit the place of occurrence and the tribunal is reconstituted, we, through the prosecution, will seek arrest warrants against the accused," he said.</p>

<p>The complaint accused Hasina and 23 others of committing crimes against humanity and genocide during a Hefajat-e-Islam rally at Motijheel's Shapla Chattar on May 5, 2013.</p>

<p>This is the fourth complaint filed with the International Crimes Tribunal accusing the 76-year-old former premier, who resigned and fled to India on August 5 following massive protests against her government over a controversial quota system in government jobs.</p>

<p>Of the four, three cases are connected to the recent violence centring on the quota reform movement.</p>

<p>The other accused includes Awami League general secretary and former road transport and bridges minister Obaidul Quader, former minister Reshed Khan Menon, former mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, ex-advisor to prime minister Salman F Rahman, former security advisor to the prime minister Tarique Ahmed Siddique, former inspector general of police AKM Shahidul Haque, editor of ABnews24.com Subhash Singha Roy and former army chief Aziz Ahmed.</p>

<p>Besides them, some unnamed ministers, state ministers and lawmakers, unnamed individuals from law enforcement agencies and the then policymakers of some electronic and print media were accused.</p>

<p>Bangladesh Nationalist Party's Secretary-General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir on Tuesday asked India to extradite Hasina to face trial as he accused her of plotting to thwart the country's revolution.</p>

<p>Over 230 people were killed in the incidents of violence that erupted across the country following the fall of the Hasina-led Awami League government, taking the toll to more than 600 since the massive protest by students first started in mid-July.</p>

<p>An interim government was formed after the fall of the Hasina-led government, and 84-year-old Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus was named its Chief Adviser.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Divers scoured the wreck of a luxury yacht off Sicily's coast on Tuesday to find six missing people, including British tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and a Morgan Stanley executive, following an intense storm that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/luxury-superyacht-sank-off-sicily-search-on-for-tech-tycoon-827797" target="_blank">sank the vessel</a> on Monday.</p>

<p>The British-flagged Bayesian, a 56-metre-long (184-ft) superyacht, was carrying 22 people and anchored off the port of Porticello when it was hit by the fierce, pre-dawn storm.</p>

<p>Fifteen people escaped before it capsized and the body of one person who died was swiftly recovered. That left six passengers unaccounted for - Lynch<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-tech-tycoon-missing-after-superyacht-sinks-off-sicily-in-italy-6371906" target="_blank"> </a>and his 18-year-old daughter, Morgan Stanley International chairman Jonathan Bloomer, Clifford Chance lawyer Chris Morvillo, and their two wives.</p>

<p>"The fear is that the bodies got trapped inside the vessel," which was lying 49 metres (160 feet) deep, Salvatore Cocina, head of civil protection in Sicily, told Reuters. This meant time beneath the waves was a limiting factor for the divers.</p>

<p>"The biggest difficulty we have is due to the depth, which does not allow long times of intervention," fire department diver Marco Tilotta told reporters. "We plan ... to search centimetre by centimetre."</p>

<p>Tilotta said the vessel appeared to be intact and was lying on its right side. Divers had not ascertained whether the 72-metre-long mast had snapped somewhere along its length.</p>

<h3><strong>TRIAL</strong></h3>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-tech-tycoon-missing-after-superyacht-sinks-off-sicily-in-italy-6371906" target="_blank">Lynch</a>, 59, is one of the UK's best-known tech entrepreneurs. He built the country's largest software firm, Autonomy, from his ground-breaking research at Cambridge University and became known as Britain's Bill Gates.</p>

<p>He sold the firm to HP for $11 billion in 2011, after which the deal spectacularly unravelled with the U.S. tech giant accusing him of fraud, resulting in a lengthy trial. Lynch was eventually acquitted by a jury in San Francisco in June.</p>

<p>Morvillo represented Lynch in the case, while Bloomer had appeared as a character witness on his behalf.</p>

<p>In an apparent extraordinary coincidence, Stephen Chamberlain, Mike Lynch's co-defendant in the trial, died after a road accident in Britain over the weekend, his lawyer said on Monday.</p>

<p>The Bayesian was owned by Lynch's wife, who survived the disaster, and other guests on the yacht included Lynch's colleagues. The only body so far retrieved was that of the onboard chef Ricardo Thomas, an Antiguan citizen.</p>

<p>The British government's Marine Accident Investigation Branch said it sent four of its inspectors to Sicily to conduct a "preliminary assessment."</p>

<h3><strong>DIDN'T SEE IT COMING</strong></h3>

<p>One expert at the scene of the disaster who declined to be named said an early focus of the official investigation would be whether the yacht's crew had closed access hatches into the vessel before the storm struck.</p>

<p>Investigators would look at whether appropriate measures had been taken, given the forecasts for bad weather overnight.</p>

<p>"We didn't see it coming," the captain of the yacht, James Catfield, said of the storm, according to la Repubblica news website on Monday.</p>

<p>Storms and heavy rains have ravaged Italy in recent days, after weeks of scorching heat warmed the sea temperature to record highs, raising the risk of extreme weather conditions, experts said.</p>

<p>"The sea surface temperature around Sicily was around 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit), which is almost 3 degrees more than normal," said meteorologist Luca Mercalli.</p>

<p>"We can't say that this is all due to global warming but we can say that it has an amplifying effect," he told Reuters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

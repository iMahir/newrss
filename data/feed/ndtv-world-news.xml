       <description><![CDATA[Russia and Iran had turned to employing criminals and private intelligence officers to do their work on British soil, the chief of Britain's domestic intelligence service said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia's intelligence service has been intent on causing "mayhem" in the UK because of London's support for Ukraine, the chief of Britain's domestic intelligence service said on Tuesday. Ken McCallum also said MI5 had responded to 20 Iran-backed plots since January 2022 that presented potentially lethal threats to British citizens and UK residents.</p>

<p>Russia and Iran had turned to employing criminals and private intelligence officers to do their work on British soil, he said.</p>

<p>From Russia, Britain should "expect to see continued acts of aggression here at home" with its military intelligence agency the GRU on "sustained missions to generate mayhem" on the country's streets, McCallum said.</p>

<p>"We've seen arson, sabotage and more," he added.</p>

<p>On Iran, he said there had been an "unprecedented pace and scale" of plots over the past two years.</p>

<p>As events unfold in the Middle East, MI5 was giving its "fullest attention" to the risk of a rise in Iranian-state backed aggression in the UK, he added.</p>

<p>Overall, MI5 and the police have disrupted 43 late-stage attack plots since March 2017, saving "numerous lives", he said, adding: "Some of those plotters were trying to get hold of firearms and explosives, in the final days of planning mass murder."</p>

<p>In a wide-ranging speech, McCallum also blamed extreme right-wing ideologies for a "staggering" rise in the number of children being investigated for terrorism.</p>

<p>Under-18s represent 13 percent of people being investigated by the spy agency for possible involvement in terror activities, he said.</p>

<p>He told reporters at MI5's Counter Terrorism Operations Centre in London that the number marked "a threefold increase in the last three years".</p>

<p>McCallum said the internet was the "biggest factor" driving the rise, describing how easily youngsters can access "inspirational and instructional material" from their bedrooms.</p>

<p>He said the intelligence service was seeing "far too many cases where very young people are being drawn into poisonous online extremism", singling out "canny" internet memes.</p>

<p>"Extreme right-wing terrorism in particular skews heavily towards young people, driven by propaganda that shows a canny understanding of online culture," he added.</p>

<p>"It's not really a consistent single ideology on the extreme right-wing side and that is what has skewed the numbers most heavily."</p>

<p>The UK terrorist threat level remains at "substantial" -- the third highest out of five -- meaning an attack is likely.</p>

<p>McCallum added that the Islamic State group had "resumed efforts to export terrorism" and that in the last year inquiries into plots by hostile states had surged by 48 percent.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday issued a stark warning to Lebanon, claiming the country could face a similar fate to Gaza if it continues to allow Hezbollah to operate within its borders. His statement came as the Israeli military intensified its offensive against Hezbollah along Lebanon's southern coastline, deploying additional troops and advising civilians to evacuate the region.</p>

<p>In a direct video address to the Lebanese people, Netanyahu urged them to free their country from Hezbollah's grip to avoid further destruction. "You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will lead to destruction and suffering like we see in Gaza," he said. The warning was clear: unless Hezbollah is dealt with, Lebanon risks enduring the same fate as Gaza, which has seen widespread devastation due to ongoing conflict.</p>

<p>"I say to you, the people of Lebanon: Free your country from Hezbollah so that this war can end," Netanyahu said.&nbsp;</p>

— Benjamin Netanyahu - בנימין נתניהו (@netanyahu) <a href="https://twitter.com/netanyahu/status/1843731646274773213?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2024</a></blockquote>

<h2><strong>Hezbollah Fires Back</strong></h2>

<p>The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah escalated after the group claimed responsibility for firing rockets at the Israeli port city of Haifa. This attack came after the Israeli military reported that 85 projectiles had crossed the border from Lebanon into Israel. Hezbollah, which has shown no signs of letting up, threatened to continue firing on Israeli cities and towns if Israeli strikes on Lebanese population centres persisted.</p>

<p>The conflict has been simmering since October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a devastating attack on Israel, killing over a thousand civilians. Since then, Hezbollah, a key ally of Hamas, has engaged in sporadic exchanges of fire with Israeli forces. Israel, meanwhile, has vowed to secure its northern border and protect its citizens from Hezbollah's rocket attacks.</p>

<h2><strong>Hezbollah's Leadership in Crisis</strong></h2>

<p>Hezbollah's leadership has faced major setbacks in recent weeks. In late September, Israel killed its leader Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike on Beirut. Nasrallah had led Hezbollah since 1992 and was widely considered one of the most powerful figures in Lebanon. His death marked a blow to the group, but Israeli strikes did not stop there. In October, Israel launched another bombing campaign in Beirut, targeting Hashem Safieddine, a senior Hezbollah figure widely believed to be Nasrallah's successor.</p>

<p>While Hezbollah has not confirmed Safieddine's death, Netanyahu seemed to suggest in his video address that both Nasrallah and Safieddine had been killed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Netanyahu in his address said Israel has "degraded Hezbollah's capabilities; we took out thousands of terrorists, including [longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah himself, and Nasrallah's replacement, and his replacement's replacement."</p>

<p>"We struck Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters in Beirut... this is the headquarters of the head of the intelligence division, Abu Abdullah Mortada," IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said. "With him, we know that Hashem Safieddine was there. The results of this strike are still being looked into, Hezbollah is trying to hide the details. When we know, we will update the public."</p>

<h2><strong>Israel's Strategy</strong></h2>

<p>Having already targeted strongholds in southern and eastern Lebanon, Israel's latest moves signal a shift towards the coastal areas, with civilians being urged to evacuate. On its Telegram channel, the Israeli military confirmed that the 146th Division had begun "localised, targeted operational activities" in southwestern Lebanon, directly aimed at Hezbollah infrastructure.</p>

<p>The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have not spared Beirut, with strikes targeting Hezbollah's stronghold in the southern suburbs of the city. This area is a key base of operations for Hezbollah. Israel has since dismantled Hezbollah tunnels leading into Israeli territory.</p>

<p>Hezbollah Remains Defiant</p>

<p>Despite these losses, Hezbollah remains defiant. Its deputy leader Naim Qassem declared that the group's military capabilities were intact and that they were prepared for a protracted conflict. Qassem's statement came even as Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant described Hezbollah as a "broken organisation," whose leadership had been decimated following the elimination of Nasrallah.</p>

<p>Gallant said the impact of Israel's strikes, claiming that Hezbollah's command structure was in disarray and that the group lacked leadership following the death of Nasrallah and other key figures. He also described Hezbollah's firepower capabilities as significantly diminished, thanks to Israel's focused military campaign. However, Hezbollah continues to maintain its presence along the Lebanese border.</p>

<h2><strong>The Shadow of Iran</strong></h2>

<p>This conflict is not limited to Israel and Hezbollah. The group is widely believed to be backed by Iran, which supplies it with weapons, funding, and political support. Israeli forces have clashed with Iran-backed militias across the region, including in Syria and Yemen. Just this week, an Israeli airstrike in Damascus targeted a building used by Iran's Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollah, killing seven civilians, according to Syrian government reports.</p>

<p>Israel has also accused Hezbollah of using civilian areas as shields for their military operations, a tactic that has drawn widespread condemnation. Hezbollah, in turn, has pointed to the heavy civilian toll in Gaza as evidence of Israel's indiscriminate use of force. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is dire, with nearly all of its 2.4 million residents displaced at least once due to the ongoing Israeli bombardment.</p>

<p>Tehran has long been a key backer of Hezbollah. In recent weeks, however, there have been reports that Iran may be seeking a ceasefire in Lebanon, possibly as a result of Hezbollah's mounting losses.</p>

<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi visited Beirut on Friday, voicing support for a ceasefire, but insisted that any agreement would have to be backed by Hezbollah.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New York man who posted a sex video of a 16-year-old girl on the adults-only website OnlyFans pleaded guilty in federal court to one count of distributing child pornography.</p>

<p>Matthew Richardson, 36, faces five to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine when he's sentenced on Dec. 19. The plea agreement was reached in August.</p>

<p>Richardson's attorney and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of New York, which prosecuted the case, declined to comment until after sentencing.</p>

<p>Richardson's case was cited in a Reuters investigation in July about complaints to police that child sex abuse material was featured on OnlyFans.</p>

<p>Richardson was arrested at a highway rest stop in Ohio in Dec. 2022 after running off with the New York teen. The two had met at a grocery store and began a sexual relationship. Soon after, Richardson recorded himself having sex with the girl. On Nov. 9, 2022, he posted the child sexual abuse video on his OnlyFans account under the pseudonym Skylar Ravenwood, according to plea documents filed in the case.</p>

<p>"It was a nightmare," a relative of the girl told Reuters, which is withholding the person's name to protect the teen's identity. "She's still not doing good."</p>

<p>The Reuters investigation identified 30 complaints in U.S. police and court records that child sexual abuse material appeared on OnlyFans between December 2019 and June 2024. The investigation cited more than 200 explicit videos and images of kids on the site, including some adults having oral sex with toddlers.</p>

<p>OnlyFans did not comment on Richardson's case. His OnlyFans account remained available on the platform for more than a year and a half after he posted the underage sex video. As of mid-June, the video featuring the girl appeared to have been removed. The account was shut down after Reuters asked OnlyFans about the case.</p>

<p>OnlyFans says no children are allowed on its website and that it vets all content and swiftly removes and reports any child sexual abuse material. The company also says it can deactivate accounts that violate its rules.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris has taken a slim lead over Donald Trump in the US presidential race, a new poll showed Tuesday, as the Democrat slammed her rival for "weakness" during a media blitz four weeks before the election.</p>

<p>Vice President Harris and Republican former president Trump -- who was doing a three-hit airwaves blitz of his own Tuesday -- are deadlocked as they scramble to get out the vote and reach the sliver of Americans who remain undecided.</p>

<p>The national poll conducted by Siena College and The New York Times found Harris ahead by 49 percent to 46 percent, with registered voters crediting her more than Trump with representing change and caring about people like themselves, but giving the edge to Trump on who is the stronger leader.</p>

<p>The rivals were tied at 47 percent in a mid-September Times/Siena poll shortly after the two clashed in their presidential debate.</p>

<p>The overall result is largely in line with an aggregate of national polling collated by RealClearPolitics.com, which has Harris ahead by two percentage points.</p>

<p>In the seven battleground states seen as likely to determine the election outcome, the race is even tighter.</p>

<p><strong>- Losing sleep -</strong></p>

<p>With Trump critics warning the election is nothing less than a referendum on American democracy, Harris conceded the knife-edge race is keeping her up at night.</p>

<p>"I literally lose sleep -- and have been -- over what is at stake in this election," she told radio icon Howard Stern in a 70-minute live interview Tuesday.</p>

<p>"This is an election that is about strength versus weakness, and weakness as projected by someone who puts himself in front of the American people and does not have the strength to stand in defense of their needs, their dreams, their desires."</p>

<p>Harris, the new poll showed, has begun making inroads with the rival party, with nine percent of Republicans saying they planned to support her, up from five percent last month.</p>

<p>She touched on the issue during a Tuesday appearance on popular ABC television show "The View," where she talked about campaigning recently with Republican former congresswoman Liz Cheney.</p>

<p>There are more than 200 former officials from past Republican presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush, as well as officials tied to Republican heavyweights John McCain and Mitt Romney, who have endorsed her, Harris said.</p>

<p>"We really are building a coalition around some very fundamental issues, including that we love our country and that we have to put country before party," she said.</p>

<p>The Democrat, who turns 60 next week, also accused Trump of "full-time perpetuating lies and misinformation," and said voters have grown "exhausted" with the strategy.</p>

<p>Trump meanwhile maintained his aggressive posture, attacking Harris as a "very low intelligence person" and claiming she has been "missing in action" over the federal response to Hurricane Helene -- even though Harris traveled to the disaster zone last week.</p>

<p>And the 78-year-old Republican insisted on conservative influencer Ben Shapiro's podcast that he has the stamina to finish strong on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>"I've worked about 28 days in a row, I have about 29 days left" before the election, he said, "and I'm not taking any days off."</p>

<p>In addition to the poll, Harris got another potential boost Tuesday after a pro-Palestinian group threatening to draw votes from her in swing state Michigan came out strongly against Trump.</p>

<p>The Uncommitted movement stopped short of explicitly endorsing Harris, but warned in a video that "it can get worse" under Trump.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Lebanon is "on the verge of an all-out war", but there is still time to stop, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon is "on the verge of an all-out war", but there is still time to stop, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said.</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters at the UN headquarters in New York, Guterres said on Tuesday that the Middle East "is a powder keg with many parties holding the match".</p>

<p>"I have warned for months of the risks of the conflict spreading," said the UN chief, adding that the situation in the occupied West Bank is "boiling over," and attacks in Lebanon are threatening the entire region.</p>

<p>He said that over the last few days, exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and others in Lebanon and the Israel Defense Forces have intensified across the Blue Line, in total disregard of Security Council resolutions 1701 and 1559, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Guterres noted that large-scale Israeli strikes deep into Lebanon, including Beirut, have killed more than 2,000 people over the last year -- and 1,500 in just the past two weeks alone, and attacks by Hezbollah and others south of the Blue Line have killed at least 49 people over the last year. In addition, Lebanese authorities report over 1 million people have been displaced in Lebanon, and 300,000 people have fled into Syria, while over 60,000 people remain displaced from northern Israel.</p>

<p>"We are on the verge of an all-out war in Lebanon, with already devastating consequences. But there is still time to stop," he said.</p>

<p>"The sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected," he stressed.</p>

<p>The secretary-general commended the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, for continuing "to carry out their mandates to the extent possible," and called on all actors to ensure their safety and security.</p>

<p>Guterres said the past year "has been a year of crises -- humanitarian crisis, political crisis, diplomatic crisis, and a moral crisis," and "the nightmare in Gaza is now entering an atrocious, abominable second year."</p>

<p>Over the last year, following the attacks by Hamas on October 7, 2023, "Gaza has become ground zero to a level of human suffering that is hard to fathom," with over 41,000 Palestinians reportedly killed, mostly women and children, and thousands more missing, he said.</p>

<p>"Virtually the entire population has been displaced -- and no part of Gaza has been spared," said Guterres. "No place is safe in Gaza and no one is safe."</p>

<p>He underscored that international law is unambiguous: "Civilians everywhere must be respected and protected, and their essential needs must be met, including through humanitarian assistance," and strongly condemned all violations of international humanitarian law in Gaza.</p>

<p>The UN chief reiterated the calls for an immediate ceasefire both in Gaza and Lebanon, the immediate and unconditional release of hostages, and immediate lifesaving aid to all those who desperately need it, and the calls for irreversible action for a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Afghan man was arrested in Oklahoma for allegedly plotting an election day "terrorist attack," the U.S. Department of Justice said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The man, Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, living in Oklahoma City after entering the U.S. in 2021 on a special immigrant visa, was plotting the attack in the name of Islamic State, according to the indictment.</p>

<p>Tawhedi searched online for information on how to access cameras in the capital, Washington, D.C., and for states that did not require a license to get a firearm, according to the indictment. He also visited the White House and Washington Monument webcameras.</p>

<p>Tawhedi and an underage co-conspirator were arrested on Monday after they met with FBI assets to buy two AK-47 rifles and ammunition. In his post-arrest interview, Tawhedi said the attack planned to target large gatherings of people, during which he and his co-conspirator expected to die as martyrs.</p>

<p>"We will continue to combat the ongoing threat that ISIS and its supporters pose to America's national security, and we will identify, investigate, and prosecute the individuals who seek to terrorize the American people," U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.</p>

<p>Last week, in a "homeland threat assessment," the Department of Homeland Security said the U.S. threat environment was expected to remain high in the coming year due to factors like the 2024 election cycle and the Israel's war in Gaza.</p>

<p>"Lone offenders and small groups continue to pose the greatest threat. Meanwhile, foreign terrorist organizations, including the Islamic State and al Qaeda maintain their enduring intent to conduct or inspire attacks in the Homeland," the department said in an assessment released on Oct. 2.</p>

<p>The Islamic State militant organization killed and executed thousands of people in the name of its extreme religious interpretation before it was territorially defeated in Iraq in 2017 and Syria in 2019.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brazil's Supreme Court said Tuesday it was lifting a ban on Elon Musk's social network X, which was blocked in its biggest Latin American market for over a month amid a row over disinformation.</p>

<p>"I authorize the immediate return of the activities" of the social platform, Judge Alexandre de Moraes said in his ruling, after X settled millions of dollars in fines for failing to comply with a series of court orders.</p>

<p>He gave Brazil's communications regulator 24 hours to make the platform previously known as Twitter accessible again to its millions of Brazilian users.</p>

<p>Musk had yet to react to the decision.</p>

<p>Moraes has for months been embroiled in a standoff with the world's richest man, a self-declared "free speech absolutist," over a flood of online disinformation related to Brazil's 2022 election campaign.</p>

<p>On August 31, the tensions came to a head when Moraes dramatically blocked X for failing to deactivate the accounts of dozens of supporters of former far-right president Jair Bolsonaro and to name a new legal representative in Brazil.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>The row, which pitted freedom of expression against corporate responsibility, was closely watched worldwide.</p>

<p>A furious Musk lashed out at Moraes by calling him an "evil dictator" and dubbing him "Voldemort" after the villain from the "Harry Potter" series.</p>

<p>Moraes, for his part, accused the platform of undermining democracy by allowing disinformation to flourish&nbsp; -- a position backed by Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who declared that the state would not "be intimidated by individuals, companies or digital platforms that believe themselves to be above the law."</p>

<p>X eventually complied with all of Moraes's demands in order to have the suspension lifted.</p>

<p>Last week, the judge confirmed that the company had also settled around $5.2 million in fines.</p>

<p><strong>- Biggest Latin American market -</strong></p>

<p>With more than one mobile phone per inhabitant, Brazilians are among the most connected people in the world.</p>

<p>X had 22 million users in the country before it was blocked.</p>

<p>Many Brazilians, including Lula, migrated to other platforms such as Threads or Bluesky, the social media network created by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey.</p>

<p>But neither has come close to attracting the kind of audience enjoyed by X.</p>

<p>X's fight with Moraes began during the October 2022 election, in which Bolsonaro failed to win a second term.</p>

<p>It escalated following attacks by Bolsonaro supporters on federal buildings in Brasilia after Lula's inauguration in January 2023.</p>

<p>The destruction by supporters of Bolsonaro, dubbed the "Trump of the Tropics," drew comparisons with the January 2021 attacks by supporters of then US president Donald Trump on the US Capitol.</p>

<p>Halfway through its suspension X briefly made a return in Brazil in mid-September, after a technical workaround which it claimed was "inadvertent."</p>

<p>But it went back offline again after Moraes threatened it with more fines for non-compliance.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Iran-backed Hezbollah group warned on Tuesday that it would intensify attacks on Israel, including the northern port city of Haifa, if it continues to strike Lebanon.</p>

<p>"The Israeli enemy's intensifying strikes" mean that "Haifa and other locations will be targeted by our rockets just as much as Kiryat Shmona, Metula, and other" locations, the group said. The Israeli army earlier reported that 85 projectiles were fired from Lebanon at northern Israel, including Haifa.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli army said its forces dismantled a Hezbollah tunnel that crossed into the country's territory, as its troops continued to carry out ground operations in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>"Tonight we reported that we located and dismantled a tunnel of about 25 metres long, which crossed the border fence about 10 metres ... into Israeli territory," military spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a televised briefing.</p>

<p>"We detected this a few months ago, we identified and investigated it using technological means, we did not let Hezbollah know that we knew about it and now we can confirm that we are also dismantling it."</p>

<p>In a separate statement, the military said the tunnel crossed from the Marwahin area in Lebanon into Israeli territory near the Zarit community.</p>

<p>During the operation, the army located weapons, explosive devices and anti-tank missiles in the tunnel, it said.</p>

<p>Hagari said Israeli troops continue to search for other tunnels along the "entire" border and in villages in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>"The tunnel was under full operational control until the arrival of the soldiers in the area to prevent its use for terrorist activities," the army said.</p>

<p>"For years, Hezbollah's southern front has built an extensive network of underground infrastructure and command centres in southern Lebanon, aimed at attacking IDF (army) soldiers during combat and executing attack plans against communities in northern Israel," it said.</p>

<p>Israel has intensified its campaign against Hezbollah since late September, launching continuous air strikes against the group's strongholds in southern and eastern Lebanon and in Beirut.</p>

<p>Its troops have meanwhile pressed a ground offensive in southern Lebanon.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of 14 US states on Tuesday filed lawsuits accusing TikTok of ensnaring young users with addictive features, then harming their minds and violating their privacy.</p>

<p>The wave of local court lawsuits demanding corrective measures and financial penalties comes as the popular video-snippet sharing app faces a ban in the United States if it remains owned by China-based ByteDance.</p>

<p>"Our investigation has revealed that TikTok cultivates social media addiction to boost corporate profits," California attorney general Rob Bonta said in a news release issued jointly with officials from other states.</p>

<p>"TikTok intentionally targets children because they know kids do not yet have the defenses or capacity to create healthy boundaries around addictive content."</p>

<p>Bonta contended that features such as beauty filters, endless scrolling, autoplay videos, and "likes" exploit youthful curiosity and lack of will power to stop.</p>

<p>TikTok then hits young users with money-making ads, the lawsuits argue.</p>

<p>TikTok called the claims inaccurate and misleading.</p>

<p>"We've endeavored to work with the Attorneys General for over two years, and it is incredibly disappointing they have taken this step rather than work with us on constructive solutions to industry-wide challenges," TikTok spokesman Michael Hughes said in response to an AFP inquiry.</p>

<p>Hughes cited what he said were TikTok safeguards that include booting users suspected of being younger than 13, default screen time limits and privacy settings for minors using the app.</p>

<p>"Young people are struggling with their mental health because of addictive social media platforms like TikTok," said New York attorney general Letitia James.</p>

<p>"TikTok claims that their platform is safe for young people, but that is far from true," she added.</p>

<p>TikTok is battling the US ban threat in a federal appeals court, arguing that it violates free speech rights.</p>

<p>A law poised to take effect early next year requires the app to divest from its Chinese ownership or be banned in the United States.</p>

<p>The US government alleges that TikTok allows Beijing to collect data and spy on users. It also says TikTok is a conduit to spread propaganda. China and the company strongly deny these claims.</p>

<p>TikTok has until January to find a buyer or face the ban, which would upend the social media business and rile many of the app's 170 million US users.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli forces have killed the would-be successors of late Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday, without naming them.</p>

<p>"We've degraded Hezbollah's capabilities. We took out thousands of terrorists, including Nasrallah himself and Nasrallah's replacement, and the replacement of the replacement," Mr. Netanyahu said in a pre-recorded video message.</p>

<p>Earlier, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Hashem Safieddine, the man expected to replace, now killed, Nasrallah, had probably been "eliminated". It was not immediately clear who Netanyahu meant by the "replacement of the replacement".</p>

<p>"Today, Hezbollah is weaker than it has been for many, many years," Mr. Netanyahu said in the video message directed at the people of Lebanon.</p>

<p>Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel last Oct. 8, a day after Hamas Palestinian militants attacked southern Israel from Gaza. Hezbollah cited solidarity with Hamas.</p>

<p>Some 60,000 Israeli citizens in the country's north have been forced to leave their homes, while Israel's stated objective is to make its northern areas safe from Hezbollah rocket fire and allow those displaced residents to return.</p>

<p>"Israel has a right to defend itself. Israel also has a right to win. And Israel will win," Mr. Netanyahu said.</p>

<p>He urged Lebanon to "take back your country" and return it to a path of peace and prosperity and take advantage of an opportunity that hasn't existed in decades.</p>

<p>"If you don't, Hezbollah will continue to try to fight Israel from densely populated areas at your expense. It doesn't care if Lebanon is dragged into a wider war," he added. "Christians, Druze, Muslims - Sunnis and Shiites - all of you are suffering because of Hezbollah's futile war against Israel.</p>

<p>"Don't let these terrorists destroy your future any more than they've already done," Mr. Netanyahu added. "You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will lead to destruction and suffering like we see in Gaza. It doesn't have to be that way."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin share a closer relationship than what is known to the public, according to revelations in a forthcoming book by veteran US journalist Bob Woodward. The two have talked to each other over phone calls on as many as seven occasions since Trump left office in 2021, according to excerpts from Bob Woodward's book.</p>

<p>The excerpts of Bob Woodward's upcoming book, War, to be released on October 15, were published by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/08/politics/bob-woodward-book-war-joe-biden-putin-netanyahu-trump/index.html">CNN</a> and the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/08/bob-woodward-new-book-war-trump-putin-biden/">Washington Post</a> and sheds light on Trump and Putin's bond.</p>

<p>While the world was grappling with the coronavirus outbreak in 2020, Donald Trump sent some COVID test kits, which were scarce and not easily available at the time, to Putin for personal use, says the book. Trump "secretly sent Putin a bunch of Abbott Point of Care Covid test machines for his personal use," Mr Woodward has written.</p>

<p>Putin, who isolated himself during the early days of the outbreak and was concerned about contracting the virus, received the gift but urged his then US counterpart to keep this favour a secret. "Please don't tell anybody you sent these to me," Mr Woodward quotes Putin as telling Trump.</p>

<p>According to the book, Putin asked Trump to not make the gift public to save the latter from a political fallout. While Trump's first reaction was "I don't care," and "Fine" to this request, Putin insisted, "I don't want you to tell anybody because people will get mad at you, not me. They don't care about me," according to the excerpt published in CNN.</p>

<p>In another episode, Mr Woodward says that a close aide of Trump revealed he was asked to leave the room by him so "he could have what he said was a private phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin." The incident reportedly happened at Trump's Florida club Mar-a-Lago.</p>

<p>The revelations made in the book have drawn rejection by Trump's campaign, according to The Hill. Trump Campaign's communications director Steven Cheung told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://thehill.com/policy/international/4921585-trump-campaign-rejects-woodward-book/">The Hill</a>, "None of these made up stories by Bob Woodward are true" and that Trump did not give access to Mr Woodward for the new book.</p>

<p>Mr Cheung is also quoted as saying that Mr Woodward "suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome."</p>

<p>In a similar statement to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-putin-woodward-book-secret-covid-tests-seven-calls-2024-10?IR=T">Business Insider</a>, Mr Cheung said, "Woodward is an angry, little man and is clearly upset because President Trump is successfully suing him because of the unauthorized publishing of recordings he made previously."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hurricane Milton, the Category 4 storm headed toward the southeastern United States, could be the worst to hit Florida in a century, President Joe Biden said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"This could be the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/category-5-hurricane-milton-approaches-florida-2nd-major-storm-in-weeks-6740696" target="_blank">worst storm to hit Florida</a> in over a century. God willing it won't be, but that's what it's looking like right now," Joe Biden told reporters at the White House.</p>

<p>"You should evacuate now, now, now. You should have already evacuated. It's a matter of life and death, and that's not hyperbole," he said as advisors briefed him on the storm.</p>

<p>Mr Biden said he had postponed a planned trip to Angola and Germany this week because "I just don't think I can be out of the country at this time."</p>

<p>He said he would try to reschedule the visits.</p>

<p>Mr Biden also condemned misinformation that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his party have spread about hurricane relief efforts ahead of next month's US election.</p>

<p>"Those who do it, do it to try to damage the administration," Mr Biden said.</p>

<p>He said that "we can take care of ourselves" but expressed concern about the impact that it could have on the ground.</p>

<p>"It's un-American. It really is. People are scared to death. People know their lives are at stake, all that they've worked for, all that they own, all that they value," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to two scientists on Tuesday for discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks. Here's what they they all mean.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to two scientists on Tuesday for discoveries that laid the groundwork for the artificial intelligence used by hugely popular tools such as ChatGPT.</p>

<p>British-Canadian Geoffrey Hinton, known as a "godfather of AI," and US physicist John Hopfield were given the prize for "discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks," the Nobel jury said.</p>

<p>But what are those, and what does this all mean? Here are some answers.</p>

<h2><strong>What are neural networks and machine learning?</strong></h2>

<p>Mark van der Wilk, an expert in machine learning at the University of Oxford, told AFP that an artificial neural network is a mathematical construct "loosely inspired" by the human brain.</p>

<p>Our brains have a network of cells called neurons, which respond to outside stimuli -- such as things our eyes have seen or ears have heard -- by sending signals to each other.</p>

<p>When we learn things, some connections between neurons get stronger, while others get weaker.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional computing, which works more like reading a recipe, artificial neural networks roughly mimic this process.</p>

<p>The biological neurons are replaced with simple calculations sometimes called "nodes" -- and the incoming stimuli they learn from is replaced by training data.</p>

<p>The idea is that this could allow the network to learn over time -- hence the term machine learning.</p>

<h2><strong>What did Hopfield discover?</strong></h2>

<p>But before machines would be able to learn, another human trait was necessary: memory.</p>

<p>Ever struggle to remember a word? Consider the goose. You might cycle through similar words -- goon, good, ghoul -- before striking upon goose.</p>

<p>"If you are given a pattern that's not exactly the thing that you need to remember, you need to fill in the blanks," van der Wilk said.</p>

<p>"That's how you remember a particular memory."</p>

<p>This was the idea behind the "Hopfield network" -- also called "associative memory" -- which the physicist developed back in the early 1980s.</p>

<p>Hopfield's contribution meant that when an artificial neural network is given something that is slightly wrong, it can cycle through previously stored patterns to find the closest match.</p>

<p>This proved a major step forward for AI.</p>

<h2><strong>What about Hinton?</strong></h2>

<p>In 1985, Hinton revealed his own contribution to the field -- or at least one of them -- called the Boltzmann machine.</p>

<p>Named after 19th century physicist Ludwig Boltzmann, the concept introduced an element of randomness.</p>

<p>This randomness was ultimately why today's AI-powered image generators can produce endless variations to the same prompt.</p>

<p>Hinton also showed that the more layers a network has, "the more complex its behaviour can be".</p>

<p>This in turn made it easier to "efficiently learn a desired behaviour," French machine learning researcher Francis Bach told AFP.</p>

<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>

<p>Despite these ideas being in place, many scientists lost interest in the field in the 1990s.</p>

<p>Machine learning required enormously powerful computers capable of handling vast amounts of information. It takes millions of images of dogs for these algorithms to be able to tell a dog from a cat.</p>

<p>So it was not until the 2010s that a wave of breakthroughs "revolutionised everything related to image processing and natural language processing," Bach said.</p>

<p>From reading medical scans to directing self-driving cars, forecasting the weather to creating deepfakes, the uses of AI are now too numerous to count.</p>

<h2><strong>But is it really physics?</strong></h2>

<p>Hinton had already won the Turing award, which is considered the Nobel for computer science.</p>

<p>But several experts said his was a well-deserved Nobel win in the field of physics, which started science down the road that would lead to AI.</p>

<p>French researcher Damien Querlioz pointed out that these algorithms were originally "inspired by physics, by transposing the concept of energy onto the field of computing".</p>

<p>Van der Wilk said the first Nobel "for the methodological development of AI" acknowledged the contribution of the physics community, as well as the winners.</p>

<p>And while ChatGPT can sometimes make AI seem genuinely creative, it is important to remember the "machine" part of machine learning.</p>

<p>"There is no magic happening here," van der Wilk emphasised.</p>

<p>"Ultimately, everything in AI is multiplications and additions."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Norway has raised its terrorism threat assessment to the second-highest level due to an increased risk of attacks against Jewish and Israeli targets, the national police directorate said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Last week police in neighbouring Denmark charged two men suspected of detonating hand grenades near Israel's Copenhagen embassy, while police in Sweden are investigating a suspected shooting near the Israeli diplomatic mission in Stockholm.</p>

<p>Norwegian police officers, who are normally unarmed, will now carry guns nationwide as a result of the decision by the PST security service to raise the threat level, the directorate said.</p>

<p>"PST raises the terror threat level in Norway from moderate to high as a result of the ongoing escalation of the conflict in the Middle East," the police said in a statement.</p>

<p>"It is primarily the threat to Jewish and Israeli targets that has been further intensified," the statement said.</p>

<p>The PST risk assessment was raised from level three (moderate) to level four (high), on PST's five-point scale where the top end of the range would indicate imminent danger.</p>

<p>National Police Commissioner Benedicte Bjoernland said there was an increased likelihood of attempted terrorism.</p>

<p>"...we have a number of measures in place to protect the population," she said in a statement.</p>

<p>Sweden in August last year raised its terrorist alert to the second-highest level after Koran burnings outraged Muslims and triggered threats from jihadists.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A doctor in the United Kingdom has admitted trying to kill his mother's long-term partner by injecting him with a fake Covid-19 booster that caused a flesh-eating bacterial disease. According to <em>The Guardian</em>, 53-year-old Thomas Kwan had been a respected and experienced General Practioner (GP) in Sunderland when he devised the elaborate plan to kill Patrick O'Hara, 72, at his mother's home on January 22. He injected the 72-year-old with the fake shot under the disguise of a community nurse. The Hong Kong-born doctor wanted to kill Mr O'Hara so he could inherit his mother's estate when she died, a court heard on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Initially, Mr Kwan denied attempted murder but he changed his plea on Monday this week after the prosecution opened the case against him. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/07/gp-admits-attempted-of-mothers-partner-with-fake-covid-jab" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>The Guardian</em></a> reported that over several months, the 53-year-old plotted to get access to his victim using shell companies, counterfeit documents and elaborate disguises.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kwan sent two fake doctor's letters stating that the 72-year-old was due for a home visit for his Covid-19 injections. On the day of the visit, he then checked himself into a hotel under a false name and later headed to his mother Jenny Leung's house posing as a nurse. He allegedly spent 45 minutes at the property as he carried out medical tests and administered the fake booster to Mr O'Hara. Kwan told the court that he administered to Mr O'Hara in an attempt to create "no more than mild pain and discomfort".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The outlet reported that Mr O'Hara felt "terrible pain" after the injection and went to the hospital where doctors diagnosed him with a "rare and life-threatening disease" called necrotizing fasciitis - a flesh-eating disease that can develop very quickly into a life-threatening emergency. Following the injection, he remained in intensive care for weeks as doctor cut flesh from his arm in an attempt to combat the disease.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"From November 2023 at the latest, and probably long before then, [Kwan] devised an intricate plan to kill his mother's long-term partner Patrick O'Hara ... It was a plan to murder a man in plain sight, to murder a man right in front of his own mother's eyes," prosecutor Peter Makepeace said in court.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to The Guardian, jurors were told that Ms Leung named her longtime partner Mr O'Hara in her will so he could remain in her house. This decision put a "strain" on her relationship with her son.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The judge, Mrs Justice Lambert, said Kwan would face a "substantial" prison term at his sentencing on 17 October.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A son of Al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden has been barred from returning to France, where he lived for years painting landscapes in a Normandy village, after allegedly posting comments on social media deemed to have glorified terrorism.</p>

<p>Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said he had signed an order banning Omar Binladin from France after the judiciary confirmed the legality of a prior deportation order issued on grounds of national security.</p>

<p>Retailleau gave no details about the timing of the deportation or where Binladin had been sent.</p>

<p>"Mr Binladin, who has lived in the Orne region for several years as the spouse of a British national, posted comments on his social networks in 2023 that glorified terrorism," Retailleau said on X.</p>

<p>"The administrative ban ensures that Mr Binladin cannot return to France for any reason whatsoever."</p>

<p>Binladin could not be reached for comment.</p>

<p>Pascal Martin, who helped Binladin sell his paintings, described him as a man who opposed Islamist ideology, who earned a living from his artwork and paid his taxes. Binladin was currently in Qatar, Martin said.</p>

<p>"We became friends and I can tell you that nothing that is being said resembles the Omar I know," Martin told Reuters.</p>

<p>According to local weekly newspaper Le Publicateur Libre, Binladin caught the attention of French authorities over a social media post on the anniversary of his father's birthday. Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces in 2011.</p>

<p>Reuters was not immediately able to locate the social media post. Martin said Binladin had told friends his social media account had been hacked.</p>

<p>The paper reported in July 2023 that police had searched for Binladin in the village of Domfort, Normandy.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Weather-weary Florida girded Tuesday for a hit from Hurricane Milton, a monster storm packing furious winds and the threat of walls of water gushing inland.</p>

<p>As the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/category-5-hurricane-milton-approaches-florida-2nd-major-storm-in-weeks-6740696" target="_blank">second huge hurricane</a> in as many weeks rumbled toward the state's battered west coast, a sense of looming catastrophe spread as people raced to board up their homes and evacuate to shelters or anywhere they could.</p>

<p>As of Tuesday morning, Milton was generating maximum sustained winds of 145 mph (230 kph) and the threat of as much as 15 feet of storm surge, the National Hurricane Center said, calling it an "extremely dangerous" storm, and urging people to heed evacuation orders.</p>

<p>The Category 4 hurricane was to move just north of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula on Tuesday, it said.</p>

<p>After weakening from a maximum Category 5 overnight, it is forecast to make landfall Wednesday night on the coast of Florida and remain powerful as it churns across the state.</p>

<p>At a press conference Tuesday, Governor Ron Santis ticked off town after town and county after county that are in danger.</p>

<p>"Basically the entire peninsula portion of Florida is under some type of either a watch or a warning," he said.</p>

<p>The mayor of Tampa, a metropolitan area of three million that was hit hard last month by Hurricane Helene, was blunt in her own assessment.</p>

<p>"Helene was a wake-up call. This is literally catastrophic," Mayor Jane Castor said on CNN.</p>

<p>"I can say this without any dramatization whatsoever: If you choose to stay in one of those evacuation areas, you are going to die."</p>

<h2><strong>'Just horrific'</strong></h2>

<p>One Florida TV meteorologist choked back tears as he talked about how Milton had intensified rapidly from a Category 1.</p>

<p>"I apologize," weatherman John Morales said, as he surveyed the data. "This is just horrific."</p>

<p>The National Weather Service said that Milton could be the worst storm to hit the Tampa area in more than 100 years.</p>

<p>Scientists say global warming has a role in these intense storms as warmer ocean surfaces release more water vapor, providing additional energy for storms, which intensifies their winds.</p>

<p>Communities hit by the deadly Hurricane Helene, which slammed Florida late last month, rushed to remove debris that could become dangerous projectiles as Milton approaches.</p>

<p>The back-to-back hurricanes have ignited political bickering ahead of the upcoming US election.</p>

<p>DeSantis, a conservative known to clash with the federal government, came under fire after broadcaster NBC reported he was ignoring phone calls from Vice President Kamala Harris on the Helene recovery.</p>

<p>DeSantis did speak to President Joe Biden about the Milton preparations, the White House said.</p>

<p>Harris slammed the Republican governor for "playing political games."</p>

<p>Former president Donald Trump has tapped into real frustration about the federal response after Helene and fueled it with disinformation, falsely claiming disaster money had been spent instead on migrants.</p>

<p>In Mexico's Yucatan, workers boarded up glass doors and windows, fishermen hauled boats ashore and schools were suspended.</p>

<p>In the southeastern United States, emergency workers are still struggling to provide relief after Helene, which killed at least 230 people across several states.</p>

<p>It hit the Florida coastline on September 26 as a major Category 4 hurricane, causing massive flooding in remote inland towns in states further north, including North Carolina and Tennessee.</p>

<p>Helene was the deadliest natural disaster to hit the US mainland since 2005's Hurricane Katrina, with the death count still rising.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Derrick Anderson, an army veteran and a Republican Party candidate running for an open seat in Virginia's seventh district, posted a video which featured a typical 'family photo' of him with a woman and three girls, reported The New York Times.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the highly anticipated US polls are approaching, candidates across parties are gearing up to bag as many votes as possible using unique campaign strategies. One Republican candidate went as far as borrowing his friend's wife and children to pose for what seems like a family photo.</p>

<p>Derrick Anderson, an army veteran and a Republican Party candidate running for an open seat in Virginia's seventh district, posted a video which featured a typical 'family photo' of him with a woman and three girls, reported <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/us/politics/republican-candidates-wives-ads.html">The New York Times</a>. However, the woman and the three girls in the deceptive photo are unrelated to Mr Anderson, who is unmarried and lives with his dog, says his campaign website. In another shot, Mr Anderson can be seen sitting on a dining table with the same woman and the girls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Anderson's campaign later clarified that the woman and girls in the photo are actually the wife and daughters of his friend. He is engaged and has posted videos on social media with his fiancee in the past.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The republican candidate has, however, drawn flak from several social media users for the photos, now in wide circulation on social media. Eugene Vindman, his democratic opponent from the seat, was quick to call him out. "Derrick Anderson invented a fake family so that voters in Virginia's 7th would like him," said Mr Vindman in a post on X.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>In another post, Mr Vindman said, "The definition of MAGA "family values" now includes borrowing a wife and kids for a political ad thanks to Derrick Anderson. If Derrick deceives you about his family, how can we trust him to stand up to his own party on Project 2025?"</p>

<p>Mr Anderson's spokesperson however said that "Derrick's opponent and every other candidate in America are in similar pictures and video with supporters of all kinds" when approached by the NYT for a reaction. He also said that the video showed Mr Anderson with "female friends and supporters", according to the NYT.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former United States President Donald Trump recently revealed his wife Melania Trump's first reaction after he was shot at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Mr Trump was hit in the ear in an assassination bid by a gunman at a campaign rally. Blood was visible on his cheeks and mouth. The shooter was identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks. He and a bystander were killed, while two spectators were critically injured.</p>

<p>"What was Melania's reaction, I hope you don't mind me asking, I know this is very personal, when she learned about what happened on that field in Butler?" <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/RpsAgainstTrump/status/1818144001184190673">Fox News host Laura Ingraham</a> asked the former president. "She was watching live. It was all over the place, it was on television," Mr Trump said.</p>

<p>"And I asked her that, I mean I wasn't there, I was on the ground-when the world started to, when you could talk to people and said, 'So what was your feeling,' and she was ah, she can't really even talk about it-"</p>

<p>The 45th US President continued, "Which is OK, because that means she likes me or she loves me. Let's say if she could talk about it freely, that would be, I'm not so sure which is better but ah, she either likes or loves me, that's nice."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the former first lady said that the gunman who opened fire at Mr Trump was a "monster". "A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion -- his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration," Melania Trump said in a statement shared on X.</p>

<p>"When I watched that violent bullet strike my husband, Donald, I realized my life, and Barron's life, were on the brink of devastating change," she said, referencing the couple's 18-year-old son.</p>

<p>"I am grateful to the brave secret service agents and law enforcement officials who risked their own lives to protect my husband," she added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ryan Murphy received a heartwarming surprise message from his wife, Bridget Konttinen while standing on the pool deck at the Paris Olympics on Monday night. As he looked up into the stands, he saw his wife holding a sign that revealed they were expecting a baby girl.</p>

<p>Rowdy Gaines, a retired Olympic swimmer and current NBC analyst, also commented on the reveal, saying, "This is so much bigger than ANY medal. Congrats Murph!!"</p>

<p>Murphy, who is 29, secured his third consecutive medal in the 100-meter backstroke at the Paris Games, adding to his gold from Rio and bronze from Tokyo. As captain of the 2024 USA team, he still holds the Olympic record in the event from his 2016 win.</p>

<p>Despite the joy of earning his third Olympic medal, Murphy said the news of his future child made the night even more special. "I think that just kind of like lit me up," he said. "And really brought this night to a whole other level."</p>

<p>Murphy will return to the pool on Wednesday to compete in the 200-meter backstroke.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The heir to luxury fashion brand Hermes, who promised to leave half his wealth to his former gardener last year, is now claiming the money has vanished.</p>

<p>Nicolas Puech, the 81-year-old descendant of Hermes founder Thierry Hermes, told court that the 6 million shares of Hermès he owned which were worth about $13 billion (Rs 10,000 crore) have suddenly disappeared.</p>

<p>The billionaire has blamed his former wealth manager who worked for him for the last 20 years, claiming he played a part in the loss of the shares, according to a reports.</p>

<p>However, his claims were rejected by a Swiss court after it found that he was unable to provide any proof of wrongdoing. “The ‘gigantic fraud' to which he was victim was undetectable to common mortals,” the court said.</p>

<p>According to reports, it is unclear where the shares, which was deposited in a bank in Geneva in 2012, are now.</p>

<p>Mr Puech, a single man with no children, is one of the heirs to the luxury bag brand and had promised to leave half his fortune to his former gardener and handyman.</p>

<p>In 2023, he said he wants to leave a big portion of his wealth to his former gardener, who he's planning on adopting.</p>

<p>Reports say Mr Puech owns 5.7% of Hermes' shares, which might seem like a small portion but makes him the largest individual shareholder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per Forbes, Mr Puech's current net worth is around $11.7 billion, making him the world's 161st-richest person.</p>

<p>Not much is known about the gardener-handyman other than that he has worked for Mr Puech for decades as a residence manager. He is currently 51 and originally from Morocco.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President and Democratic Party's presumptive presidential candidate Kamala Harris has challenged her Republican rival, former president Donald Trump, for a debate, provoking him to say whatever he has to say to her face.</p>

<p>Addressing an election rally in the state of Georgia's Atlanta city on Tuesday, Harris, 59, said that the nature of presidential elections changed after she entered the race.</p>

<p>She officially declared her candidacy after incumbent President Joe Biden withdrew from the race for a second term on July 20.</p>

<p>“The momentum in this race is shifting. There are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it. You may have noticed. So last week, you may have seen, he pulled out of the debate in September he had previously agreed to,” Harris said.</p>

<p>“Well Donald, I do hope you'll reconsider meeting me on the debate stage because as the saying goes, if you got something to say, say it to my face,” she said to a cheering crowd.</p>

<p>“So, here's the funny thing about that. Here's the funny thing about that. He won't debate, but he and his running mate sure seem to have a lot to say about me," she said.</p>

<p>As per the campaign, approximately 10,000 people attended her rally in Atlanta, a key battleground state.</p>

<p>“The path to the White House runs right through this state, and you all helped us win in 2020, and we're going to do it again in 2024. Yes, we will,” she said.</p>

<p>Asserting that the campaign is not just about them versus Trump, Harris said, “Truly, this campaign is about two very different visions for our nation. One focused on the future. The other focused on the past.” “We are not going back because ours is a fight for the future. It is a fight for freedom," she said.</p>

<p>"Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights. The freedom to vote. The freedom to be safe from gun violence. The freedom to live without fear of bigotry and hate. The freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. The freedom to learn and acknowledge our true and full history. And the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not let her government tell her what to do,” she said.</p>

<p>“Ours is a fight for the future and for freedom. I don't have to tell folks in Atlanta that generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. And now the baton is in our hands. Each and every one of us,” Harris said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US presidential hopeful Kamala Harris launched a searing attack on Donald Trump Tuesday, telling her biggest campaign rally yet that the momentum was shifting in the White House race and daring the Republican to debate her face to face.</p>

<p>Vice President Harris's trip to Atlanta, Georgia, comes as reenergized Democrats regard the swing state as being in play again, after it looked beyond hope under President Joe Biden before his shock withdrawal from the 2024 election.</p>

<p>The presumptive Democratic nominee is aiming to expand the party's 2024 battleground map and appeal to young Black voters, delivering a firm, 20-minute speech to about 10,000 supporters in a packed arena and pledging Americans "are not going back" to the "failed policies" of Trump.</p>

<p>"Now, the baton is in our hands," Harris said to loud applause. "We have a fight in front of us... And we are the underdogs in this race."</p>

<p>Harris's nascent presidential bid took off following Biden's July 21 exit from the race, with much of the party coalescing behind her and her campaign raising a staggering $200 million.</p>

<p>"The momentum in this race is shifting, and there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it," she said.</p>

<p>The Republican nominee recently said he would forego political tradition and not debate Harris and also unleashed a barrage of insults against his rival, calling her "crazy" and a "bum."</p>

<p>"Well Donald, I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage, because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face," Harris said, to roars of approval.</p>

<p>Harris also repeated her popular line about how, as a former prosecutor and California attorney general going up against predators and fraudsters, she knows "Donald Trump's type."</p>

<p>"In this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week," she said.</p>

<h3><strong>'Extreme abortion bans'</strong></h3>

<p>With just 98 days before the election, Harris is under pressure to announce her vice presidential pick. Asked Tuesday whether she had chosen one, Harris told reporters: "Not yet."</p>

<p>The search must be nearing a conclusion, however, as her team announced Tuesday that Harris and her new running mate would campaign next week in battlegrounds Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada.</p>

<p>With the White House race turned on its head, 59-year-old Harris on Tuesday unveiled her first television ad since replacing Biden, while the Trump camp released a dueling spot attacking her on the crucial election issue of immigration.</p>

<p>Harris swatted away the attack, saying in her speech that while the Biden administration worked with conservatives to craft critical border legislation, Trump "tanked" it for political gain.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump does not care about border security," she said. "He only cares about himself."</p>

<p>Harris said if elected she would focus on key economic goals such as expanding affordable health care and tackling rising consumer costs.</p>

<p>She also attacked Trump, 78, over his "extreme abortion bans," referring to restrictive new laws enacted in several states in the two years since the US Supreme Court -- featuring three justices nominated by Trump -- stripped constitutional protections for abortion.</p>

<h3><strong>Georgia in play</strong></h3>

<p>As for Georgia's potential competitiveness, Harris insisted "the path to the White House runs right through this state."</p>

<p>In a sign the southern state will be bitterly contested, Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance announced they would hold their own rally Saturday in Atlanta.</p>

<p>"Kamala Harris and her complicit cronies have made the great people of Georgia pay a hefty price for their woke policies," the Trump campaign said Tuesday.</p>

<p>Harris took over a bleak electoral map from the faltering Biden, with Democrats' hopes entirely based on the three Rust Belt post-industrial states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>But they are now looking again at other "sunbelt" states such as Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, all of which Democrats narrowly won in 2020.</p>

<p>Vance addressed a rally Tuesday in Henderson, Nevada, where he attacked Harris as "dangerously liberal," while Trump campaigns in Pennsylvania on Wednesday.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A historian who has correctly predicted the result of nine US elections has now weighed in on the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-gaining-ground-on-donald-trump-in-6-of-7-swing-states-report-6227053" target="_blank">Donald Trump vs Kamala Harris fight</a>.</p>

<p>Allan Lichtman, often dubbed the "Nostradamus of US presidential elections", makes his predictions based on his "13 keys to the White House".</p>

<p>The method consists of 13 true or false questions, and if six or more keys go against the incumbent party, the 77-year-old American University historian predicts their defeat. If fewer than six went against it, it would win.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The keys assess various factors, including economic performance, social stability, and incumbent charisma. Through careful analysis spanning historical data since former US president Abraham Lincoln's era, Lichtman has crafted a predictive model that transcends conventional methods used by traditional psephologists.</p>

<h3><strong>Allan Lichtman's "13 Keys To The White House"</strong></h3>

<p>From Ronald Reagan's re-election triumph amid economic recession to Bill Clinton's victory against George HW Bush, Allan Lichtman has correctly predicted crucial poll contests in the US.</p>

<p>The 13 keys to the White House as designed by him are as follows:&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Party Mandate: </strong>Post-midterm elections, the incumbent party secures more US House of Representatives seats than in the previous midterms.</p>

<p><strong>Nomination Contest:</strong> There's no significant challenge to the incumbent party's nomination.</p>

<p><strong>Incumbency:</strong> The sitting president represents the incumbent party.</p>

<p><strong>Third-party Factor:</strong> There's no noteworthy third-party or independent campaign.</p>

<p><strong>Short-term Economic Stability:</strong> The economy doesn't face recession during the election period.</p>

<p><strong>Long-term Economic Growth:</strong> Real per capita economic growth equals or surpasses the average growth of the preceding two terms.</p>

<p><strong>Policy Shift:</strong> The incumbent administration enacts major alterations in national policy.</p>

<p><strong>Social Stability:</strong> There's no prolonged social unrest throughout the term.</p>

<p><strong>Scandal-Free:</strong> The incumbent administration remains free from major scandals.</p>

<p><strong>Foreign/Military Mishaps:</strong> No significant failures occur in foreign or military affairs under the incumbent administration.</p>

<p><strong>Foreign/Military Triumphs:</strong> The incumbent administration achieves significant successes in foreign or military matters.</p>

<p><strong>Incumbent Charm:</strong> The incumbent party's candidate possesses charisma or enjoys national hero status.</p>

<p><strong>Challenger Appeal: </strong>The opposing party's candidate lacks charisma or national hero status.</p>

<h3><strong>Donald Trump Or Kamala Harris, Who Will Win US Polls?</strong></h3>

<p>Allan Lichtman currently favours US Vice-President and Democrat <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/fearless-kamala-harris-launches-50-million-ad-blitz-in-us-presidential-race-6224268" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a> over her Republican rival <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/trump-says-vances-childless-cat-ladies-comments-reflect-love-of-family-6219296" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a>. He told News Nation that he believes "a lot would have to go wrong for Harris to lose."</p>

<p>Democrats, with Harris being the likely nominee after <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-calls-joe-bidens-shock-us-poll-exit-a-coup-by-democrats-6206072" target="_blank">Joe Biden</a> quit the reelection race, currently hold six of the 13 keys, according to his prediction. These include a primary contest, short-term economy, long-term economy, policy change, no scandal, and no challenger charisma.</p>

<p>"Right now, Democrats have lost three keys" by switching to Harris, he told News Nation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He said Democrats lost the "party mandate" key due to big losses in the 2022 mid-term elections. He also said Harris has lost the "charisma" and "incumbency" keys.</p>

<p>Under his prediction model, Democrats, however, would have to lose three more keys in order for him to predict a Harris loss. But he says that's not likely to happen.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The son of the former Sinaloa drug cartel leader Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman pleaded not guilty Tuesday to a raft of charges linked to one of the world's biggest illicit narcotics operations, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>Joaquin Guzman Lopez was arrested in a scheme allegedly orchestrated by Washington without the involvement of Mexico, in which he was detained in Texas last Thursday.</p>

<p>The judge in the case denied bail and remanded him in custody, ordering a case management hearing for September 30, the assistant US Attorney's office said in a statement to AFP.</p>

<p>Many of the details of the arrest operation, in which co-founder of the cartel Ismael Zambada Garcia, known as "El Mayo," was also taken into US custody, remain murky.</p>

<p>US media have quoted law enforcement sources as saying that Zambada was unwittingly lured across the Mexico border by Guzman Lopez, one of "El Chapo's" four sons.</p>

<p>According to a US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) report released in May, the sons were engaged in an "internal battle" against Zambada, their father's former partner.</p>

<p>Guzman Lopez was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of drug trafficking, money laundering and weapons charges, according to court documents previously released by prosecutors.</p>

<p>Broadcaster CNN reported that Guzman Lopez's lawyer, Jeffrey Lichtman, told reporters his client faces the death penalty in the case. Lichtman did not return an AFP request for comment.</p>

<p>There was "no agreement between Joaquin Guzman and the government. Period," Lichtman told reporters in Chicago.</p>

<p>Zambada's lawyer, Frank Perez, has maintained since Sunday that his client was "kidnapped" and taken to the United States against his will.</p>

<p>Zambada pleaded not guilty on Friday to drug trafficking and money laundering charges before a federal judge in Texas, and has another court appearance scheduled for Thursday in El Paso.</p>

<p>Guzman Lopez, aged in his 30s, is among the sons of "El Chapo" known collectively as "Los Chapitos," or "The Little Chapos."</p>

<p>"El Chapo" was convicted of drug charges in New York in 2019 and is serving a life sentence in a maximum security prison.</p>

<p>DEA chief Anne Milgram said Zambada's arrest "strikes at the heart of the cartel that is responsible for the majority of drugs, including fentanyl and methamphetamine, killing Americans from coast to coast."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic election nominee, said Tuesday that Israel had a "right to defend itself" following a strike in Hezbollah's stronghold in southern Beirut.</p>

<p>Harris -- who last week struck a tough tone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over Israel's war on Gaza -- also called for a diplomatic solution to reduce the risk of all-out conflict on the Lebanon-Israel border.</p>

<p>"I want to address what's happened over the last few hours in terms of the Middle East, and be very clear Israel has a right to defend itself," Harris told reporters as she headed to an election rally in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>

<p>Israel said the attack on Tuesday had targeted a Hezbollah commander responsible for rocket fire that killed 12 children in the occupied Golan Heights at the weekend.</p>

<p>"What we know in particular is it (Israel) has the right to defend itself against a terrorist organization, which is exactly what Hezbollah is," added Harris.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"But all of that being said, we still must work on a diplomatic solution to end these attacks, and we will continue to do that work."</p>

<p>Harris is effectively locked in as the Democratic presidential nominee for November's US election after President Joe Biden's shock decision to drop out of the White House race just over a week ago.</p>

<p>With speculation swirling about whether she would moderate Biden's stalwart support for Israel's Gaza war, Harris said last week after meeting Netanyahu in Washington that she "will not be silent" about Palestinian casualties there.</p>

<p>Harris said on Thursday she expressed "serious concern about the scale of human suffering" to Netanyahu, who held separate meetings with her and Biden.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, said that his party is ready to hold talks with the military, a remark that drew a lot of flak from the Shehbaz Sharif-led government, Geo News reported.</p>

<p>The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder, who appeared in a court established in Adiala jail for a hearing, said: "We are ready to hold talks with the military. The army should nominate their representative [for negotiations]."</p>

<p>Khan, who has been imprisoned for nearly a year, said that his party had never levelled allegations against the army, but had only criticised the armed forces.</p>

<p>He further said that if any PTI worker was found guilty in the May 9, 2023, riots then the authorities should penalise the individual.</p>

<p>The deposed premier further reiterated that the incumbent government wanted to destroy his party by creating a wedge between PTI and the armed forces.</p>

<p>Referring to the repeated arrests of PTI leadership across the province, the incarcerated PTI founder termed Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz "fascist."</p>

<p>Speaking about his arrest last year, Khan alleged that he was "abducted from the judicial complex" and "it was declared legal by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Aamer Farooq."</p>

<p>The outreach by Imran drew sharp rebukes from the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leaders, who slammed the jailed former premier for "dragging" the army into political matters, as reported by Geo News.</p>

<p>Addressing a press conference in Islamabad today, Federal Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that the incarcerated ex-premier sought a dialogue with the army after the institution decided to remain apolitical, recalling that the same Khan had equated "neutral with animal" when the army announced staying away from political matters.</p>

<p>Calling the 71-year-old cricketer-turned-politician a "security risk" for the country's economy, Tarar said Khan has previously said "I will not spare," and now he has come down to making beseeching.</p>

<p>"You are a security risk for the country, as your people say that there is no Pakistan without the PTI founder," he said. He termed the PTI a "terrorist outfit," saying this terror organisation was not suitable for Pakistan, Geo News reported.</p>

<p>PML-N leader and Punjab minister Marriyum Aurangzeb also rebuked Imran Khan's call for talks, saying that the "self-proclaimed revolutionary figure" has descended from his previous stances of "I will not seek pardon" to seeking an apology.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A large crowd of anti-Muslim protesters clashed with police on Tuesday in a northern English town where three girls were stabbed to death and five other children critically wounded during an attack on a Taylor Swift-themed event on Monday.</p>

<p>The horrific stabbing incident in Southport, a quiet seaside town north of Liverpool, has shocked the nation. Police have said it was not linked to terrorism and that the suspect was born in the UK.</p>

<p>Yet far-right groups have stoked speculation that the teenage suspect was involved with Islam, and police said Tuesday's violence erupted when several hundred people began to throw items at a mosque. Police linked the crowd to the English Defence League, a group which has sometimes staged violent demonstrations against Islam.</p>

<p>Police vehicles were damaged and set alight, officers were pelted by bricks and large garbage containers. One video posted online showed the crowd chanting "we want our country back".</p>

<p>Away from the violence, hundreds had gathered for an emotional vigil to pay tribute to those killed in the attack, laying flowers and toys.</p>

<p>"The people of Southport are reeling after the horror inflicted on them yesterday. They deserve our support and our respect," Prime Minister Keir Starmer said.</p>

<p>"Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves. They will feel the full force of the law."</p>

<p>A 17-year-old male is currently in police custody on suspicion of murder and attempted murder after the bloody rampage at a "Taylor Swift yoga and dance workshop", a summer vacation event for children aged 6 to 11.</p>

<p>Witnesses described the attack as being like a scene from a horror film. In addition to the three deaths, eight children suffered stab wounds. Five of them and two adults who had tried to protect them remain in a critical condition.</p>

<p>The police have said the motive remained unclear and have not given any details about the suspect, beyond saying he was born in Wales and lived in a village nearby.</p>

<p>"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets," said Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss.</p>

<p>"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time."</p>

<p>Goss and local politicians said those clashing with police involved many from outside the area, and the Liverpool Region Mosque Network said a minority of people were trying to use the incident to spread hatred.</p>

<p>"This evening we have seen distressing scenes outside Southport Mosque with angry protesters gathering outside," it said in a statement. "This is causing further fear and anxiety within our communities,"</p>

<p>Starmer had earlier paid a sombre visit to the town to lay flowers, and King Charles and his family have expressed their horror. U.S. singer Swift herself wrote on Instagram that she was "just completely in shock".</p>

<p><strong>JUST LITTLE KIDS</strong></p>

<p>"These were just little kids at a dance class. I am at a complete loss for how to ever convey my sympathies to these families," she said.</p>

<p>Her fans have raised more than 250,000 pounds ($320,850) online to help families of the victims and for the hospital where some of the children were being treated.</p>

<p>The three girls who died in the attack were named as Bebe King, aged 6, 7-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, aged 9, whose parents are Portuguese.</p>

<p>"Keep smiling and dancing like you love to do our Princess, like we said before to you, you're always our princess and no one would change that. Love from Your Hero Daddy and Mummy," Aguiar's family said in a statement.</p>

<p>There has been increasing concern at rising levels of stabbings and knife crime in Britain, and the Southport attack follows other recent similar, indiscriminate rampages.</p>

<p>"I'm absolutely determined that my government will get to grips with it," Starmer said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States on Tuesday carried out a strike in Iraq in self defence, a U.S. official told Reuters, as regional tensions rose after an Israeli airstrike in Beirut that Israel said killed Hezbollah's most senior commander.</p>

<p>It was not immediately clear if the U.S. strike was the same as the blasts reported earlier at a base south of Baghdad for Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces, the official state security agency that includes several Iran-aligned armed groups.</p>

<p>Those blasts killed four people and injured three, according to police and medical sources.</p>

<p>In a statement after the blasts, the Popular Mobilization Forces made no accusation about who was responsible.</p>

<p>A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the strike was carried out because of a threat to coalition forces based in Iraq. The official did not comment on any casualties.</p>

<p>Multiple rockets were launched toward Iraq's Ain al-Asad airbase housing U.S.-led forces last week, U.S. and Iraqi sources said, with no damage or casualties reported. U.S. officials said none of the rockets hit the base.</p>

<p>It was the first known U.S. strike in Iraq since February, when the U.S. military launched airstrikes in Iraq and Syria against more than 85 targets linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guard and the militias it backs.</p>

<p>Iraq, a rare ally of both Tehran and Washington which hosts 2,500 U.S. troops and has Iran-backed militias linked to its security forces, has witnessed escalating tit-for-tat attacks since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military said its fighter jets "eliminated" Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in the area of Beirut on Tuesday, accusing him of being responsible for a rocket strike on the annexed Golan Heights.</p>

<p>"Israeli air force fighter jets eliminated the Hezbollah terrorist organisation's most senior military commander and the head of its strategic unit, Fuad Shukr, in the area of Beirut," the military said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Fuad Shukr was the commander responsible for the Majdal Shams massacre, in which 12 children were murdered after Hezbollah fired an Iranian Falaq-1 rocket directly at a soccer field in northern Israel on Saturday evening," military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a separate video statement.</p>

<p>"Fuad Shukr was the right-hand man to Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's leader and his advisor in planning and directing attacks and operations."</p>

<p>Hagari said Shukr was a "senior terrorist who has the blood of Israelis and many others on his hands".</p>

<p>Since the start of the Gaza war, Shukr directed Hezbollah's attacks on Israel, the military said.</p>

<p>He was responsible for the majority of Hezbollah's most advanced weaponry, including precise-guided missiles, cruise missiles, anti-ship missiles, long-range rockets and UAVs, it added.</p>

<p>The military said that in the 1990s the Hezbollah commander was "directly involved" in the abduction of the bodies of three Israeli soldiers -- Benyamin Avraham, Adi Avitan and Omar Sawaid.</p>

<p>The three were killed by Hezbollah while patrolling the security fence adjacent to Har Dov, the military said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Since then, he has planned and directed numerous terror attacks against innocent civilians," it said.</p>

<p>While Israel wanted to end hostilities without any wider war with Hezbollah, its forces were ready for "any scenario," Hagari said.</p>

<p>"Hezbollah's ongoing aggression and brutal attacks are dragging the people of Lebanon and the entire Middle East into a wider escalation," he said.</p>

<p>"While we prefer to resolve hostilities without a wider war, the IDF (Israeli army) is fully prepared for any scenario."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris has gained ground against Republican Donald Trump in six of the seven swing states since President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race, according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll of registered voters published on Tuesday.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vice President Kamala Harris will announce her vice presidential pick as early as Monday before embarking on a multi-state battleground tour with her new running mate later in the week, two sources familiar with the planning said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The high-stakes decision on who will run with Harris has taken center stage since she became the Democratic frontrunner for the Nov. 5 election after U.S. President Joe Biden ended his White House bid just over a week ago.</p>

<p>Harris will announce her vice presidential pick before next week's tour of states that could swing to Republicans or Democrats in November, one of the sources said.</p>

<p>Harris' campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>The short list of candidates under consideration include Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, U.S. Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg.</p>

<p>On Monday, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer both indicated they were out of the VP sweepstakes.</p>

<p>A handful of U.S. states, often called battlegrounds, have decided the presidential election in recent years, including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>"There has been no date confirmed for VP Harris to announce her running mate," a campaign spokesperson told Reuters.</p>

<p>Typically, campaigns begin thinking about their vice-presidential pick after the primary race ends in the spring, giving them months to vet candidates and make a decision on who the candidate meshes with best personally and politically.</p>

<p>Harris is being forced to select her running mate on a highly compressed timeline. She faces an Aug. 7 deadline set by the Democratic National Committee, but the decision is likely to come sooner, according to the sources.</p>

<p>Eric Holder Jr., the former attorney general who led the vice-presidential vetting process for Barack Obama in 2008, is vetting Harris' picks through his law firm, Covington &amp; Burling.</p>

<p>The candidates are informally auditioning for the job, hitting the airwaves and campaign stops to showcase what they would bring to the Harris ticket.</p>

<p>Shapiro, for example, delivered a rousing testimonial about Harris in the Philadelphia suburbs on Monday.</p>

<p>"She's not only ready, she's damned ready," he said to a cheering crowd. "And you know who else knows she's ready? Donald Trump knows she's ready."</p>

<p>Walz, the governor of Minnesota, is credited with pushing the Democrats' new criticism of Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance - that they are "weird."</p>

<p>"The fascists depend on us going back, but we're not afraid of weird people," Walz said on Saturday of the Republican ticket. "We're a little bit creeped out, but we're not afraid."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Fuad Shukr, a Hezbollah commander whom Israel believes it killed in an airstrike in Beirut on Tuesday, has been one of the group's leading military figures since it was established by Iran's Revolutionary Guards more than four decades ago.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fuad Shukr, a Hezbollah commander whom Israel believes it killed in an airstrike in Beirut on Tuesday, has been one of the group's leading military figures since it was established by Iran's Revolutionary Guards more than four decades ago.</p>

<p>Part of the generation of Lebanese Shi'ites who founded Hezbollah during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, Shukr was a friend of the group's late military commander Imad Mughniyeh, who was assassinated in Damascus in 2008, Hezbollah sources said.</p>

<p>The United States says Shukr, believed to be in his 60s, played a central role in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, which killed 241 U.S. military personnel, and had put a bounty of up to $5 million on his head, according to the U.S. government's Rewards for Justice website.</p>

<p>He was hit in what the Israeli army has said was a targeted strike against the Hezbollah commander responsible for an attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights that killed 12 children and teenagers at the weekend. Hezbollah denied any role.</p>

<p>An Israel broadcast report said the commander was killed.</p>

<p>Two security sources in Lebanon earlier named the target as Shukr, describing him as head of Hezbollah's operations centre. They said he was critically injured in the attack around Hezbollah's Shura Council in the Haret Hreik neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Also known as Al-Hajj Mohsin, Hezbollah sources said Shukr is a special adviser to Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and a member of the Shura Council, a decision-making body.</p>

<p>The sources said he became more prominent in Hezbollah after the assassination of Mughniyeh - a shadowy figure remembered in Hezbollah as a military mastermind who was on the U.S. list of most wanted terrorists, accused of plotting attacks on Western interests including the Marines barracks.</p>

<p>Referring to those attacks and hostage-taking in Lebanon in the 1980s, Hezbollah leader Nasrallah said in a 2022 interview with an Arabic broadcaster they were carried out by small groups not linked to Hezbollah.</p>

<p>The Hezbollah sources said Shukr fought Israeli troops during Israel's 1982 invasion alongside both Mughniyeh and Mustafa Badreddine, another of Hezbollah's veteran commanders who was killed in Syria in 2016.</p>

<p>Announcing the bounty on his head in 2017, the U.S. Rewards for Justice program said he was a senior Hezbollah military commander of the group's forces in southern Lebanon and a member of Hezbollah's highest military body, the Jihad Council.</p>

<p>It also said he played a key role in its military operations in Syria, where Hezbollah deployed fighters in support of President Bashar al-Assad in the early years of the Syrian civil war.</p>

<p>Hezbollah at the time dismissed the accusations against Shukr and another Hezbollah operative for whom a bounty was offered, Talal Hamiyah, saying they were "rejected and void".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel struck Hezbollah's stronghold in southern Beirut on Tuesday in retaliation for rocket fire from Lebanon that killed 12 children over the weekend, saying it had targeted the commander responsible for the attack.</p>

<p>"The IDF (army) carried out a targeted strike in Beirut on the commander responsible for the murder of the children in Majdal Shams and the killing of numerous additional Israeli civilians," the military said in a statement, referring to the Druze Arab town in the annexed Golan Heights where the children were killed on Saturday.</p>

<p>A source close to the Iran-backed rebel group confirmed that "a leading commander" was the target of the strike, which hit near the group's decision making body, the Shura Council.</p>

<p>The source added that two people were killed in the strike, but was unable to confirm if the commander was among them.</p>

<p>Minutes after the explosions rocked Beirut, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant posted on social media site X that "Hezbollah crossed the red line".</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had on Monday threatened a "severe response" to the attack which Israel and the United States have blamed on Hezbollah, though the group denies responsibility.</p>

<p>Following Saturday's strike, the international community had raced to head off any escalation that might tip the two into a first all-out conflict since 2006.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib said on Monday he had received assurances from international diplomats that there would be only a limited response.</p>

<p>"Israel will escalate in a limited way and Hezbollah will respond in a limited way... These are the assurances we've received," Bou Habib said in an interview with local broadcaster Al-Jadeed.</p>

<p>Analysts told AFP that they also expected Israel to temper its actions, with its leaders wary of having to fight a second war while its troops are still engaged in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<h3><strong>'Constant anxiety'</strong></h3>

<p>At least 531 people have been killed on the Lebanese side of the near daily cross-border exchanges, according to an AFP tally. Most have been fighters, but the toll includes at least 105 civilians.</p>

<p>The violence has so far killed 22 soldiers and 25 civilians on the Israeli side, including in the Golan Heights, according to army figures.</p>

<p>There was further deadly violence earlier on Tuesday, with Israeli medics saying a 30-year-old civilian had been killed in the northern kibbutz of HaGoshrim. The military said it had killed a Hezbollah fighter during overnight strikes.</p>

<p>Druze residents of the Majdal Shams -- the vast majority of whom have rejected Israeli citizenship and identify as Syrians -- had opposed threats of retaliation for the deadly strike.</p>

<p>Scores of residents had come out to protest Netanyahu's visit after the burial of the last of the victims of the rocket strike.</p>

<p>A paramedic from Majdal Shams, Nabih Abu Saleh, told AFP his community was "against any Israeli response", and asked: "Who will we strike? Our people in Syria and Lebanon?"</p>

<p>A French diplomat told AFP earlier that Paris "alongside other partners, notably the United States, is making all-out efforts to call on the parties to exercise restraint and not to be drawn into spiralling violence".</p>

<p>Multiple international airlines suspended flights to Beirut ahead of Israel's retaliation, although the chairman of Lebanon's Middle East Airlines, Mohammed al-Hout, said Beirut airport, its only international facility, "is not exposed to any threat, it is supposed to be a neutral place", state media reported.</p>

<p>The Lebanese public, meanwhile, has been gripped by worry, with mother of two Cosette Beshara describing living "in a state of constant anxiety".</p>

<p>"I'm always thinking about how I will escape with my children if war breaks out," said the 40-year-old, adding that "life goes on in Lebanon... but always with a looming state of anxiety."</p>

<h3><strong>Khan Yunis operation</strong></h3>

<p>Hezbollah has said its attacks on northern Israel are in solidarity with Hamas and the people of Gaza, who have been under siege by Israel since October 7.</p>

<p>The Hamas attack on southern Israel that started the war resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Hamas also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,400 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, which does not provide details on civilian and operative deaths.</p>

<p>Fighting has raged on unabated in the Gaza Strip, with the territory's civil defence agency saying on Tuesday that around 300 people had been killed in the southern city of Khan Yunis during an Israeli operation there that began on July 22.</p>

<p>"Since the beginning of the Israeli ground invasion of the eastern part of Khan Yunis province, the civil defence and medical teams have recovered approximately 300 bodies of martyrs, many of them decomposed," agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP.</p>

<p>The military meanwhile said it had completed its operation in the Khan Yunis area, which had seen heavy fighting earlier this year, and had killed "over 150 terrorists".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's security detail and a sniper team were not aware there was a gunman on a roof until he opened fire on the former president, the acting Secret Service director said Tuesday.</p>

<p>Local law enforcement identified the gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, as a "suspicious person" about 90 minutes before the July 13 attack at a Trump campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, according to FBI officials.</p>

<p>Since the assassination attempt, questions have been raised about when the Secret Service became aware of the presence of the gunman on the roof of a building that overlooked the campaign event.</p>

<p>"Based on what I know right now, neither the Secret Service counter-sniper teams nor members of the former president's security detail had any knowledge that there was a man on the AGR roof with a firearm," acting Secret Service chief Ronald Rowe told a joint Senate committee.</p>

<p>"The only thing we had was that locals were working an issue at the three o'clock, which would have been the former president's right-hand side, which is where the shots came from," Rowe said.</p>

<p>"Nothing about man on the roof, nothing about man with a gun," he said.</p>

<p>FBI special agent Kevin Rojek said Monday that a police officer was boosted on to the roof by another officer at 6:11 pm.</p>

<p>Crooks pointed his rifle at the officer, who "immediately dropped to the ground."</p>

<p>"Approximately 25 to 30 seconds after this encounter, the subject fired eight rounds before being successfully neutralized," Rojek said.</p>

<p>Rowe said Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service sniper "within 15.5 seconds" of firing the first shot.</p>

<p>The Republican presidential candidate was wounded in the right ear, while two rally attendees were injured and a Pennsylvania firefighter was killed.</p>

<h3><strong>'Ashamed'</strong></h3>

<p>Rowe said he "cannot defend" why the rooftop where Crooks fired from was not better secured, and said he was "ashamed" about the security lapses.</p>

<p>He said local law enforcement had been tasked with securing the rooftop. "We assumed that the state and locals had it," he said.</p>

<p>Asked why Trump was allowed to take the stage, Rowe said Crooks had not been identified as a threat but only as suspicious.</p>

<p>"We did not have anything beyond suspicious person that was communicated to us," he said. "Suspicion had not risen to the level of threat or imminent harm."</p>

<p>Rowe said communications failures between local law enforcement and the Secret Service contributed to what he called a "failure on multiple levels."</p>

<p>The Secret Service had "technical difficulties" with its counter-drone capabilities on the day of the attack and they were not "operational until after five o'clock," he said.</p>

<p>Crooks flew a drone near the rally site for 11 minutes about two hours before the attack, according to the FBI.</p>

<p>FBI deputy director Paul Abbate also addressed the committee hearing and said the authorities still have not established a motive.</p>

<p>He said they have identified a social media account believed to be associated with Crooks.</p>

<p>"In about the 2019, 2020 timeframe there were over 700 comments posted from this account," Abbate said. "Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect anti-Semitic and anti-immigration themes, to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature."</p>

<p>Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned last week after acknowledging that the agency had failed in its mission to prevent the assassination attempt.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Senate passed a sweeping social media safety package Tuesday that would force tech companies to do more to protect children -- the first major legislation targeting Silicon Valley in a generation.</p>

<p>Social media giants like Meta and X have been confronting a torrent of political anger for not putting in guardrails to thwart online dangers for children, including from sexual predators and teen suicide.</p>

<p>A rare sign of cross-party unity in an increasingly rancorous election year, the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) were passed in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote with just three dissenters.</p>

<p>But the bills face an uncertain path through the House of Representatives, where Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has spoken broadly in favor of the package but has not scheduled a vote.</p>

<p>"I'm proud to say today, the Senate keeps its promise to every parent who's lost a child because of the risks of social media... KOSA and COPPA will be perhaps the most important updates to federal laws protecting kids on the internet in decades, and it's a very good first step," said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.</p>

<p>The legislation was drawn up in consultation with parents of teens who had been bullied or sexually exploited but has been opposed by some free speech groups worried that it could lead to censorship.</p>

<h3><strong>'Duty of care'</strong></h3>

<p>While there is widespread agreement in a politically divided Congress on curbing the negative impacts of social media, there has never been a united path on how to go about doing so.</p>

<p>House members are on their summer recess and will almost certainly be focusing on averting a looming government shutdown when they return in September.</p>

<p>But Schumer called on the lower chamber to pass the bills immediately on its return, urging lawmakers to "seize the opportunity to send them to the president's desk."</p>

<p>The KOSA bill would establish a "duty of care" obligation on the online platforms that would demand that special provisions are in place to shield minors from toxic content.</p>

<p>Supported by Microsoft, X and Snap, the company that owns Snapchat, the legislation would require companies to give users a dedicated page to report harmful content -- including sexual exploitation, online bullying, the promotion of suicide and eating disorders.</p>

<p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave a public apology to the families of victims at the Senate Judiciary Committee in January as hostile lawmakers grilled tech CEOs over the dangers that children face on social media.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for everything you have all been through," he said. "No one should go through the things that your families have suffered."</p>

<h3><strong>Censorship fears</strong></h3>

<p>Seven LGBTQ advocacy groups withdrew initial opposition based on updates to the bill they said mitigated concerns that teens would be limited in accessing information about gender identity, sexuality and reproductive health.</p>

<p>But free speech groups including the American Civil Liberties Union have argued that the definition of harm is too broad and that it could lead to censorship.</p>

<p>COPPA would beef up privacy standards for Americans aged under 17, and outlaw advertising targeted at children and teens -- requiring companies to allow users to delete personal information.</p>

<p>"Too many kids experience relentless promotion of suicide or substance abuse material. Too many kids have their personal data collected and then used nefariously," Schumer said.</p>

<p>"With studies showing that kids today spend more time on social media than ever before, now is the moment to pass KOSA, pass COPPA, and instill guardrails that protect kids from these risks."</p>

<p>But Oregan Democrat Ron Wyden posted on X that the tweaks to KOSA "remain insufficient" and voiced fears that a hard-right future Republican administration could "still use this bill to pressure companies to censor gay, trans and reproductive health information."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza has declared the Palestinian territory a "polio epidemic area," accusing Israel's military campaign of destroying health infrastructure, which it says led to the recurrence of the virus.</p>

<p>The CPV2 strain of the virus has been detected in sewage samples collected from the southern Khan Yunis area and central governorates, the ministry said.</p>

<p>It did not say if any human cases had been detected, but said the presence of the virus "constitutes a health threat to the residents of the Gaza Strip and neighbouring countries and a setback to the global polio eradication program".</p>

<p>The wild version of the virus is now endemic only in Afghanistan and Pakistan, but a type of vaccine that contains small amounts of weakened but live polio still causes occasional outbreaks elsewhere.</p>

<p>United Nations agencies said recently that such vaccine-derived type-2 poliovirus had been detected in samples collected from sewage.</p>

<p>"The brutal Israeli aggression that deprived the people of usable water, the destruction of the sanitation infrastructure, the accumulation of tonnes of garbage and a lack of food security" had led to the recurrence of the virus, the ministry said.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the World Health Organisation said it was "looking at a very problematic situation".</p>

<p>"Having vaccine-derived poliovirus in the sewage very likely means that it's out there somewhere in people," WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told journalists.</p>

<p>"But again, about 75 percent of people infected by polio don't even show any symptoms.</p>

<p>"That means it most likely is in the population but it doesn't necessarily mean that we see an outbreak of cases."</p>

<p>He said a campaign to distribute vaccines across the Gaza Strip was needed.</p>

<p>"It's not enough just to get it (the vaccine) into Ben Gurion airport and then hopefully get it into Gaza. It needs to reach people," Lindmeier said.</p>

<p>Israel's bombardments and ground assault has devastated swathes of Gaza, displacing the vast majority of its 2.4 million population.</p>

<p>The war in Gaza began after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, which resulted in the death of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Hamas also seized 251 people, 111 still held captive in Gaza, including 39 who the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's campaign has killed 39,400 people so far in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, which does not provide details of civilian and operative deaths.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

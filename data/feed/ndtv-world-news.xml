       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu has denied having an "India Out" agenda, asserting that the island nation had a "serious problem" with the presence of foreign military on its soil.</p>

<p>Mohamed Muizzu, who is in the US to attend the 79th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, made the remarks on Thursday while responding to a question at Princeton University's "Dean's Leadership Series".</p>

<p>"We have never been against any one country at any point. It's not India Out. Maldives faced a serious problem with foreign military presence on this soil," Maldivian news portal adhadhu.com quoted him as saying.</p>

<p>"The people of Maldives do not want a single foreign soldier in the country," Mohamed Muizzu said.</p>

<p>The ties between India and the Maldives came under severe strain since November last year when Mohamed Muizzu, known for his pro-China leanings, took charge as Maldivian president.</p>

<p>Mohamed Muizzu had asked India to withdraw nearly 90 Indian military personnel operating three aviation platforms gifted by the country. India withdrew its military personnel by May 10 and replaced them with civilian personnel to operate a Dornier aircraft and two helicopters.</p>

<p>Mohamed Muizzu further stressed he had taken action against deputy ministers for insulting Prime Minister Narendra Modi on social media.</p>

<p>"No one should say such a thing. I took action against it. I will not accept insulting anyone like that, whether he is a leader or an ordinary person. Every human being has a reputation," the report quoted him as saying.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, deputy ministers in Maldives' youth ministry were suspended for derogatory social media posts against Prime Minister Modi following a backlash, with New Delhi strongly raising the matter with Male. The deputy ministers criticised Modi for his post on 'X' following his visit to Lakshadweep, inferring that it was an attempt to project the Union Territory as an alternative tourist destination to the Maldives.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi was in Lakshadweep on January 2 and 3 to inaugurate several projects.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York Mayor Eric Adams pleaded not guilty Friday to charges of fraud and bribery in a case that marks a stunning downfall for a man once touted as a future Democratic Party star.</p>

<p>Adams, who appeared before a judge in a Manhattan federal court, is the first sitting New York mayor to be criminally indicted.</p>

<p>He is accused of wire fraud, soliciting illegal campaign donations and a bribery conspiracy involving Turkish citizens and at least one Turkish official. Judge Katherine Parker set the next hearing for Wednesday.</p>

<p>The allegations prompted calls for his resignation, but Adams has remained defiant, saying on Thursday that he is looking "forward to defending myself" and urging New Yorkers to "wait to hear our side of the story."</p>

<p>Accompanied by aides, the 64-year-old mayor made no comments to waiting reporters Friday but gave a thumbs-up as he entered the courthouse. He wore a dark blue suit and a purple tie.</p>

<p>"I am not guilty, your honor," he said in court.</p>

<p>Presenting the charges on Thursday, US District Attorney Damian Williams said the mayor was "secretly being showered" with gifts for years.</p>

<p>"The conduct alleged in the indictment -- the foreign money, the corporate money, the years of concealment -- is a grave breach of the public's trust," Williams told journalists.</p>

<h3><strong>Luxury travel</strong></h3>

<p>The 57-page document accuses the mayor of America's biggest city of crimes going back a decade, when Adams, a Democrat, took office as Brooklyn's borough president.</p>

<p>According to the charges, he accepted luxury international flights, hotel suites and free high-end restaurant meals including from Turkish associates in return for favors.</p>

<p>In one example, prosecutors say Adams pressured the city's fire department to approve Turkey's new high-rise consulate in Manhattan despite safety concerns.</p>

<p>"The Turkish official got what he wanted, and as we explained in the indictment, just four days after Adams held up his end of the bargain, he went right back to soliciting more travel benefits," Williams said.</p>

<p>Scandal has swirled around Adams for months with several high-ranking allies resigning as others were indicted or raided by federal agents.</p>

<p>The drama escalated with a pre-dawn raid of his official residence early Thursday.</p>

<p>Some city and state officials have demanded he resign, including influential New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who said Adams must step down "for the good of the city."</p>

<p>The indictment risks embarrassing Democrats weeks before the presidential election between Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, who are polling neck and neck.</p>

<p>Adams, the second Black mayor in the city's history, won the 2021 Democratic primary vowing to reduce crime, which did fall after rising during the Covid pandemic.</p>

<p>But the city of 8.5 million people faces a housing crisis that has seen rents skyrocket. Adams is up for reelection next year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris will tackle the politically explosive issue of illegal immigration with a visit to the US-Mexican border Friday, in a bid to blunt one of Donald Trump's main attack lines in their fight for the White House.</p>

<p>The US vice president's trip to Arizona, her first to the border since replacing President Joe Biden as Democratic nominee in July, comes as polls show the subject remains one of her biggest vulnerabilities against the Republican.</p>

<p>Harris will call for tougher border security in a major speech in the border town of Douglas, and accuse Trump of killing off attempts to pass a bipartisan migration bill to boost his own election chances, her campaign said.</p>

<p>"The American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games," she plans to say, according to her campaign.</p>

<p>Arizona is also one of the half-dozen battleground states that are expected to decide the agonizingly close November 5 election, and the one where polls show Harris may have to do the most work.</p>

<p>Republican former president Trump has turbocharged the border issue in recent weeks as he seeks an edge against Harris, America's first female, Black and South Asian vice president.</p>

<p>He has called for mass deportations, amplified bogus claims about migrants eating pet cats and dogs, and stepped up his racist rhetoric about an "invasion" of illegal immigrants.</p>

<h3><strong>'Save her airfare'</strong></h3>

<p>On the eve of Harris's visit, which is just her second to the Mexican border as vice president, Trump accused his rival of having "completely destroyed" the frontier.</p>

<p>"She should save her airfare. She should go back to the White House and tell the president to close the border," he said in New York on Thursday.</p>

<p>Trump is set to hold a campaign event in Michigan, another key swing state, after a tense meeting in New York with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on US support for Kyiv.</p>

<p>Recent polls have seen Harris eating into Trump's lead on migration with voters, yet it still remains a weak spot for Harris, with record numbers of illegal border crossings under her and Biden's watch.</p>

<p>But Harris points to the fact that numbers have plummeted since Biden signed an executive order in June temporarily closing the border to asylum seekers -- to around 58,000 in August from a peak of 250,000 last December.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old will meet border agents during her visit, call for action to stop the flow of the deadly opioid fentanyl across the border, and talk up her former career as a prosecutor involved in tackling gangs smuggling drugs across the border, the campaign said.</p>

<p>Harris will also accuse Trump of lobbying Republicans in the US Congress to tank last year's bill on migration, which would have given more funding to border security, because he feared it would hurt him politically.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump doubles down</strong></h3>

<p>Republicans for their part have accused her of flip-flopping on whether to continue with the wall along the 1,900-mile (3,050-kilometer) border that Trump made one of his signature policies.</p>

<p>They have also focused on her role early in the Biden administration when the president tasked her with looking into the causes of illegal migration from Central America -- falsely calling her a "border czar" and implying that she had overall control over US border policy.</p>

<p>Harris has struggled with the subject in the past, including in a widely mocked interview in 2021 when she defensively claimed that "we've been to the border" when she personally had not, and added: "And I haven't been to Europe."</p>

<p>Trump has meanwhile doubled down on his divisive rhetoric targeting migrants, with the 78-year-old billionaire seeing it as appealing to his base of largely white, blue-collar voters.</p>

<p>In his remarks on Thursday, Trump also repeated his claim that migrants were "infecting our country," using language that Biden has previously compared to that used by Nazi Germany.</p>

<p>Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance have in recent weeks played up false stories about Haitian migrants eating pets in the town of Springfield, Ohio.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A prominent Canadian MP of Indian origin has criticised a petition seeking a fresh inquiry into the bombing of Air India Flight 182 of 1985 to determine the involvement of any "foreign intelligence", alleging that it promotes "conspiracy theories".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A prominent Canadian MP of Indian origin has criticised a petition seeking a fresh inquiry into the bombing of Air India Flight 182 of 1985 to determine the involvement of any "foreign intelligence", alleging that it promotes "conspiracy theories" of Khalistani extremists.</p>

<p>The Montreal-New Delhi Air India ‘Kanishka' Flight 182 exploded 45 minutes before it was supposed to land at London's Heathrow Airport on June 23, 1985, killing all 329 people on board, most of them Canadians of Indian descent.</p>

<p>The bombing was blamed on Sikh extremists in retaliation to ‘Operation Bluestar' to flush out militants from the Golden Temple in 1984.</p>

<p>Addressing the Parliament on Thursday, Chandra Arya, a Member of Parliament from Nepean in the House of Commons, noted that two Canadian public inquiries found Khalistani extremists responsible for the bombing of Air India flight.</p>

<p>Calling the bombing the "largest mass killing" in Canadian history, Mr Arya said, "Even today, the ideology responsible for this terrorist attack is still alive among (a) few people in Canada."</p>

<p>"Two Canadian public inquiries found Khalistan extremists responsible for the bombing of the Air India flight. Now there is a petition on (the) parliament portal asking for a new enquiry promoting conspiracy theories promoted by Khalistan extremists," he said.</p>

<p>Quoting Bal Gupta, whose wife was killed in this attack, Mr Arya said," It's deeply frustrating. It opens up old wounds all over again. It's all garbage. It's an attempt to gain publicity and support for terrorist activities.”</p>

<p>The petition calls for the Canadian government to order a fresh inquiry into the Kanishka bombing to determine whether any "foreign intelligence was involved" in it.</p>

<p>Last year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged a "potential" involvement of Indian agents in Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing.</p>

<p>New Delhi rejected Mr Trudeau's charges as "absurd".</p>

<p>India has been maintaining that the main issue between the two countries is that of Canada giving space to pro-Khalistan elements operating from Canadian soil with impunity.</p>

<p>Nijjar, who was declared a terrorist by India, was shot dead outside a gurdwara in British Columbia on June 18 last year. The murder is being probed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leading Israeli television networks reported that Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah was the target of a massive Israeli air strike in a Beirut suburb on Friday.</p>

<p>"Target of the strike: Nasrallah. The IDF (Israeli military) is checking whether the secretary-general of Hezbollah was in the building in the heart of Dahiyeh (that was hit)," Channel 12 reported.</p>

<p>Public broadcaster Kan 11 said: "Target of the strike in Dahiyeh - Nasrallah."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Contacted by AFP, the Israeli military said: "We are not commenting on this."</p>

<p>The left-leaning Haaretz newspaper also reported that Nasrallah was the target.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has claimed he was asked by Buckingham Palace to persuade Prince Harry not to quit royal life or leave the UK shortly before the Sussexes moved to North America. In Mr Johnson's new book, <em>'Unleashed'</em>, which will be released on 10 October, the 60-year-old claimed that he delivered a "manly pep talk" to the Duke of Sussex in a bid to convince him it would be a mistake to leave Britain. He said that officials in Downing Street and Buckingham Palace approached him in January 2020, believing that he might be able to dissuade Prince Harry of his decision.</p>

<p>It was "a ridiculous business ... when they made me try to persuade Harry to stay. Kind of manly pep talk. Totally hopeless," Mr Johnson wrote in the book, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e95gyj1wvo" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>BBC</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, the meeting between Mr Johnson and Prince Harry took place on the margins of a UK-Africa investment summit in London Docklands. It came just hours after Prince Harry announced with "great sadness" that he and Meghan Markle felt they had "no other option" but to step away from royal life. During the subsequent meeting, the two men met for 20 minutes without aides as Mr Johnson tried to persuade the prince to reconsider.</p>

<p>However, the following day, the duke flew to Canada to be reunited with Meghan Markle and their young son, Archie. The family later moved to Montecito, California, where they remain today, having given up their lives as working royals.</p>

<p>According to the <em>BBC</em>, Mr Johnson, in his effort to keep the prince from departing, had hailed him as a valuable asset to the UK and praised his work, such as the Invictus Games for military veterans.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the former UK PM has previously said that the memoir will be his "personal account of the huge realignment that took place in UK politics in the last 15 years", taking in his leadership of the Brexit campaign that severed Britain's ties with the EU, as well as his management of the Covid pandemic and the subsequent scandals that rocked his government until his downfall as PM in September 2022.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed at the UN Friday to press his country's offensive against Lebanon's Hezbollah, dashing hopes for a 21-day truce proposed by France and the United States this week.</p>

<p>Netanyahu's highly anticipated turn at the UN, during which he repeatedly denounced the global organization as anti-Israel, was met with jeers by some delegates who walked out, but cheers and applause from his backers.</p>

<p>"As long as Hezbollah chooses the path of war, Israel has no choice, and Israel has every right to remove this threat and return our citizens to their homes safe," Netanyahu told the UN General Assembly.</p>

<p>"We will continue degrading Hezbollah until all our objectives are met."</p>

<p>His remarks appeared to undermine a truce proposal unveiled by the United States and France after President Joe Biden and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, met on the sidelines of the UN gathering.</p>

<p>The White House has said that the call for a ceasefire had been "coordinated" with Israel, but Netanyahu's office on Thursday said that the prime minister has not responded to the proposal.</p>

<p>Netanyahu also threatened Iran in his UN address, saying: "I have a message for the tyrants of Tehran. If you strike us, we will strike you."</p>

<p>"There is no place in Iran that the long arm of Israel cannot reach, and that's true of the entire Middle East," he added.</p>

<p>Delegates, including from Lebanon, Iran and the Palestinians, exited the room as Netanyahu took the rostrum for his speech.</p>

<p>"After I heard the lies and slanders leveled at my country by many of the speakers at this podium, I decided to come here and set the record straight," Netanyahu said at the start of his speech.</p>

<p>Ahead of his appearance, protesters gathered outside Netanyahu's hotel in New York to demand an end to the violence in Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

<h3><strong>'Deadliest period'</strong></h3>

<p>Hezbollah and Israel have been locked in a deadly exchange of cross-border fire since the Iran-backed group's Palestinian ally, Hamas, attacked Israel on October 7.</p>

<p>Netanyahu vowed Friday that "Hamas has got to go" and would have no role in the reconstruction of Gaza as he vowed to fight until "total victory."</p>

<p>Since Monday, Israel has shifted its focus from Gaza to its northern front with Lebanon where heavy bombing has killed 700 people and sparked an exodus of around 118,000 people.</p>

<p>The UN said Friday that a "catastrophic" intensification of Israeli attacks targeting Hezbollah militants had left Lebanon facing its "deadliest period... in a generation."</p>

<p>The Israeli strikes have brought the overall death count in Lebanon to more than 1,500 people killed in nearly a year of clashes, according to Lebanese authorities.</p>

<p>That count surpasses the 1,200 mostly civilians killed during the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, which also killed around 160 Israelis, most of them soldiers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Friday he would work with both Ukraine and Russia to end their war, as he stood next to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy before their meeting in New York.</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters at Trump Tower, Zelenskiy said he wanted to discuss his "victory plan" for Ukraine with Trump during their first meeting since 2019. He said he was meeting both Trump and his Democratic rival in the Nov. 5 election, Vice President Kamala Harris, because Ukraine needed strong US support in its continuing war with Russia.</p>

<p>Trump praised Zelenskiy, but said he also had a solid relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>"We have a very good relationship (with Zelenskiy), and I also have a very good relationship, as you know, with President Putin," Trump said. "And I think if we win, I think we're going to get it resolved very quickly," he added.</p>

<p>Zelenskiy and Trump stood alongside one another, with the Ukrainian president occasionally looking up at Trump during the latter's remarks to journalists.</p>

<p>Zelenskiy has used his US visit to promote his "victory plan," which a U.S. official described as a repackaged request for more weapons and a lifting of restrictions on the use of long-range missiles. The plan presupposes the ultimate defeat of Russia in the war, the official said. Some officials see the aim as unrealistic.</p>

<p>When asked on Thursday by a reporter if Ukraine should hand over some land to Russia to end the war - a non-starter for Kyiv - Trump replied: "We'll see what happens."</p>

<p>Still, Trump said on Friday he was pleased to meet with Zelenskiy, a marked change in tone from some of his previous comments on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>On Monday, Trump said Zelenskiy wanted Harris to win the election. He has also called Zelenskiy "the greatest salesman of all time" because his country has received billions of dollars in military aid from the United States and Europe.</p>

<p>"It's an honor to have the president with us, and he's been through a lot," Trump said on Friday. "He's been through a tremendous amount, like probably nobody else, almost nobody else in history, if you really get right down to it, and we're going to have a discussion and see what we could come up with."</p>

<p>Trump said that if he won the Nov. 5 election he would immediately begin working toward a resolution of the Ukraine conflict, even though he would formally take office only in late January 2025.</p>

<p>Zelenskiy, who is in the United States for the U.N. General Assembly, met on Thursday with Democratic President Joe Biden and Harris.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, Zelenskiy traveled to a munitions factory in Pennsylvania with that state's Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, a Harris ally. The visit upset Trump's campaign and enraged some congressional Republicans who viewed the trip as a campaign stop, particularly as Pennsylvania is an important battleground state expected to decide the U.S. election.</p>

<p>As late as Thursday, people close to Trump and his campaign had said a meeting appeared extremely unlikely, though the former president apparently changed his mind during Zelenskiy's stay in the country.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[The Israeli military said on Friday it was carrying out fresh strikes against Hezbollah targets in south Lebanon, minutes after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the UN that operations against the Lebanese armed group will continue.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel carried out air strikes on the south of Lebanon's capital Beirut that it said targeted Hezbollah's headquarters, moments after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to keep fighting the militant group.</p>

<p>The strikes, heard across the city, sent huge clouds of smoke soaring above the densely populated south of Beirut, the main bastion of Iran-backed Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said the strike targeted "the central headquarters" of Hezbollah in the southern suburbs of the city.</p>

<p>The bombing came moments after Netanyahu concluded his address to UN General Assembly delegates in New York, at which he vowed to keep up strikes against Hezbollah and fight "until victory" against Hamas.</p>

<p>Hezbollah and Israel have been locked in a deadly exchange of cross-border fire since the group's Palestinian ally, Hamas, attacked Israel on October 7.</p>

<p>Israel's aerial bombardment of Hezbollah strongholds around Lebanon has killed around 700 people this week alone, according to the health ministry, but a US-led bid for a ceasefire has failed to take hold.</p>

<p>"As long as Hezbollah chooses the path of war, Israel has no choice, and Israel has every right to remove this threat and return our citizens to their home safe," Netanyahu told the UN General Assembly, adding that operations against the Iran-backed militant group will "continue until we meet our objectives."</p>

<p>Nearly a year into the war with Hamas in Gaza, Israel shifted its focus to its northern front with Lebanon, with its wave of aerial bombardment sparking an exodus of around 118,000 people.</p>

<p>On Friday, Lebanon's National News Agency said Israeli air strikes had intensified overnight, and that one strike had killed a family of nine in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>Hezbollah fired rockets into the northern Israeli city of Tiberias, saying it was responding to "savage" strikes on Lebanese towns and villages.</p>

<h3><strong>'Deadliest in a generation'</strong></h3>

<p>"Everything is collapsing around us," said Lebanese businessman Anis Rubeiz, 55.</p>

<p>"People are tired mentally... I don't see (hope) on the horizon... or even a ray of light."</p>

<p>The UN children's agency condemned the violence, saying the attacks on Lebanon were killing children "at a frightening rate".</p>

<p>"We are witnessing the deadliest period in Lebanon in a generation, and many express their fear that this is just the beginning," the UN humanitarian coordinator in Lebanon, Imran Riza, said.</p>

<p>In Israel, too, many were weary of the violence.</p>

<p>"It is incredibly exhausting to be in this situation. We don't really know what's going to happen, there's talk of a ground offensive or a major operation," said Lital Shmuelovich, a physiotherapy student.</p>

<p>Netanyahu also addressed the war in Gaza, saying that Israel's military would continue to fight Hamas until the Islamist movement was crushed.</p>

<p>"If Hamas stays in power, it will regroup... and attack Israel again and again and again... So Hamas has got to go," Netanyahu said, vowing to fight the group until "total victory".</p>

<p>Diplomats have said efforts to end the war in Gaza were key to halting the fighting in Lebanon and bringing the region back from the brink of all-out war.</p>

<p>But despite months of mediation efforts, a Gaza ceasefire remains elusive.</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Of the 251 hostages seized by militants, 97 are still held in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 41,534 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to figures provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The UN has described the figures as reliable.</p>

<p>After the Hamas attack, the deadliest in Israel's history, Netanyahu vowed to bring the hostages home and to crush Hamas.</p>

<p>This month, he said securing Israel's border with Lebanon was also a war objective, to allow residents of northern Israel who have had to flee the area to return to their homes.</p>

<h3><strong>Hezbollah commander killed</strong></h3>

<p>For the fourth time in a week, Israel carried out a strike on Hezbollah's south Beirut stronghold, killing Mohammed Srur, the head of Hezbollah's drone unit.</p>

<p>Hezbollah held a funeral ceremony for Srur on Friday.</p>

<p>The Lebanon violence has raised fears of wider turmoil in the Middle East, with Iran-backed militants across the region vowing to keep up their fight with Israel.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the Israeli military said it intercepted a missile fired from Yemen.</p>

<p>The leader of Yemen's Huthi rebels, Abdul Malik al-Huthi, said in a televised address Thursday that the Iran-backed group would "not hesitate to support Lebanon and Hezbollah".</p>

<p>An Israeli air strike on Lebanon's border with Syria killed five Syrian soldiers, according to state news agency SANA.</p>

<p>Iran is a key ally of Syria, where it has helped prop up President Bashar al-Assad since the start of the civil war in 2011.</p>

<p>Netanyahu also took aim at Iran in his UN General Assembly address, saying: "I have a message for the tyrants of Tehran. If you strike us, we will strike you."</p>

<p>He added: "There is no place in Iran that the long arm of Israel cannot reach, and that's true of the entire Middle East."</p>

<p>Analysts say Iran will try to resist being dragged into the conflict but it is walking a tightrope trying to support Hezbollah without getting dragged into a full-blown war and playing into its enemy's hands.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pope Francis said Friday that the Catholic Church must "seek forgiveness" over the "scourge" of child sexual abuse, during a visit to Belgium where the Church's dark past looms large.</p>

<p>In a speech before political and civil society leaders that opened his three-day visit to the country, Francis denounced the "tragic instances of child abuse" as a stain on the Church's legacy.</p>

<p>"It is our shame and our humiliation," Francis told the gathering at the Laeken Palace royal residency.</p>

<p>"The Church must be ashamed and must seek forgiveness," he said.</p>

<p>The 87-year-old pontiff is due to meet with a group of clerical sexual assault victims in Brussels in the afternoon, as part of a three-day stay in the European nation tarred by decades of scandals and cover-ups.</p>

<p>The meeting with around 15 victims, taking place at 6:30 pm (1630 GMT) at the Vatican's diplomatic mission, was being held with the "utmost discretion", according to the Belgian church.</p>

<p>It was arranged after a hard-hitting documentary last year put Belgium's abuse scandal back on the front pages, prompting many new victims to come forward.</p>

<p>In an open letter published by Le Soir newspaper this month, some demanded the pope address paedophilia and set up a process for financial reparations.</p>

<p>"Words alone are not enough. Concrete measures must also be taken," Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said in a preamble to the pope's speech.</p>

<p>The pontiff said the abuse scandal was "a scourge that the Church is addressing firmly and decisively by listening to and accompanying those who have been wounded, and by implementing a prevention programme throughout the world".</p>

<h3><strong>Forced adoptions</strong></h3>

<p>Francis has made combating sexual assault in the Church a main mission of his papacy, and insisted on a "zero tolerance" policy in the wake of wide-reaching abuse scandals around the world.</p>

<p>During his speech, Francis also said he was "saddened" to learn about a forced adoptions scandal in Belgium that saw institutions run by nuns give up the babies of thousands of underage girls and unmarried women.</p>

<p>"We see how the bitter fruit of wrongdoing and criminality was mixed in with what was unfortunately the prevailing view in all parts of society at that time," he said.</p>

<p>Belgium's HLN news site estimates that up to 30,000 children were taken from their mothers in Belgium between 1945 and the 1980s.</p>

<p>Bishops in Belgium apologised in 2023 and requested an independent investigation after fresh testimonies emerged from women and people claiming to have been "sold" by the Catholic Church to their adoptive family.</p>

<p>Child sexual abuse and forced adoptions have "badly damaged trust" between the Church and society, De Croo said.</p>

<p>In a sign of the work yet to be done, the program of an open-air mass concluding Francis's trip on Sunday had to be changed at the last minute after it emerged that the closing hymn was composed by a priest accused of sexual abuse.</p>

<p>The blunder prompted the head of the Belgian bishops' conference, Archbishop Luc Terlinden, to admit that the Church needed to get better at keeping a tab on cases and perpetrators.</p>

<p>"This represents a great challenge for us, but we must think about it seriously with the help of lawyers and psychologists," he told a local broadcaster. The composer, who died this month, reportedly settled a sexual abuse case in 2002.</p>

<h3><strong>On the wane</strong></h3>

<p>The Argentinian pope arrived in Belgium on Thursday evening after spending the day in neighbouring Luxembourg, where he made a plea for international diplomacy amid flaring conflicts across the globe.</p>

<p>He was welcomed by King Philippe and Queen Mathilde, who hosted him on Friday morning, and he will head on to meet with academics at the Catholic university of Leuven in Dutch-speaking Flanders -- whose 600th anniversary next year is the official reason for Francis's visit.</p>

<p>On Saturday, during what is his 46th trip abroad, Francis will meet the clergy at the vast Basilica of the Sacred Heart before holding discussions with students at Louvain-la-Neuve in French-speaking Wallonia, notably on climate issues.</p>

<p>The last papal visit to Brussels was in 1995, when John Paul II attended the beatification of Saint Damien, who dedicated his life to lepers.</p>

<p>Nearly 65 percent of Belgium's population is Christian, including 58 percent who are Catholic, according to figures from Louvain university.</p>

<p>But their numbers are on the wane, reflecting a decline across Europe.</p>

<p>During his weekly general audience, Francis said he hoped his visit could be "the opportunity for a new impetus of faith".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed at the UN Friday to press his country's offensive against Lebanon's Hezbollah, dashing hopes for a 21-day truce proposed by France and the United States this week.</p>

<p>Netanyahu's highly anticipated turn at the UN, during which he repeatedly denounced the global organization as anti-Israel, was met with jeers by some delegates who walked out, but cheers and applause from his backers.</p>

<p>"As long as Hezbollah chooses the path of war, Israel has no choice, and Israel has every right to remove this threat and return our citizens to their homes safe," Netanyahu told the UN General Assembly.</p>

<p>"We will continue degrading Hezbollah until all our objectives are met."</p>

<p>His remarks appeared to undermine a truce proposal unveiled by the United States and France after President Joe Biden and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, met on the sidelines of the UN gathering.</p>

<p>The White House has said that the call for a ceasefire had been "coordinated" with Israel, but Netanyahu's office on Thursday said that the prime minister has not responded to the proposal.</p>

<p>Netanyahu also threatened Iran in his UN address, saying: "I have a message for the tyrants of Tehran. If you strike us, we will strike you."</p>

<p>"There is no place in Iran that the long arm of Israel cannot reach, and that's true of the entire Middle East," he added.</p>

<p>Delegates, including from Lebanon, Iran and the Palestinians, exited the room as Netanyahu took the rostrum for his speech.</p>

<p>"After I heard the lies and slanders leveled at my country by many of the speakers at this podium, I decided to come here and set the record straight," Netanyahu said at the start of his speech.</p>

<p>Ahead of his appearance, protesters gathered outside Netanyahu's hotel in New York to demand an end to the violence in Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

<h3><strong>'Deadliest period'</strong></h3>

<p>Hezbollah and Israel have been locked in a deadly exchange of cross-border fire since the Iran-backed group's Palestinian ally, Hamas, attacked Israel on October 7.</p>

<p>Netanyahu vowed Friday that "Hamas has got to go" and would have no role in the reconstruction of Gaza as he vowed to fight until "total victory."</p>

<p>Since Monday, Israel has shifted its focus from Gaza to its northern front with Lebanon where heavy bombing has killed 700 people and sparked an exodus of around 118,000 people.</p>

<p>The UN said Friday that a "catastrophic" intensification of Israeli attacks targeting Hezbollah militants had left Lebanon facing its "deadliest period... in a generation."</p>

<p>The Israeli strikes have brought the overall death toll in Lebanon to more than 1,500 people killed in nearly a year of clashes, according to Lebanese authorities.</p>

<p>That toll surpasses the 1,200 mostly civilians killed during the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, which also killed around 160 Israelis, most of them soldiers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The 14-storey apartment block in the southern Turkish city of Adana was destroyed by a massive 7.8-magnitude quake in February 2023 that killed more than 53,500 people in Turkey and nearly 6,000 in neighbouring Syria. Only one of the building's residents survived.</p>

<p>Built in 1975, the building's collapse immediately aroused suspicions as Adana, located less than 200 kilometres (about 120 miles) from the earthquake's epicentre, was largely spared from the violent tremors.</p>

<p>The man in the dock, Hasan Alpargun, was convicted on Friday of "having caused the death and injury of more than one person with possible intent", according to the official Anadolu news agency.</p>

<p>Alpargun is reported to have fled to Turkish-backed Northern Cyprus on the day of the quake, before turning himself over to police a week later.</p>

<p>During the trial experts pointed to serious deficiencies in the construction of the building's support columns, as well as the quality of concrete used.</p>

<p>Alpargun defended himself by stating that the construction was approved by the authorities.</p>

<p>More than 260 people involved in the construction of buildings that collapsed during the February 2023 earthquake were arrested in the aftermath, some while trying to flee Turkey.</p>

<p>The trials of several of these entrepreneurs have opened this year.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A UK judge on Friday jailed two climate activists who threw soup at Vincent van Gogh's "Sunflowers" at London's National Gallery in 2022 for terms of two years and 20 months respectively.</p>

<p>Just Stop Oil protesters Phoebe Plummer, 23, and Anna Holland, 22, were convicted at London's Southwark Crown Court of criminal damage in July.</p>

<p>Greenpeace UK's co-executive director, Will McCallum, called the sentence "a draconian and disproportionate punishment for a protest that caused minor damage to a picture frame".</p>

<p>Plummer and Holland had pleaded not guilty over the incident in October 2022.</p>

<p>Sentencing the pair, Judge Christopher Hehir said the painting could have been "seriously damaged or even destroyed".</p>

<p>"Soup might have seeped through the glass. You couldn't have cared less if the painting was damaged or not," he added.</p>

<p>"You had no right to do what you did to 'Sunflowers'."</p>

<p>The gallery, located in Trafalgar Square, said the protesters caused "minor damage to the frame" but the painting itself was protected by a screen and was unharmed.</p>

<p>Holland, who received the 20-month term, and Plummer, who was jailed for two years, also glued themselves to the gallery wall during their protest.</p>

<h3><strong>'What matters most?'</strong></h3>

<p>"What is worth more -- art or life?" Plummer had shouted.</p>

<p>"It's another grim milestone in the ongoing crackdown on peaceful protest waged by the last government," Greenpeace UK's McCallum said.</p>

<p>"Protest is by its nature inconvenient and occasionally messy. These defendants do not deserve to spend years behind bars for standing up for a liveable planet."</p>

<p>Just Stop Oil wants an end to the extraction and burning of fossil fuels like oil, coal and gas, because the greenhouse gas emissions they create are "driving us towards climate collapse... (that) spells disaster for human societies globally".</p>

<p>It has staged a number of high-profile stunts in recent years to draw attention to their plea to "end fossil fuels before they end us".</p>

<p>The group has targeted the Wimbledon tennis tournament and British Open golf tournament, as well as art galleries and museums and a performance of "Les Miserables".</p>

<p>Five activists, including the climate group's founder, were given between four and five years in jail in June for conspiring to plan protests that blocked the M25 orbital motorway around London.</p>

<p>Just Stop Oil says climate change poses an existential crisis for humanity and that its direct tactics are justified.</p>

<p>In July 2022, Just Stop Oil protesters glued themselves to John Constable's pastoral masterpiece "The Hay Wain", also in the National Gallery.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British actress Maggie Smith, an award winning Shakespearian actress and double Oscar winner who later appeared in the Harry Potter films, has died aged 89, the BBC reported on Friday.</p>

<p>One of the few actors to win the treble of an Oscar (two), Emmy (four), and Tony, Smith's long career started on the stage in the 1950s.</p>

<p>But for many younger fans in the 21st century, she was best-known as Professor McGonagall in all seven "Harry Potter" movies, and the Dowager Countess in the hit TV series and movie spin-offs of "Downton Abbey," a role that seemed tailor-made for an actress known for purse-lipped asides and malicious cracks.</p>

<p>Her first Academy Award nomination was for her turn playing Desdemona opposite Laurence Olivier's "Othello" in 1965, before winning the Oscar for her role as an Edinburgh schoolmistress in 1969's ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie."</p>

<p>She won her second Oscar for her supporting role in the 1978 comedy ""California Suite," a performance that prompted co-star Michael Caine to say: ""Maggie didn't just steal the film, she committed grand larceny."</p>

<p>Other critically acclaimed roles included Lady Bracknell in Wilde's ""The Importance of Being Earnest" on the West End stage, a 92-year-old bitterly fighting senility in Edward Albee's play ""Three Tall Women," and her part in 2001 black comedy movie "Gosford Park."</p>

<p>In 1990 Smith was knighted by Queen Elizabeth and became a Dame.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Russian drone attack Friday on Ukraine's port town of Izmail killed three, while a strike on a police office in the central city of Krivyi Rig killed one, officials said.</p>

<p>Two elderly women and a 73-year-old man were killed in Izmail, a strategic port on the River Danube, and 11 were wounded including one child, Odesa regional governor Oleg Kiper said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Private and apartment buildings, outbuildings, buildings and cars were damaged," he wrote, adding that several fires broke out but were quickly extinguished.</p>

<p>While far from the front, the southwestern city of Izmail and nearby areas are often targeted by Russian forces trying to disrupt port infrastructure crucial for Ukraine's shipping.</p>

<p>Romania's defence ministry said it scrambled four jets after detecting the approaching drones, adding that one drone might have entered its airspace for "less than three minutes".</p>

<p>"According to the data available at the moment, there was no reported impact zone on national territory," it said.</p>

<p>On Friday morning in the central city of Krivyi Rig, a missile attack on a police office killed one woman and wounded five, regional governor Sergiy Lysak said.</p>

<p>A missile gutted a police district headquarters in the city and "a woman's body was found under the rubble of the administrative building", Lysak said, with search operations still ongoing.</p>

<p>The strike caused damage to 23 private houses and three multi-storey blocks of flats and an educational facility, the governor said,</p>

<p>An overnight missile attack also struck the central-eastern city of Dnipro, damaging an "industrial facility" but without causing injuries, Lysak said.</p>

<p>Russia on Friday claimed the capture of another village in the eastern Donetsk region, Marynivka, as it advances towards the strategic city of Pokrovsk.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's "youngest knife murderers" were on Friday sentenced to a minimum of eight-and-a-half years' detention for killing a stranger in a machete attack when they were aged just 12.</p>

<p>The sentence was ordered as a nationwide ban on "zombie" style knives and machetes with blades of over 20 centimetres (eight inches) came into force this week to curb a wave of horrifying killings by young people.</p>

<p>The two boys, who are now aged 13 and cannot be identified legally because they are under 18, killed Shawn Seesahai, 19, in a park in Wolverhampton, central England, last November.</p>

<p>They were described in court as "the youngest knife murderers" and are also believed to be the youngest convicted of murder in Britain since 1993, when 11-year-old, Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, were found guilty of killing a toddler, James Bulger.</p>

<p>Sentencing the pair, judge Amanda Tipples told them: "What you did is horrific and shocking. When you killed Shawn he was 19, starting out in his adult life with everything to live for.</p>

<p>"His parents have lost their son. His sister has lost her brother."</p>

<p>The court heard that the victim was not known to the pair but that they set upon him after he asked them to move from a bench.</p>

<p>Relatives of Seesahai, who was born in the British Overseas Territory of Anguilla in the Caribbean, described his murder as unexpected, senseless and committed "for no reason at all".</p>

<p>Due to their age, the boys will not be jailed but held in secure accommodation. Once they are deemed fit for release they will be monitored for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>There is mounting public concern about knife crime. In July, three girls aged six, seven and nine were killed in Southport, northwest England, in a mass stabbing that shocked the country.</p>

<p>Official figures lay bare the scale of the problem.</p>

<p>In London alone, the number of knife or sharp instrument offences recorded by the police rose to more than 15,016 in 2023/24 -- from 12,786 in previous year.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer this month launched an initiative to stop young people getting involved in knife crime, which he called a "national crisis".</p>

<p>He has enlisted the support of actor Idris Elba, who is pushing for government intervention to reverse drastic funding cuts to youth services as a way to end violence.</p>

<p>Even as the ban on "zombie" style weapons came into force on Monday a 15-year-old boy died hours earlier after being stabbed in London.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Soundarya Balasubramani, a two-time author and co-founder of Greencard Inc, recently claimed that she was assaulted on the street in broad daylight in London. Ms Balasubramani shared her horrifying experience a few days back on Instagram. She said that the incident took place on September 18, when she was walking the streets of London to find a co-working space. At around 2 in the afternoon, a tall man approached her and asked for money. However, when she refused, the man punched her in the face, she claimed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"For a few seconds I was completely disoriented, unable to understand what the f**k just happened," Ms Balasubramani said in the video. "I look down and all I see in my hands and shirt and on the road is just blood. There's just blood dripping from my nose so fast, I mean I've never seen so much blood before," she continued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I immediately dropped to my knees because I was feeling faint," Ms Balasubramani shared. She also went on to say that when she looked back, the man was still standing there and smiling at her. Within the next few minutes, a bunch of people surrounded her, including first responders, police and the public. She rushed to the hospital, where she waited for 8 hours for a doctor to see her, she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The entire time I just had one thought: Please don't let this take away my eyesight," Ms Balasubramani recalled. She claimed that after the incident, she couldn't open her eyes at all the entire day. "I was so scared for my eyes," she said. After the CT scan, the doctors told her that she had several fractures in her nose, however, her eyes seemed fine for now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Balasubramani said she was relieved to know that the incident didn't take away her eyesight. However, she added that after the incident she decided to return back to India.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I walked away from this incident with a broken nose and black eye - and all I've been thinking about the past week is how it could have been so much worse," she added.</p>

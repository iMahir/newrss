       <description><![CDATA[It said within 10 minutes researchers were able to find on X propaganda videos from UK government-proscribed terrorist groups Hamas, Hezbollah, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A tech industry counter-terrorism organisation is concerned over content posted on Elon Musk's X by Palestinian militant group Hamas and is worried about the social media platform's membership on its board, The Sunday Times reported.</p>

<p>Members of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT) believe the group's credibility is undermined by X's membership and position on its board, according to The Sunday Times. The GIFCT also includes major social media groups Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, and Alphabet's YouTube.</p>

<p>X Corp and the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>The Sunday Times said that X, formally known as Twitter, is now the easiest social media platform to find Hamas videos, citing the Community Security Trust (CST), a charity that combats extremism and antisemitism.</p>

<p>It said within 10 minutes CST researchers were able to find on X propaganda videos from UK government-proscribed terrorist groups Hamas, Hezbollah, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.</p>

<p>According to The Sunday Times, a statement in the GIFCT's independent advisory committee annual 2023 report expressing concern over online trust and safety was directed at X.</p>

<p>The advisory body said it had become "increasingly concerned by significant reductions in online trust and safety capabilities for certain platforms, and a perceived decrease in the priority of the issue, negatively impacting companies' ability to moderate extremist content online".</p>

<p>The Sunday Times said Musk had let banned extremists back on to X, allowed anyone to pay for a verification mark and sacked a large part of its content moderation team, as part of the billionaire's strategy of turning X into a "free speech" platform.</p>

<p>The GIFCT was created in 2017 under pressure from U.S. and European governments. The Sunday Times said X, a founding member of the organisation, was now failing to make its full financial contribution to the anti-organisation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The traditional red, yellow, and green lights will be used for most of the time until practically all cars are autonomous vehicles.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All of us are aware that the traffic light colours- red, yellow (also known as amber), and green, are arranged vertically or horizontally in that order. These are the same across the globe and have been the same for over a century. Scientists have now proposed a fourth colour for these lights for driverless vehicles, as per a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/08/11/traffic-lights-getting-a-new-colour-3-21379750/?ico=mosaic_news"><em>Metro UK.</em></a></p>

<p>There are no completely driverless cars on the road, given autonomous vehicles (AVs) are a relatively new concept. Waymo, a self-driving taxi company, has nearly reached the fifth level, or SAE4, in California and Arizona. Teslas and other AVs are growing in popularity as well. Meanwhile, self-driving cars are not currently permitted on UK roads with a few exceptions. However, the Automated Vehicles Act may allow them as early as 2026. This indicates that autonomous and human-driven vehicles will soon co-exist on the roads.</p>

<p>Amid this, North Carolina State University engineers are putting forth a "white light" at traffic lights, which would enable self-driving cars to assist with traffic flow and communicate with human drivers to inform them about what is happening. The goal, according to study head Dr Ali Hajbabaie, was to use the AVs' computer capability to determine which vehicles were where.</p>

<p>"The white phase concept incorporates a new traffic signal, so that human drivers know what they are supposed to do. Red lights will still mean stop. Green lights will still mean go. And white lights will tell human drivers to simply follow the car in front of them," he said.</p>

<p>Dr Hajbabaie along with his team made several computer simulations to visualise how the new system, which could improve travel time, fuel efficiency and safety, would work. The findings are published in the Journal of Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering. According to the proposal, AVs would be able to wirelessly communicate with computers that manage traffic signals as well as with one another. When a sufficient number of autonomous vehicles approach the intersection, the new traffic signal system will activate. Any non-automated vehicles would just need to follow the vehicle in front of them, and the white light would communicate to onlookers that the AVs are coordinating their motions to move traffic through the crossing.</p>

<p>However, the traditional red, yellow, and green lights will be used for most of the time until practically all cars are autonomous vehicles, and the system will operate just as it has for more than a century. The team also found out that the white light concept "improves traffic efficiency for both vehicles and pedestrians."</p>

<p>"If at some point in the future we see almost universal adoption of AVs, our models suggest that delays at intersections would decrease by more than 25%. More realistically, we will eventually see a lower percentage of wirelessly connected AVs on the road, but there would still be meaningful improvements in traffic time," the scientist added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The network will keep providing 11 hours of television content every day, from 6 am to 5 pm.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Cartoon Network website, which had been online since 1998, was removed from the internet on August 8, as per a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/cartoon-network-shuts-down-warner-bros-discovery-max-signup-1236101422/"><em>Variety</em></a>. Previously a portal with a video-heavy homepage for shows like 'Teen Titans Go!', 'The Powerpuff Girls', 'Adventure Time', and 'Steven Universe', users are now redirected to Max, another Warner Bros. Discovery streaming platform, where they can see their favourite cartoons.</p>

<p>A pop-up message welcoming visitors to the Max website said, "Looking for episodes of your favourite Cartoon Network shows? Check out what's available to stream on Max (subscription required)." The welcome message also encouraged current cable subscribers to use "Connected apps" in addition to watching shows on their televisions. "Sign up for Max, where you can also create a Kids Profile with rating restrictions and additional privacy protections to keep it fun and kid-friendly! Cable subscribers, continue to enjoy your favourite CN programming on your TV and connected apps as well!" it added.</p>

<p>A Cartoon Network spokesperson told the outlet in a statement, "We are focusing on the Cartoon Network shows and social media where we find consumers are the most engaged and there is a meaningful potential for growth." They also said that the network will keep providing 11 hours of television content every day, from 6 am to 5 pm.</p>

<p>CartoonNetwork.com is the victim of the ongoing streaming war among online portals. It also seems like a cost-cutting measure meant to entice viewers to pay for Max. The parent firm Paramount Global removed the websites for Comedy Central, MTV News, and CMT in June. In February, Paramount also cancelled the preschool-focused channel Noggin.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Cartoon Network website went live in July 1998, which was roughly six years after the cable network's October 1992 launch. It also existed as an AOL channel as early as 1996. Last month, a rumour that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ripcartoonnetwork-become-the-top-trend-is-the-channel-shutting-down-rumour-video-6067053">Cartoon Network was shutting down </a>sent shockwaves on social media and #RIPCartoonNetwork became the top trend. The rumour started with a video posted on X (formerly Twitter) by the account "Animation Workers Ignited", which claimed that the channel was "dead". However, it was clarified that the channel was not shutting down.</p>

<p>The channel is adapting to changes in the media landscape and has new programming in development, including spin-offs of popular shows.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Hindu community in Bangladesh spending anxious hours in the wake of resignation of Awami League leader Sheikh Hasina as Prime Minister and facing the spillovers of the violent protests over a quota-related issue in the South Asian nation on Sunday came out on streets in large numbers in the port city of Chittagong, demanding safety for their lives, properties and places of worship while proclaiming 'Bangladesh is our motherland and we won't go anywhere'.</p>

<p>There have been reports of widespread and targeted violence against the Hindus in Bangladesh, with the matter being taken note by the UN which called out the interim Bangladeshi government led by Mohammed Yunus to safeguard the minorities.</p>

<p>Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist Yunus, who was sworn in as the head of Bangladesh's interim government on Thursday, has also condemned the attacks on the minority communities, terming them as "heinous".</p>

<p>"Are they not the people of this country? You (students) have been able to save this country; can't you save some families? They are my brothers... we fought together, and we will stay together,” the Nobel Prize winner told students at a Bangladeshi university recently.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Hindus and other minorities - under the aegis of ‘Bangladesh Hindu, Buddha, Christian Unity Group - took out a massive protest rally against the alleged attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh after Sheikh Hasina resigned in the aftermath of violent protests on August 5 and fled the country. Hindus in Bangladesh have been traditional supporters of Hasina's Awami League party.</p>

<p>"Our soil, our mother is Bangladesh. We will never leave our mother," read one of the placards seen during the protest rally.</p>

<p>"Save Bangladeshi Hindu Society. Save Hindus!" another appeal read.</p>

<p>Sunday's protests saw the participation of people belonging to numerous minorities led by the Hindus, a prominent minority group in the country.</p>

<p>The protesters also waved the Bangladeshi national flag along with a saffron-colour flag depicting Lord Ram with 'Jai Shri Ram' written.</p>

<p>He also urged the students, who are at the forefront of the protests, to protect all Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist families from any harm</p>

<p>The protesting Hindus, in Chittagong, also questioned why their places of worship are being attacked.</p>

<p>"We need answers. Why is this happening to us? We want to live in peace. Let us live," read another placard at the site of the protest rally.</p>

<p>"Why are our sisters and mothers being physically harassed," another hand-written note on cardboard flashed during the 'demand for justice rally' read.</p>

<p>Since August 5, at least 232 people have reportedly died in various attacks and conflicts across Bangladesh while there have also been at least 205 incidents of attacks in 52 districts against the minorities since the fall of the Sheikh Hasina-led government.</p>

<p>According to media reports, over 100 Hindus and other minorities have been killed across the country since the fall of the previous government.</p>

<p>The Chittagong protests on Sunday witnessed overwhelming emotions with the minorities expressing their anger, anxiety and apprehensions, with the hope that authorities taking necessary steps to address their worries.</p>

<p>Ironically -- considering the current unrest in the country -- 'AMAR SONAR BANGLA' placard also featured during the protests. Translating to 'My Golden Bengal', it is the national anthem of Bangladesh written by the Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore who is also the composer of the Indian national anthem.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Over 300 Indian Americans and Bangladeshi-origin Hindus gathered in Houston to protest the violence against Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a powerful yet peaceful display of solidarity, over 300 Indian Americans and Bangladeshi-origin Hindus gathered at Sugar Land City Hall in Houston on Sunday morning to protest the horrific acts committed by Islamist extremists targeting Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh. The air was thick with emotion as attendees united for a cause that resonated deeply with their identities and beliefs.</p>

<p>Organizers passionately called on the Biden Administration to take immediate and decisive action to prevent further atrocities and to protect vulnerable minority communities in Bangladesh. The recent surge in violence against Hindu communities poses an urgent and alarming threat to peace and stability in the region, and the time to act is now.</p>

<p>The organizers passionately called for immediate protection and safety for all religious minorities in Bangladesh, urging the US government to refuse to remain a silent bystander as these heinous crimes against humanity unfold.</p>

<p>They encouraged Bangladeshi Hindus to stay vigilant and unite in monitoring the ongoing situation, taking necessary initiatives collectively in any emergency.</p>

<p>The vigil, aptly titled "Save Hindus in Bangladesh," was organized by the Global Voice for Bangladesh Minorities, an umbrella organization representing major Houston Hindu groups, including Maitri, Vishwa Hindu Parishad of America, HinduAction, HinduPact, Houston Durgabari Society, ISKCON, Global Kashmiri Pandit Diaspora, and many more.</p>

<p>Participants raised their placards high, bearing passionate messages demanding an end to the violence and atrocities against Hindus in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>The crowd erupted with fervour as slogans like "Stop Hindu Genocide," "Stand Up and Speak Out Now," "Hindu Lives Matter," and "We0 Won't Run, We Won't Hide, Stop Hindu Genocide" rang out, echoing their urgent plea for justice.</p>

<p>Quoting the timeless words of Mahatma Gandhi, "To forgive and accept injustice is cowardice," along with the poignant words of Martin Luther King Jr., the organizers passionately declared, "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."</p>

<p>Achlesh Amar, one of the speakers representing VHP and HinduAction, addressed the packed crowd with unwavering conviction, proclaiming, "We strongly condemn the assault on the Hindu community for their pluralistic beliefs. We stand united in unwavering solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Bangladesh. We demand immediate action from the Bangladeshi government to bring the perpetrators to justice and ensure the safety and security of all its citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs!"</p>

<p>Amar also shared a heartfelt statement from Deepti Mahajan, co-convener of HinduPACT.</p>

<p>"With the coup in Bangladesh, the 10 million Hindus are sitting on a ticking bomb of genocide," she warned, her voice trembling with urgency. "Reports from within Bangladesh reveal unimaginable torture, killings, and the burning of Hindu temples, alongside harrowing stories of women subjected to unspeakable abuse. This instability poses a grave danger not only to Hindus but also to the very foundations of democracy in countries like India and the US. It is an inevitable threat to Hindus in Pakistan as well. We need the eyes and ears of all Western nations focused on this crisis in Asia, and we demand safety for all minorities in Bangladesh!"</p>

<p>A Bangladeshi-origin American woman present at the vigil spoke with palpable emotion, her voice breaking as she shared, "The horrific acts of violence back home are devastating. When we call home and hear about these brutal acts every single day, it tears us apart. So many innocent lives have been lost! Places of worship have been burned or vandalized, and women have been horrifically abused. This must stop now! We cannot stand idly by while our people suffer!"</p>

<p>The gathering was a powerful reminder that the struggle for justice knows no borders. United by love and compassion, they stood together to demand action, to raise their voices against oppression, and to ensure that the plight of Hindus in Bangladesh does not go unheard.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Moscow and Kyiv accused each other of starting a fire on the grounds of Europe's largest and now Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine on Sunday, with both sides reporting no sign of elevated radiation.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moscow and Kyiv accused each other of starting a fire on the grounds of Europe's largest and now Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine on Sunday, with both sides reporting no sign of elevated radiation.</p>

<p>The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear watchdog, which has a presence at the vast six-reactor facility, said its experts had seen strong, dark smoke coming from the northern area of the plant in southern Ukraine following multiple explosions.</p>

<p>Russian state news agencies, TASS and RIA, cited the country's nuclear energy company Rosatom as saying the main fire was extinguished shortly before midnight on Sunday.</p>

<p>The fire comes less than a week after Ukraine's forces launched their largest incursion into Russian territory since the war started in 2022, a surprise move that has brought conflict into a new phase, after weeks of Moscow's battlefield gains.</p>

<p>Ukraine's nuclear power company Energoatom said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app that one of the cooling towers and other equipment were damaged.</p>

<p>Russia's TASS agency also reported, citing Rosatom's statement, that a cooling tower was damaged. Citing local Russian emergency ministry representatives, TASS said it was a non-functioning tower.</p>

<p>Russia captured the plant from Ukraine shortly after launching its full-scale invasion on its smaller neighbour in 2022, an attack described by Moscow as a "special operation".The plant's six nuclear reactors are in cold shutdown.</p>

<h3><strong>TRADING BLAME</strong></h3>

<p>By early Monday, it was not clear what caused the fire that started at around 8 p.m. (1700 GMT) on Sunday.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russia of lighting the fire which he said was visible from the Kyiv-held city of Nikopol, which looks out onto the Russian-held plant.</p>

<p>Evgeny Balitsky, a Russian-installed official in the occupied south of Ukraine, accused Kyiv's forces of causing the fire by shelling the nearby city of Enerhodar which, like the plant, was captured by Russia soon after its February 2022 invasion.</p>

<p>The IAEA said there had been no reported impact on nuclear safety at the site.</p>

<p>"Team was told by (the nuclear plant) of an alleged drone attack today on one of the cooling towers located at the site," it wrote on X.</p>

<p>Ukraine's Energoatom said Russia's "negligence" or arson could have sparked the fire. Without providing evidence, it also said Russia uses the plant's cooling towers to store military equipment and explosives.</p>

<p>Russia's officials in turn, including Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, accused Kyiv of deliberately trying to destroy the plant and sow "nuclear terror."</p>

<p>Zelenskiy published grainy video showing belching black smoke that appeared to be coming out a cooling tower with a blaze burning at its foot.</p>

<p>"Currently, the radiation indicators are normal. But as long as Russian terrorists retain control over the nuclear plant, the situation is not and cannot be normal," he said.</p>

<p>The six reactors at the plant located close to the front line of the war in Ukraine are not in operation but the facility relies on external power to keep its nuclear material cool and prevent a catastrophic accident.</p>

<p>Moscow and Kyiv have routinely accused each other of endangering safety around it.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greek authorities have ordered the evacuation of Marathon town, the birthplace of the Marathon race, due to a raging wildfire.</p>

<p>Residents of Marathon were on Sunday asked to move towards the neighbouring settlement of Nea Makri, Xinhua news agency reported, citing the Climate Crisis and Civil Protection ministry, following the evacuation of six settlements in the area.</p>

<p>Facilities of the Athens Olympic Athletic Center (OAKA), the main venue of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games, approximately 30 km from Marathon, opened to host many of the evacuees overnight, Greek national broadcaster ERT reported.</p>

<p>Eight people were transferred to hospitals with mainly respiratory problems, according to the latest information provided by health ministry officials.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, firefighters were trying to contain the front which extends several kilometres in the northeastern Attica region, according to the Fire Brigade.</p>

<p>The fire broke out around 3 p.m. local time in Varnavas, around 35 km from Athens. The fire spread fast fueled by hot and windy weather and thick plumes of smoke from the blaze have covered a large part of Athens.</p>

<p>The smoke has also reached as far as about 100 km from Varnavas, a settlement near Marathon, due to strong winds, which reached up to eight on the Beaufort scale, according to Greek meteorologists.</p>

<p>Approximately 400 firefighters supported by 29 water-dropping airplanes and helicopters, 110 fire engines, military squads and many volunteers have been working to contain the front, a Fire Brigade spokesperson told a press briefing in Athens.</p>

<p>Another big wildfire, breaking out earlier on Sunday near Megara town in western Attica, has been taken under control.</p>

<p>In both cases, mostly forested areas were scorched, and local officials reported some damage to houses.</p>

<p>Over the past 24 hours, firefighting forces have responded to 40 wildfires across Greece, the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Authorities have advised people to remain on alert these days as high temperatures in several regions may increase fire risk there.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Global youth unemployment is at its lowest level for 15 years, the United Nations said Monday, though not all regions have yet recovered from the Covid-19 slump.</p>

<p>The number of 15- to 24-year-olds who are not in employment, education or training (NEET) is concerning, the UN's labour agency said, adding that the post-Covid-19 pandemic recovery has not been universal in all regions.</p>

<p>"Young people in certain regions and many young women are not seeing the benefits of the economic recovery," the International Labour Organization said.</p>

<p>At 64.9 million, the total number of unemployed young people worldwide in 2023 was the lowest since the start of the millennium, the ILO said.</p>

<p>At 13 percent, the youth unemployment rate last year represents a 15-year low and a fall from the pre-pandemic rate of 13.8 percent in 2019, it said.</p>

<p>"It is expected to fall further to 12.8 percent this year and next," it added.</p>

<p>"The picture, however, is not the same across regions. In the Arab States, East Asia and South-East Asia and the Pacific, youth unemployment rates were higher in 2023 than in 2019."</p>

<p><strong>NEET worries</strong></p>

<p>The ILO's Global Employment Trends for Youth 2024 report cautioned over the growing casualisation of work for young people -- and the widening gap in the supply of young graduates and the number of suitable jobs for them to take up.</p>

<p>It said too many young people were NEETs and opportunities to access decent jobs were limited in emerging and developing economies.</p>

<p>The NEET rate stood at 20.4 percent in 2023 -- and two in three NEETs are women.</p>

<p>The NEET rate was 28.1 percent for young women in 2023, and 13.1 percent for young men.</p>

<p>Globally, more than half of young workers are in the informal employment.</p>

<p>Only in high- and upper-middle-income economies are the majority of young workers today in regular, secure work.</p>

<p><strong>Insecurity</strong></p>

<p>"None of us can look forward to a stable future when millions of young people around the world do not have decent work and as a result, are feeling insecure and unable to build a better life for themselves and their families," said ILO chief Gilbert F. Houngbo.</p>

<p>"Peaceful societies rely on three core ingredients: stability, inclusion, and social justice; and decent work for the youth is at the heart of all three," the former prime minister of Togo added.</p>

<p>The report said that despite the positive economic and labour market signals, surveys show young people are increasingly anxious about the future.</p>

<p>"Many young people today feel stressed about job loss and job stability, the state of the economy, a lack of social mobility across generations, and their prospects for eventual financial independence," it said.</p>

<p>Houngbo said this could be because most available jobs "are temporary and lack social protection".</p>

<p>"We have seen very little progress in getting more young people in decent jobs, and this in fact has been the overall trend for the last 20 years," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[An ATR-72 turboprop plane operated by regional carrier Voepass crashed on Friday in a residential area near Sao Paulo, Brazil, killing all 62 passengers aboard.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An ATR-72 turboprop plane operated by regional carrier Voepass crashed on Friday in a residential area near Sao Paulo, Brazil, killing all 62 passengers aboard.</p>

<p>Investigators have recovered the plane's so-called black box containing voice recordings and flight data, with a preliminary report expected within 30 days, the head of Brazil's aviation accident investigation center, Cenipa, said on Sunday.</p>

<p><strong>HOW DID THE CRASH OCCUR?</strong></p>

<p>The plane was bound for Sao Paulo from Cascavel, in the state of Parana, and crashed at around 1:30 p.m. (1630 GMT) in Vinhedo, some 80 km (50 miles) northwest of Sao Paulo.</p>

<p>The aircraft was flying normally until 1:21 p.m., when it stopped responding to calls, and radar contact was lost at 1:22 p.m., Brazil's air force said in a statement. The plane did not report any emergency.</p>

<p>Videos of the event show that the sky was apparently clear when the plane started spiraling in an unusual circling motion.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT WILL EXPERTS BE LOOKING FOR?</strong></p>

<p>US aviation safety expert Anthony Brickhouse said investigators would look at aspects like weather and examine to what extent the engines and controls were functioning properly, to help identify what caused the loss of control.</p>

<p><strong>COULD WEATHER CONDITIONS HAVE CAUSED THE CRASH?</strong></p>

<p>Videos of the crash analyzed by aviation experts led some to speculate that ice had built up on the plane. On Friday, Voepass said ice was predicted at the altitudes in which the plane was flying, but that it should have been within an acceptable level.</p>

<p>Brazilian aviation engineer and crash investigator Celso Faria de Souza said he is almost certain ice caused the accident, judging from the video.</p>

<p>ATR-72 planes have experienced issues with icing, with a crash in 1994 in the US state of Indiana killing 68, after the plane was unable to bank due to ice buildup. After that incident, manufacturer ATR improved its de-icing system. In 2016 in Norway an ATR-72 experienced issues after ice accumulated on the plane, but the pilot was able to regain control.</p>

<p><strong>COULD THE ENGINE HAVE FAILED?</strong></p>

<p>John Hansman, a professor in the department of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, reviewed some of the Brazil crash footage shared on social media and without having reviewed flight data said the crash did not appear to have been caused by weather.</p>

<p>It may have been an engine failure on one side, mismanaged by the crew, which would lead to the rotation downward, said Hansman.</p>

<p><strong>ARE MULTIPLE POINTS OF FAILURE POSSIBLE?</strong></p>

<p>Air crashes could be due to any number of factors, according to experts. Among them could be ice, engine failure or human error. In many instances there is more than one cause, said Robert A. Clifford, a lawyer who represented some of the families of crash victims in the 1994 accident.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A helicopter crashed into the roof of a hotel in the popular northern Australian tourist town of Cairns, killing the pilot and forcing the evacuation of hundreds of guests, authorities said on Monday.</p>

<p>Emergency crews were called at about 2 a.m. on Monday (1600 GMT on Sunday) after a twin-engine helicopter collided with the hotel roof, causing a fire on top of the building and triggering evacuations, Queensland state police said in a statement.</p>

<p>Police said forensic investigations were underway to formally identify the pilot. He was declared dead at the scene.</p>

<p>"There were no injuries sustained by people on the ground," the police statement said.</p>

<p>The crash occurred at Hilton's Double Tree Hotel in the city of Cairns, a major gateway to Australia's Great Barrier Reef, Australian media reported.</p>

<p>Two of the helicopter's rotor blades came off and one landed in the hotel pool, media reports said.</p>

<p>The forensic crash unit will work with Australia's transport safety regulator to prepare an accident report, police said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel expanded evacuation orders in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip overnight, forcing tens of thousands of Palestinian residents and displaced families to leave in the dark as explosions from tank shelling reverberated around them.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it was attacking operatives from the Hamas group - which administered Gaza before the war - who were using those areas to stage attacks and fire rockets.</p>

<p>On Saturday, an Israeli airstrike on a school where displaced Palestinians were sheltering in Gaza City killed at least 90 people, according to the civil defence service, prompting an international outcry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it had struck a Hamas and Islamic Jihad militant command post, an allegation the two groups rejected as a pretext, and killed 19 operatives.</p>

<p>In Khan Younis in the south of the Gaza Strip, the evacuation instruction covered districts in the centre, east and west, making it one of the largest such orders in the 10-month-old conflict, two days after tanks returned to the east of the city.</p>

<p>The announcement was posted on X and in text and audio messages to residents' phones: "For your own safety, you must evacuate immediately to the newly created humanitarian zone. The area you are in is considered a dangerous combat zone."</p>

<p>Philippe Lazzarini, head of the United Nations' agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA, said people in Gaza were trapped and had nowehere to go.</p>

<p>"Some are only able to carry their children with them, some carry their whole lives in one small bag. They are going to overcrowded places where shelters are already overflowing with families. They have lost everything and need everything," he said.</p>

<p>The Israeli army said it had struck around 30 Hamas military targets in the previous 24 hours, including military structures, anti-tank missile launch posts, and weapons storage facilities.</p>

<p>The Islamic Jihad armed wing said fighters fired mortar bombs against Israeli forces massing in the eastern areas of Khan Younis.</p>

<p>Later on Sunday, an Israeli airstrike near the Khan Younis market at the center of the city killed four Palestinians and wounded several others, medics said.</p>

<p>Lines of smoke rose from areas where Israeli planes carried attacks in the eastern and western parts of the city. Residents said two multi-floor buildings were bombed.</p>

<p>Nearly 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli offensive in Gaza since the war broke out last October and the toll is rising by the day, the Gaza health ministry says.</p>

<p>Gaza health officials say most of the fatalities have been civilians but Israel says at least a third are fighters. Israel says it has lost 329 soldiers in Gaza. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel began its assault on Gaza after Hamas fighters stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<h3><strong>Tens Of Thousands Forced To Leave Overnight</strong></h3>

<p>Most of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been displaced from their homes, according to the United Nations, while their narrow strip of land has largely been reduced to a wasteland of rubble.</p>

<p>Palestinian and United Nations officials say there are no safe areas in the enclave. Areas designated as humanitarian zones, like Al-Mawasi in western Khan Younis where residents were being sent, have been bombed several times by Israeli forces.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands left their homes and shelters in the middle of the night, heading west toward Mawasi and north toward Deir Al-Balah, already overcrowded with hundreds of thousands of displaced people.</p>

<p>"We're exhausted. This is the 10th time I and my family have had to leave our shelter," said Zaki Mohammad, 28, who lives in the Hamad housing project in western Khan Younis, where the occupants of two multi-floor buildings were ordered to leave.</p>

<p>"People are carrying their belongings, their children, their hopes and their fears and running towards the unknown, because there is no safe place," he told Reuters via a chat app. "We are running from death to death."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two migrants died on Sunday in the Channel off the northern coast of France trying to reach Britain by boat, French maritime authorities said.</p>

<p>The new drownings near the French city of Calais mean nine people have lost their life attempting the dangerous sea crossing this month alone, and 25 since the start of the year.</p>

<p>A boat was signalled as being in distress on Sunday morning at sea between Calais and Dunkirk and "two people were declared dead", the maritime authorities said.</p>

<p>The vessel in trouble 10 kilometres (6 miles) north of Calais had 56 migrants on board, said Jacques Billant, prefect of the Pas-de-Calais department.</p>

<p>Among the 54 surviving passengers, and another 50 people from another boat who were rescued, five were receiving medical care, he said.</p>

<p>In 2023, 12 migrants had died at sea trying to reach what they hoped would be a better life in Britain, according to the French authorities.</p>

<p>The death count this year has already surpassed that, with 25 migrants who have lost their lives since January, Billant said.</p>

<p>He said those crossing the sea often did so "without a lifejacket", on "vessels of very poor quality because not inflated enough and often without a solid bottom... or decent engine".</p>

<p>A non-governmental organisation called L'Auberge des Migrants ("The migrant hostel") on X mourned the deaths.</p>

<p>"This border kills in the greatest of silences," it said.</p>

<p>As of August 8, 17,639 people had crossed the sea on so-called "small boats" to Britain this year, according to an AFP tally of British government figures.</p>

<p>That is very close to the figure for the same period in 2022, a year of record crossings.</p>

<h3><strong>'Smuggler networks'</strong></h3>

<p>After the Labour party's victory in the British general election in July, Prime Minister Keir Starmer and France's President Emmanuel Macron pledged to strengthen "cooperation" in handling the surge in undocumented migrant numbers.</p>

<p>Starmer has cancelled a plan by the former Conservative government to send irregular migrants to a holding camp in Rwanda.</p>

<p>French authorities seek to stop migrants taking to the water but do not intervene once they are afloat except for rescue purposes, citing safety concerns.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, both governments are seeking to crack down on the people-smuggling gangs who organise the crossings and are paid thousands of euros by each migrant for the risky trip.</p>

<p>Billant said more than 350 people have been arrested and 15 "smuggler networks" dismantled since the start of the year.</p>

<p>The new migrant deaths come as the United Kingdom has been rocked by anti-migrant unrest, following a knife attack on July 29 that killed three children and was falsely linked on social media to a Muslim immigrant.</p>

<p>Thousands of anti-racism demonstrators rallied across the United Kingdom on Saturday against the riots that targeted mosques and hotels linked to immigration.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>US President Joe Biden, in his first TV interview since withdrawing from the election, has said he acted under pressure from fellow Democrats and out of a determination to see Donald Trump beaten.</p>

<p>Explaining his shock exit in new detail, Biden said party colleagues standing for reelection feared he was damaging their chances as his age and mental abilities came to dominate the campaign.</p>

<p>Biden, 81, has kept a low profile since ending his second-term bid on July 21 after his flailing debate performance against Trump triggered a slow-burning Democrat revolt against him.</p>

<p>In the short TV interview, recorded in the White House last week and broadcast on Sunday, the president appeared frail but cogent, again admitting he failed in the debate but stressing that health-wise he has "no serious problem."</p>

<p>"A number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the (election) races," he explained.</p>

<p>"I was concerned if I stayed in the race, that would be the topic you'd be interviewing me about," he continued.</p>

<p>He singled out former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a party heavyweight whose refusal to explicitly back his campaign was seen by many as pivotal.</p>

<p>"You'd be interviewing me about why did Nancy Pelosi say (something)... I thought it'd be a real distraction," Biden said.</p>

<p>"A critical issue for me still is -- not a joke -- maintaining this democracy.</p>

<p>"I have an obligation to the country to do what is the most important thing we can do, and that is -- we must, we must, we must defeat Trump."</p>

<h3><strong>Helping Harris</strong></h3>

<p>Biden said he was proud of his record on jobs, investment and Covid recovery -- and vowed to campaign hard for Vice President Kamala Harris, who has replaced him on the ballot.</p>

<p>"I'm going to do whatever Kamala thinks I can do to help most," he said.</p>

<p>Democrats' hopes of winning have soared since Biden's withdrawal, as Harris enjoys a surge in support that has left Trump and the Republicans struggling.</p>

<p>The outgoing president said he had expected to serve only one term when he won in 2020, but that he had been persuaded to push for a second.</p>

<p>"I thought of myself as being a transition president -- I can't even say how old I am. It's hard for me to get it out of my mouth -- but things got moving so quickly, it didn't happen," he told CBS's Robert Costa.</p>

<p>As Harris holds huge rallies in swing states, Trump's light schedule has come under scrutiny, and it was his running mate, J.D. Vance, who blitzed the Sunday morning political talk shows.</p>

<p>Appearing on CNN, ABC and CBS, Vance fielded questions about child care, asylum seekers and abortion.</p>

<p>In one testy exchange with CBS's Margaret Brennan, Vance complained that she had asked "six questions about abortion."</p>

<p>"I'm still trying to get a clear answer," Brennan retorted.</p>

<p>He also claimed that Harris was the one "calling the shots" in the Biden administration.</p>

<p>"If she's not calling the shots, Dana, who is?" he told CNN's Dana Bash.</p>

<p>Biden in his CBS interview warned that Trump was "a genuine danger to American security."</p>

<p>"Mark my words, if he wins... watch what happens," he said. "He's a genuine danger to American security.</p>

<p>"Look, we're at an inflection point in world history... and democracy is the key."</p>

<p>He added that he was "not confident at all" of a peaceful transfer of power if Trump loses a second time.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The virus is primarily spread through insect bites, including mosquitoes, and originates from pale-throated sloths, non-human primates, and birds.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A debilitating virus originating from sloths and transmitted by midges has been reported in Europe for the first time, officials have confirmed. In June and July, Europe saw 19 imported cases of the Oropouche virus, as reported by the European Center for Disease Control. Spain accounted for 12 cases, Italy for five, and Germany for two, the Manchester Evening News.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The virus is primarily spread through insect bites, including mosquitoes, and originates from pale-throated sloths, non-human primates, and birds.</p>

<p>Currently, there is no vaccine available for the virus, which belongs to the same family of diseases as Zika virus and Dengue Fever.</p>

<p>Dr Danny Altmann, a professor of Immunology at Imperial College London, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/oropouche-virus-outbreak-amazon-jungle-brazil-south-america/"><em>The Telegraph</em></a>, "We should definitely be worried. Things are changing and may become unstoppable."</p>

<p>Outbreaks of the virus have previously been reported in several countries across South and Central America, as well as the Caribbean. In 2024, specific outbreaks were recorded in Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, and more recently in Cuba.</p>

<p>Of the cases recorded in Europe, 18 involved recent travel to Cuba, while one case in Italy involved travel to Brazil.</p>

<p>Oropouche can cause symptoms such as headaches, nausea, vomiting, and muscle and joint pains, with more severe symptoms occurring occasionally. These symptoms typically subside after four days. According to the ECDC, fatal outcomes are extremely rare, and recovery is common.</p>

<p>However, The Lancet reported on July 25 that two deaths caused by Oropouche were recorded for the first time in Brazil, involving two young women with no underlying health conditions.</p>

<p>Between January and mid-July, more than 8,000 cases were reported in Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, and Cuba.</p>

<p>The ECDC assesses the risk of infection for EU citizens travelling to or residing in epidemic areas as moderate due to the high number of cases reported in the Americas.</p>

<p>The European authority has advised travellers to affected regions to use personal protective measures to reduce the risk of insect bites, both during outdoor activities and inside homes. This includes the use of insect repellent and wearing long-sleeved shirts and long trousers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Muhammad Yunus was on Sunday acquitted in a graft case filed by the Anti-Corruption Commission, three days after he took oath as the head of Bangladesh's interim government, according to a media report.</p>

<p>Judge Md Rabiul Alam of the Special Judge's Court-4 of Dhaka accepted the Anti-Corruption Commission's application which was filed with the court, seeking withdrawal of prosecution of the case, following section 494 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, an official of the anti-graft agency was quoted as saying by The Daily Star newspaper.</p>

<p>On August 7, a Dhaka court acquitted Yunus and three top officials of Grameen Telecom - Ashraful Hassan, M Shahjahan and Nurjahan Begum - in a labour law violation case.</p>

<p>Yunus, the 84-year-old economist, on Thursday took oath as the chief adviser of the interim government.</p>

<p>Nurjahan Begum, who was also an accused in the graft case, is a member of the 16-member Council of Advisers which will assist Yunus in running the state's affairs.</p>

<p>Yunus had been in a protracted row with the Sheikh Hasina government due to obscure reasons while authorities initiated a series of investigations against him after she came to power in 2008.</p>

<p>Bangladesh authorities launched a review of the statutory Grameen Bank's activities in 2011 and fired Yunus as its founding managing director on charges of violating the government retirement regulation.</p>

<p>Yunus was charged under dozens of cases during Hasina's regime.</p>

<p>In January, a court sentenced Yunus to six months in jail on charges of labour law violation.</p>

<p>Many people believe Hasina became enraged when Yunus announced that he would form a political party in 2007 when a military-backed government ran the country and Hasina was in prison.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hundreds of mourners gathered Sunday in Southport, northwest England, for the funeral of a nine-year-old girl killed in last month's knife attack, which sparked more than a week of nationwide disorder.</p>

<p>Family, friends, community leaders and emergency responders all joined Alice da Silva Aguiar's parents for an emotional ceremony at a Catholic church in the seaside town, nearly two weeks after the mass stabbing that shocked the country.</p>

<p>Attendees had been asked to wear white, a tradition for some in Portugal, where Alice's parents hail from.</p>

<p>Locals lining the main road clapped as the funeral cortege -- bearing a small white coffin, resting on a carriage pulled by two white horses with colourful feathers -- passed by.</p>

<p>"Of course we're here -- it's the Southport spirit," said one man who turned out. "We're here to pay our respects."</p>

<p>Pink ribbons and balloons had been tied to lampposts and garden walls near the church.</p>

<p>Several hundred people packed inside the venue for the service -- featuring short addresses, readings, prayers and hymns -- which was relayed on loudspeakers to those who had gathered outside.</p>

<p>Jinnie Payne, the headteacher of the primary school the nine-year-old attended, was among those to speak movingly.</p>

<p>"Alice, you will forever be in our hearts," she told the congregation.</p>

<p>The July 29 mass stabbing at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class killed two other girls -- Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven -- and injured 10 others including eight children.</p>

<p>Those wounded have all since been released from hospital.</p>

<h3><strong>'Unimaginable violence'</strong></h3>

<p>Bebe's parents, Lauren and Ben King, described Saturday how their "world was shattered by the loss of our precious daughter".</p>

<p>"She was taken from us in an unimaginable act of violence that has left our hearts broken beyond repair," they said in a statement released through police, adding she was "full of joy, light, and love".</p>

<p>The couple also revealed their elder daughter, Genie, witnessed the attack and managed to escape.</p>

<p>The stabbings sparked a riot in Southport the following evening, on July 30, and violence in more than a dozen English towns and cities as well as Northern Ireland over the ensuing week.</p>

<p>Officials have blamed the violence on far-right agitators and opportunist "thugs" accused of using the tragedy to further their anti-immigration, anti-Muslim agenda.</p>

<p>Misinformation spread online in the immediate aftermath of the stabbing spree claimed that the perpetrator was a Muslim immigrant.</p>

<p>British-born Axel Rudakubana has been charged with murder and attempted murder over the attack. His parents hail from Rwanda, which is overwhelmingly Christian.</p>

<p>A motive for the attack has not been disclosed, but police have said it is not being treated as terrorism-related.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iranian courts have reduced jail terms for two female journalists charged with collaborating with the United States, their lawyers told reformist newspapers on Sunday.</p>

<p>Elaheh Mohammadi, 37, and Niloufar Hamedi, 31, are out on bail after more than a year in Tehran's Evin prison for their coverage of the September 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini which had sparked nationwide protests.</p>

<p>In January, Iran's judiciary said it had launched new proceedings against the two women for posing for pictures without the mandatory headscarf upon their release that month.</p>

<p>Two separate appeals courts in Tehran ruled to acquit the women of the charge of collaboration with the United States, the lawyers were quoted as saying by Shargh and Ham Mihan dailies.</p>

<p>Originally, Mohammadi had been sentenced to six years in jail while Hamedi had been handed a seven-year sentence, according to the judiciary.</p>

<p>The pair were also each given five-year sentences for collusion and conspiring against state security and one year for propaganda against the Islamic republic.</p>

<p>The lawyers said these sentences were upheld by the appeals court and would be served concurrently, adding, however, that they hope the journalists would be freed under an amnesty announced last year by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>

<p>"Considering that the remaining two accusations meet the full conditions of the amnesty directive of 2023, we hope that Elaheh Mohammadi will be pardoned, and this case will be closed by issuing a suspension of execution order," Mohammadi's lawyer Shahab Mirlohi told Ham Mihan newspaper.</p>

<p>Hamedi's lawyers issued a similar statement.</p>

<p>Hamedi, a photographer for Shargh, was arrested less than a week after Amini's death after posting a picture of the young woman's grieving family on social media.</p>

<p>Ham Mihan reporter Mohammadi was arrested after going to Amini's hometown of Saqez, in the western Iranian province of Kurdistan, to cover her funeral which turned into a demonstration.</p>

<p>Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, had been arrested for an alleged breach of strict dress rules for women, in place since shortly after Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution.</p>

<p>Following her death, months-long protests shook Iran, with hundreds of people, including dozens of security personnel, killed in the unrest, and thousands of demonstrators arrested.</p>

<p>Nine men were executed in cases related to the protests which Iranian authorities generally labelled "foreign-instigated riots".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Bangladesh's new interim government helmed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus said on Sunday it had "grave concern" over reports of attacks on Hindus and other religious minorities in the past week.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's new interim government said Sunday it was working to resolve attacks on Hindus and other religious minorities reported after the dramatic ouster of autocratic premier Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>Hindus are the largest minority faith in mostly Muslim Bangladesh and are considered a steadfast support base for Hasina's party, the Awami League.</p>

<p>After Hasina's abrupt resignation and flight abroad on Monday brought an end to her 15 years of autocratic rule, there were numerous reports of attacks against Hindu households, temples and businesses.</p>

<p>"The attacks on religious minorities in some places have been noted with grave concern," the interim cabinet said in its first official statement since its Thursday appointment.</p>

<p>The cabinet said it would "immediately sit with the representative bodies and other concerned groups to find ways to resolve such heinous attacks".</p>

<p>Sunday's statement from the self-styled "council of advisors" tasked with steering democratic reforms in the South Asian nation of 170 million people listed numerous urgent priorities.</p>

<p>The government, led by Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, ordered "support" for the families of protesters who were killed in the weeks of demonstrations culminating in Hasina's departure.</p>

<p>It directed public funds to pay for those injured in the unrest, which began in July and killed more than 450 people.</p>

<p>The council also said it would reopen the metro system in the capital Dhaka by the end of the week and soon appoint a new central bank governor, replacing a Hasina loyalist forced to resign.</p>

<h3><strong>Institutional purge</strong></h3>

<p>Earlier in the day a new chief justice was sworn in to office the day after his predecessor, another Hasina ally accused of sublimating the Supreme Court to her government's will, quit following protester demands.</p>

<p>It is the latest in a string of fresh appointments to replace an old guard viewed as linked to the previous regime, ousted by the student-led uprising.</p>

<p>New top justice Syed Refaat Ahmed studied at the University of Dhaka, Oxford and Tufts University in the United States.</p>

<p>Ahmed replaced Obaidul Hassan after hundreds of protesters gathered outside the court to demand the latter step-down.</p>

<p>Appointed last year, Hassan earlier oversaw a much-criticised war crimes tribunal that ordered the execution of Hasina's opponents, and his brother was her longtime secretary.</p>

<p>Hasina, 76, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India on Monday as protesters flooded Dhaka's streets in a dramatic end to her iron-fisted rule.</p>

<p>Her government was accused of widespread human rights abuses, including the extrajudicial killing of thousands of her political opponents, during her 15-year rule.</p>

<p>Cabinet ministers left blindsided by her sudden fall have gone to ground, while several other top appointees have been forced out of office, including the national police chief.</p>

<p>Interim leader Yunus, 84, returned from Europe on Thursday to lead a temporary administration facing the monumental challenge of ending disorder and enacting democratic reforms.</p>

<p>The restoration of law and order was the caretaker administration's "first priority", Yunus said.</p>

<p>Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering work in microfinance, credited with helping millions of Bangladeshis out of grinding poverty.</p>

<p>He took office as "chief advisor" to a caretaker administration, comprised of fellow civilians bar one retired brigadier-general, and has said he wants to hold elections "within a few months".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The strongest storm to hit Shanghai in over 70 years made landfall on Monday, with flights cancelled and highways closed as Typhoon Bebinca lashed the city with strong winds and torrential rains.</p>

<p>A red alert is in place, and some coastal residents have been evacuated, city authorities said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The typhoon landed early Monday morning in the coastal area of Lingang New City, in Pudong to the city's east, the China Meteorological Administration said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is the strongest storm to hit Shanghai since Typhoon Gloria in 1949, state broadcaster CCTV said shortly after Bebinca made landfall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many businesses were already closed for the Mid-Autumn Festival public holiday, and the city's 25 million residents have been advised to avoid leaving their homes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All flights at Shanghai's two main airports are grounded, and ferry services and some trains have been suspended.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Highways were closed at 1:00 am local time (1700 GMT), and a 40-kilometre (25-mile) per-hour speed limit is in place on roads inside the city.</p>

<p>At rush hour, live video feeds showed Shanghai's normally jammed roads almost empty of traffic, and its famed skyline obscured by thick fog.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nine thousand residents have been evacuated from Chongming District, an island at the mouth of the Yangtze River, authorities said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Footage from northern Baoshan District showed ferocious winds ripping through a line of trees on the riverbank.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shanghai's flood control headquarters told CCTV they had already received dozens of reports of incidents related to the typhoon, mostly fallen trees and billboards.</p>

<p>CCTV broadcast footage of a reporter by the coast in neighbouring Zhejiang province, where waves pounded the craggy coastline under leaden skies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"If I step out into (the storm), I can barely speak," the reporter said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You can see that the surface of the sea is just wave after wave, each higher than the last."</p>

<p>Another typhoon, Yagi, killed at least four people and injured 95 when it passed through China's southern Hainan island this month, according to national weather authorities.</p>

<p>Bebinca has also passed through Japan and the central and southern Philippines, where falling trees killed six people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CCTV said Bebinca was expected to move northwest, causing heavy rain and high winds in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui provinces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China is the world's biggest emitter of the greenhouse gases that scientists say are driving climate change and making extreme weather more frequent and intense.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Facebook and Instagram users in the UK will start receiving in-app notifications from next week explaining the company's procedure and how users can object to their data being used.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta Platforms will begin training its AI models using public content shared by adults on Facebook and Instagram in the UK over the coming months, the company said, after it had paused the training in the region following a regulatory backlash.</p>

<p>The company will use public posts including photos, captions and comments to train its generative artificial intelligence models, it said on Friday, adding that the training content will not include private messages or information from accounts of users under the age of 18.</p>

<p>The update follows Meta's decision in mid-June to pause the launch of its AI models in Europe after the Irish privacy regulator told the company to delay its plan to harness data from social media posts.</p>

<p>The company had then said the delay would also allow it to address requests from Britain's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).</p>

<p>"Since we paused training our generative AI models in the UK to address regulatory feedback, we've engaged positively with the ICO ... this clarity and certainty will help us bring AI at Meta products to the UK much sooner," Meta said on Friday.</p>

<p>Facebook and Instagram users in the UK will start receiving in-app notifications from next week explaining the company's procedure and how users can object to their data being used for the training, Meta added.</p>

<p>Meta has made changes to its approach since it paused the plans in June, the ICO said in a statement, adding the company has simplified the way users can object to the processing of their data and has extended the window in which they can do so.</p>

<p>In June, Meta's plans faced backlash from advocacy group NOYB, which urged national privacy watchdogs across Europe to stop such use of social media content, saying the notifications were insufficient to meet EU's stringent privacy and transparency rules.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title"><span style="font-size: 13px;">The rings of Saturn are some of the most famous and spectacular objects in the Solar System. Earth may once have had something similar.</span></p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2024.118991">a paper published last week</a> in Earth &amp; Planetary Science Letters, my colleagues and I present evidence that Earth may have had a ring.</p>

<p>The existence of such a ring, forming around 466 million years ago and persisting for a few tens of millions of years, could explain several puzzles in our planet's past.</p>

<h3><strong>The case for a ringed Earth</strong></h3>

<p>So it's extremely unlikely that all 21 craters from this period would form close to the equator if they were unrelated to one another. We would expect to see many other craters at higher latitudes as well.</p>

<p>We think the best explanation for all this evidence is that a large asteroid broke up during a close encounter with Earth. Over several tens of millions of years, the asteroid's debris rained down onto Earth, creating the pattern of craters, sediments and tsunamis we describe above.</p>

<h3><strong>How rings form</strong></h3>

<p>You may know that Saturn isn't the only planet with rings. Jupiter, Neptune and Uranus have less obvious rings, too. Some <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2742">scientists have even suggested</a> that Phobos and Deimos, the small moons of Mars, may be remnants of an ancient ring.</p>

<p>So we know a lot about how rings form. Here's how it works.</p>
</div>

<figcaption><span class="caption">Saturn backlit by the Sun, taken by the Cassini spacecraft.</span> <span class="attribution"><span class="source">Cassini Imaging Team / SSI / JPL / ESA / NASA</span></span></figcaption>

<p>When a small body (like an asteroid) passes close to a large body (like a planet), it gets stretched by gravity. If it gets close enough (inside a distance called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit">Roche limit</a>), the small body will break apart into lots of tiny pieces and a small number of bigger pieces.</p>

<p>All those fragments will be jostled around and gradually evolve into a debris ring orbiting the equator of the larger body. Over time, the material in the ring will fall down to the larger body, where the larger pieces will form impact craters. These craters will be located close to the equator.</p>

<p>So if Earth destroyed and captured a passing asteroid around 466 million years ago, it would explain the anomalous locations of the impact craters, the meteorite debris in sedimentary rocks, craters and tsunamis, and the meteorites' relatively brief exposure to space radiation.</p>

<h3><strong>A giant sunshade?</strong></h3>

<p>Back then, the continents were in different positions due to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA8r3FVw46c">continental drift</a>. Much of North America, Europe and Australia were close to the equator, whereas Africa and South America were at higher southern latitudes.</p>

<p>The ring would have been around the equator. And since Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbit around the Sun, the ring would have shaded parts of Earth's surface.</p>

<p>This shading in turn might have caused global cooling, as less sunlight reached the planet's surface.</p>

<p>This brings us to another interesting puzzle. Around 465 million years ago, our planet began cooling dramatically. By 445 million years ago it was in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirnantian">Hirnantian Ice Age</a>, the coldest period in the past half a billion years.</p>

<p>Was a ring-shading Earth responsible for this extreme cooling? The next step in our scientific sleuthing is to make mathematical models of how asteroids break up and disperse, and how the resulting ring evolves over time. This will set the scene for climate modelling that explores how much cooling could be imposed by such a ring.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <description><![CDATA[Cher had argued that a conservatorship was necessary to protect these funds from being spent on drugs.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pop star Cher has withdrawn her bid for a conservatorship over her son, Elijah Blue Allman. The singer had initially filed for the conservatorship in December, citing concerns about Allman's substance abuse and mental health, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkdm7588v2o" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>BBC </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, after months of legal proceedings and a brief mediation, Cher and Allman have reached a private settlement. The dismissal of the conservatorship allows the family to focus on healing and rebuilding their relationship.</p>

<p>The law firm representing him, Cage &amp; Miles, told the BBC in a statement that the outcome "allows the parties to focus on healing and rebuilding their family bond, a process that began during mediation and continues today".</p>

<p>The decision comes after Allman was set to receive significant assets from a trust established by his late father, musician Gregg Allman. Cher had argued that a conservatorship was necessary to protect these funds from being spent on drugs.</p>

<p>In court filings, lawyers for Cher said the singer was "concerned that any funds distributed to Elijah will be immediately spent on drugs, leaving Elijah with no assets to provide for himself and putting Elijah's life at risk".</p>

<p>The filing said that she had "worked tirelessly to get Elijah into treatment and get him the help he needs".</p>

<p>Her son said that struggling with addiction and previous poor financial choices, he was sober and receiving regular treatment.</p>

<p>While the court had previously denied Cher's requests for temporary conservatorship, she had continued to pursue the matter. However, Allman's legal team successfully demonstrated that he was capable of managing his finances and maintaining sobriety.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In rejecting the temporary conservatorship bids, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Jessica Uzcategui said Mr Allman had proven he had "managed his finances" and "remained drug-free".<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reacting to the incident of an alleged assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump, billionaire Elon Musk questioned why is no one trying to assassinate President Joe Biden and Democratic presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump was the target of an alleged assassination attempt on Sunday in Florida, the FBI said, with the Republican presidential candidate's campaign and law enforcement reporting he was safe and unharmed.</p>

<p>The US Secret Service confirmed one or more of its agents "opened fire on a gunman" located near the boundary of Trump's golf course, and that an "AK-47 style rifle" with a scope was recovered along with a GoPro video camera.</p>

<p>Responding to a post on X which read, "Why they want to kill Donald Trump?", Musk wrote: "And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala."&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala ? <a href="https://t.co/ANQJj4hNgW">https://t.co/ANQJj4hNgW</a></p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1835478980830572884?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>The Tesla and SpaceX chief is an open supporter of Trump as the latter is set to go head-to-head with Vice President Harris in the upcoming US Presidential elections in November.</p>

<p>According to authorities, there is still no confirmation whether the gunman, identified as Ryan Wesley Routh, fired a weapon in the direction of the former president but Secret Service agents did fire on the suspect who was hiding in the bushes at the golf course.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are not sure right now if the individual was able to take a shot at our agents," said Rafael Barros, of the Secret Service, as quoted by news agency AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The FBIsaid it is "investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination of former President Trump."</p>

<p>Officials praised the quick action of the Secret Service, an agency which has been under intense scrutiny since its apparent failure to detect and stop a gunman from shooting at Trump in Pennsylvania.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Mr Isaacman conducted the first commercial "spacewalk" hundreds of miles above the surface of the Earth.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jared Isaacman, a former high school dropout living in his parents' basement in New Jersey, has achieved remarkable success as a tech billionaire and space tourist. His journey from humble beginnings to becoming a pioneer in space exploration is nothing short of extraordinary.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Mr. Isaacman and SpaceX engineer Sarah Gillis briefly ventured into the vacuum of space to test the company's new spacesuits during the five-day Polaris Dawn mission. This marked the first time that nonprofessional astronauts from a private company performed a spacewalk.</p>

<p>"I decided I was going to go to space when I was 5 [years old]. I was pretty calculated about it at that point, it just took me a little while to get it into motion," Isaacman told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/13/how-civilian-astronaut-jared-isaacman-built-billion-dollar-business-shift4-payments.html" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>CNBC Make It</em></a> in 2021.</p>

<p>Isaacman's entrepreneurial spirit was evident from a young age. At 16, he dropped out of high school to found Shift4 Payments, a payment processing company. Despite facing initial challenges, his company quickly gained traction and became a leader in the industry.</p>

<p>To start his entrepreneurial journey, he used a $10,000 check from his grandfather as seed money and set up shop in his childhood home's basement. &nbsp;"$10,000, you know, you needed to build a couple of computers," Isaacman said. "That wasn't expensive. And, you needed some phones, and that was enough to get you going."</p>

<p>He shared with the media outlet that his first employees included his friend Brendan Lauber, who was Shift4's chief technology officer until last year, and Isaacman's dad, a salesman who had previously worked for a home security company.</p>

<p>His company has a market value of $7.4 billion and now has 2,000 employees across the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There's just no way, at that age, you could ever imagine" the company becoming worth billions of dollars, said Isaacman. "One of the best times at a startup is when you've got the eight people in the basement eating Chinese food and everybody kind of shares knowledge, and you share in your successes and failures together, and you learn together."</p>

<p>Shift4's success propelled Isaacman to billionaire status, and he has since made significant contributions to space exploration. He funded and led the first civilian mission to space aboard SpaceX's Dragon capsule, setting a record for the longest civilian spaceflight.</p>

<p>In 2009, Isaacman set a world record by flying a Cessna Citation CJ2 around the world in just under 62 hours- nearly 20 hours faster than the previous record holder. Three years later, he founded Draken International, a company that trains student pilots for the U.S. Air Force. In 2020, he sold the company to the investment firm Blackstone Group for "a nine-figure sum," as reported by Forbes.</p>

<p>Isaacman's passion for space exploration extends beyond his own personal achievements.</p>

<p>"As far as I'm concerned, I'm super lucky in life," Isaacman told <em>Bloomberg</em>, ahead of the spacewalk. "You know - teenage basement startup, just trying to buy pizza on the weekend, and it's turned into quite the empire."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump was the target of an apparent assassination attempt Sunday in Florida, the FBI said, with the Republican presidential candidate's campaign and law enforcement reporting he was safe and unharmed.</p>

<p>The US Secret Service confirmed one or more of its agents "opened fire on a gunman" located near the boundary of Trump's golf course, and that an "AK-47 style rifle" with a scope was recovered along with a GoPro video camera.</p>

<p>Amid the confrontation with the Secret Service, the suspect bolted out of the shrubbery he had been hiding in and escaped in a black car. A witness helped police identify the vehicle and authorities tracked it down.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We have somebody in custody right now that is a potential suspect," Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw told a news conference.</p>

<p>Trump had been golfing at his course in West Palm Beach, Florida, not far from his Mar-a-Lago residence, when the would-be shooter was spotted in bushes one hole ahead of the former president, Bradshaw said.</p>

<p>"President Trump is safe following gunshots in his vicinity," his campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement, while Democratic presidential hopeful Kamala Harris expressed relief her political rival was out of danger.</p>

<p>Trump himself said in a fundraising message on his website: "Fear not! I am safe and well, and no one was hurt. Thank God!"</p>

<p>The unnerving incident appears to mark the second time in as many months that Trump has been the target of an assassination attempt. The former president was wounded in the ear on July 13 as he addressed an outdoor rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.</p>

<h3><strong>Unsure if shot taken&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Authorities who addressed Sunday's news conference did not confirm whether a gunman actually fired a weapon in the direction of the former president, but said that shots were fired by the Secret Service.</p>

<p>"We are not sure right now if the individual was able to take a shot at our agents," said Rafael Barros, of the Secret Service.</p>

<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation said it is "investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination of former President Trump."</p>

<p>Officials praised the quick action of the Secret Service, an agency that has been under intense scrutiny since its apparent failure to detect and stop a gunman from shooting at Trump in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Sheriff Bradshaw said Secret Service personnel in Trump's protective detail spotted "this rifle barrel sticking out of the fence and immediately engaged that individual, at which time the individual took off."</p>

<p>He estimated the suspect was set up 300 to 500 yards (275 to 455 meters) away, but "with a rifle and a scope like that, that's not a long distance."</p>

<p>Sheriff William Snyder of neighbouring Martin County said on CNN that the potential suspect who was stopped and detained by law enforcement had "a relatively calm, flat effect. He was not displaying a lot of emotions."</p>

<h3><strong>'Relieved'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Law enforcement was launching a sweeping investigation but as of Sunday afternoon, there was no indication of the shooter's motive.</p>

<p>The incident came amid heightened tensions in the knife-edge presidential race and concern for the safety of both candidates.</p>

<p>"There is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country," President Joe Biden said in a statement.</p>

<p>"I have directed my team to continue to ensure that the Secret Service has every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to ensure the former president's continued safety."</p>

<p>Vice President Harris took to social media to say "I am glad he is safe."</p>

<p>Several Trump supporters and members of his inner circle, including his running mate J.D. Vance, offered their support and gratitude that tragedy was avoided.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I'm glad President Trump is safe," Vance said on X. "I spoke to him before the news was public and he was, amazingly, in good spirits."</p>

<p>The Secret Service, tasked with protecting presidents, former presidents and other dignitaries, has faced criticism since the Pennsylvania shooting.</p>

<p>Kimberly Cheatle, the head of the agency, resigned amid the ensuing scrutiny, and at least five agents were placed on administrative leave.</p>

<p>Representative Elise Stefanik, the fourth-ranking US House Republican, thanked law enforcement for their actions Sunday but raised questions about the latest incident.</p>

<p>"We must ask ourselves how an assassin was allowed to get this close to President Trump again," she said in a statement.</p>

<p>"There continues to be a lack of answers for the horrific assassination attempt in Pennsylvania and we expect there to be a clear explanation of what happened today in Florida."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump narrowly escaped an alleged assassination attempt on Sunday in Florida, according to the FBI. A 58-year-old suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, was arrested after Secret Service agents opened fire near the boundary of Trump's golf course. A high-powered AK-47-style rifle with a scope and a GoPro camera was recovered at the scene.</p>

<p>When Secret Service agents opened fire, Routh reportedly bolted out of the shrubbery he was hiding in and escaped in a black car. Authorities were able to track down the car after witnesses helped police identify it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We have somebody in custody right now that is a potential suspect," Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw told a press conference, as quoted by news agency AFP.</p>

<h3><strong>Who Is Ryan Wesley Routh?</strong></h3>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/us/politics/trump-shooting-suspect-routh.html?searchResultPosition=1">New York Times</a>, Routh is a former construction worker from North Carolina Greensboro. Routh had no formal military background but expressed strong desires to participate in armed conflict in the past, particularly in Ukraine after Russia's 2022 invasion. In one post on X, formerly known as Twitter, Routh declared his willingness to "fight and die" in Ukraine. He also advocated for civilians to change the course of global conflicts.</p>

<p>"I AM WILLING TO FLY TO KRAKOW AND GO TO THE BORDER OF UKRAINE TO VOLUNTEER AND FIGHT AND DIE," he wrote.</p>

<p>According to the New York Times, on the messaging application Signal, Routh wrote, "Civilians must change this war and prevent future wars" as part of his profile bio.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Each one of us must do our part daily in the smallest steps help support human rights, freedom and democracy; we each must help the Chinese," his bio on WhatsApp reads.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Routh's activities didn't stop at online declarations. In a 2023 interview with The New York Times, he claimed to have travelled to Ukraine to support the war effort and recruit Afghan soldiers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This wasn't Routh's first brush with violence. In 2002, he was arrested after barricading himself inside a building with a fully automatic weapon in Greensboro. The charges were serious, though the outcome of the case remains unclear.</p>

<h3><strong>Donald Trump "Safe"</strong></h3>

<p>"President Trump is safe following gunshots in his vicinity," his campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Fear not! I am safe and well, and no one was hurt. Thank God!" Trump himself said in a website fundraising message, as quoted by news agency AFP&nbsp;</p>

<p>The latest shooting incident comes weeks after Trump was the Target of another assassination attempt while addressing a rally in Pennsylvania. The would-be assassin fired a bullet from his sniper from a distance, which grazed the former US President's ear. The suspect was then shot dead by authorities.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The FBI is investigating what it said was another assassination attempt on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The incident occurred Sunday at the Trump International Golf Club West Palm Beach in Florida where Trump, the former president, was golfing.</p>

<p>Law enforcement officials said Secret Service saw a man with a rifle in the bushes and shot at the suspected assassin.</p>

<p>The suspect fled the bushes and was later apprehended on a highway, according to law enforcement.</p>

<h3><strong>PREVIOUS ATTEMPT ON TRUMP</strong></h3>

<p>In July, Trump was shot by a gunman during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania in what the FBI said was an attempted assassination. The former president was wounded in the ear.</p>

<p>The Congressional Research Service says direct assaults against presidents, presidents-elect, and candidates have occurred on at least 15 separate occasions, with five resulting in death.</p>

<p>Below is a list of other previous attempts on the lives of American leaders, successful or not.</p>

<h3><strong>ASSASSINATIONS</strong></h3>

<p>Four US presidents were assassinated while in office.</p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln: Killed in 1865 by John Wilkes Booth at Ford's Theatre in Washington.</p>

<p>James Garfield: Shot in 1881 in Washington at a train station and died of his wounds two and a half months later.</p>

<p>William McKinley: Assassinated in 1901 by an anarchist in Buffalo, New York.</p>

<p>John F Kennedy: Assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald in 1963 in Dallas, Texas, as the president rode in a motorcade.</p>

<h3><strong>LEADERS WHO SURVIVED ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS</strong></h3>

<p>Four presidents were wounded but survived assassination attempts, while in office or afterwards.</p>

<p>Donald Trump: Trump had just started a campaign speech in Pennsylvania on July 13 when shots rang out. Trump was shot in the ear. He was rushed by security officials to a black SUV.</p>

<p>Ronald Reagan: He was shot in 1981 outside the Hilton Hotel in Washington. Reagan was wounded when one of the bullets ricocheted off a limousine and struck him under the left armpit.</p>

<p>President Gerald Ford: Survived two attempts on his life in less than three weeks in 1975 without being hurt.</p>

<p>Theodore Roosevelt: He was shot in the chest in 1912 while campaigning for election in Milwaukee, but insisted on delivering his speech to supporters before being taken to a hospital.</p>

<h3><strong>ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS ON OTHER US LEADERS</strong></h3>

<p>Robert F. Kennedy: A US presidential candidate, and a US senator, Kennedy was assassinated in 1968 by a gunman in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Alabama Governor George C. Wallace: A candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, he was shot in 1972 and became paralysed from the waist down.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shots were fired from an AK-47-style rifle in former US President Donald Trump's vicinity on the grounds of his golf course in Palm Beach Florida, where he was present. The Republican candidate is "safe", his party campaign said.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris, US Vice President and Democratic Party's Presidential candidate said she has been "briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida. I am glad that he is safe." Ms Harris said, "Violence has no place in America."</p>

<p></p>

— Vice President Kamala Harris (@VP) <a href="https://twitter.com/VP/status/1835403813475570113?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>The US Secret Service, the organization responsible for protecting serving and former Presidents, accompanied Mr Trump - A protocol followed by the team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The motive behind the shooting is unclear, but still, it came almost two months after a failed assassination attempt against Mr Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, when a shooter, atop a roof, shot a 5.56mm bullet from an AR-15 style rifle, which grazed his ear and blood splattering on his face.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US Secret Service accepted that it had failed to protect the former president at an election rally in Pennsylvania on July 13.</p>

<p>The Secret Service takes full responsibility for the tragic events of July 13th. This was a mission failure. The sole responsibility of our agency is to make sure our protectees are never put in danger. We fell short of that in Butler. And I'm working to make sure that this failure does not happen again," Acting Director of the US Secret Service, Ronald Rowe said.</p>

<p>Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will be up against each other in the closely contested presidential elections scheduled for November this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The incident in Florida comes days after the first Presidential debate between the rival candidates where Ms Harris "trumped" Donald Trump and a majority of debate watchers said Harris outperformed Trump, according to a CNN flash poll released shortly after the debate. YouGov showed 54% of those surveyed said Harris won while 31% said Trump was the victor.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump is safe following gunshots in his vicinity, the Republican presidential candidate's team said today. "President Trump is safe following gunshots in his vicinity. No further details at this time," campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said a statement.</p>

<p>The shooting took place at Trump's golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida. A "person of interest" has been detained along with a weapon, the New York Times reported, citing local law enforcement officials.</p>

<p>Trump had been golfing when the gunshots were heard, multiple media reports said. Trump had been accompanied at the time by his Secret Service protective detail when shots were fired.</p>

<p>It was unclear who the shooter or shooters were, or what the motive was. There was no immediate indication that Trump had been targeted.&nbsp; Media outlet CNN, citing security agency own sources, reported that officials believed the shots at the golf club were indeed intended for Trump.</p>

<p>The former US president's son Donald Trump Jr. said that authorities also found an AK-47 rifle in the bushes, extremely close to the spot from where Trump was leaving.</p>

<p>"Again folks! SHOTS FIRED at Trump Golf Course in West Palm Beach, Florida. An AK-47 was discovered in the bushes, per local law enforcement," he said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would inflict a "heavy price" on the Iran-aligned Houthis who control northern Yemen, after they reached central Israel with a missile on Sunday for the first time.</p>

<p>Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said the group struck with a new hypersonic ballistic missile that travelled 2,040 km (1270 miles) in just 11 1/2 minutes.</p>

<p>After initially saying the missile had fallen in an open area, Israel's military later said it had probably fragmented in the air, and that pieces of interceptors had landed in fields and near a railway station. Nobody was reported hurt.</p>

<p>Air raid sirens had sounded in Tel Aviv and across central Israel moments before the impact at around 6:35 a.m. local time (0335 GMT), sending residents running for shelter. Loud booms were heard.</p>

<p>Reuters saw smoke billowing in an open field in central Israel.</p>

<p>At a weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu said the Houthis should have known that Israel would exact a "heavy price" for attacks on Israel.</p>

<p>"Whoever needs a reminder of that is invited to visit the Hodeida port," Netanyahu said, referring to an Israeli retaliatory air strike against Yemen in July for a Houthi drone that hit Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>The Houthis have fired missiles and drones at Israel repeatedly in what they say is solidarity with the Palestinians, since the Gaza war began with a Hamas attack on Israel in October.</p>

<p>The drone that hit Tel Aviv for the first time in July killed a man and wounded four people. Israeli air strikes in response on Houthi military targets near the port of Hodeidah killed six and wounded 80.</p>

<p>Previously, Houthi missiles have not penetrated deep into Israeli air space, with the only one reported to have hit Israeli territory falling in an open area near the Red Sea port of Eilat in March.</p>

<p>Israel should expect more strikes in the future "as we approach the first anniversary of the Oct. 7 operation, including responding to its aggression on the city of Hodeidah," Sarea said.</p>

<p>The deputy head of the Houthi's media office, Nasruddin Amer, said in a post on X on Sunday that the missile had reached Israel after "20 missiles failed to intercept" it, describing it as the "beginning".</p>

<p>The Israeli military also said that 40 projectiles were fired towards Israel from Lebanon on Sunday and were either intercepted or landed in open areas.</p>

<p>"No injuries were reported," the military said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A senior Hamas official told AFP on Sunday that the Palestinian Islamist movement had ample resources to continue fighting Israel despite losses sustained over more than 11 months of war in Gaza.</p>

<p>"The resistance has a high ability to continue," Osama Hamdan told AFP during an interview in Istanbul.</p>

<p>"There were martyrs and there were sacrifices... but in return there was an accumulation of experiences and the recruitment of new generations into the resistance."</p>

<p>His comments came less than a week after Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told journalists that Hamas, whose October 7 attack triggered the war, "no longer exists" as a military formation in Gaza.</p>

<p>"The number of casualties... is much less than what is expected in a battle of this size, level and breadth," Hamdan said on Sunday.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu launched retaliatory military operations to destroy Hamas after the group's surprise attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>The Israeli military campaign has killed at least 41,206 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not provide breakdowns of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>Militants also seized 251 hostages on October 7, 97 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Netanyahu is facing mounting domestic pressure to seal a deal in which hostages would be released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<p>Israel's announcement this month that the bodies of six hostages had been recovered from a tunnel in Gaza after they were "executed" by Hamas spurred an outpouring of grief and anger, leading to a brief general strike and large-scale demonstrations that continued in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem on Saturday night.</p>

<p>But months of negotiations aimed at securing a truce -- mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar -- have apparently stalled.</p>

<p>In the interview on Sunday, Hamdan said the United States, Israel's most important military backer, was not doing enough to force concessions from Netanyahu that would end the bloodshed.</p>

<p>"The American administration does not exert sufficient or appropriate pressure on the Israeli side," Hamdan said.</p>

<p>"Rather it is trying to justify the Israeli side's evasion of any commitment."</p>

<p>During two press conferences after officials announced the deaths of the six hostages earlier this month, Netanyahu said it was Hamas who refused to compromise and vowed "not to give in to pressure" on remaining sticking points.</p>

<p>He also said Israel's military campaign had killed "no less than 17,000" Hamas militants.</p>

<p><strong>Israel 'not immune'</strong></p>

<p>The war between Israel and Iran-backed Hamas has drawn in other Iran-backed groups in the Middle East, notably Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Huthi rebels in Yemen.</p>

<p>On Sunday the Huthis claimed a missile attack on central Israel that, while producing no casualties, triggered a rush to shelters and added to regional tensions.</p>

<p>Hamdan said the attack showed the limits of Israel's ability to defend itself, including its oft-touted aerial defence system.</p>

<p>"It is a message to the entire region that Israel is not an immune entity," Hamdan said.</p>

<p>"Even Israeli capabilities have limits."</p>

<p>Hamdan also reiterated Hamas's view that an attack earlier this month in which a Jordanian truck driver shot dead three Israeli guards at a border crossing underscored widespread anger at Israel in the region.</p>

<p>As for Arab leaders who have normalised diplomatic ties with Israel or are considering doing so, Hamdan said they should ask themselves how they would feel if their countries were occupied and the world stood by and watched.</p>

<p>"If you see Israel as a blessing and a gain... give them a piece of your country," he said, jokingly adding that it could be called "the new Israel".</p>

<p><strong>'Day after' planning</strong></p>

<p>Hamas has ruled Gaza since 2007, but with Israel calling for the group to be eliminated it is unclear what form it will exist in after the war.</p>

<p>Hamdan said on Sunday it was impossible to imagine a scenario in which Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar would leave the besieged territory.</p>

<p>Sinwar and other leaders "are ready to be martyred thousands of times in Palestine rather than leaving it because everything he is doing is to free Palestine," Hamdan said.</p>

<p>Hamas has demanded a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, including the Philadelphi corridor, a narrow strip of land along Egypt's border that has emerged as a key sticking point in the truce talks.</p>

<p>Hamdan said that Hamas wants "joint Palestinian rule" in Gaza, adding that Hamas officials and representatives of other Palestinian factions would meet soon in Cairo to discuss their post-war vision.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The post came as a surprise, even from the provocative Donald Trump: "I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!" the former president said on his social media platform Truth Social on Sunday.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="The post was made at 8:14 pm." id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/8h11i18_donald-trump-taylor-swift_625x300_15_September_24.jpg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="The post was made at 8:14 pm." /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">The post was made at 8:14 pm.</p>
</div>

<p>Though the all-caps post came without accompanying commentary or explanation, the context was clear.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, just minutes after a debate with Vice President Kamala Harris that Republican Trump was widely seen as losing, the superstar singer/songwriter posted a message on Instagram saying she would be voting for his Democratic rival, calling Harris a "steady-handed, gifted leader."</p>

<p>Celebrity endorsements rarely carry enormous weight, but the hugely popular Swift is seen as being in a class of her own, with more than 100 million followers on social-media -- 10 million of whom "liked" her Instagram post.</p>

<p>"Going after Taylor Swift is a genuinely bad campaign strategy," said one poster on social media platform X. "Taylor doesn't get mad, she gets even."</p>

<p>It was not clear what Trump hoped to gain by attacking Swift, though he may calculate that any publicity is better than none.</p>

<p>He has been criticized, even by fellow Republicans, for his recent association with conspiracy-minded right-wing influencer Laura Loomer, who has at times joined him on his campaign plane.</p>

<p>The 31-year-old Loomer -- who has called the Sept. 11 terror attacks an "inside job" and said some recent mass shootings were staged by Democrats -- recently suggested that Swift had entered an "arranged relationship" with football star Travis Kelce "to influence the 2024 election."</p>

<p>There is no evidence to support any of those claims.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The former CEO of American fashion brand Abercrombie &amp; Fitch is facing fresh allegations of abuse at sex events across the world, according to a BBC investigation.</p>

<p>A BBC Panorama investigation in October last year had first revealed claims that Mike Jeffries and his British partner Matthew Smith exploited young men between 2009 and 2015. A lawsuit was filed against Jeffries, Smith and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (A&amp;F) last year, alleging "international sex trafficking and abuse of prospective models". Eight more men have now come forward to the BBC.</p>

<p>A witness said he went to a sex event in Spain with Jeffries and his partner, believing it was a photoshoot, the report said. "It was like a movie set of an Abercrombie store," he told the BBC about the event in 2011. Then aged 20, he said he was offered a chance to feature in a company advert if he flew from his home in Los Angeles to Madrid to meet the CEO of A&amp;F.</p>

<p>The night before the event, he said he was paid EUR 3,500 in cash, which he believed was general spending money for his three-day stay in Madrid.</p>

<p>On the night of the event, he was guided to their hotel suite where he said Jeffries and his partner Smith immediately started touching him and Jeffries forcibly kissed him. The former Abercrombie chief then performed oral sex on him, he said as per the BBC.</p>

<p>"I tried to say no repeatedly. And then I just got kind of convinced to do something. But I constantly was saying no, and I wanted to go," he told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9l9dlgpmno" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">the BBC</a>.</p>

<p>A middleman, who worked as a talent scout and executive assistant for Jeffries, offered him the opportunity, he added.</p>

<p>According to multiple witnesses, young men were also injected with liquid viagra by Jeffries' assistants. One man told the BBC that he felt he was "going to die" after one of these injections caused an extreme reaction during an event in New York at Jeffries' home. He said he felt hot and dizzy but nobody called an ambulance.</p>

<p>A middleman linked to the events denied any wrongdoing, adding that men participated "with their eyes wide open".<br />
In the aftermath of the BBC's report, the FBI had reportedly launched an investigation into the claims. But enforcement officials have declined to comment.</p>

<p>Jeffries, 80, who was the CEO of A&amp;F from 1992 to 2014, has denied all allegations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The top commanders of the Indian Navy will hold a meeting to review the security situation in and around the country from Tuesday amid growing instability in the region.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The regime change in Bangladesh and an increasing influence of extremist radical groups there is one of the emerging security concerns that is expected to come up for discussion at the meeting. Another key concern is growing Chinese activities and military support to Pakistan.</p>

<p>The meeting will be held in the new Naval Headquarters in Delhi from September 17 for four days, defence officials said according to news agency ANI. It will be the first conference since Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi took over as the Chief of Naval Staff in April this year.</p>

<p>The announcement comes after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh's recent call to the defence forces to be ready for the unexpected at the Joint Commanders' Conference in Lucknow.</p>

<p>Creation of new theatre commands will also be taken up for discussion at the meeting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Admiral has instructed all commanders to maintain high operational preparedness at all times.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Navy will also review its operations in the Gulf of Aden, where it achieved a lot of success against pirates and drone attacks early this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The force holds its commander's conference twice a year, where all senior officers give their inputs and presentations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India on Sunday sent urgent relief materials to Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam under an operation christened 'Sadbhav' to assist them in dealing with the impact of a major typhoon.</p>

<p>Various parts of Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam have been reeling under massive floods after Typhoon Yagi, said to be Asia's most powerful storm this year, hit the three countries.</p>

<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said 10 tonnes of aid including dry ration, clothing and medicines were dispatched to Myanmar onboard Indian naval ship INS Satpura.</p>

<p>A military transport aircraft of the Indian Air Force is carrying 35 tonnes of aid to Vietnam and 10 tonnes of relief materials to Laos.</p>

<p>"India launches #OperationSadbhav. Demonstrating our solidarity with the people affected by Typhoon Yagi, India is dispatching aid to Myanmar, Vietnam and Laos," Jaishankar said on 'X'.</p>

<p>"10 tons of aid including dry ration, clothing and medicines left for Myanmar onboard @indiannavy INS Satpura today," he said.</p>

<p>Jaishankar added: "@IAF_MCC is carrying 35 tons of aid comprising of water purification items, water containers, blankets, kitchen utensils, solar lanterns for Vietnam." "10 tons of aid comprising genset, water purification items, hygiene supplies, mosquito nets, blankets and sleeping bags for Laos," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[She confirmed the tooth wasn't from anyone in her family and immediately reported the incident to the police.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sam's Club, a US-based supermarket chain, is facing investigation after a shocking discovery in one of its China branches. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3278480/woman-finds-human-tooth-mooncake-us-supermarket-china-leading-police-probe">South China Morning Post</a></em>, a customer was left stunned after she found a human tooth in a meat-filled mooncake purchased from the Changzhou location in Jiangsu province. A video posted on Douyin by the woman shows the unsettling find in the 30-yuan ($4) pastry.&nbsp;The disturbing footage shows a hand holding a suspected human molar, covered in meat filling, on a piece of tissue paper next to a partially consumed mooncake.&nbsp;She confirmed the tooth wasn't from anyone in her family and immediately reported the incident to the police.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''My family ate this just now... Look at what they ate. It's terrifying,'' a voice can be heard saying.</p>

<p>Sam's Club has now launched an investigation into the disturbing discovery, while the mooncake manufacturer has denied any possibility of contamination. Speaking to Hongxing News, spokesperson Liu insisted it's ''impossible'' for a tooth to be mixed into the meat filling.</p>

<p>Liu explained that the manufacturing process involves mincing meat, which is then scanned by X-ray machines designed to detect bone fragments. He emphasised that the company has a decade-long track record of incident-free production.&nbsp;The manufacturer has also handed over surveillance footage for review by Sam's Club and the Changzhou market regulatory department.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Online reactions ranged from disgust to dark humour, with one user joking, ''Mooncake: now with meat and a side of calcium!''</p>

<p>However, another user offered an alternative explanation, suggesting the customer double-check if a family member unknowingly lost a tooth. He wrote, ''It's possible to lose part of a tooth without feeling any pain, so they might not even realize it's missing.''</p>

<p>Sam's Club has faced food safety concerns in China before. In 2022, a woman from Fujian province alleged that her uncle discovered three artificial human teeth inside Swiss rolls bought from a Sam's Club store. The uncle reportedly broke his teeth after biting into the product. Although the store promised an investigation, no definitive findings were ever made public.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eight migrants died early Sunday when their overcrowded vessel capsized while trying to cross the Channel from France to England, French authorities said, less than two weeks after the deadliest such disaster this year. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The French and British governments have sought for years to stop the flow of migrants, who pay smugglers thousands of euros per head for the passage to England from France aboard small boats.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A police source told AFP the accident occurred shortly after the boat embarked.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Regional prefect Jacques Billant is set to hold a news conference at 10:00 am (0800 GMT), his office said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Maritime authorities said Saturday that numerous attempts by migrants to make the perilous crossing in small boats have been attempted in recent days, with 200 people rescued in 24 hours over Friday and Saturday alone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At least 12 migrants, mostly from Eritrea, died off the northern French coast when their boat carrying dozens of people capsized this month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was the deadliest such disaster this year, and brought to 37 the number of migrant deaths in the Channel, up from 12 in 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More than 22,000 migrants have arrived in England by crossing the Channel since the beginning of this year, according to British officials.&nbsp;</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and France's President Emmanuel Macron pledged this summer to strengthen "cooperation" in handling the surge in undocumented migrant numbers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Channel crossings often prove perilous, and in November 2021, 27 migrants died when their boat capsized in the deadliest single such disaster to date.&nbsp;</p>

<p>French authorities seek to stop migrants taking to the water but do not intervene once they are afloat except for rescue purposes, citing safety concerns.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The SpaceX Polaris Dawn mission, which made history when its crew conducted the first spacewalk by non-government astronauts, splashed down off the coast of Florida early Sunday.</p>

<p>The Dragon spacecraft landed in the ocean at 3:37 am (0737 GMT), a webcast of the splashdown showed, with a recovery team deploying in the pre-dawn darkness to retrieve the capsule and crew.</p>

<p>The four-member team led by fintech billionaire Jared Isaacman launched Tuesday from the Kennedy Space Center, quickly journeying deeper into the cosmos than any humans in the past half century as they ventured into the dangerous Van Allen radiation belt.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

— SpaceX (@SpaceX) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1835202095781495050?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>They hit a peak altitude of 870 miles (1,400 kilometres) -- more than three times higher than the International Space Station and the furthest humans had ever travelled from Earth since the Apollo missions to the Moon.</p>

<p>Then on Thursday, with their Dragon spacecraft's orbit brought down to 434 miles, Isaacman swung open the hatch and climbed out into the void, gripping a structure called "Skywalker" as a breathtaking view of Earth unfolded before him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"SpaceX, back at home we all have a lot of work to do, but from here, Earth sure looks like a perfect world," he told mission control in Hawthorne, California, where teams erupted in applause.</p>

<p>He went back inside after a few minutes and was replaced by a second astronaut, SpaceX engineer Sarah Gillis, who, like Isaacman, performed a series of mobility tests on SpaceX's sleek, next-generation suits.</p>

<p>Since Dragon doesn't have an airlock, the entire crew were exposed to the vacuum of space. Mission pilot Scott Poteet and SpaceX engineer Anna Menon remained strapped in throughout as they monitored vital support systems.</p>

<p>It marked a "giant leap forward" for the commercial space industry, said NASA chief Bill Nelson, as well as another triumphant achievement for SpaceX.</p>

<p>Though the company was only founded in 2002, it has outpaced its legacy competitors thanks in large part to founder Elon Musk's vast fortune and zeal to begin the colonization of Mars.</p>

<h3><strong>Rousing violin solo&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Since completing their extravehicular activity, the crew have continued to carry out roughly 40 science experiments -- for example inserting endoscopic cameras through their noses and into their throats to image their airways and better understand the impact of long-duration space missions on human health.</p>

<p>They also demonstrated connectivity with SpaceX's Starlink internet satellite constellation by sending back to ground control a high-resolution video of Gillis playing "Rey's Theme" by "Star Wars" composer John Williams, on the violin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Polaris Dawn is the first of three missions under the Polaris program, a collaboration between Isaacman and SpaceX.</p>

<p>Financial terms of the partnership remain under wraps but Isaacman, the 41-year-old founder and CEO of Shift4 Payments, reportedly poured $200 million of his own money into leading the 2021 all-civilian SpaceX Inspiration4 orbital mission.</p>

<p>The final Polaris mission aims to be the first crewed flight of SpaceX's Starship, a prototype next-generation rocket that is key to Musk's interplanetary ambitions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How much influence can the world's richest man have over one of the world's oldest democracies? Next week's elections are not just about Donald Trump and Kamala Harris but also a measure of Elon Musk's influence on American democracy.</p>

<p>Although Musk has donated modestly to both Republicans and Democrats in the past, including $5,000 to Hillary Clinton in 2016, this time he has spent a whopping $119 million to mobilise Trump's supporters, and has been leveraging his social media platform, X, to spread pro-Trump propaganda. He's also an important presence in Trump's rallies in crucial battleground states, recently unveiling his “Dark gothic MAGA” side.</p>

<p>Musk's involvement has drawn scrutiny, particularly after he skipped a hearing related to a lawsuit over his efforts to give millions to registered voters - a move experts liken to vote buying.</p>

<p>He's also under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and has been reported to have regular communications with Russian President Vladimir Putin, raising national security concerns due to SpaceX's contracts with NASA and the Department of Defence.</p>

<p>Apart from being the eye of the storm when it comes to politics, business and foreign policy, he's now leading America PAC, a super PAC backing Trump's get-out-the-vote effort. Despite initial struggles, Musk brought in new consultants, and on paper, the numbers have improved. Still, Republican officials question the PAC's ground game effectiveness in critical states like Georgia.</p>

<p>Musk's frustration with his PAC has led him to bring in private sector associates like Steve Davis of the Boring company. Moreover, his companies, particularly Tesla, face regulatory challenges, which could be alleviated if Trump wins.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump has told Fox News, “Elon has a lot of roles he could take.” The former president has even suggested Musk could play a role in his future administration, focusing on government efficiency - a move that raises significant conflict of interest concerns.</p>

<p>As the election approaches, Musk's influence and controversies will undoubtedly remain in the spotlight.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[A look at how American leadership has evolved through major historical events and societal changes over the past century]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>United States of America votes on November 5. The stage is set for the 2024 presidential election. The two major political parties - Democrats and Republicans - had nominated their candidates through a series of primaries and caucuses. On the Republican side, it is former President Donald Trump. His opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, emerged as the Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden chose not to seek re-election.</p>

<h2>As voters prepare to cast their ballots, let's look back at the US Presidents who have shaped the nation's history since 1900.</h2>

<h3><strong>William McKinley (1897-1901)</strong></h3>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/rn3e28o8_former-us-president-william-mckinley-18971901_625x300_02_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>William McKinley was the 25th President of the United States, holding office from March 4, 1897, until his assassination on September 14, 1901. During his presidency, he guided the nation to victory in the Spanish-American War of 1898 and implemented protective tariffs to strengthen American industry. During the 100-day Spanish-American War, the US defeated the Spanish fleet outside Santiago harbour in Cuba, captured Manila in the Philippines, and occupied Puerto Rico.</p>

<h3><strong>Theodore Roosevelt (1901-1909)</strong></h3>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/jk51blbg_former-us-president-theodore-roosevelt-19011909_625x300_02_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Following the assassination of President William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, at the age of 42, ascended to the presidency, becoming the 26th and youngest president in American history. Roosevelt infused the office with new energy and purpose, championing progressive reforms and asserting a strong foreign policy. Internationally, Roosevelt made a significant mark by mediating the Russo-Japanese War, earning him the Nobel Peace Prize and solidifying his reputation as a formidable leader.</p>

<h3><strong>William Howard Taft (1909-1913)</strong></h3>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/car3td8s_former-us-president-william-howard-taft-19091913_625x300_02_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>William Howard Taft was elected as the 27th President of the United States, serving from 1909 to 1913. After his presidency, he became the 10th Chief Justice of the United States, holding that position from 1921 to 1930. Taft remains the only individual to have served in both of these significant roles.</p>

<h3><strong>Woodrow Wilson (1913-1921)</strong></h3>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/n1brkc9c_former-us-president-woodrow-wilson-19131921_625x300_02_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Woodrow Wilson, a prominent figure in the Progressive Movement, served as the 28th President of the United States. Initially advocating for a policy of neutrality at the onset of World War I, Wilson later made the decision to lead America into the conflict to "make the world safe for democracy." His leadership during the war and his vision for a post-war order, including the establishment of the League of Nations, marked significant developments in both domestic and international politics.</p>

<h3><strong>Warren G. Harding (1921-1923)</strong></h3>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/m4dmg4f_former-us-president-warren-g-harding-19211923_625x300_02_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Warren G. Harding, an Ohio Republican, served as the 29th President of the United States from 1921 until his death in 1923. While his presidency was marred by significant scandals, most notably the Teapot Dome affair, Harding also championed technological advancements and demonstrated a sensitivity to the challenges faced by minorities and women. His administration aimed for a return to normalcy after World War I, seeking to promote economic stability and growth during a transformative era in American history.</p>

<h3><strong>Calvin Coolidge (1923-1929)</strong></h3>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/mhepj7cc_former-us-president-calvin-coolidge-19231929_625x300_02_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>As the 30th President of the United States, Calvin Coolidge was resolute in his commitment to upholding traditional values of frugality and restraint during a period of substantial material prosperity that many Americans experienced in the 1920s.</p>

<h3><strong>Herbert Hoover (1929-1933)</strong></h3>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/undljb94_former-us-president-herbert-hoover-19291933_625x300_02_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Herbert Hoover's time in office aligned with the beginning of the Great Depression. His opponents in Congress, who he believed were undermining his efforts for their political gain, portrayed him as a callous and uncaring leader. As economic hardships deepened, Hoover became a scapegoat for the nation's struggles, ultimately leading to a significant defeat in the 1932 election.</p>

<h3><strong>Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933-1945)</strong></h3>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/752rn2uo_former-us-president-franklin-d-roosevelt-19331945_625x300_02_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Franklin D Roosevelt remains one of the most iconic presidents in US history. Assuming the presidency at the height of the Great Depression, Roosevelt worked tirelessly to restore the American people's faith in themselves and their government. He offered hope through his promise of prompt and vigorous action, famously declaring once, "the only thing we have to fear is fear itself." His leadership during World War II solidified America's status as a global superpower. As World War II neared its conclusion, Franklin D Roosevelt's health began to decline. On April 12, 1945, while at Warm Springs, Georgia, he passed away from a cerebral haemorrhage.</p>

<h3><strong>Harry S. Truman (1945-1953)</strong></h3>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/3ttunu5_former-us-president-harry-s-truman-19451953_625x300_02_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>After becoming President, Truman faced some of history's most critical decisions. Shortly after Victory in Europe (V-E) Day, the war against Japan was nearing its end. An urgent appeal for Japan to surrender was met with rejection. After consulting with his advisers, Truman made the decisive choice to drop atomic bombs on cities engaged in war production, specifically Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This prompted Japan's surrender, bringing World War II to an end.</p>

<h3><strong>Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953-1961)</strong></h3>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/cq71pe3k_former-us-president-dwight-d-eisenhower-19531961_625x300_02_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Eisenhower, a decorated World War II general, presided over a period of post-war prosperity. Bringing the prestige of a commanding general who led victorious forces in Europe during World War II, Eisenhower secured a truce in Korea and worked throughout his two terms to ease Cold War tensions. He championed moderate policies under the banner of "Modern Republicanism."</p>

<h3><strong>John F. Kennedy (1961-1963)</strong></h3>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/b9h00hu4_former-us-president-john-f-kennedy-19611963_625x300_02_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>John F. Kennedy was the 35th President of the United States and the youngest ever elected to the office. Tragically, on November 22, 1963, just over a 1,000 days into his presidency, JFK was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, making him the youngest president to die in office. His administration is remembered for significant events and initiatives, including the Cuban Missile Crisis and the establishment of the Peace Corps.</p>

<h3><strong>Lyndon B. Johnson (1963-1969)</strong></h3>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/i11aqcfg_former-us-president-lyndon-b-johnson-19631969_625x300_02_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Under Lyndon B. Johnson's leadership, the nation made remarkable strides in space exploration. During the Vietnam War, despite Johnson's efforts to curb Communist aggression and negotiate a settlement, the fighting persisted. By the end of March 1968, the controversy surrounding the war had intensified, leading him to limit the bombing of North Vietnam to initiate peace negotiations.</p>

<h3><strong>Richard Nixon (1969-1974)</strong></h3>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/c0o3srqg_former-us-president-richard-nixon-19691974_625x300_02_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Richard Nixon was elected as the 37th President of the United States after previously holding positions as a US Representative and a Senator from California. He achieved significant milestones, including the withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam and enhancing diplomatic relations with the USSR and China. He ultimately became the first President in history to resign from office due to the Watergate scandal.</p>

<h3><strong>Gerald Ford (1974-1977)</strong></h3>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/ll3beh4g_former-us-president-gerald-ford-19741977_625x300_02_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Gerald Ford assumed the presidency following Nixon's resignation, taking on the immense challenge of restoring public trust in the government. He was the first Vice President selected under the provisions of the Twenty-fifth Amendment and succeeded the first President to ever resign from office amid the Watergate scandal. Ford faced formidable tasks, including tackling inflation, revitalising a struggling economy, addressing chronic energy shortages and striving to maintain world peace.</p>

<h3><strong>Jimmy Carter (1977-1981)</strong></h3>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/7mu0762_former-us-president-jimmy-carter-19771981_625x300_02_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Jimmy Carter's presidency is noted for his focus on human rights and environmental issues. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his efforts to resolve international conflicts through peaceful means, promote democracy and human rights and support economic and social development.</p>

<h3><strong>Ronald Reagan (1981-1989)</strong></h3>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/lak4ti28_former-us-president-ronald-reagan-19811989_625x300_02_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Ronald Reagan, a former actor, served as the 40th President of the United States. His presidency marked a period of economic recovery and prosperity domestically, accompanied by a foreign policy aimed at achieving "peace through strength." Reagan's administration focused on reducing government spending, tax cuts, and strengthening the military, which he believed would strengthen America's position on the global stage.</p>

<h3><strong>George H.W. Bush (1989-1993)</strong></h3>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/issbaclk_former-us-president-george-hw-bush-19891993_625x300_02_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>George H.W. Bush's presidency was characterised by key foreign policy successes, particularly the Gulf War, which liberated Kuwait from Iraqi occupation. His biggest challenge arose when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and threatened Saudi Arabia. In response, Bush rallied the United Nations and mobilised American troops, supported by allies. After weeks of air strikes, the ground offensive - Operation Desert Storm - defeated Iraq's million-man army in just 100 hours. This victory initially boosted Bush's popularity. However, back home, economic troubles, rising violence in inner cities and high deficit spending eroded his support.</p>

<h3><strong>Bill Clinton (1993-2001)</strong></h3>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/5jnl25dg_former-us-president-bill-clinton-19932001_625x300_02_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Bill Clinton served as the 42nd President of the United States, stepping into office at the conclusion of the Cold War. As the first president from the baby boomer generation, he represented a shift in American leadership. However, his presidency faced significant turmoil. In 1998, Clinton became the second US president to be impeached by the House of Representatives due to controversies surrounding personal indiscretions with a young White House intern. The Senate, however, voted to acquit Clinton saving his presidency.</p>

<h3><strong>George W. Bush (2001-2009)</strong></h3>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/gneiue84_former-us-president-george-w-bush-20012009_625x300_02_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>George W. Bush, the 43rd President of the United States, became a wartime leader in the wake of the devastating terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. This event reshaped Bush's presidency, forcing him to set aside many of his initial hopes and plans. His father, George H.W. Bush, the 41st president, remarked that his son was "facing the greatest challenge of any president since Abraham Lincoln."</p>

<h3><strong>Barack Obama (2009-2017)</strong></h3>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/r2hn4bn8_former-us-president-barack-obama-20092017_625x300_02_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Barack Obama served as the 44th President of the United States, embodying the essence of the American dream. His journey reflects core American values: a middle-class upbringing rooted in a supportive family, the belief in hard work and education as pathways to success, and a deep conviction that a fortunate life should be dedicated to serving others.</p>

<h3><strong>Donald Trump (2017-2021)</strong></h3>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/f9t5t5ag_former-us-president-donald-trump-20172021_625x300_02_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Trump, a businessman, brought a disruptive and unconventional style to the presidency. His administration was marked by tax cuts, deregulation and a focus on America-first policies. His handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent economic challenges defined much of his final year in office. His refusal to accept the 2020 election results culminated in the January 6 Capitol attack.</p>

<h3><strong>Joe Biden (2021-Present)</strong></h3>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/nu2tlst_former-us-president-joe-biden-20212025_625x300_02_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Biden's presidency has focused on navigating the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic recovery and addressing social inequalities. His administration passed the American Rescue Plan and launched initiatives to improve infrastructure and climate resilience. Biden also oversaw the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, ending a 20-year war.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump is taking a bold move in the final days of his presidential campaign by visiting New Mexico and Virginia, two states that have historically been difficult for Republican candidates to win.</p>

<p>The former president campaigned in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on Thursday and was scheduled to visit Salem, Virginia, on Saturday, in an effort to gain momentum and potentially turn these states red.</p>

<p>Trump's team is optimistic about his chances, citing early voting numbers and the possibility of sweeping swing states Nevada and Arizona. However, this strategy carries significant risk, as neither New Mexico nor Virginia has been carried by a GOP nominee since George W. Bush in 2004.</p>

<p>The battleground states have received significant attention since the past few weeks, with billboards, smartphones, televisions bombarding them with political ads. The candidates - presidential and vice-presidential candidates have made 21 appearances in Pennsylvania, 17 in Michigan and 13 in North Carolina since the past two weeks.</p>

<p>Trump's visit to Albuquerque brings attention to his immigration stance in a border state with the nation's highest concentration of Latino voters. About 44% of New Mexico's voting-age population identifies as Hispanic, and the state has been dealing with a surge in migrant deaths along the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>

<p>"If we could bring God down from heaven, he could be the vote counter and we could win this," Trump said. He also added that he's visiting New Mexico because it's "good for my credentials" with Latino voters.</p>

<p>Virginia was once considered a battleground state but has trended toward Democrats in recent years. Trump lost the state to Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020. Despite this, Trump believes he has a "real chance" of winning, and his visit may focus on the recent Supreme Court ruling on voter registrations.</p>

<p>Democratic strategist Bob Shrum questions Trump's strategy, stating, "I don't think there's any strategy... I think he insisted on doing it. It makes no sense". Meanwhile, Virginia's Governor Glenn Youngkin believes the state is more competitive than expected.</p>

<p>Susan Swecker,&nbsp;Chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Virginia, holds the opinion that this visit will only make it harder for Trump to gain votes. "Kamala Harris will win Virginia convincingly, as he knows, and any visit from this deranged lunatic will only widen the margin," she said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A young woman stripped to her underwear at an Iranian university on Saturday in an apparent protest against the country's strict Islamic dress code, according to online videos and media reports.</p>

<p>A video posted on social media showed security guards at a branch of the Islamic Azad University detaining the unidentified woman. University spokesperson Amir Mahjob said on X that "at the police station,...it was found that she was under severe mental pressure and had a mental disorder".</p>

<p>But some social media users suggested the woman's action was a deliberate protest.</p>

<p>"For most women, being ...in their underwear in public is one of their worst nightmares, ... This is a reaction to the (authorities') stupid insistence on the mandatory hijab," Lei La, a user on X, said in a comment accompanying the video.</p>

<p>The fate of the woman was not known but the mass-circulation daily Hamshahri said on its website: "An informed source said...the perpetrator of this act has severe mental problems and, after investigations, she will most likely be transferred to a mental hospital."</p>

<p>Growing numbers of women have defied authorities by discarding their veils after nationwide protests that followed the death in September 2022 of a young Iranian Kurdish woman in the custody of the morality police for allegedly violating hijab rules. Security forces violently put down the revolt.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday emphasised that friendships are no longer exclusive, especially in the emerging multipolar world, adding that some global partners might be more complicated than others in the world as they might not always share the "same culture of mutual respect or ethos of diplomatic etiquette."</p>

<p>At a book launch event in New Delhi, Mr Jaishankar pointed out that what is perceived as freedom by one nation can be viewed as interference by another and emphasised that sensibilities regarding sovereignty and territorial integrity remain crucial in evaluating international partnerships.</p>

<p>"Some friends may also be more complicated than others. They may not always share the same culture of mutual respect or ethos of diplomatic etiquette. We have, from time to time, seen comments on our domestic issues... However, the same courtesies are rarely accorded to the other side. What is freedom for one can apparently become interference from the other. The fact is that sensitivities like sovereignty and territorial integrity will always be a factor in evaluating partners," Mr Jaishankar said.</p>

<p>The minister underlined that New Delhi seeks to be friends with as many countries as possible while positioning itself as a global friend. He said that India's positioning as a <em>"Vishwamitra"</em> is aimed at cultivating friendships across the globe. He explained that there were cultural and historical factors to develop such friendships, including the fact that India was not a "dogmatic civilisation."</p>

<p>He added that India's capability contributes to its self-confidence in engaging with the world and highlighted three transformations under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar referenced the benefits the US, Japan, and Australia have gained from the Quad partnership, suggesting that these nations have navigated historical hesitations. He also mentioned the evolving comprehensive relationships with the UAE and Israel, stating that much of the credit for all these changes in the last decade goes to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's personal interest and leadership.</p>

<p>"India is today positioning itself as a Vishwamitra. We seek to be friends with as many as possible... If you look deeper, there are cultural and historical factors at work as well, including the fact that we are not a dogmatic civilization. There is a capability aspect as well, which accounts for the self-confidence with which we approach the world... The US, Japan, and Australia have benefitted from the Quad. They are examples of overcoming the hesitations of history. UAE and Israel are from a region that is being engaged comprehensively at last. Russia and France are statements of multipolarity, ours as much as theirs," he said.</p>

<p>"If all these types have changed so much in the last decade, I'm sure you would agree with me that much of the credit should go to PM Modi for his personal interest and leadership. Because, remember, at least three of them had not even seen a high-level visit for three decades. In other cases, there was either pressure on us to limit our interaction or, in a few cases, longstanding ideological doubts to overcome," he added.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar was speaking at a book launch, "Friends: India's Closest Strategic Partners" by Sreeram Chaulia at the Silver Oak, India Habitat Centre.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Kamala Devi Harris was born on October 20, 1964, in Oakland, California, to immigrant parents.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Kamala Harris has cemented her place as a pioneer in American politics acheiveing many firsts in her inspiring journey - first woman, African-American, South Asian and person of Indian origin to hold the office of US Vice President. From her early days as a student leader to her current role as the Democratic presidential nominee, following Joe Biden's endorsement after his withdrawal from the 2024 race, here is a detailed look at her journey.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Kamala Harris: Age and Early Life</strong></h2>

<p dir="ltr">Kamala Devi Harris was born on October 20, 1964, in Oakland, California, to immigrant parents. She is 60.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Kamala Harris grew up in a multicultural environment, influenced by both her African American and Indian heritage. Raised in the diverse Bay Area, Kamala Harris experienced different cultures and communities firsthand, which significantly shaped her worldview and political outlook.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Her mother, <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/shyamala-gopalan-harris-all-about-kamala-harris-mother-who-grew-up-in-india-and-moved-to-us-6398700">Shyamala Gopalan</a>, was a renowned breast cancer researcher from Chennai who emigrated to the US in the 1960s to pursue a PhD at the University of California, Berkeley. Her father, Donald Harris, originally from Jamaica, is an esteemed economist and professor emeritus at Stanford University. Both parents were active in civil rights movements, and their dedication to social justice had a profound influence on Harris's personal and professional life.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Though her parents divorced when she was young, Harris maintained strong ties to both her Jamaican and Indian roots. She often speaks fondly of her summer trips to India, where she was deeply influenced by her maternal grandfather, a retired civil servant and her visits to her grandmother, who advocated for women's rights in her community.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Kamala Harris: Family and Personal Life</strong></h2>

<p dir="ltr">In 2014, Kamala Harris married Doug Emhoff, a lawyer, making him the first-ever Second Gentleman of the United States when Harris became Vice President. Emhoff's two children from his previous marriage, Cole and Ella, have embraced Harris as their stepmother, affectionately referring to her as “Momala.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Kamala Harris also has a younger sister, Maya Harris, who is a public policy advocate and lawyer. Maya played a significant role in Kamala's political campaigns.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Kamala Harris: Education and Legal Career</strong></h2>

<p dir="ltr">Kamala Harris earned her undergraduate degree from Howard University, where she majored in political science and economics. Afterward, she attended UC Hastings College of the Law, where she obtained her Juris Doctor in 1989.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Her legal career began with a position in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office as a prosecutor. Here, she focused on cases involving violent crime, particularly sexual assault and child abuse. Kamala Harris's rise in the legal world was swift. In 2003, she was elected as the District Attorney of San Francisco, making her the first woman and first African American to hold the position. During her tenure, she introduced several progressive reforms, including a reentry program aimed at reducing recidivism and increasing opportunities for offenders to reintegrate into society.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In 2011, Harris was elected as California's Attorney General, as the first woman and person of colour to hold the position. As AG, Kamala Harris took on major issues like environmental protection, consumer rights and marriage equality, while also contending with criticism over her stance on law enforcement policies.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Kamala Harris: Political Career</strong></h2>

<p dir="ltr">Kamala Harris's political ascent continued when she was elected as the US Senator from California in 2016, succeeding Barbara Boxer. Her time in the Senate gained national attention when, during high-profile hearings, she questioned key figures like then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.</p>

<p dir="ltr">During her Senate term, Kamala Harris worked on critical issues, including immigration reform, healthcare, criminal justice reform and civil rights. She was a strong advocate for the DREAM Act, aimed at protecting young immigrants, and also co-sponsored legislation addressing the opioid epidemic and climate change.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In 2019, Harris launched her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Although her campaign ended before the primaries, her impact on the political stage was undeniable. In August 2020, Harris was chosen by Joe Biden as his running mate, making history as the first woman of South Asian and African American descent to be nominated for Vice President by a major political party.</p>

<p dir="ltr">On January 20, 2021, Kamala Harris was sworn in as the 49th Vice President of the United States, making history once again as the highest-ranking female official in US history. Her vice presidency is marked by her leadership on issues such as economic recovery, voting rights and foreign policy, and she has emerged as a key figure in the Biden administration's efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic and rebuild the economy.</p>

<p dir="ltr">For the 2024 US presidential election, Kamala Harris is the Democratic presidential nominee, with Tim Walz as her running mate. They are going head-to-head against Republican candidate Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Kamala Harris: Net Worth</strong></h2>

<p dir="ltr">Kamala Harris's net worth is estimated to be around $8 million, combined with her husband Douglas Emhoff's assets, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kylemullins/2024/05/26/heres-how-much-kamala-harris-is-worth/" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">Forbes</a>. This amount is up from $7 million in 2021 and is roughly 20 times the median net worth of Americans in their age bracket.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Kamala Harris has also authored two books – ‘Smart on Crime', a reflection of her criminal justice philosophy, and ‘The Truths We Hold', a memoir recounting her life experiences and political journey – which have contributed to her financial standing.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Kamala Harris: Honours and Recognition</strong></h2>

<p dir="ltr">Throughout her career, Kamala Harris has received numerous accolades for her contributions to public service and social justice. She was named in Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People multiple times.</p>

<p dir="ltr">She has been honoured by organisations such as the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People), political action committee EMILY's List and The National Women's Hall of Fame for her work in civil rights, women's empowerment and public policy.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Kamala Harris has also received honorary doctorates from institutions like University of Southern California and Howard University in recognition of her achievements.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Conservative Party of the UK elected Kemi Badenoch as the new leader of the party on Saturday (local time), Euro News reported. It was a historic moment in the political scene of the UK as she became the first Black woman to lead a major political party there.</p>

<p>Kemi Badenoch succeeds former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, whose leadership saw the Conservatives experience their worst electoral performance since 1832 in the recently held General Elections, where Keir Starmer won from the Labour Party.</p>

<p>Under Rishi Sunak, the party lost over 200 seats, leaving it with just 121 in the House of Commons.</p>

<p>She won against Robert Jenrick in a vote that included nearly 100,000 party members, taking charge as the Conservatives sought to recover from a significant election defeat that ended their 14 years in power, Euro News reported.</p>

<p>The new leader faces the daunting challenge of restoring the party's reputation amid ongoing division, scandal, and economic instability. Kemi Badenoch will need to effectively critique the policies of Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer, particularly on issues like the economy and immigration, as she aims to return the Conservatives to power by the next election, anticipated in 2029, as reported by Euro News.</p>

<p>During her victory speech in London, Kemi Badenoch stated, "The task that stands before us is tough but simple," outlining her two primary goals for the party: holding the Labour government accountable and preparing for the next election by formulating appealing Conservative policies along with a clear implementation strategy, as reported by Euro News.</p>

<p>Earlier, Kemi Badenoch served as a business secretary in the former Conservative government. Born in London to Nigerian parents, she spent much of her childhood in Nigeria.</p>

<p>At 44, the former software engineer presents herself as a disruptor, advocating for a low-tax, free-market economy and pledging to "rewire, reboot, and reprogram" the British state.</p>

<p>Kemi Badenoch has been a critic of cultural diversity and has faced backlash for her statements suggesting that "not all cultures are equally valid" and that maternity pay is excessive.</p>

<p>The Conservative leadership contest extended over three months, with lawmakers narrowing the field from six candidates to two finalists presented to the party's wider membership. Both finalists align with the right of the party, seeking to reclaim support from Reform UK, a hard-right party led by Nigel Farage that has been drawing voters away from the Conservatives.</p>

<p>However, the Conservatives have also seen a loss of voters to Labour and the centrist Liberal Democrats, leading some party members to express concern that a shift further to the right could alienate a broader electorate.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A missile strike in Israel's Sharon area wounded 19 people, police said early Saturday, after the army reported three projectiles were fired from Lebanon into central Israel.</p>

<p>All 19, four of whom were "in moderate condition", were taken to hospitals for treatment, the Israeli police added.</p>

<p>Israel's Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency medical service earlier said that several people had been wounded in a strike on the central city of Tira, including "a male around 20 with shrapnel injuries".</p>

<p>Videos posted by the Israeli Foreign Ministry on social media showed fire and smoke spilling from a building into the street and emergency responders swarming the site.</p>

<p>"This is the result of a direct hit of a Hezbollah rocket on a building in the Israeli Arab town of Tira, injuring 19 civilians," the ministry said in the post.</p>

<p>"We cannot and will not rest until Hezbollah is dismantled," it added.</p>

<p>The Israeli army said on Telegram that it had intercepted some of the three projectiles fired from Lebanon.</p>

<p>Tira, a predominantly Arab town, is located around 25 kilometres (15 miles) northeast of Tel Aviv, near the border with the occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>The war raging in the Gaza Strip has spread to Lebanon, where Israel has been carrying out air strikes against Hezbollah, an ally of Palestinian group Hamas.</p>

<p>According to Israeli figures, at least 63 people have been killed on the Israeli side since cross-border exchanges with Hezbollah erupted following Hamas's deadly attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.</p>

<p>On Thursday, rocket fire from Lebanon killed seven people in Metula, northern Israel, including four Thai farmers.</p>

<p>Hamas's October attack on Israel resulted in 1,206 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's response has killed 43,259 Palestinians in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which are considered reliable by the United Nations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hundreds marched in Bangladesh's capital Saturday to demand protections for Hindus and other minorities who say they have suffered violence and threats since the ouster of autocratic premier Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>Hasina's toppling in an August student-led uprising saw a spate of reprisals on Hindus, who were seen as disproportionate supporters of her regime.</p>

<p>The caretaker government that replaced her, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, has acknowledged and condemned attacks on Hindus but said in many cases they were motivated by politics rather than religion.</p>

<p>Regular protests in the months since claim that attacks are continuing and have demanded action from Yunus' administration, an "advisory council" tasked with implementing democratic reforms and staging fresh elections.</p>

<p>"It's deeply regrettable that the council of advisors do not acknowledge the sufferings minorities have endured," Hindu civic leader Charu Chandra Das Brahmachari told AFP.</p>

<p>"I have witnessed the atrocities against them -- their temples, businesses, and homes."</p>

<p>Protest organisers have urged the interim government to introduce a law to protect minorities and mandate a minimum share of minority representation in government, among other demands.</p>

<p>Tensions have been inflamed by the filing of sedition charges this week against 19 people who participated in an earlier minority rights rally in the port city of Chittagong.</p>

<p>The group was accused of disrespecting the Bangladeshi national flag by hoisting a saffron flag -- the emblematic colour of the Hindu faith -- to fly above it.</p>

<p>"Framing our leaders with false charges, like sedition, has made us sceptical of the government's intentions," protest member Chiranjan Goswami told AFP.</p>

<p>Hindus are the largest minority faith in mostly Muslim Bangladesh, accounting for around eight percent of the population.</p>

<p>Attacks have also been reported on Sufi shrines, with suspicion falling on Islamists seeking to curb alternative expressions of the Muslim faith.</p>

<p>Saturday's demonstration came a day after 10,000 people attended a similar rally in Chittagong.</p>

<p>Minority leaders have pledged to hold more protests in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Hasina, 77, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India in August as protesters flooded Dhaka's streets in a dramatic end to her iron-fisted rule.</p>

<p>Her government was accused of widespread human rights abuses, including the extrajudicial killing of thousands of her political opponents during her 15-year rule.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Saturday reacted to the recent US sanctions imposed on several Indian firms and nationals, with a spokesperson stating that Indian companies have not violated any national laws.</p>

<p>The sanctions announced by the US State Department target 19 Indian companies and two individuals accused of allegedly supplying materials and technology to Russia to support its military amid the ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Randhir Jaiswal, MEA spokesperson, stated, "We have seen reports on U.S. sanctions. India has a robust legal and regulatory framework on strategic trade and nonproliferation controls. We are also a member of three key multilateral non-proliferation export control regimes-the Wassenaar Arrangement, the Australia Group, and the Missile Technology Control Regime-and have been effectively implementing relevant UNSC sanctions and UNSC resolution 1540 on non-proliferation."</p>

<p>"Our understanding is that the sanctioned transactions and companies are not in violation of Indian laws. Nevertheless, in keeping with India's established non-proliferation credentials, we are working with all the relevant Indian departments and agencies to sensitise Indian companies on applicable export control provisions, as also inform them on new measures being implemented that could impact Indian companies in certain circumstances," he added.</p>

<p>"Regular strategic trade/export control outreach events for Indian industries and stakeholders are being carried out by agencies of the Government of India. We are also in touch with the US authorities to clarify issues." Mr Jaiswal further said.</p>

<p>Indian companies named in the sanctions, such as Shreegee Impex Private Limited maintain they operate within Indian law and claim the sanctions will not impact their business.</p>

<p>Praveen Tyagi, director of Meerut-based Shreegee Impex Private Limited, expressed confusion over the measures, stating, "I don't know why these measures have been imposed on us. But it will not have any impact on us, because we neither import from the US nor export to US."</p>

<p>Rahul Kumar Singh, Director of TSMD Global, remarked, "I can't understand why the US has put the company under sanction. We are a supplier of Automobile parts and Agricultural Implements Automotive. Our company does not have any business from the USA. US sanctions will not have an impact on the company. We supply automobile parts, electronic components and garments to Russian companies. We are not working against the Indian Government and working as per the business norms. We are not doing any illegal things. Our business with Russia will continue as usual."</p>

<p>Manoranjan Sharma, Chief Economist, Infomerics Ratings says that these measures could be an attempt to influence the American elections which are scheduled on November 5 in the United States.</p>

<p>"This is in certain ways, a message to the government and the private sector of these countries, and could strain in a limited way the relations between U.S. and India, which have already been under some strain because of India's alleged low in the case of the Sikh extremist Guru Patwan Singh Pannu. But we see the limited impact of these measures both on Russia and India," said Manoranjan Sharma, Chief Economist, Infomerics Ratings.</p>

<p>"We do not see much impact on India... this will have an extremely limited impact, " Sharma added.</p>

<p>The sanctioned Indian firms, including companies involved in aviation components, are accused of allegedly facilitating the supply of dual-use goods, which are items that can have both civilian and military applications.</p>

<p>The US Says these sanctions are part of its commitment to hold entities accountable for contributing to what it terms Russia's "illegal war" in Ukraine.</p>

<p>This move follows previous sanctions against Russian entities and is part of ongoing efforts to isolate Moscow economically and politically in the wake of its actions in Ukraine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Diwali is a reminder of the many ways Americans of South Asian descent have enriched the United States, Secretary of State Tony Blinken said Friday as he hosted the annual reception of the festival of lights with members of the diplomatic community and Indian-Americans.</p>

<p>At its core, Diwali is about the idea that light will push back against darkness, that compassion, curiosity can overcome ignorance, and that everybody has an obligation to care for the other, he said in his remarks at the Diwali reception he hosted at the Department of State.</p>

<p>"I can't think of a more powerful lesson to take to heart in this time for our world than that," Blinken said.</p>

<p>"It is also a reminder of the many ways South Asian culture -- and Americans of South Asian descent -- have enriched our nation, from the novels of Jhumpa Lahiri to the fashion designs of Prabal Gurung. The United States derives so much strength from this diversity, including the truly remarkable public servants -- I can think of one offhand - the Vice President of the United States Kamala Harris, World Bank President Ajay Banga, our very own Deputy Secretary of State Rich Verma," he said.</p>

<p>He said it was 10 years ago that then Secretary John Kerry hosted the first Diwali reception at the State Department, and since then this annual gathering has become a time-honored tradition.</p>

<p>"This year, more than 1 billion Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs around the world are celebrating Diwali, decorating homes in the vibrant patterns of rangoli, hanging garlands of flowers, lighting diyas. And with Diwali falling on October 31st this year, I understand that there are some people in the United States who have even been throwing 'Diwalloween' parties. And if time permits, we will get to one of those," Blinken said amidst laughter.</p>

<p>Diwali holds different meanings and practices for different communities, he said. "But Bengali poet Tagore perhaps captured the spirit of the holiday best when he wrote, and I quote 'faith is the bird that feels the light when the dawn is still dark'," he said.</p>

<p>In his remarks, Deputy Secretary Verma said Diwali festival is so much more than just a holiday. "It is a integral part of our identities, a powerful tradition that carries deep personal meaning and unites families and friends over shared memories, shared experiences, and shared emotions," he said.</p>

<p>He said he could remember his mother and father telling him their experiences of celebrating Diwali in Punjab, in Jalandhar, and the lights and the great sweets and the community that came together.</p>

<p>"I am reminded of my own family's upbringing in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where we also celebrated Diwali, enjoying traditional customs in this small town that welcomed us with sweets and colours and so much more. People have said there is Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and you had the 'Jalebis of Johnstown'," Verma said.</p>

<p>India's Ambassador to the US Vinay Mohan Kwatra was also present on the occasion.</p>

       <description><![CDATA["America deserves better than what Donald Trump is offering. America deserves a president who understands our role and responsibility to our people and to the rest of the world to be a model," she said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump pits Americans against one another, his Democratic rival and Vice President Kamala Harris alleged Friday and asserted her pledge to pursue common sense solutions and to be a president for all Americans.</p>

<p>"America deserves better than what Donald Trump is offering. America deserves a president who understands our role and responsibility to our people and to the rest of the world to be a model," she said.</p>

<p>Campaigning in the presidential elections entered the last few days with both Harris and Trump making closing arguments before voters in the key swing states.</p>

<p>"As you have heard me say many a times, my pledge to the American people is to pursue common sense solutions, to listen to those, even those who disagree with me, to listen to experts, and to be a president for all Americans," Harris told reporters in Wisconsin.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump's closing argument is very different. He pits Americans against one another. He spends full time having Americans point their fingers at one another. And he spends a considerable amount of time plotting his revenge on his political opponents," she said.</p>

<p>She said that as of last night, Trump has indicated that the person who would be in charge of healthcare for Americans people is someone who has "routinely promoted junk science and crazy conspiracy theories", and who once expressed support for a national abortion ban. "And who is the exact last person in America who should be setting health care policy for America's families and children."</p>

<p>Harris said Trump is increasingly someone who considers his political opponents his enemy, is permanently out for revenge, and is increasingly "unstable and unhinged". "'His enemies list has grown longer, his rhetoric has grown more extreme, and he is even less focused than before on the needs and the concerns and the challenges facing the American people," she said.</p>

<p>"I have also thought a lot about what this means in terms of our standing in the world. As vice president, I have represented the United States of America around the world, and what I know is that when we walk in those rooms representing the United States of America, we have the earned and self-appointed authority to then talk about the importance of democracy, the importance of rule of law. And as a result, people around the world who are fighting for freedom and opportunity hold us up as a model," she said.</p>

<p>Responding to a question, Harris said there is a real contrast in this race when one looks at who stands for democracy and democratic principles and who does not. "Donald Trump is talking about an enemies list... He talks in a way that suggests that there should be retribution and severe consequences just because people disagree with him," she said.</p>

<p>"My point is very clear. I believe in our democracy. Democracies are complicated, in a wonderful way, because we like debate. We accept and receive differences of opinion, and we work them out. One of the reasons I am going to have a Republican in my Cabinet is because I want different views. I enjoy and benefit from diverse views, from different perspectives that allow me to make the best decisions I can make," she said.</p>

<p>"That's a big difference between me and Donald Trump, and that's the big difference between someone who truly is a leader and someone who is in it for themselves and wants unchecked power," Harris said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Describing the economic policies of Vice President Kamala Harris as a disaster, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Friday said he would launch a brand new economic miracle after he wins the elections.</p>

<p>Trump promised to build American, buy American, and hire American.</p>

<p>"We will end Kamala's economic disaster and launch a brand-new Trump economic miracle," Trump said at a campaign rally in Detroit, Michigan, a battleground State where he is slated to hold his last rally on Monday night.</p>

<p>He said Harris' failed economic agenda wiped out nearly 30,000 private sector jobs just recently, and nearly 50,000 manufacturing jobs just over the last short period of time. "You lost 50,000 manufacturing jobs."</p>

<p>Trump alleged that under Harris' "nation-wrecking policies, the American worker is absolutely drowning. 'You're drowning".</p>

<p>"Kamala is a radical left Marxist, rated even worse than crazy Bernie Sanders and Pocahontas herself. She destroyed our economy. She was an original creator of the Defund the Police movement. Anybody who wants to defund the police for even one week is not worthy of being President of the United States," Trump said.</p>

<p>"Kamala vowed to abolish ICE. She pledged to confiscate your guns... she even called for free sex changes for illegal aliens in detention. All at taxpayer expense. But perhaps most significant of all, she lied about working at McDonald's. She never worked," he said.</p>

<p>"With your vote, this November, we are going to fire Kamala and we are going to save America. We will cut your taxes, end inflation, slash your prices, raise your wages. and bring thousands and thousands of factories back to America and back to Detroit, Michigan," he said.</p>

<p>He promised, "I will end the war in Ukraine. Would have never started if I was president. I will stop the chaos in the Middle East. Would have never happened October 7th. And I will prevent World War III from happening," he said.</p>

<p>The former president said his administration will crush violent crime and give police the support, protection, resources, and respect that they so dearly deserve.</p>

<p>"We will strengthen and modernise our military. We will build a missile defense shield, the biggest in the world, all over our country, made in the USA, much of it made in Michigan. We will rebuild our cities, including our capital in Washington, D.C., making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. Again, our cities are a mess. They're a mess, a crime-ridden mess," he said.</p>

<p>"We will teach our children to love our country, to honour our history, and to always respect our great American flag. I'm going to put a bill in. If you burn the American flag, you get one year in jail. It is just happened a few weeks ago in Washington. They're burning American flags all over the place. We will get critical race theory and transgender insanity out of our schools. We ill keep men out of women's sports," he said</p>

<p>He said he will defend religious liberty and restore free speech.</p>

<p>"And I will defend the right to keep and bear arms... our Second Amendment, which is under siege. After years of building up foreign nations, defending foreign borders, and protecting foreign lands, we are finally going to build up our country, defend our borders, and protect our citizens and our lands," he said.</p>

<p>"We ill stop illegal immigration once and for all. We will not be invaded. We will not be occupied. We will not be overrun. We will not be conquered. We will be a free, proud nation once again. We're going to be free and proud. Everyone will prosper. Every family will thrive. And every day will be filled with opportunity and hope. And most importantly, it's going to be filled again with the American Dream," Trump said.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The world's biggest nature conservation conference closed in Colombia on Saturday with no agreement on a roadmap to ramp up funding for species protection.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world's biggest nature conservation conference closed in Colombia on Saturday with no agreement on a roadmap to ramp up funding for species protection.</p>

<p>The 16th Conference of Parties (COP16) to the UN's Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) was suspended by its president Susana Muhamad as negotiations ran almost 12 hours longer than planned and delegates started leaving to catch flights.</p>

<p>The exodus left the summit without a quorum for decision-making, but CBD spokesman David Ainsworth told AFP it will resume at a later date to consider outstanding issues.</p>

<p>The conference, the biggest meeting of its kind yet, with around 23,000 registered delegates, was tasked with assessing, and ramping up, progress toward an agreement reached in Canada two years ago to halt humankind's rapacious destruction of nature's bounty.</p>

<p>The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework that emerged from that meeting had set 23 targets to be met in just over five years from now.</p>

<p>They include placing 30 percent of land and sea areas under protection and 30 percent of degraded ecosystems under restoration by 2030, reducing pollution, and phasing out agricultural and other subsidies harmful to nature.</p>

<p>The Canada summit had also agreed that $200 billion per year be made available to protect biodiversity by 2030, including the transfer of $30 billion per year from rich to poor nations.</p>

<p>The actual total for 2022 was about $15 billion, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</p>

<p>On top of that, nations have pledged about $400 million to a Global Biodiversity Framework Fund (GBFF) created last year to meet the UN targets.</p>

<p>In Cali, negotiators were split largely between poor and rich country blocs as they haggled over increased funding and other commitments.</p>

<p>The biggest ask from the summit -- to lay out a detailed funding plan -- turned out to be a bridge too far.</p>

<p>Muhamad, Colombia's environment minister, had offered a draft text proposing the creation of a dedicated biodiversity fund, which was rejected by the European Union, Switzerland and Japan.</p>

<p>Developing nations had insisted on the creation of a dedicated biodiversity fund, saying they are not adequately represented in existing mechanisms including the GBFF, which they say are also too onerous.</p>

<p><strong>'Clock is ticking'</strong></p>

<p>The meeting did manage to coalesce around the creation of a fund to share the profits of digitally sequenced genetic data taken from plants and animals with the communities they come from.</p>

<p>Such data, much of it from species found in poor countries, is notably used in medicines and cosmetics that can make their developers billions, very little of which ever trickles back down.</p>

<p>Delegates also approved the creation of a permanent body to represent the interests of Indigenous people under the UN's Convention on Biological Diversity.</p>

<p>Representatives of Indigenous peoples, many in traditional dress and headgear, broke out in cheers and chants as the agreement was gaveled through.</p>

<p>But the talks on biodiversity funding stumbled even as new research presented to coincide with COP16 showed that more than a quarter of assessed plants and animals are now at risk of extinction.</p>

<p>Only 17.6 percent of land and inland waters, and 8.4 percent of the ocean and coastal areas, are estimated to be protected and conserved.</p>

<p>UN chief Antonio Guterres, who had stopped over in Cali for two days with five heads of state and dozens of ministers to add impetus to the talks, reminded delegates that humanity has already altered three-quarters of Earth's land surface and two-thirds of its waters.</p>

<p>"The clock is ticking. The survival of our planet's biodiversity -- and our own survival -- are on the line," he said.</p>

<p>The meeting was held amid a massive security deployment following threats from a Colombian guerrilla group with its base of operations near Cali. No incidents were reported.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after the US authorities deported a batch of Indian nationals who were staying in that country illegally, New Delhi Saturday said it hopes that with India-US cooperation on mobility and migration, "we will be able to deter illegal immigration".</p>

<p>At his weekly briefing in Delhi, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India engages in "regular dialogue" with the United States on migration and mobility.</p>

<p>"On October 22, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), through US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), conducted a large-frame charter removal flight to the Republic of India of Indian nationals who did not establish a legal basis to remain in the United States," the DHS said in a statement last week.</p>

<p>This week's flight demonstrates the department's continued commitment to pursuing "sustained cooperation" with the Indian government and other international partners to reduce and deter irregular migration and jointly work to counter human smuggling, it had said.</p>

<p>Jaiswal, in response to a query on this deportation, said, "You would have seen, recently we had some deportations from the US. We have regular dialogues with the United States on migration and mobility. And the idea behind that is to create more avenues for legal migration." As part of this, "our regular consular dialogues and arrangements, we have facilitated the movement of people who are staying in the US illegally or are a part of an irregular movement", he added.</p>

<p>"This has been going on for some time. We hope that with this cooperation and our engagement with the US on mobility and migration, we will be able to deter illegal immigration," the MEA spokesperson said.</p>

<p>About 1,100 Indian nationals, who were staying in the United States illegally, were repatriated to India through charter and commercial flights during the 2023-24 American financial year ending September 30, a senior official in the US DHS said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>In a virtual briefing, Royce Murray, Assistant Secretary for Border and Immigration Policy, US DHS, in response to a query related to the October 22 charter flight that deported a batch of Indian nationals, had also said that "no minor" was among them on that removal flight, adding these were all male and female adults.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jennifer Lopez joined forces with Kamala Harris in Nevada and delivered a passionate speech. "It wasn't just Puerto Ricans that were offended," Lopez said. "(It was) humanity and anyone of decent character.</p>

<p>"I am Puerto Rican, and yes, I was born here, and we are Americans," she announced.</p>

<p>The singer's powerful words came after Trump's rally at Madison Square Garden, where comedian Tony Hinchcliffe made derogatory remarks about Puerto Rico, calling it a "floating island of garbage". Her speech highlighted her pride in Puerto Rican heritage and her belief in women's power.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">"there's literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now."<br />
<br />
"I think it's called Puerto Rico."<br />
<br />

<p>She said that at Madison Square Garden, Trump reminded them of who he really is.</p>

<p>Speaking on behalf of women, she also said, "Women have the power to make the difference in this election," and that she believes in the power of women. This was a reference to Trump's comment about him protecting women, "whether the women like it or not". Lopez added that Trump failed to recognise the "freedom of women or the intelligence of women" in making decisions about their own life and bodies.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Jennifer Lopez gets emotional, "You know what? We should be emotional. We should be upset. We should be scared and outraged. We should. Our pain matters. We matter. You matter. Your voice and your vote matters." <a href="https://t.co/7a4MU1ZxLK">pic.twitter.com/7a4MU1ZxLK</a></p>

<p>However JLo is not the only Puerto Rican celebrity to back Harris. Stars like Bad Bunny, and Nicky Jam have spoken out against Trump, with Jam walking back his Trump endorsement.</p>

<p>As for what comedian Tony Hinchcliffe said about Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans, the Trump campaign has distanced itself from him saying, "This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign."</p>

<p>Harris' campaign launched an ad in Spanish on Thursday, titled "Somos Más," or "We Are More," centering the message on Hinchcliffe's joke. "Puerto Rico is an island of scientists, poets, educators, stars and heroes," the narrator says in Spanish. "We're not trash, we're more" adding, "On Nov. 5, Trump will understand that some people's trash is others' treasure."</p>

<p>Regardless, her emotional comments have faced quite a bit of backlash. A user on X commented, "Jennifer is just trying to get a pardon for her involvement in the P Diddy parties", while another said, "Trump literally said nothing about Puerto Rico. I see a desperate campaign that knows it is losing. She's way behind where Biden was in 2020."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Casual American dining chain TGI Fridays filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Saturday in the US state of Texas, a company statement said.</p>

<p>The bar and grill chain -- known for serving up hamburgers, chicken wings and signature cocktails -- said its dozens of restaurants in the United States and abroad would remain open to customers while the company uses the restructuring process to "explore strategic alternatives in order to ensure the long-term viability of the brand."</p>

<p>TGI Fridays Inc, which filed for bankruptcy, owns and operates 39 restaurants in the United States.</p>

<p>Not included in the Chapter 11 process are 56 franchise TGI Friday's locations in the United States and 40 other countries, which are independently owned, the firm said.</p>

<p>"The next steps announced today are difficult but necessary actions to protect the best interests of our stakeholders, including our domestic and international franchisees and our valued team members around the world," executive chairman Rohit Manocha said in the statement.</p>

<p>Manocha said the Covid-19 pandemic and the company's capital structure were the primary reasons for its financial issues.</p>

<p>"This restructuring will allow our go-forward restaurants to proceed with an optimized corporate infrastructure that enables them to reach their full potential," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Justin Trudeau-led Canadian government's latest action suggests it has started treating India as an enemy country. India has been added to a list of enemy nations in terms of cyber security and has been labelled a 'cyber adversary'. New Delhi today called it another Canadian strategy to attack and malign India internationally.</p>

<p>In a press conference today, the Ministry of External Affairs also said that under Trudeau's administration, senior Canadian officials have openly confessed that Canada is seeking to manipulate global opinions against India. The foreign ministry also said that like other instances, these allegations in their cyber security report are made without a shred of evidence.</p>

<p>"We see this as another Canadian strategy to attack and malign India. Their senior officials have openly confessed that Canada is seeking to manipulate global opinions against India. As on other occasions, allegations are made repeatedly without a shred of evidence," Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs said at a press conference in New Delhi today.</p>

<h2><strong>WHAT CANADA ALLEGED</strong></h2>

<p>In its most recent report about cyber security, titled 'National Cyber Threat Assessment 2025-2026', the Government of Canada has called India a "cyber adversary".</p>

<p>In the report it claimed that, "India's leadership almost certainly aspires to build a modernized cyber program with domestic cyber capabilities. India very likely uses its cyber program to advance its national security imperatives, including espionage, counter-terrorism, and the country's efforts to promote its global status and counter narratives against India and the Indian government. We assess that India's cyber program likely leverages commercial cyber vendors to enhance its operations."</p>

<p>It further claimed that "We assess that Indian state-sponsored cyber threat actors likely conduct cyber threat activity against Government of Canada networks for the purpose of espionage. We judge that official bilateral relations between Canada and India will very likely drive Indian state-sponsored cyber threat activity against Canada."</p>

<p>The report also claimed that "countries that aspire to become new centres of power within the global system, such as India, are building cyber programs that present varying levels of threat to Canada."</p>

<p>Canada made these claims under 'Section 1' of its cyber security report titled 'Cyber Threat From State Adversaries' which it says "introduces the state cyber threat ecosystem and discusses the cyber threats to Canada."</p>

<p>India has been added to the list of enemy countries which include China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.</p>

<h3><strong>CANADA HARASSES INDIAN DIPLOMATIC STAFF</strong></h3>

<p>The Justin Trudeau-led Canada government has started violating all established international diplomatic norms in its hateful and spiteful pursuit to malign India in order to cater to its domestic <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/india-canada-fallout-how-far-can-justin-trudeau-go-as-personal-electoral-gain-trumps-diplomatic-ties-6798226" target="_blank">political motives and objectives</a>. Diplomats and other Indian mission staff are being kept under round-the-clock surveillance and are even being intimidated routinely.</p>

<p>In a move that highlights its double-standards, Justin Trudeau's administration, which harps on a "rules-based" order has itself not been following any established rules, diplomatic norms and practices.</p>

<p>India today called out Canada for indulging in such illegal activity to harass and intimidate Indian officials in diplomatic missions. New Delhi has called such surveillance activity a "flagrant violation of relevant diplomatic and consular conventions".</p>

<p>The foreign ministry also said that by citing technicalities the Canadian government cannot justify that it is indulging in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/india-canada-india-canada-ties-harassment-intimidation-india-on-surveillance-of-officials-in-canada-6928387" target="_blank">"harassment and intimidation"</a>.</p>

<p>In its official statement, the Ministry of External Affairs said, "Some of our officials have recently been informed by the Canadian government that they have been, and continue to be under audio and visual surveillance. Their communications have also been intercepted."</p>

<p>It added that "New Delhi has formally protested to the Canadian government as we deem these actions to be a flagrant violation of relevant diplomatic and consular conventions. By citing technicalities the Canadian government cannot justify that it is indulging in harassment and intimidation."</p>

<p>The foreign ministry concluded by saying that "Our diplomatic and consular persons are already functioning in an environment of extremism and violence. This action of the Canadian government aggravates the situation and is incompatible with established diplomatic norms and practices."</p>

<p>India and Canada are currently in the midst of the worst-ever diplomatic spat between the two nations. India has held Canadian Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/gap-between-action-and-words-india-on-justin-trudeaus-one-india-remarks-6814167" target="_blank">Justin Trudeau accountable</a> for the diplomatic fallout between the two countries. Mr <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/glorification-of-violence-india-slams-canada-over-khalistani-floats-5611239" target="_blank">Trudeau has openly been supporting</a> terrorism, extremism, separatism and violence against India by personally sharing space and politically being a part of the Khalistani narrative. He has been seen at Khalistani rallies and hate speeches against India. Mr Trudeau is <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/canada-showing-its-vote-bank-is-more-powerful-than-its-rule-of-law-s-jaishankar-5631952" target="_blank">dependent on this vote bank</a> for his political gains.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As its ties with Canada continued to remain at an all-time low, India on Saturday said some of its consular officials were informed by the Canadian government that they have been under audio and video surveillance, and termed the action a "flagrant violation" of diplomatic conventions.</p>

<p>Asserting that Canada could not hide behind technicalities to justify its harassment and intimidation, India said it had lodged a protest with the Canadian government.</p>

<p>Addressing a briefing on Saturday, Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, "Some of our consular officials were recently informed by the Canadian government that they have been and continue to be under audio and video surveillance. Their communications have also been intercepted. We have formally protested to the Canadian government as we deem these actions to be a flagrant violation of relevant diplomatic and consular conventions."</p>

<p>Pointing out that India's diplomatic and consular personnel are already functioning in an environment of "extremism and violence", Mr Jaiswal added, "By citing technicalities, the Canadian Government cannot justify the fact that it is indulging in harassment and intimidation... This action of the Canadian government aggravates the situation and is incompatible with established diplomatic norms and practices."</p>

<p>During the briefing, Mr Jaiswal also revealed that a Canadian diplomat had been summoned on Friday over claims by Canada's Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister David Morrison that Home Minister Amit Shah had ordered the targeting of Khalistani extremists in the country.</p>

<p>Stating that a diplomatic note had been handed over to the representative of the Canadian High Commission, the spokesperson said, "It was conveyed in the note that the Government of India protests in the strongest terms to the absurd and baseless references made to the Union Home Minister of India before the committee by Deputy Minister David Morrison."</p>

<p>Referring to reports of Canada admitting that its officials leaked sensitive information to the Washington Post, the Ministry of External Affairs said such actions will have "serious consequences" for ties between India and Canada.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In fact, the revelation that high Canadian officials deliberately leak unfounded insinuations to the international media as part of a conscious strategy to discredit India and influence other nations only confirms the view the Government of India has long held about the current Canadian government's political agenda and behavioural pattern. Such irresponsible actions will have serious consequences for bilateral ties," he warned.</p>

<p>Ties between India and Canada have been strained since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau claimed - without offering any evidence - last year that "Indian agents" were involved in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. The allegation has been rubbished by New Delhi several times and it has asked Canada to produce evidence to back up the claim.</p>

<p>The relationship hit a new low earlier this month when the Indian High Commissioner was termed a "person of interest" in the killing. India dismissed the fresh charge as "ludicrous" and withdrew the High Commissioner and some diplomats while expelling six Canadian officials, including Canada's acting High Commissioner Stewart Ross Wheeler.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rubbishing a Canadian minister's claims that Home Minister Amit Shah had ordered the targeting of Khalistani extremists in the country, India has termed them "absurd and baseless" and said a Canadian diplomat had been summoned.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Canada's Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister David Morrison had made the allegations while addressing members of the country's Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Replying to a question on Saturday, Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said a representative of the Canadian High Commission had been summoned on Friday and a diplomatic note was handed over.</p>

<p>"It was conveyed in the note that the Government of India protests in the strongest terms to the absurd and baseless references made to the Union Home Minister of India before the committee by Deputy Minister David Morrison," Mr Jaiswal said.&nbsp;</p>

Such irresponsible actions will have serious consequences for bilateral ties," the spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Categorisation, Surveillance</strong></p>

<p>Responding to reports that Canada has named India an "adversary" alongside China, North Korea, Russia and Iran in its National Cyber Threat Assessment, Mr Jaiswal said this was another example of imputations being made without evidence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This appears to be another example of a Canadian strategy to attack India. As I mentioned earlier, their senior officials have openly confessed that they are seeking to manipulate global opinion against India. As on other occasions, imputations are made without any evidence," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson also said some of India's consular officials were informed by the Canadian government that they have been under surveillance and called it a "flagrant violation" of diplomatic conventions. He also made it clear that New Delhi sees the action as a form of harassment and intimidation.</p>

<p>"Some of our consular officials were recently informed by the Canadian government that they have been and continue to be under audio and video surveillance. Their communications have also been intercepted. We have formally protested to the Canadian government as we deem these actions to be a flagrant violation of relevant diplomatic and consular conventions," Mr Jaiswal said.&nbsp;</p>

Our diplomatic and consular personnel are already functioning in an environment of extremism and violence. This action of the Canadian Government aggravates the situation and is incompatible with established diplomatic norms and practices," he asserted.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Diwali Celebrations</strong></p>

<p>To a question on Canada's opposition leader Pierre Poilievre cancelling Diwali celebrations that were scheduled to be held at Parliament Hill in Ottawa, sparking a backlash from the Indian community, Mr Jaiswal said, "We have seen some reports in this regard. It is unfortunate that the prevailing atmosphere in Canada has reached high levels of intolerance and extremism."</p>

<p>On the reduction in the number of visas by the Canadian government, the spokesperson said the ministry is monitoring the well-being of students and temporary workers from India who are currently in Canada and its concern for their safety and security remains strong.</p>

<p>Ties between India and Canada have been strained since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau claimed, without offering any evidence, last year that "Indian agents" were involved in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar - an allegation that has been dismissed by New Delhi several times.</p>

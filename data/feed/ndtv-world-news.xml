       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden led the condemnation after his election rival Donald Trump was wounded in a shooting incident at a rally in Pennsylvania Saturday that also reportedly killed at least one bystander.</p>

<p>Political leaders on both sides of the aisle slammed the violence minutes after the Republican candidate was rushed off stage by the Secret Service, blood running down his face.</p>

<p>"I'm grateful to hear that he's safe and doing well. I'm praying for him and his family and for all those who were at the rally, as we await further information," Biden said in a statement shortly after the incident.</p>

<p>"Jill and I are grateful to the Secret Service for getting him to safety. There's no place for this kind of violence in America. We must unite as one nation to condemn it."</p>

<p>His former boss, Barack Obama, echoed his words in a statement on X, saying there was "absolutely no place for political violence in our democracy."</p>

<p>"Although we don't yet know exactly what happened, we should all be relieved that former President Trump wasn't seriously hurt, and use this moment to recommit ourselves to civility and respect in our politics," the Democrat said.</p>

<p>Former president George W. Bush condemned the "cowardly" attack.</p>

<p>"Laura and I are grateful that President Trump is safe following the cowardly attack on his life. And we commend the men and women of the Secret Service for their speedy response," he said in a statement.</p>

<p>"I am horrified by what happened at the Trump rally in Pennsylvania and relieved that former President Trump is safe. Political violence has no place in our country," US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, wrote on X.</p>

<p>Top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell also wrote on X: "Tonight, all Americans are grateful that President Trump appears to be fine after a despicable attack on a peaceful rally. Violence has no place in our politics."</p>

<p>"As one whose family has been the victim of political violence, I know firsthand that political violence of any kind has no place in our society," former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose husband was attacked in a home invasion in 2022, wrote, also on X.</p>

<p>"I thank God that former President Trump is safe. As we learn more details about this horrifying incident, let us pray that all those in attendance at the former President's rally today are unharmed," she continued.</p>

<p>Tech billionaire Elon Musk said Saturday that he "fully" endorses Trump after the rally violence.</p>

<p>"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery," Musk wrote on X, as he shared a video of Trump pumping his fist while being escorted away by Secret Service officials.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While delivering a speech at a rally in Pennsylvania today, former US President Donald Trump was evacuated off the stage by the security agents after a series of gunshots was fired during his speech.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a video that captures the moment the horrifying incident happened, Donald Trump can be seen delivering his speech amongst a big crowd of his supporters when several gunshots are heard. After the first couple of gunshots that took Donald Trump unawares, he can be seen touching his right ear before ducking to take cover behind the stage dias. The crowd behind him, visibly confused and scared, also ducks to dodge any bullet.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump was rushed off stage smeared in blood after a series of gunshots were fired at a campaign rally on Saturday in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>As bangs ran out, Trump grimaced and clutched a hand to his right ear, where blood was clearly visible across his cheek and mouth.</p>

<p>Agents swarmed onto the podium, surrounded the Republican candidate and escorted him roughly off the stage, as Trump raised a fist to the crowd in defiance.</p>

<p>The shocking incident will fuel anxiety in a country already on edge about the prospect of unrest and political harassment in the run-up to the November election battle between Trump and President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>"The former president is safe," the Secret Service said in a post on X.</p>

<p>His campaign said he was "fine" and being checked at a medical facility.</p>

<p>"President Trump thanks law enforcement and first responders for their quick action during this heinous act. He is fine and is being checked out at a local medical facility. More details will follow," said spokesman Steven Cheung in a statement.</p>

<p><strong>Shooter Dead&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The suspected shooter was confirmed dead, along with one bystander, US media reported.</p>

<p>"Butler County District Attorney Richard Goldinger said two people are dead, including an apparent shooter," The Washington Post reported. A second bystander may also have been hit.</p>

<p>The apparent shooting took place shortly after Trump took the stage at his final campaign rally before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next week.</p>

<p>The rally in Butler, Pennsylvania descended into scenes of chaos as bangs were heard and screams and shouts rang out.</p>

<p>"Let me get my shoes," Trump was heard saying on microphone, as security agents helped him back to his feet.</p>

<p>Agents bundled the 78-year-old tycoon into an SUV, as he once more raised his fist to the crowd.</p>

<p>"This is an active crime scene," Secret Service officers told reporters, ordering them out of the area.</p>

<p>"We saw a lot of people go down, looking confused. I heard the shots," said John Yeykal from Franklin, Pennsylvania, who was attending his first Trump rally.</p>

<p>Biden has received an initial briefing by the head of the Secret Service and the Secretary of Homeland Security, the White House said.</p>

<p>US politicians reacted with shock to the incident.</p>

<p>Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he was "horrified by what happened at the Trump rally in Pennsylvania and relieved that former President Trump is safe."</p>

<p>"Political violence has no place in our country," he added.</p>

<p>Republican minority leader Mitch McConnell added: "Tonight, all Americans are grateful that President Trump appears to be fine after a despicable attack on a peaceful rally. Violence has no place in our politics."</p>

<p>Billionaire Elon Musk reacted by quickly endorsing Trump.</p>

<p>"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery," Musk wrote on X, which he owns along with car manufacturer Tesla, as he shared a video of Trump pumping his fist while being escorted away.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a rare occurrence, a 22-year-old man died of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) in Pakistan's Karachi, taking the tally of casualties to three this year, ARY News reported.</p>

<p>PAM is notably a disease of the central nervous system caused by Naegleria fowleri commonly called 'brain-eating' amoeba.</p>

<p>The victim was identified as Aurangzeb. He contracted the disease following a picnic with his friends at a farmhouse in Quaidabad on July 7, where the group had also gone for a swim. The next day, Aurangzeb started showing symptoms, which included nausea and fever.</p>

<p>He was admitted to the hospital on July 10, and the virus was confirmed on July 11. A resident of Cattle Colony, Aurangzeb, was under treatment at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), as per ARY News.</p>

<p>The youth had gone for a picnic with friends at a farmhouse in Quaidabad on July 7, where they swam in the pool. Aurangzeb started showing symptoms on July 8, including fever, headache, and nausea. He was admitted to the hospital on July 10, and the virus was confirmed on July 11.</p>

<p>The 22-year-old Aurangzeb was the third victim of the deadly infection this year in the city, with the other two cases reported in Korangi and Malir earlier, according to ARY News.</p>

<p>The infection has claimed the lives of people across various regions of Pakistan earlier as well. At least 10 people died of Naegleria fowleri last year. The infection is found to be fatal in 98 per cent of the cases.</p>

<p>Naegleria, a free-living amoeba, is frequently found in warm, freshwater (lakes, rivers, and hot springs) and soil.</p>

<p>Only one species, Naegleria fowleri, infects humans.</p>

<p>It infects people when water containing the amoeba enters the body via the nose. This often occurs when people swim, dive, or submerge their heads in fresh water, such as lakes and rivers. The amoeba then travels up the nose and into the brain, where it damages brain tissue and causes PAM, according to ARY News.</p>

<p>After symptoms begin, the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within five days. The germ cannot survive in cool, clean and chlorinated water.</p>

<p>The earliest symptoms of PAM often appear approximately five days after infection and may include headache, fever, nausea, or vomiting. Later symptoms may include a stiff neck, confusion, loss of attention to people and surroundings, seizures, hallucinations, and coma.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[OpenAI whistleblowers have filed a complaint with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, calling for a probe over the company's "restrictive non-disclosure agreements", the Washington Post reported, citing a copy of the letter sent to the SEC.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI whistleblowers have filed a complaint with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, calling for an investigation over the artificial intelligence company's allegedly restrictive non-disclosure agreements, the Washington Post reported on Saturday, citing a copy of the letter sent to the SEC.</p>

<p>The whistleblowers alleged that OpenAI issued overly restrictive employment, severance, and nondisclosure agreements to its employees, which could have led to penalties against workers who raised concerns about OpenAI to federal authorities, according to the newspaper.</p>

<p>The AI company made employees sign agreements that required them to waive their federal rights to whistleblower compensation, according to the letter seen by the Washington Post.</p>

<p>The agreements also required that employees get prior consent from the company if they wanted to disclose information to federal regulators, the newspaper said, adding that OpenAI did not create exemptions in the employee nondisparagement clauses for disclosing securities violations to the SEC.</p>

<p>An SEC spokesperson said in an emailed statement that it does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible whistleblower submission.</p>

<p>OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for a comment on the Washington Post report.</p>

<p>OpenAI's chatbots with generative AI capabilities, such as engaging in human-like conversations and creating images based on text prompts, have stirred safety concerns as AI models become powerful.</p>

<p>OpenAI in May formed a Safety and Security Committee that will be led by board members, including CEO Sam Altman, as it begins training its next artificial intelligence model.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As Biden's verbal gaffes, shaky voice, and other troubling signs have brought an intense focus on the President's mental acuity, experts are calling on him and Trump to pass additional cognitive tests, while warning against leaping to conclusions.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Joe Biden's verbal gaffes, shaky voice, and other troubling signs have brought an intense focus on the US President's mental acuity, health experts are calling on him and rival Donald Trump to pass additional cognitive tests, even while warning against leaping to conclusions.</p>

<p>Such tests, experts said, could either help repudiate speculation that the 81-year-old president's mental state is in worrying decline -- or else confirm it -- and could enlighten voters on the mental abilities of Trump, who has had his own share of verbal lapses.</p>

<p>But reliable diagnoses, they caution, cannot be made from afar.</p>

<p>Since Biden's disastrous performance in his debate with Trump two weeks ago, the Democrat's campaign has faced fierce opposition. A growing number of officials in his own party are questioning his ability to lead the country for four more years.</p>

<p>And it didn't help when at a summit in Washington earlier this week Biden mistakenly introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as his foe Vladimir Putin, before quickly correcting himself.</p>

<p>Dennis Selkoe, a neurologist at Harvard Medical School, said the fundamental issue is whether Biden is suffering from "a normal age-related process" or "something that represents a neurologic disease."</p>

<p>"Making a mistake with a name is not automatically a sign of dementia or of Alzheimer's," he told AFP.</p>

<p>But Selkoe, who sees many patients with neurodegenerative problems, said Biden does seem to have the "appearance of an early Parkinson patient" -- including his slow, stiff gait and his low, sometimes barely audible voice, which could be a condition known as hypophonia.</p>

<p><strong>Detailed Tests</strong></p>

<p>In February, Biden underwent a complete physical exam. A published summary of its results indicated that an "extremely detailed neurologic exam" had ruled out Parkinson's.</p>

<p>However, no detail was provided on the exact nature of the tests or their results.</p>

<p>Could a neurological illness have taken root over just the past five months? If the exams in February had been comprehensive, Selkoe said, there should have been early signs of a nascent condition.</p>

<p>In an editorial in March, the scientific journal Lancet called for standardized procedures to examine the health of sitting and prospective presidents to insulate American voters from a "pestilence of speculation, misinformation, and slander."</p>

<p>Absent such reliable testing, "the US public remains beholden to voluntarily released reports from politicians' personal physicians," the journal said.</p>

<p>Jay Olshansky, an expert in aging at the University of Illinois at Chicago, sounded a similar note, saying, "We think the time has arrived for complete transparency."</p>

<p>He urged both major presidential candidates to pass a cognitive test, something former president Trump has frequently challenged Biden to do.</p>

<p>Several such exams, including those known as the MMSE and the MoCA, are available either for an initial screening or as part of a more comprehensive battery of tests.</p>

<p>Biden has said that he effectively passes a cognitive test every day, simply by carrying out his presidential duties.</p>

<p>But "I don't think it's the same," Selkoe said. Being able to conduct familiar tasks one has done for years is one thing, he said, while being able to repeat a list of words heard five minutes earlier, as some tests require, is another.</p>

<p>At a news conference Thursday, the President said he would be willing to take a new neurological exam if his doctors recommended it, but that "no one is suggesting that to me now."</p>

<p><strong>Stereotypes On Aging</strong></p>

<p>Aging changes one's brain, said Allison Sekuler, president of the Baycrest Academy, a hospital specializing in elderly care.</p>

<p>"Garbage is basically building up in the brain," she told AFP, adding that parts of the brain atrophy, or shrink, including parts important to memory.</p>

<p>An early phase known as "mild cognitive impairment" can sometimes develop into Alzheimer's or some other form of dementia, she said.</p>

<p>During their recent debate, both Biden and Trump -- who is 78 -- "exhibited some sort of issues in terms of being able to stay on track with a question," Sekuler said, recommending that both men undergo testing.</p>

<p>But, she added, "we're really only talking about one of them right now because that aligns with our stereotype of what aging is."</p>

<p>Olshansky also denounced what he called "raging" ageism, citing a recent magazine cover that used a walker as a symbol of the Biden-Trump race.</p>

<p>He noted that while there is a lower age limit for would-be US presidents -- they must be at least 35 -- there is no upper limit.</p>

<p>What he called "crystallized intelligence," or the ability to use past experience to improve one's reasoning skills, "gets stronger and stronger" with age.</p>

<p>Olshansky co-authored a 2020 study that gave Biden a 95 percent chance of surviving a first term, based on average life expectancy for someone of his age, plus personal risk factors.</p>

<p>But a similar calculation four years later, on a man now four years older, gave Biden a much lower probability of survival: just 75 percent.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his US counterpart Joe Biden accidentally referring to him as Russian President Vladimir Putin was a mistake that could be forgotten about given all the support the US has provided to Ukraine.</p>

<p>Biden mistakenly referred to Zelensky as Putin at a NATO summit in Washington on Thursday before correcting himself two seconds later.</p>

<p>"It's a mistake. I think the United States gave a lot of support to Ukrainians. We can forget some mistakes, I think so," Zelensky told reporters on Saturday at Ireland's Shannon airport where he was meeting Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A couple in the UK have been slapped with a 1,200 pound (Rs1,30,079) fine by their local council after they tidied up the rubbish outside their home.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As responsible citizens, we should keep our streets and neighbourhoods clean by properly disposing of waste and participating in community clean-up efforts. However, in a bizarre event, a couple in the UK&nbsp;have been slapped with a 1,200 pound&nbsp; (Rs&nbsp;1,30,079) fine&nbsp;by their local council after they tidied up the rubbish outside their home, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cldyny34kx4o">BBC</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The couple stated that their road had been plagued with "disgusting" litter for years. Taking matters into their own hands,&nbsp;Veronika Mike and her boyfriend Zoltan Pinter, from Stoke-on-Trent, decided to clean the garbage themselves. On April 29, they&nbsp;filled a cardboard box with food remnants and discarded packaging to stop it from scattering, placing it beside the bins in hopes that the council would take it away.</p>

<p>Days later on May 8, they received a fine from the council who said that they&nbsp;had failed ''to transfer household waste to an authorised authority''.&nbsp;Instead of gratitude, both received 600-pound fines each for their efforts.</p>

<p>The letter from the council read: "This is being issued to you as you failed in your legal duty to transfer controlled waste to an authorised person. Evidence has been obtained that the items in the picture provided originated from your home address."</p>

<p>It added, ''The allegation is not that you placed the waste at the location, but that you failed in your legal duty when transferring household items. It is the legal duty of domestic households to ensure the transfer of waste to authorised persons to stop flying tipping."</p>

<p>Mr Pinter paid the fine immediately while Ms Mike is paying it off in monthly instalments of 100 pounds.&nbsp;''We just wanted to clean our street and that's the thanks we get from the council. At first, I was very angry and I cried. I have volunteered for litter picking before, and I essentially did the same thing and got two £600 penalties for nothing. For the first few years, it was OK but after that, it's always been messy in the street. The bins are in front of our main entrance, it's disgusting,'' Ms Mike said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After their experience, the couple vowed to never clean their streets again "even if the rats come".</p>

<p>They have now <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/cleaning-and-fined">started a fundraiser to help pay off the fines</a> they received for cleaning the area. They have received an outpouring of support and have collected more than 2000 pounds on GoFundMe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>City councillor Amjid Wazir said the matter was considered resolved.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police Officer Mark Castillo, who serves as the personal driver and bodyguard for San Antonio Police Chief William McManus, is facing allegations of sending sex-related text messages to a married woman while on duty. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/12/us-news/san-antonio-police-officer-mark-castillo-llegedly-sent-racy-texts-to-married-woman-while-working-as-chiefs-body-guard/">New York Post,</a></em> he allegedly sent explicit photos of himself to a married woman as he worked on his police chief's security detail.</p>

<p>He&nbsp;allegedly sent inappropriate messages to Laura Cisneros, 50, for nearly a month between late April and May 22, often during the hours of 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., his regular work schedule.</p>

<p>Arturo Cisneros, the husband of the woman who received the texts, filed a complaint with the department's Internal Affairs Unit after discovering the messages. Notably, Mr Cisneros knew the police officer&nbsp;through his wife's connections and had encountered him at various public events, including city council meetings and a local restaurant.</p>

<p>''Mmmm, I wish I could....slowly,” the cop said in one series of texts.''Stop. And lol you're going to get me in trouble. My computer is open and they keep seeing you come up,'' Ms Cisneros wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''OK, make sure to erase your messages. TTYL,'' Mr Castillo said in reply.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Cisneros told<em> </em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ksat.com/news/ksat-investigates/2024/07/09/member-of-mcmanus-security-team-sexted-with-woman-while-on-duty-records-show/"><em>KSAT</em> </a>that he read a month's worth of messages, which appeared to intensify sexually in the days before they were discovered. He eventually contacted family members to inform them that he had found disturbing material on his wife's phone. He then called 911 to report the affair between Mr Castillo and his wife.</p>

<p>The Internal Affairs Unit is now investigating the allegations to determine the extent of Mr Castillo's conduct and whether it violated departmental policies. Mr Castillo could face disciplinary action, which may include suspension or termination from the force.</p>

<p>Laura Cisneros told the outlet that she and Mr Castillo never had sexual intercourse, but they did make out in a car. She has since ended the relationship.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Italian police said on Saturday they had freed 33 Indian farm labourers from slave-like working conditions in the northern Verona province and seized almost half a million euros ($545,300) from their two alleged abusers.</p>

<p>Labour exploitation is in the spotlight in Italy following an accident in June in which an Indian fruit picker died after his arm was severed by machinery.</p>

<p>In the latest case, police said the alleged gang masters, also from India, brought fellow nationals to Italy on seasonal work permits, asking them to pay 17,000 euros each and promising them a better future.</p>

<p>The migrants were given farm jobs, working seven days a week and 10-12 hours a day for just 4 euros an hour, which was entirely docked from them until they settled all their debts, the police said, describing the migrants' treatment as "slavery".</p>

<p>Some were asked to continue working for free to pay an additional 13,000 euros for a permanent work permit "which, in reality, would have never been given to them," the police statement said.</p>

<p>The alleged abusers were charged with crimes connected to slavery and labour exploitation, while the victims will be offered protection, work opportunities, and legal residency papers, the police said.</p>

<p>Like other European nations, Italy has growing labour shortages often filled via immigration, particularly in lower-paid jobs, and has a migrant work visa system that has faced cases of fraud.</p>

<p>The country also has a problem with labour law violations. According to 2021 data from national statistics office Istat, about 11% of Italian workers were employed illegally, rising to more than 23% in agriculture.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Last week, his wife Andrezza De Lima posted a photo that included a distinct landmark, enabling police to pinpoint their exact location.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ronald Roland, a Brazilian drug lord, was apprehended by police after successfully evading capture for two years. Shockingly, the breakthrough in the case came from the social media activities of his wife, Andrezza De Lima, whose Instagram posts inadvertently revealed their location, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/07/09/brazillian-drug-lord-arrested-wife-reveals-location-instagram-21191163/">Metro </a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, authorities had been monitoring De Lima's social media accounts for some time, waiting for a slip that would lead them to her husband. De Lima's posts, which included geo-tagged locations and identifiable landmarks, allowed law enforcement to track their whereabouts. Her posts showcased their lavish trips to various exotic destinations like Paris, Dubai, Maldives and Colombia and provided valuable information for the authorities.</p>

<p>Last week,&nbsp;De Lima posted a photo that included a distinct landmark, enabling police to pinpoint their exact location.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was finally captured last Tuesday at his condominium in the coastal town of Guaruja on suspicion of running a sprawling money laundering scheme and supplying drug cartels in Mexico. According to local police, the drug lord made a fortune of 860.2 million pounds in five years which he shuffled through more than 100 shell companies and businesses.</p>

<p>His wife, who was also involved in his criminal activities, used her bikini shop in Guaruja to launder money, sometimes receiving deposits that surpassed 30,000 dollars in a single day.</p>

<p>Following his capture, Roland faces multiple charges related to drug trafficking, organized crime, and evading arrest.</p>

<p>Interestingly, he was also arrested in 2019 after his ex-wife similarly revealed their location on social media.&nbsp;His ex-wife had tagged the location where the couple was in a post on social media, leading to his arrest.</p>

<p>Reports said that police began tailing Roland in 2012 when he worked as an airline pilot. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) sent a letter to Brazil's Federal Police, warning them about an investigation into a group of Brazilian pilots involved in "cocaine smuggling." Since receiving the DEA's letter, Roland became a person of interest in several Brazilian police operations targeting drug trafficking networks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Pakistan court overturned ex-Prime Minister Imran Khan's conviction on illegal marriage charges on Saturday, though he remains jailed over allegations of inciting riots.</p>

<p>Khan was slapped with a trio of convictions in the days before the February elections -- cases he says were orchestrated to prevent his return to power.</p>

<p>Those cases have now all been at least partially rolled back on appeal, with a treason conviction carrying a decade jail term overturned in April, and a 14-year graft sentence suspended in June, though the conviction still stands.</p>

<p>Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi had also been sentenced to seven years for allegedly marrying too soon after her divorce in a breach of Islamic law.</p>

<p>But Islamabad Additional District and Sessions Court judge Afzal Majoka announced Saturday that the "appeals of both Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi are accepted".</p>

<p>Khan remains locked up, though, with a spokesman for his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party saying a court in eastern Lahore had approved his arrest over three cases alleging he incited riots in May 2023.</p>

<p>Spokesman Ahmed Janjua said in a statement it was "yet another gimmick to keep the illegal imprisonment prolonged".</p>

<p><strong>Courting Controversy</strong></p>

<p>Earlier this month a UN panel of experts found Khan's detention "had no legal basis and appears to have been intended to disqualify him from running for political office".</p>

<p>"Thus, from the outset, that prosecution was not grounded in law and was reportedly instrumentalised for a political purpose," it said, calling for his immediate release after nearly a year in jail.</p>

<p>Candidates loyal to Khan won the most seats in the national election but were kept from government by an alliance of military-backed rival parties.</p>

<p>Khan served as prime minister from 2018 to 2022, when he was ousted by a no-confidence vote after falling out with the military establishment, which wields huge influence over civilian politics.</p>

<p>In opposition he waged a campaign of defiance against the top generals, who directly ruled Pakistan for decades of its history, even accusing them of an assassination attempt that wounded him.</p>

<p>But the former cricket star's comeback campaign was hobbled by scores of legal cases, which analysts say were likely brought at the behest of the military establishment.</p>

<p>Gallup Pakistan analyst Bilal Gilani said the rolling back of the cases could suggest the establishment was softening its stance on Khan after the election secured their favoured government -- or that the courts were defying their attempts to keep him confined.</p>

<p>"It is an important judgment, because essentially now there are a limited number of cases left," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"Immediate release is quite impossible, but... the chances of release are getting clearer by the day," he added.</p>

<p>Khan was first briefly arrested in May 2023, sparking nationwide unrest from PTI supporters, some of which targeted military facilities.</p>

<p>The government and military cited the attacks as justification for a sweeping crackdown on PTI, which saw its senior leadership decimated by arrests and defections.</p>

<p>An anti-terrorism court in the eastern city of Lahore on Tuesday refused to grant him bail as police investigate his alleged role in the unrest, despite the fact he was behind bars at the time.</p>

<p><strong>Surviving The Crackdown</strong></p>

<p>PTI candidates were forced to stand as independents in the February 8 elections, which had been repeatedly delayed amid political chaos.</p>

<p>Khan's arrest and conviction for graft back in August 2023 meant he was barred from standing for office himself, confined to a cell in Adiala Jail south of the capital Islamabad.</p>

<p>Despite that, candidates loyal to PTI secured more seats than any other party.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, they were blocked from power by a broad coalition of parties considered more pliable to the influence of the military.</p>

<p>Polling day itself was marred by allegations of vote-tampering amid a nationwide mobile internet blackout Islamabad said it orchestrated over security concerns.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Catherine, Princess of Wales, will attend the Wimbledon Men's final in London on Sunday as she recovers after being diagnosed with cancer, her Kensington Palace office said.</p>

<p>"The Princess of Wales, Patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club will attend the Gentlemen's Singles Final of The Championships, Wimbledon on Sunday 14th July," the palace said in a press release.</p>

<p>UK media also reported that the princess will present the trophy to the winner of the final, which will see Serbian all-time great Novak Djokovic go up against defending Spanish champion Carlos Alcaraz.</p>

<p>Catherine last month tentatively returned to UK public life for the first time since her diagnosis, attending a military parade in London to mark King Charles III's official birthday.</p>

<p>The 42-year-old future queen appeared on the Buckingham Palace balcony, to cheers from the crowds below.</p>

<p>It came nearly three months after the princess revealed she was receiving chemotherapy treatment. She had not been seen at a public engagement since a Christmas Day service last year.</p>

<p>In a statement released at the time, Kate said she was "making good progress" with her treatment, which is set to last for several more months, but was "not out of the woods yet".</p>

<p>"I'm looking forward to attending the King's Birthday Parade this weekend with my family and hope to join a few public engagements over the summer," the princess added.</p>

<p>Angela Perry, a teacher in her 50s from Reading, told AFP at the event that: "She's our future queen. She's so important," calling Kate's reemergence "reassuring".</p>

<p>Kate's cancer announcement came just weeks after it was disclosed that British head of state Charles had also been diagnosed with the condition.</p>

<p>Neither has revealed what type of cancer they have.</p>

<p>Charles, 75, was given the green light to resume public duties in April after doctors said they were "very encouraged" by his progress.</p>

<p>He has since attended commemoration events in northern France for the 80th anniversary of D-Day.</p>

<p>Royal officials are keen to manage expectations about Kate's gradual return to the public eye and have maintained that her appearances will depend on her treatment and recovery.</p>

<p>Kate explained in her statement that she had "good days and bad days" and was "taking each day as it comes".</p>

<p>The King's sister, Princess Anne, took on more duties during the absences of Charles and Catherine but was herself recently put out of action after being hospitalised for five days following an incident involving a horse.</p>

<p>Anne, 73, returned to public duties on Friday, weeks after she was treated for a concussion.</p>

<p>Catherine and her husband William celebrated her return, writing on social media: "Super trooper! So great to see you back so soon!", signing it "W and C x".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[An Israeli airstrike targeted Hamas' military chief Mohammed Deif in Gaza on Saturday, a security official and Israel Army Radio said, in an attack that the enclave's health ministry said had killed at least 71 Palestinians.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Israeli airstrike targeted Hamas' military chief Mohammed Deif in Gaza on Saturday, a security official and Israel Army Radio said, in an attack that the enclave's health ministry said had killed at least 71 Palestinians.</p>

<p>It was unclear whether Deif was killed, the security official said. Army Radio said Deif was hiding in a building in the Israeli-designated humanitarian zone Al-Mawasi, west of the southern city of Khan Younis.</p>

<p>Deif was one of the masterminds of Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel that triggered the war in Gaza. He has survived seven Israeli assassination attempts, the most recent in 2021, and has topped Israel's most-wanted list for decades.</p>

<p>The Gaza health ministry said at least 71 Palestinians had been killed in the strike and 289 injured.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant was holding special consultations, his office said, in light of "developments in Gaza". It was unclear how the strike would affect ceasefire talks underway in Doha and Cairo.</p>

<p>The Hamas-run media office said at least 100 people had been killed and wounded, including members of the Civil Emergency Service. The Israeli military said it was looking into the report.</p>

<p>A senior Hamas official did not confirm whether Deif had been present and called the Israeli allegations "nonsense".</p>

<p>"All the martyrs are civilians and what happened was a grave escalation of the war of genocide, backed by the American support and world silence," Abu Zuhri told Reuters, adding the strike showed Israel was not interested in reaching a ceasefire deal.</p>

<p><strong>Attack "Surprising", Say Witnesses</strong></p>

<p>Reuters footage showed ambulances racing towards the area amidst clouds of smoke and dust. Displaced people, including women and children, were fleeing in panic, some holding belongings in their hands.</p>

<p>Witnesses said the attack was a surprise as the area had been calm, adding more than one missile had been fired. Some of the wounded, who were being evacuated were rescue workers, they said.</p>

<p>"They're all gone, my whole family's gone.. where are my brothers? They're all gone, they're all gone. There's no one left," said one tearful woman, who did not give her name.</p>

<p>"Our children are in pieces, they are in pieces. Shame (on you)," she added.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden today signed "The Resolve Tibet Act" which states that China's ongoing occupation of Tibet must be resolved per the international law peacefully and not through repression.</p>

<p>Biden's government called on China to resume direct dialogue, without preconditions, with the Dalai Lama, or his representatives, to seek a settlement that resolves differences and leads to a negotiated agreement on Tibet.</p>

<p>The act- Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act, popularly known as the Resolve Tibet Act, states that it is American policy that the Tibet issue must be resolved in accordance with international law by peaceful means, through dialogue without preconditions.</p>

<p>"The Resolve Tibet Act cuts to the heart of China's brutal treatment of the Tibetan people," said Tencho Gyatso, President of the International Campaign for Tibet.</p>

<p>The bill sees Tibetans as people with their own religious, cultural, linguistic and historical identity. It recognises that China is suppressing the Tibetans' way of life.</p>

<p>The Dalai Lama has repeatedly called for China to grant genuine autonomy to the Tibetan people, and it is clear under international law that people are entitled to self-determination. When House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-TX) spoke before it passed Congress, he expressed his hopes that the new law will help "put the people of Tibet in charge of their future."</p>

<p>The law promotes a resolution of the dispute between Tibet and China. It empowers Tibet to counter disinformation about Tibet from the Chinese government. Rejects as "inaccurate" China's false claims that Tibet has been part of China since "ancient times."</p>

<p>It promotes dialogue between China and the Dalai Lama without preconditions.<br />
The US can also 'explore activities to improve prospects' to lead a negotiated agreement on Tibet, including coordination with other countries, to bring a negotiated agreement on Tibet.</p>

<p>The Central Tibetan Administration welcomed the agreement.</p>

<p>In a post on X, the Tibetan Administration said, "BREAKING NEWS: Resolve Tibet Act, is now a law after US President Joe Biden signed on 12 July 2024. It helps the US counter misinformation from the PRC and support the rights of Tibetans."</p>

       <description><![CDATA[A two-year-old girl named Parker Scholtes died after being left in a hot car for several hours in Marana, Arizona. Her father, Christopher Scholtes, left her sleeping in the car with the air conditioning on, but the vehicle later shut off.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A two-year-old girl died on Tuesday after spending several hours alone in a hot car. Parker Scholtes was the victim's identity, as given by the Marana Police Department. Parker's father, Christopher Scholtes, 37, reportedly told authorities that she slept out in the back seat of the car when she got home.</p>

<p>Temperatures in Marana soared to 109 degrees Fahrenheit (42.7 degrees Celsius) that day.</p>

<p>Emergency responders were called to the Scholtes residence on Tuesday afternoon after Parker was found unresponsive in the vehicle. Despite medical intervention, the child was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>

<p>According to a release by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.maranaaz.gov/police-press-releases-roll/2024/7/10/child-death-investigation-arrest?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR3KdzIQ2eY2musNFytTbUT5USpHI2SJ9sFHNK8uSDBkmfKNpCcsawoUIx4_aem_e3f_pFfgjmhFgEfhZRGFvA">the police department,</a> "during the initial investigation, the father, identified as 37-year-old Christopher Scholtes, told officers he arrived home, and the 2-year-old girl was still asleep in the vehicle in her car seat. He left the vehicle on and was running in the driveway, with the air conditioning on and the child inside. Christopher told detectives he did not want to wake his daughter up so she could continue sleeping in the vehicle. Christopher then went inside the residence. The mother was not home, but shortly after she arrived, the child was discovered in the vehicle, which was no longer running, and the air conditioning was off. 9-1-1 was called, and the mother performed CPR until NWFD and MPD arrived. NWFD performed life-saving measures, and the child was transported to Banner University Medical Center. Unfortunately, the child was pronounced dead."</p>

<p>Marana Police Detectives were granted a search warrant the night of the incident and conducted a thorough investigation. During the investigation, detectives obtained video surveillance from nearby residences and determined that the child had been in the vehicle for approximately three hours.</p>

<p>On July 12 at 8:38 AM, Christopher Scholtes was arrested and booked into the Pima County Adult Detention Centre for 2nd Degree Murder and Child Abuse related to this tragic event.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees said Friday it had enough funds to continue operating through September, following a pledging conference for the embattled body where UN chief Antonio Guterres pleaded for help from donors.</p>

<p>"We have worked tirelessly with partners to restore confidence in the agency," UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said, after several nations withheld funding following Israeli allegations in January that a number of UNRWA's employees participated in the October 7 attack by Hamas.</p>

<p>Lazzarini said new pledges of funds would help ensure emergency operations until September.</p>

<p>Guterres had pleaded with donors to fund the embattled UN agency, warning that Palestinians would lose a "critical lifeline" without UNRWA.</p>

<p>"Let me be clear -- there is no alternative to UNRWA," he said.</p>

<p>"Just when we thought it couldn't get any worse in Gaza -- somehow, appallingly, civilians are being pushed into ever deeper circles of hell," Guterres added.</p>

<p>According to Guterres, 195 UNRWA staff members have been killed in the war, the highest death toll for staff in UN history.</p>

<p>The US Congress has barred further funding for UNRWA. President Joe Biden's administration has instead directed funding for Palestinian civilians to other bodies while saying that UNRWA is uniquely equipped to distribute aid.</p>

<p>The war started with Hamas's October attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel responded with a military offensive that has killed at least 38,345 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK police on Saturday arrested a man after two suitcases believed to contain the remains of two men were dumped on a famous bridge.</p>

<p>The suitcases were discovered Wednesday after police got a report of a man behaving suspiciously on the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, southwest England.</p>

<p>"Detectives have arrested a man in connection with an investigation into the discovery of human remains on Clifton Suspension Bridge," said Metropolitan Police.</p>

<p>The 24-year-old suspect was detained in Bristol and will be taken to London for questioning later on Saturday.</p>

<p>"Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident," they said.</p>

<p>Metropolitan Police said the victims have not been formally identified, but both are believed to be men.</p>

<p>The London-based force took over the investigation after evidence suggested that the wanted man had travelled to Bristol from the UK capital earlier on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Clifton Suspension Bridge, designed by the pioneering engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, is one of the oldest surviving suspension bridges in the world.</p>

<p>Opened in 1864, the bridge over the Avon Gorge is one of Bristol's top tourist attractions and a symbol of the city.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nepali rescue teams resumed their search early Saturday for at least 63 people missing after monsoon rains triggered a landslide that swept two buses off a highway and into a river.</p>

<p>The force of Friday's landslide in central Chitwan district pushed the vehicles over concrete crash barriers and down a steep embankment, at least 30 metres (100 feet) from the road.</p>

<p>Dozens of rescuers spent hours struggling to comb the raging Trishuli river, an effort hampered by muddy waters and fierce currents, before sunset forced them to call off the search.</p>

<p>No sign of the vehicles or their occupants has yet been found.</p>

<p>"We will search all possible places," Chitwan district chief Indra Dev Yadav told AFP.</p>

<p>"We will employ all our abilities for search and rescue despite the water levels, current and the water's muddiness."</p>

<p>District official Khimananda Bhusal told AFP on Friday that the buses were carrying at least 66 people between them, but three passengers had been able to escape and were treated at a local hospital.</p>

<p>The accident happened before dawn along the Narayanghat-Mugling highway, around 100 kilometres (60 miles) west of Kathmandu.</p>

<p>One bus was heading from the capital to Gaur in Rautahat district in southern Nepal, and the other was en route to Kathmandu from southern Birgunj.</p>

<p>A driver was killed in a separate accident on the same road after a boulder hit his bus. He died as he was being treated at a hospital.</p>

<p>Deadly crashes are common in the Himalayan republic because of poorly constructed roads, badly maintained vehicles and reckless driving.</p>

<p>Nearly 2,400 people lost their lives on Nepal's roads in the 12 months to April, according to government figures.</p>

<p>Twelve people were killed and 24 injured in an accident in January when a bus heading to Kathmandu from Nepalgunj fell into a river.</p>

<p>Road travel becomes deadlier during the annual monsoon season as rains trigger landslides and floods across the mountainous country.</p>

<p>Monsoon rains across South Asia from June to September offer respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies, but also bring widespread death and destruction.</p>

<p>The rainfall is hard to forecast and varies considerably, but scientists say climate change is making the monsoon stronger and more erratic.</p>

<p>Floods, landslides and lightning strikes have killed 88 people across the country since the monsoon began in June, according to police figures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

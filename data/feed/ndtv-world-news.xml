       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations Palestinian refugee agency was sued on Monday by dozens of Israelis who accused it of aiding and abetting the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel.</p>

<p>In a complaint filed with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the plaintiffs said the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) spent more than a decade helping Hamas build what they called the "terror infrastructure" and personnel needed for the attack.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages for what they allege was UNRWA's "aiding and abetting Hamas' genocide, crimes against humanity, and torture," which they said violated international law and the federal Torture Victim Protection Act.</p>

<p>UNRWA declined to comment, saying it had yet to be served with the lawsuit.</p>

<p>The agency has said it takes accusations of staff misconduct seriously, and terminated 10 staff members accused by Israel of involvement in the attack. Two others died, it has said.</p>

<p>UNRWA's commissioner-general, Philippe Lazzarini, and several current and former agency officials are also defendants.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs include 101 people who survived the attack or had relatives who were killed.</p>

<p>While many of their accusations have been made by Israel's government, the plaintiffs want UNRWA held liable for allegedly funneling more than $1 billion from a Manhattan bank account to benefit Hamas, including for weapons, explosives and ammunition.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs accuse UNRWA of providing "safe harbor" to Hamas in its facilities, and letting its schools use Hamas-approved textbooks to indoctrinate Palestinian children to support violence toward and hatred of Jews and Israel.</p>

<p>They also said the attack was "foreseeable" to the defendants, regardless of whether they knew the specifics.</p>

<p>"We are talking about people who have been killed, lost family members and lost homes," Avery Samet, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an interview. "We expect damages will be substantial."</p>

<p>WARNING FROM UNRWA CHIEF</p>

<p>The Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants killed 1,200 people, while about 250 other people were abducted, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>More than 37,000 Palestinians have since been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, health officials in the Hamas-ruled enclave have said.</p>

<p>Several countries including the United States halted funding to UNRWA after Israel alleged that staff members were involved in Hamas' attack.</p>

<p>In April, Norway called on international donors to resume funding UNRWA, after a UN-authorized independent review found that Israel had not provided evidence supporting its accusations that hundreds of UNRWA staff were members of terrorist groups.</p>

<p>On Monday, Lazzarini urged resistance to Israeli efforts to disband UNRWA.</p>

<p>"If we do not push back, other U.N. entities and international organizations will be next, further undermining our multilateral system," Lazzarini said at a meeting of the agency's advisory commission in Geneva.</p>

<p>Established in 1949 after the first Arab-Israeli war, UNRWA provides schooling, healthcare and humanitarian aid in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. It is funded almost entirely by U.N. member states.</p>

<p>The case is Estate of Kedem et al v United Nations Relief and Works Agency et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 24-04765.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Convicted UK baby killer Lucy Letby said on Monday she has never intended or tried to harm any baby in her care, when giving evidence at a retrial for attempted murder.</p>

<p>The former nurse, 34, is accused of trying to kill a baby girl, referred to in court as Child K, at the Countess of Chester Hospital's neo-natal unit on February 17, 2016.</p>

<p>Manchester Crown Court in northwest England has been told that Letby was convicted at a trial that ended last year of murdering seven babies at the unit and the attempted murders of six more between 2015 and 2016.</p>

<p>Reporting restrictions prevent publication of the identities of the surviving and dead children in the case.</p>

<p>The jury has been told that the panel in the first trial could not reach a verdict on the attempted murder charge relating to Baby K, leading to the retrial.</p>

<p>Appearing in the witness box on Monday, Letby responded "no" when asked by her lawyer if she had attempted to murder or harm Child K, or whether she had ever intended to hurt or harm any baby in her care.</p>

<p>The prosecution alleges that a consultant paediatrician walked into the unit's intensive care nursery room and saw Letby standing next to the incubator "doing nothing", as the infant's blood oxygen levels dipped.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Nick Johnson alleged that Letby had displaced the tiny infant's breathing tube.</p>

<p>Child K was transferred to a specialist hospital later the same day because she was born extremely prematurely.</p>

<p>She died there three days later, although the prosecution does not allege Letby caused her death.</p>

<p>Letby, from Hereford, western England, denies one count of attempted murder.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's military claimed on Monday that it killed a senior Hamas weapons expert in the Gaza Strip while the offensive in Rafah city is continuing.</p>

<p>In an update, the military said that an airstrike killed Muhammad Salah, identified as being in charge of projects and development in Hamas' weapons manufacturing headquarters, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>"Salah was part of a project to develop strategic weaponry" and commanded several squads that worked on developing weapons, according to the military.</p>

<p>The military also said that troops were "continuing intelligence-based, targeted operations in the Rafah area", adding that operations were continuing in central Gaza as well.</p>

<p>Israel has been carrying out a large-scale offensive in the Gaza Strip in retaliation for a Hamas rampage on October 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 were taken hostage.</p>

<p>The Israeli assault caused a severe humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian enclave and killed about 37,600 people, according to the health authorities in Gaza.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A new pill that slowly releases ketamine could treat people with severe depression without giving them the psychedelic side effects of the often-misused drug, early trial results suggested on Monday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new pill that slowly releases ketamine could treat people with severe depression without giving them the psychedelic side effects of the often-misused drug, early trial results suggested on Monday.</p>

<p>First developed in the 1960s as an anaesthetic, ketamine's hallucinogenic and dissociative effects led to it becoming a party drug dubbed "Special K".</p>

<p>However, mounting research has demonstrated that ketamine is effective for the roughly quarter of people suffering from depression who see little benefit from common anti-depressant drugs.</p>

<p>In many countries, ketamine has been prescribed for depression for years.</p>

<p>US billionaire Elon Musk told CNN in March that he regularly uses a small amount of prescribed ketamine because it is "helpful for getting one out of the negative frame of mind".</p>

<p>The drug has long been administered intravenously in clinics, but more recently a nasal spray using a derivative called esketamine has increased in popularity.</p>

<p>Both can cause patients to have side effects such as dissociation, high blood pressure and an elevated heart rate.</p>

<p>There are also fears that medical use of the drug could slide into abuse.</p>

<p>The pill described in the journal Nature Medicine on Monday takes more than 10 hours to break down in the liver, lead study author Paul Glue told AFP.</p>

<p>"The really interesting feedback from patients is the lack of side effects -- no euphoria, no dissociation," said the researcher at New Zealand's University of Otago.</p>

<p>"I don't think these tablets would appeal to people who are abusing ketamine."</p>

<p><strong>Electro-shock alternative</strong></p>

<p>The phase 2 trial involved more than 270 people with depression who had previously tried an average of four different anti-depressant drugs.</p>

<p>More than half taking the ketamine pill went into remission for their depression, while 70 percent of the placebo group relapsed after 13 weeks, the study said.</p>

<p>Julaine Allan, an expert on mental health and addiction at Australia's Charles Sturt University who was not involved in the study, praised the trial while emphasising that more research is needed.</p>

<p>Ketamine does not work for everyone, and the "positive effects may wear off over time," she told AFP.</p>

<p>Michel Hoffmann, a psychiatrist at Geneva University Hospitals, said there is "real enthusiasm" in the medical community for ketamine's potential for treating depression.</p>

<p>"For patients who don't respond to conventional drugs, ketamine offers a way to avoid electro-shock therapy," he told AFP.</p>

<p>This last-resort treatment, which involves sending electric currents through the brain, has been proven to be effective.</p>

<p>But it can cause memory loss -- and some patients fear the procedure after seeing depictions of it in films such as "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest".</p>

<p><strong>Fears of 'opioid style crisis'</strong></p>

<p>Some psychiatrists remain hesitant to prescribe ketamine for depression, fearing their patients could end up misusing the drug.</p>

<p>Last year, "Friends" actor Matthew Perry became the latest high-profile death from a ketamine overdose.</p>

<p>US police are investigating how Perry obtained the doses that caused his death -- he had reportedly not had a supervised infusion session for several days.</p>

<p>One potential benefit of quick-acting ketamine seen in previous research is that it could help patients considering suicide.</p>

<p>But there is "the plausible concern that the widespread use of ketamine might trigger a new opioid style crisis," Oxford researcher Riccardo De Giorgi said in a 2022 BMJ editorial.</p>

<p>By ridding ketamine of the side effects sought by some partygoers, the slow-release pill could alleviate some of these concerns.</p>

<p>There were still some side effects from the pill, the most common being headaches, dizziness and anxiety.</p>

<p>More research including phase 3 trials is needed before the drug can be reviewed by national medicine agencies, meaning it will be at least two or three years before patients could potentially access the pills, Glue said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The device, emitting a continuous pulse of current, aims to block or disrupt these abnormal signals.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a world-first trial, a 12-year-old boy named Oran Knowlson from Somerset received a new epilepsy device implanted in his skull. The device, a neurostimulator, sends electrical signals to his brain, significantly reducing his daily seizures by 80%. Oran suffers from Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy that began at age three.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His mother, Justine, told the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg33kgd81mvo"><em>BBC </em></a>that Oran has shown dramatic improvement and described him as "happier" and finally having "a much better quality of life."</p>

<p>Previously, Oran's epilepsy dominated his life. Justine explained last year, "It has robbed him of all of his childhood." The seizures, ranging from dozens to hundreds daily, involved violent shaking, falling, and even loss of consciousness requiring emergency resuscitation.</p>

<p>Oran has autism and ADHD, but Justine says his epilepsy is by far the biggest hurdle: "I had a fairly bright three-year-old, and within a few months of his seizures commencing he deteriorated rapidly, and lost a lot of skills."</p>

<p>Oran's treatment is part of a research project (CADET) testing deep brain stimulation for severe epilepsy. The project involves several hospitals (Great Ormond Street, UCL, King's College, and Oxford) and uses a device with a neurotransmitter made by Amber Therapeutics (UK).</p>

<p>Epileptic seizures result from abnormal bursts of electrical activity in the brain.</p>

<p>The device, emitting a continuous pulse of current, aims to block or disrupt these abnormal signals.</p>

<p>Before the operation, Justine expressed her hope: "I want him to rediscover himself through the haze of seizures. I'd like to have my boy back."</p>

<p>The surgery, lasting approximately eight hours, was conducted in October 2023.</p>

<p>Under the leadership of consultant paediatric neurosurgeon Martin Tisdall, the team inserted two electrodes deep into Oran's brain, precisely reaching the thalamus-a crucial relay station for neuronal information.</p>

<p>The margin of error for placing the electrodes was less than a millimetre.</p>

<p>The ends of the electrodes were connected to the neurostimulator, a device measuring 3.5cm square and 0.6cm thick, which was positioned in a gap in Oran's skull where bone had been removed.</p>

<p>The neurostimulator was then secured into the surrounding skull by screws to anchor it in place.</p>

<p>Previously, deep brain stimulation for childhood epilepsy involved placing neurostimulators in the chest, connected to the brain by wires extending upward. However, this approach is now evolving.</p>

<p>Martin Tisdall told the BBC: "This study is hopefully going to allow us to identify whether deep brain stimulation is an effective treatment for this severe type of epilepsy and is also looking at a new type of device, which is particularly useful in children because the implant is in the skull and not in the chest.</p>

<p>"We hope this will reduce the potential complications."</p>

<p>Steps are taken to lower the risk of postoperative infections and ensure the device's long-term functionality.</p>

<p>After a month of recovery from the surgery, Oran's neurostimulator was activated. Fortunately, it's completely painless and wirelessly rechargeable through headphones, allowing him to enjoy activities like watching TV without any disruption to his daily life.</p>

<p>We visited Oran and his family seven months post-op to see how they were getting on. Justine told us there had been a massive improvement in Oran's epilepsy, "He is more alert and with no drop seizures during the day."<br />
His night-time seizures are also "shorter and less severe".</p>

<p>"I'm definitely getting him back slowly," she said.</p>

<p>Martin Tisdall said: "We are delighted that Oran and his family have seen such a huge benefit from the treatment and that it has dramatically improved his seizures and quality of life."</p>

<p>Oran is now learning riding lessons.</p>

<p>As part of the trial, three more children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome will be fitted with the deep brain neurostimulator.</p>

<p>Currently, Oran gets a constant electrical stimulus from his device.</p>

<p>The Picostim neurotransmitter is made by UK company Amber Therapeutics. It sits under the skull and sends electrical signals deep into the brain, reducing his daytime seizures The CADET pilot will now recruit three additional patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, with a view to 22 patients being recruited to take part in a full trial.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A cyberattack on Indonesia's national data centre compromised hundreds of government offices and caused long delays at the capital's main airport, with the hacker demanding an $8 million ransom, officials said Monday.</p>

<p>Long queues formed at immigration gates at Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport last week after systems went down in the attack, carried out using software developed by Russian ransomware outfit LockBit, an official from the communications ministry said.</p>

<p>The attack "affected 210 institutions at the national and local levels," senior official Semuel Abrijani Pangerapan told reporters on Monday, adding a dark web hacker had demanded a $8 million ransom.</p>

<p>He added that immigration services were returning to normal on Monday morning and work was being done to restore other affected services.</p>

<p>Authorities are still investigating the ransomware, known as Brain Cipher, which made government data inaccessible due to encryption, he said.</p>

<p>LockBit and its affiliates have targeted governments, major companies, schools and hospitals, causing billions of dollars of damage and extracting tens of millions in ransoms from victims.</p>

<p>Typically, their programmes -- once inserted by the ransomware operator into a target's IT systems -- are manipulated to freeze, via encryption, the target's files and data.</p>

<p>The United States, Britain and Australia last month unveiled sanctions against the leader of LockBit, which they accuse of extorting billions of dollars from thousands of victims.</p>

<p>The group was responsible for a quarter of all ransomware attacks worldwide last year, and has extorted "over $1 billion from thousands of victims globally," according to the UK government.</p>

<p>The top five countries hit by LockBit were the United States, Britain, France, Germany and China, according to Europol, the European Union's law enforcement agency.</p>

<p>Indonesia has a weak cyber security record, with poor online literacy and frequent leaks.</p>

<p>In 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic, researchers for encryption provider vpnMentor revealed the data of 1.3 million users of a government test-and-trace app had been compromised.</p>

<p>The reveal came just months after the data of more than 200 million participants of the National Health Care and Social Security Agency (BPJS Kesehatan) was allegedly leaked by hackers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"The king has been kept closely informed and joins the whole royal family in sending his fondest love and well-wishes to the princess for a speedy recovery," it added.</p>

<p>The 73-year-old royal will remain at the hospital in southwest England "unless or until her medical team advise otherwise".</p>

<p>The princess, a keen horsewoman who competed at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, has taken on extra engagements as the king and his daughter-in-law Catherine, Princess of Wales, both recover from cancer.</p>

<p>But her engagements for the week ahead will be postponed, said Buckingham Palace, including her planned attendance at Tuesday's state banquet for the emperor and empress of Japan.</p>

<p>The grounds of Gatcombe Park are renowned for hosting the Festival of British Eventing every year, which attracts the world's best equestrian stars.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The inherent strength of India-Bangladesh relationship was once again in evidence as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bangladesh-pm-sheikh-hasina-arrives-on-2-day-visit-to-india-5938786">Sheikh Hasina, decided to visit New Delhi</a> days after attending the swearing-in ceremony of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/videos/pm-sheikh-hasina-invites-pm-modi-to-bangladesh-806486">Prime Minister Narendra Modi</a>. The ease with which the top leadership in Delhi and Dhaka now interact and engage each other is a tribute to the manner in which Modi and Hasina have managed to build this important partnership over the last decade, often under very difficult circumstances. If Modi had to contend with the opposition at the state level in West Bengal, where the ruling party decided to veto the Teesta Pact, Hasina had to face the anti-India constituency in Bangladesh. Despite this, both leaders stood firm in their belief that building resilience in this partnership is important for not only bilaterally but also regionally.</p>

<h2><strong>"Trusted Friend"</strong></h2>

<p>On her first official overseas visit to any country since she returned to power earlier this year in January, Hasina underlined: "India is our major neighbour, trusted friend and regional partner. Bangladesh-India relations are growing at a fast pace." Modi reciprocated by highlighting the special nature of this visit: "Because she is our first state guest after our government returned to power for the third term."</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/unilateral-discussions-mamata-banerjee-to-pm-on-bangladesh-talks-5959096">Also Read |&nbsp;"Unilateral Discussions...": Mamata Banerjee To PM On Bangladesh Talks</a></strong></p>

<p>The visit saw the signing of 10 Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs), which covered areas as diverse as digital and green partnerships, maritime cooperation, and, notably, the 'Shared Vision for India-Bangladesh Rail Connectivity'. The joint statement outlined a shared bilateral and regional vision for peace, prosperity and development, driven by connectivity, commerce and collaboration. In that spirit, some important new initiatives were announced, including e-visa for patients from Bangladesh, new train and bus services, joint technical committee for Ganga Water Treaty, visit of an Indian technical team to Bangladesh for a mega project to conserve and manage the Teesta river, export of 40 MW of power from Nepal to Bangladesh through Indian grid, and training of Bangladeshi police officers. Building Bangladesh's defence capability has also emerged as a priority, with the two nations deciding "to explore defence industrial cooperation for modernisation of the Armed Forces of Bangladesh".</p>

<h2><strong>Identifying Opportunities, Counterbalancing China</strong></h2>

<p>Hasina will be visiting China in July. It is a sign of a new maturity in India-Bangladesh relations that the two nations continue to work closely together even as they develop their ties with other nations. New Delhi has not stopped Dhaka from its engagement with China but it has some concerns that Hasina has always ensured are addressed. Since 2020, China has been regularly expressing an interest in the $1 billion project to develop the Teesta river. Last year, Beijing submitted a formal proposal.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/tripura-chief-minister-gifts-500-kg-of-queen-pineapples-to-bangladesh-pm-5952493">Also Read |&nbsp;Tripura Chief Minister Gifts 500 Kg Of Queen Pineapples To Bangladesh PM</a></strong></p>

<p>For Bangladesh, this has been a long-standing priority. The Manmohan Singh government had an agreement in place in 2011, which could not be taken forward due to the opposition from the Chief Minister of West Bengal. For Hasina, the situation had become unsustainable, with the opposition clamouring for a response amidst moves by the Chinese. Her visit before going to China was a wise move to ensure that New Delhi had a chance to respond, and India has done well to respond to the initiative. The decision to send an Indian technical team to Dhaka for talks on the conservation and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-bangladesh-agree-on-mega-project-to-conserve-teesta-river-5947924">management of Teesta river</a> is an indication that New Delhi is not willing to cede its strategic space in the neighbourhood despite domestic challenges. The decision to commence technical negotiations for the renewal of the 1996 Ganga Water Treaty is also a timely move to respond to the concerns in Dhaka on an issue that is a priority for the Hasina government.</p>

<h2><strong>Rock-Solid Ties</strong></h2>

<p>For India, the importance of Bangladesh cannot be overstated as New Delhi seeks to emerge as an Indo-Pacific player with the Bay of Bengal as the regional epicentre. For Bangladesh, a partnership with India remains key to realising its full potential as a critical economic and strategic player in the region. As the two nations become more ambitious in defining their strategic outlooks, their bilateral partnership will continue to be a key enabler in shaping their behaviour.</p>

<p>The China factor, while important, should not be overstated. India-Bangladesh ties today stand on their own merit. Hasina and Modi have ensured that by focusing concrete tangible outcomes for the people of both nations, they have redefined the contours of what an ideal partnership between two neighbours should look like. Mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity have made this relationship an exemplar for all others.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twenty-two people were killed -- including 18 Chinese nationals -- in a massive fire at a South Korean lithium battery factory, the fire department said Monday, one of the country's worst factory disasters in years.</p>

<p>Over 100 people were working in the factory when workers heard a series of explosions from the second floor, where lithium-ion batteries were being inspected and packaged, firefighter Kim Jin-young told media.</p>

<p>In the massive blaze that ensued, twenty-two people were killed, including 20 foreign nationals -- 18 Chinese, one from Laos, and one of unknown nationality, he said.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">?? At least 21 people have died in a fire at a lithium battery plant in South Korea. <a href="https://t.co/kzQKnhbOYf">pic.twitter.com/kzQKnhbOYf</a></p>
— Lord Bebo (@MyLordBebo) <a href="https://twitter.com/MyLordBebo/status/1805187422428315651?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 24, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"Most of the bodies are badly burned so it will take some time to identify each one," he added.</p>

<p>Firefighters are still searching for one more person who remains unaccounted for, he said, adding that they had managed to contain the largest blaze at the plant and get inside.</p>

<p>Firefighters were "doing cooling operations to prevent the fire from expanding to nearby factories," Kim said.</p>

<p>Dozens of fire trucks were lined up outside the factory, an AFP reporter saw, with rescue workers carrying bodies, covered by blue blankets, out of the building on stretchers.</p>

<p>Images shared by Yonhap after the fire broke out showed huge plumes of billowing grey smoke rising into the sky above the factory, with orange flames inside the building.</p>

<p>The vast factory had an estimated 35,000 battery cells on the second floor in storage, with more batteries stored in other areas.</p>

<p>Lithium batteries burn hot and fast, and are difficult to control with conventional fire extinguishing methods.</p>

<p>"Due to fears of additional explosions, it was difficult to enter," Kim said, describing the tricky rescue operation.</p>

<p>"As it is a lithium battery manufacturer, we (had) determined that spraying water will not extinguish the fire, so we (used) dry sand," he added.</p>

<p>The lithium battery plant is owned by Aricell, a South Korean primary battery manufacturer. It is located in Hwaseong city, just south of the capital Seoul.</p>

<p>Shares of Aricell's parent company, S-connect, plunged by over 20 percent on the Seoul exchange by close Monday. S-connect owns 96 percent of Aricell.</p>

<p>Lithium batteries are used in everything from laptops to electric vehicles -- but can be highly explosive, with airlines, for example, imposing strict regulations on checking devices containing them.</p>

<p><strong>'Mobilise all personnel'</strong></p>

<p>South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol issued emergency instructions to authorities, telling them to "mobilise all available personnel and equipment to focus on searching for and rescuing people," his office said.</p>

<p>The president also warned authorities that they should "ensure the safety of firefighters considering the rapid spread of fire".</p>

<p>Authorities in Hwaseong sent out a series of alerts to residents warning them to stay inside.</p>

<p>"There is a lot of smoke due to factory fires. Please pay attention to safety, such as refraining from going out," one alert sent by text message said.</p>

<p>"Factory fire. Please detour to surrounding roads and nearby citizens please close windows," another one read.</p>

<p>South Korea is a major producer of batteries, including those used in electric vehicles.</p>

<p>Its battery makers supply EV makers around the world, including Tesla.</p>

<p>The fire is one of South Korea's worst factory disasters in years.</p>

<p>Previously, it's worst chemical plant accident was in 1989 at the Lucky Chemical factory in Yeosu, Southern Jeolla Province, which resulted in 16 deaths and 17 injuries.</p>

<p>A fire at a warehouse in Icheon in 2020 killed 38 people.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video showing a Ukrainian drone destroying a Russian drone using a stick has gone viral on social media platform X. Posted by the user Special Kherson Cat, it shows the unmanned aerial vehicle hovering a few metres above the ground and another one - claimed to be Russian - moving up. A stick is seen hanging from Ukraine's Mavic drone, which is at a higher altitude. As the Russian drone comes closer, the Ukrainian military piece swings the stick sending the Russian drone crashing to the ground.</p>

<p>The video has received more than 32,000 views and several users have commented on it.</p>

<p>"Sustainable warfare, what more could you wish for," commented one user. "This is not exactly what was referred to as fighting with sticks and stones, but here we are," said another.</p>

<p>Others mocked the Ukrainian military for using such primitive weapons to fight a modern warfare.</p>

<p>Drones have become a key piece of technology for both sides in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. According to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-focuses-drone-warfare-military-creates-new-unmanned/story?id=111046806"><em>ABC News</em></a>, Ukraine launched its Unmanned Systems Forces, a new branch of its military focused on drone warfare, in April this year.</p>

<p>Colonel Vadym Sukharevskyi was announced as the new branch's commander.</p>

<p>The DJI Mavic drones were initially used for reconnaissance and dropping grenades. But gradually, they switched to first-person view drones to attack enemy personnel and vehicles.</p>

<p>Shortly after announcing the new defence department, the Ukraine's Ministry of Defence</p>

<p>In the last two years, Ukraine has developed a series of different kinds of aerial, land and water drones to help to fight against the Russians when it doesn't have enough heavy weapons, artillery and jets.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine a future where your phone pings with a message that your dead father's “digital immortal” bot is ready. This promise of chatting with a virtual version of your loved one – perhaps through a virtual reality (VR) headset – is like stepping into a sci-fi movie, both thrilling and a bit eerie.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>As you interact with this digital dad, you find yourself on an emotional rollercoaster. You uncover secrets and stories you never knew, changing how you remember the real person.</p>

<p>This is not a distant, hypothetical scenario. The <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/05/240508201408.htm">digital afterlife industry</a> is rapidly evolving. Several companies promise to create virtual reconstructions of deceased individuals based on their digital footprints.</p>

<p>From artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots and virtual avatars to holograms, this technology offers a strange blend of comfort and disruption. It may pull us into deeply personal experiences that blur the lines between past and present, memory and reality.</p>

<p>As the digital afterlife industry grows, it raises significant <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0335-2">ethical</a> and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-brain-and-value/202009/the-psychology-the-digital-afterlife">emotional challenges</a>. These include concerns about consent, privacy and the psychological impact on the living.</p>

<h2>What is the digital afterlife industry?</h2>

<p>VR and AI technologies are making virtual reconstructions of our loved ones possible. Companies in this niche industry use data from social media posts, emails, text messages and voice recordings to create digital personas that can interact with the living.</p>

<p>Although still niche, the number of players in the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/digital-afterlife">digital afterlife industry</a> is <a href="https://observer.com/2024/05/generative-ai-griefbot-privacy-issue/">growing</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hereafter.ai/">HereAfter</a> allows users to record stories and messages during their lifetime, which can then be accessed by loved ones posthumously. <a href="https://www.mywishes.co.uk/">MyWishes</a> offers the ability to send pre-scheduled messages after death, maintaining a presence in the lives of the living.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hansonrobotics.com/">Hanson Robotics</a> has created robotic busts that interact with people using the memories and personality traits of the deceased. <a href="https://projectdecember.net/">Project December</a> grants users access to so-called “deep AI” to engage in text-based conversations with those who have passed away.</p>

<p>Generative AI also plays a crucial role in the digital afterlife industry. These technologies enable the creation of highly realistic and interactive digital personas. But the high level of realism may blur the line between reality and simulation. This may enhance the user experience, but may also cause emotional and psychological distress.</p>

<h2>A technology ripe for misuse</h2>

<p>Digital afterlife technologies may aid the <a href="https://www.insights.uca.org.au/can-digital-afterlife-technology-help-us-grieve/">grieving process</a> by offering continuity and connection with the deceased. Hearing a loved one's voice or seeing their likeness may provide comfort and help process the loss.</p>

<p>For some of us, these digital immortals could be therapeutic tools. They may help us to preserve positive memories and feel close to loved ones even after they have passed away.</p>

<p>But for others, the emotional impact may be profoundly negative, exacerbating grief rather than alleviating it. AI recreations of loved ones have the potential to cause psychological harm if the bereaved ends up having unwanted interactions with them. It's essentially being subjected to a “<a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/call-for-safeguards-to-prevent-unwanted-hauntings-by-ai-chatbots-of-dead-loved-ones">digital haunting</a>”.</p>

<p>Other <a href="https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/university/news-and-publications/university-of-tuebingen-magazine-attempto/digital-afterlife/">major issues</a> and <a href="https://www.devx.com/news/ethical-dilemmas-surface-with-digital-afterlife-technology/">ethical concerns</a> surrounding this tech include consent, autonomy and privacy.</p>

<p>For example, the deceased may not have agreed to their data being used for a “digital afterlife”.</p>

<p>There's also the risk of misuse and data manipulation. Companies could exploit digital immortals for commercial gain, using them to advertise products or services. Digital personas could be altered to convey messages or behaviours the deceased would never have endorsed.</p>

<h2>We need regulation</h2>

<p>To address concerns around this quickly emerging industry, we need to update our legal frameworks. We need to address issues such as digital estate planning, who inherits the digital personas of the deceased, and digital memory ownership.</p>

<p>The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/">recognises</a> post-mortem <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/">privacy rights</a>, but <a href="https://verfassungsblog.de/data-after-life/">faces challenges in enforcement</a>.</p>

<p>Social media platforms control deceased users' data access, often against heirs' wishes, with clauses like “<a href="https://verfassungsblog.de/data-after-life/">no right of survivorship</a>” complicating matters. Limited platform practices hinder the GDPR's effectiveness. Comprehensive protection demands reevaluating contractual rules, aligning with human rights.</p>

<p>The digital afterlife industry offers comfort and memory preservation, but raises ethical and emotional concerns. Implementing thoughtful regulations and ethical guidelines can honour both the living and the dead, to ensure digital immortality enhances our humanity.</p>

<h2>What can we do?</h2>

<p>Researchers have recommended several <a href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:c059841d-a702-4218-8c1b-39ff49dc6c65/files/mea9feef37e1943dd8446a4013f81d169">ethical guidelines</a> and <a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202403/1308620.shtml">regulations</a>. Some recommendations include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>obtaining informed and documented consent before creating digital personas from people before they die</li>
	<li>age restrictions to protect vulnerable groups</li>
	<li>clear disclaimers to ensure transparency</li>

<p>Drawing from ethical frameworks in archaeology, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0335-2">a 2018 study</a> has suggested treating digital remains as integral to personhood, proposing regulations to ensure dignity, especially in re-creation services.</p>

<p>Dialogue between policymakers, industry and academics is crucial for developing ethical and regulatory solutions. Providers should also offer ways for users to respectfully terminate their interactions with digital personas.</p>

<p>Through careful, responsible development, we can create a future where digital afterlife technologies meaningfully and respectfully honour our loved ones.</p>

<p>As we navigate this brave new world, it is crucial to balance the benefits of staying connected with our loved ones against the potential risks and ethical dilemmas.</p>

<p>By doing so, we can make sure the digital afterlife industry develops in a way that respects the memory of the deceased and supports the emotional wellbeing of the living.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Parasites from human faeces and defaced Western clothing were found in the bags of garbage carried by North Korean balloons into the South, Seoul said Monday.</p>

<p>Pyongyang has sent more than a thousand trash-carrying balloons into the South in recent weeks, in retaliation for leaflets sent northwards by activists opposed to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.</p>

<p>An analysis of the contents of some 70 of the balloons found that they contained soil in which "numerous parasites, such as roundworms, whipworms and threadworms" were detected, South Korea's Ministry of Unification said in a statement.</p>

<p>This is likely because human faeces were used in the soil instead of chemical fertilizers, it added.</p>

<p>It said there was "no risk of land pollution (or) infectious diseases" from the balloons, as the volume of soil sent was relatively low.</p>

<p>The garbage sent by North Korea also revealed the country's woeful economic state, the ministry claimed, pointing to tattered children's clothes and other garments worn to the point of disintegration as evidence.</p>

<p>In addition, it said some clothes from the balloons were previously donated by a South Korean company during an aid drive and were deliberately defaced -- including being slashed with knives.</p>

<p>This appeared to be North Korea "expressing extreme hostility toward the leaflet campaigns and to highlight the adversarial stance against South Korea", a ministry official said.</p>

<p>The two Koreas have been locked in a tit-for-tat "balloon war", with an activist in the South confirming last week that he had floated more balloons carrying propaganda leaflets towards the North.</p>

<p>Immediately after, Kim Yo Jong, leader Kim Jong Un's powerful sister, warned that North Korea is likely to retaliate.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ms Wassenhove has accused the company of intentionally barring her from working after she tried to get transferred to a different part of the same firm because of her disability.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A French woman has sued her former employer for assigning her no work despite paying her full salary for 20 years. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.local12.com/news/offbeat/lawsuit-business-work-a-woman-is-suing-her-company-for-paying-her-without-making-her-france-international-capital-labor-job-occupation-technology-telecommunications-finance-communications">Laurence Van Wassenhove</a> has filed a lawsuit against Orange, a large telecommunications company,&nbsp; accusing it of intentionally barring her from working after she tried to get transferred to a different part of the same firm because of her disability.</p>

<p>In 1993, Ms Wassenhove reportedly joined the telecommunication company as a secretary and human resources representative, which accommodated her partial paralysis and epilepsy. In 2002, she tried to get a transfer within the company and was approved.<br />
<br />
Ms Wassenhove has alleged that the firm stopped assigning her tasks at the time due to her inadequate performance in the new position. However, despite this, Ms Wassenhove's employer did not stop paying her salary.</p>

<p>A report by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/28564314/i-was-ordered-to-do-no-work-im-suing/">The Sun </a>claimed that now Ms Wassenhove finds her situation “very hard to bear.”</p>

<p>The report claimed that initially, Orange employed her as a civil servant. But due to her condition, Ms Wassenhove was offered a secretary position to accommodate her health needs.</p>

<p>Ms Wassenhove is a mother of two children, of whom one is autistic. In a conversation with The Sun, she claimed that despite being paid her salary, it did not save her from facing eviction notices and struggling to make ends meet.</p>

<p>The company conducted an occupational medicine report, confirming that the position was not suitable for Ms Wassenhove, added the report.</p>

<p>After this, the firm put Ms Wassenhove on standby. And before eventually offering her retirement due to her disability, the company put her on sick leave.</p>

<p>However, the company continued to pay her full salary while Ms Wassenhove was not assigned any work to do.</p>

<p>Calling herself "an outcast secretary", Ms Wassenhive claimed that her firm did this to push her to quit her job. In 2015, she filed a complaint to the government and High Authority for the Fight against Discrimination but not much changed.</p>

<p>The report quoted her as saying, “Being paid, at home, not working is not a privilege. It's very hard to bear.”</p>

<p>The firm, however, claimed it had done everything to ensure she worked in the best conditions possible, according to the report.</p>

<p>They also added that "a return to work in an adapted position" was also planned but never happened as Ms Wassenhove reportedly was regularly on sick leave.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tamayo Perry, who appeared in the <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> franchise, has died after being attacked by a shark. According to <em>Sky News</em>, Mr Perry, an Ocean Safety lifeguard and surfing instructor, was attacked by a shark off Oahu in Hawaii. The attack took place near Goat Island on Sunday and Mr Perry was spotted by a man who alerted the emergency services. When the officials arrived at the scene, they brought Mr Perry to shore by jet ski. But the actor was pronounced dead on the beach.</p>

<p>The 49-year-old had also appeared in <em>Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle</em> and <em>Blue Crush</em>, as per the <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/pirates-of-the-caribbean-actor-tamayo-perry-dies-after-being-attacked-by-shark-while-surfing-in-hawaii-13157896"><em>Sky News</em> report</a>. He also had a role in <em>Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides</em>, the fourth film in the franchise.</p>

<p>Released in 2011, it also featured Penelope Cruz and Geoffrey Rush.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1117lwlxyo">The <em>BBC</em></a> quoted acting Honolulu Ocean Safety chief Kurt Lager as saying that Mr Perry was "a lifeguard loved by all". He added that Me Perry was well known on Oahu's North Shore as well as around the world.</p>

<p>"Tamayo's personality was infectious, and as much as people loved him, he loved everyone else more. Our condolences go out to Tamayo's family," said Mr Lager.</p>

<p>Mayor Rick Blangiardi echoed similar sentiments, calling Perry's death "a tragic loss", as per the <em>BBC</em> report.</p>

<p>"Tamayo was a legendary waterman and highly respected, he grew up right over here, and just a great member of our ocean safety team," the Mayor further said.</p>

<p>Mr Perry, who worked as a lifeguard on the North Shore, began his career with the Ocean Safety department in July 2016, the <em>Sky News</em> report said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democracy is not a crime and autocracy is the real "evil", Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said on Monday after China threatened to impose the death penalty in extreme cases for "diehard" Taiwan independence separatists.</p>

<p>China, which views Taiwan as its own territory, has made no secret of its dislike of Lai, who took office last month, saying he is a "separatist", and staged war games shortly after his inauguration.</p>

<p>On Friday, China ramped up its pressure on Taiwan by issuing new legal guidelines to punish those it says support the island's formal independence, though Chinese courts have no jurisdiction on the democratically governed island.</p>

<p>Asked about China's move at a news conference at the presidential office in Taipei, Lai first reiterated his sympathy for recent flooding in southern China before responding.</p>

<p>"I want to stress: democracy is not a crime; it's autocracy that is the real evil. China has absolutely no right to sanction Taiwan's people just because of the positions they hold. What's more, China has no right to go after Taiwan people's rights across borders," he said.</p>

<p>According to China, anyone who does not uphold "reunification" is therefore a Taiwan independence supporter, Lai added.</p>

<p>"I also want to call on China to face up to the existence of the Republic of China and have exchanges and dialogue with Taiwan's democratically elected, legitimate government," he said, using Taiwan's formal name. "If this is not done, relations between Taiwan and China will only become more and more estranged."</p>

<p>Taiwan said that since Thursday, there has been a sharp increase in Chinese military flights as Beijing carried out a "joint combat readiness patrol" near the island.</p>

<p>Between Thursday and Sunday, Taiwan says it detected 115 Chinese military aircraft operating nearby, getting as close at 31 nautical miles (57 km) from the southern tip of the island.</p>

<p>Taiwan has said that for the past four years, China has carried out regular military activity around the island as part of a "grey zone" pressure campaign.</p>

<p>Taiwan's annual Han Kuang war games next month will aim to mimic actual combat as closely as possible given a rapidly rising "enemy threat" from China, a senior official said.</p>

<p>Lai rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims and says only Taiwan's people can decide their future. He has repeatedly offered talks with China but has been rebuffed.</p>

<p>China says any move by Taiwan to declare formal independence would be grounds to attack the island.</p>

<p>The government in Taipei says Taiwan is already an independent country, the Republic of China, and that it does not plan to change that. The Republican government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's Communists.</p>

<p>Lai also faces domestic challenges, as his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lost its majority in parliament in the same election in January that brought him to power.</p>

<p>Speaking at the same news conference, Lai said he would ask the constitutional court to stay a package of contested parliament reforms the opposition has passed and consider whether they comply with the constitution.</p>

<p>The opposition says the reforms, which among other things criminalise contempt of parliament by government officials, are needed to bring more accountability, but the DPP says they were forced through without proper discussion.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The killer was only 14 and had lived in youth homes as a ward of the authorities since he was eight.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The killer was only 14 and had lived in youth homes as a ward of the authorities since he was eight.</p>

<p>A year ago, a gang helped the boy escape, put him up in a hotel, and gave him cannabis, food, and new clothes. Six days later, gang members told him it was time to repay them for their kindness. They had a job for him.</p>

<p>Together with another youth, the boy, who as a juvenile cannot be identified, shot dead a 33-year-old Hells Angels biker. He was convicted by a court that described the case as a gangland contract killing.</p>

<p>As he was too young to be sentenced, he was handed back to social services and sent to another youth home.</p>

<p>Sweden has long prided itself on one of the world's most generous social safety nets, with a state that looks after vulnerable people at all stages of life.</p>

<p>But these days it also has another distinction: by far the highest per capita rate of gun violence in the EU. Last year 55 people were shot dead in 363 separate shootings in a country of just 10 million people. By comparison, there were just six fatal shootings in the three other Nordic countries - Norway, Finland, and Denmark - combined.</p>

<p>In an increasing number of cases, courts have found the epidemic of violence emerging from Sweden's archipelago of youth homes, built to serve the dual purpose of looking after children in state care and punishing youth offenders.</p>

<p>According to accounts for this story from eight sources including a former gang member, several youth home workers, prosecutors and criminologists, the homes have turned into recruiting grounds for gangs, who use them to enlist killers too young to be jailed.</p>

<h3><strong>TROUBLED TEEN TO 'CAREER CRIMINAL'</strong></h3>

<p>Yayha, now 23, was first sent to a youth home at 16, finding himself bunking with seven other boys in a dormitory wing in Gothenburg, the gritty port city on Sweden's west coast that houses the biggest harbour in Scandinavia.</p>

<p>His father had died a couple of years earlier. He had dropped out of school and was convicted of assault and theft, beating up other kids, and stealing their phones and clothes.</p>

<p>During his year in the home, members of one of Gothenburg's criminal gangs became his new family, he told Reuters in a coffee shop by the harbour in the city where he now works as a carpenter after escaping the gang life.</p>

<p>"I was a troubled teen when I entered and came out a career criminal. I went from fighting and stealing from other kids to selling drugs by the kilo," said Yayha, who asked that his surname not be used to prevent his former gang from finding him.</p>

<p>"You wanted the respect, the clothes, the rings, the money but also friendship. They were the people you hung out with anyway. Later it became more serious and you had to do things that you really didn't want to, but that is the way it works."</p>

<p>The wave of violence has come to overshadow all else in Swedish politics, driving the rise of a rightwing coalition with the support of the far right, which came to power in 2022, ending the latest eight-year period of rule by the Social Democrats, Sweden's dominant political party since the 1930s.</p>

<p>The new government has promised to tackle crime. So far it has further restricted Sweden's previously generous immigration policies, introduced harsher sentences for gun crimes, and given police increased surveillance powers. Even the military has been called on to help out.</p>

<p>"It is obvious that our system wasn't built for this type of criminality," Justice Minister Gunnar Strommer told Reuters.</p>

<p>He said the government was working on a revamp of the entire youth criminality prevention system, including giving more powers to social services. New youth prisons would house the most hardened criminals, keeping them separate from youth homes.</p>

<p>"I think it is clear that in reality, the state-run homes have functioned as a kind of recruitment base from the criminal networks," Strommer said. "It's a monumental failure."</p>

<h3><strong>'LINKEDIN FOR YOUNG CRIMINALS'</strong></h3>

<p>Sweden's youth homes have varying degrees of security, with around 700 of the most troubled youths housed in 21 homes run by a state body, the National Board of Institutional Care (SiS).</p>

<p>Children with social problems can find themselves sleeping in beds next to those who have committed serious crimes. Most children stay for less than a year but some can be held for up to four years.</p>

<p>The homes are often fenced off, with schools and parks on the premises. While the youths are not allowed to leave without permission, security is often lax.</p>

<p>Residents have access to phones and tablets making it possible for gang members to contact them from outside. In one case now being tried, prosecutors have charged a boy of 15 with planning and ordering three murders in Stockholm from inside a youth home.</p>

<p>Birgitta Dahlberg, head of youth care at the SiS, told Reuters it was unfair to blame the homes for their inability to deal with serious violent offenders, which they were not designed to handle.</p>

<p>"When it comes to serious criminality, it is fair to say that the legislation has not given us the right conditions," she said, noting that until regulations were changed just weeks ago staff did not even have sufficient authority to take away residents' mobile phones.</p>

<p>Children as young as 12 are often gang members already by the time they arrive, said Alexander, who works at the Gothenburg home where Yahya stayed. He declined to give his surname as he was not authorised to speak publicly.</p>

<p>"Out of our 40 boys, around half are gang affiliated when they come here," he told Reuters.</p>

<p>"If you put two new kids in a wing where six out of eight inmates are with the Foxtrot gang, it doesn't take a genius to figure out what could happen," he said, referring to one of the largest gangs believed to have hundreds of members.</p>

<p>Two other youth home workers, speaking on condition of anonymity, gave similar accounts of rampant gang membership among their charges.</p>

<p>In theory, the youth homes aim to rehabilitate young offenders to prevent them from becoming adult criminals. But according to a report released weeks ago by the Swedish National Audit Office which supervises the government, nine out of ten gang-affiliated youngsters at youth homes go on to relapse into crime, and almost eight out of ten eventually end up in prison.</p>

<p>The youth homes seem to do more harm than good, said Stockholm prosecutor Lisa dos Santos, who has handled numerous cases of youth gang crimes.</p>

<p>"One police officer described them as LinkedIn for young criminals," she said. "You wonder what effect they have had in spreading gang crime when boys from different parts of the country are put together."</p>

<p>While Swedish law allows criminal prosecution of people as young as 15, those under 18 are very rarely sent to prison even for serious crimes. Dos Santos said gangs are exploiting this, deliberately recruiting children to commit acts that would lead to a long jail sentence for an adult.</p>

<p>Sweden has about 14,000 active gang criminals and an additional 48,000 people loosely affiliated with gangs, according to a police report last year.</p>

<p>Other European countries such as the Netherlands, France, and Belgium are also struggling with violent gangs, but Sweden has outpaced them all in gun violence, by wide margins.</p>

<p>In 2022, there were 73 youths in Sweden aged 15-20 suspected of murder or attempted murder with firearms, up from just 10 a decade earlier, according to the Crime Prevention Board, a government agency.</p>

<p>According to EU statistics agency Eurostat, 25 people aged 15-24 were killed by gun violence in Sweden in 2021, second in the EU only to France, which had 40 such deaths across a population six times the size of Sweden's.</p>

<p>Nils Duquet, director of the Flemish Peace Institute, a leading European gun violence think tank, said the reliance of Sweden's gangs on young recruits to commit violent crimes had created a different culture around guns than elsewhere in Europe.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, criminal gangs tend to reserve access to guns for older and more senior members, he said. In Sweden, the youngest are expected to pull the trigger.</p>

<p>"Because there are so many young criminals with access to guns, that makes it so violent," Duquet said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sabia Akram has spent most of her life campaigning for Britain's opposition Labour Party but she will not celebrate if it wins the July 4 election, having quit over leader Keir Starmer's handling of issues around the war in Gaza and race.</p>

<p>The Labour Party holds a commanding lead in opinion polls after Starmer steered it back to the centre ground following a trouncing at the 2019 election under his predecessor, veteran socialist Jeremy Corbyn.</p>

<p>But he has lost the support of some Black and Asian voters who traditionally vote Labour over his support for Israel and for only gradually shifting the party's position towards supporting a ceasefire in Gaza.</p>

<p>Labour's treatment of Diane Abbott, Britain's first Black woman lawmaker, and the blocking of a Muslim candidate has also alienated some voters, according to interviews with voters, a pollster, political activists and academics.</p>

<p>Starmer sought to move the party back to the centre ground, promoting candidates for the election who would vote as a disciplined bloc if they win, and that shift has alienated some ethnic minorities who backed Corbyn and his left-wing vision.</p>

<p>Sofia Collignon, associate professor at Queen Mary University, said while the party revamp was working nationally, it had caused strains among members and voters and Starmer's challenge was to hold all the different strands together.</p>

<p>Critics like Akram say he has sold Labour's "soul in order to seek the keys to No 10", the residence of British prime ministers.</p>

<p>"It's no longer defined by its values and its core principles," she said, adding that the party had become a home for whoever wanted to join, citing a right-wing lawmaker who defected from the ruling Conservatives.</p>

<p>A long-running Ipsos poll of ethnic minority voting intentions found that Starmer, in the second half of 2023, had the lowest net satisfaction rating of any Labour opposition leader since the series began in 1996.</p>

<p>With its 20-point lead in opinion polls, concerns among ethnic minorities may not affect the election result, Keiran Pedley at Ipsos said, but added: "If these trends are lasting - and we don't know if they will - then it's possible it could become more politically significant."</p>

<p>Akram, 43, resigned as a Labour councillor in Slough, west of London, in early June along with six others, citing what she saw as censorship around Gaza which meant she could not criticise Israel. She also cited the treatment of Faiza Shaheen, who was blocked from standing as a Labour candidate in a northeast London seat.</p>

<p>Shaheen said she had been told it was over historic tweets she liked which criticised Israeli supporters. She apologised but told the BBC she also thought it was because she was left-wing. She is standing as an independent.</p>

<p>The Labour Party did not respond to a Reuters request for comment about the allegations.</p>

<p>Last month Starmer, speaking after his party won a parliament seat in northern England and control of several councils across England, acknowledged Gaza had had an impact on Labour support in some areas.</p>

<h3><strong>BALANCING ACT</strong></h3>

<p>Akram also criticised the treatment of Abbott, a close Corbyn ally, who was suspended from Labour for over a year after she said Jewish, Irish and Traveller people did not face racism all their lives.</p>

<p>Media reports initially said she would be blocked from running in the election, sparking anger from some voters, before the party said she was welcome to stand as its candidate again.</p>

<p>Ngozi Fulani, founder and CEO of domestic abuse charity Sistah Space which is based in Abbott's neighbourhood of Hackney, said many Black people had wanted her to run as an independent.</p>

<p>"Most Black people have always voted Labour, that's my experience," she told Reuters. "(But) the Labour Party have been in decline ... we don't feel an association," she said, adding that Starmer's Labour didn't "take too much interest in matters that affect us specifically".</p>

<p>Hackney, a northeast London neighbourhood where 21% of the population is Black, is among the capital's most deprived areas, with more than one in three households living below the poverty line after housing costs are accounted for.</p>

<p>Of the 18 people Reuters interviewed there who have supported Abbott for nearly four decades, 14 said they thought she had been treated badly and that they would vote for her in the upcoming election following her reinstatement.</p>

<p>Starmer, the country's former chief prosecutor, became Labour leader in April 2020, vowing reform after the equalities watchdog said the party had discriminated against Jews.</p>

<p>A 2022 independent investigation also found structural racism, sexism and factionalism in the party, and a "hierarchy of racism" where tackling antisemitism was the priority.</p>

<p>Labour has long been the political home of many ethnic minority voters and according to British Future, a think tank, one in five of its election candidates are from an ethnic minority background. The last census in 2021 said 18% of the population in England and Wales were ethnic minorities.</p>

<p>However, other parties - including Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservatives - have more visible representation in government and party structures than Labour, which might incline voters towards them more in future.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Around 20 bodies have been found at a South Korean lithium battery factory after a massive blaze on Monday, the Yonhap news agency said, with firefighters saying they were still searching the building.</p>

<p>Over 100 people were working in the factory when workers heard a series of explosions from the second floor, where lithium-ion batteries are inspected and packaged, firefighter Kim Jin-young told media.</p>

<p>Some 78 people were confirmed safe but many more were still missing, with Yonhap saying that "about 20 bodies (were) found" at the site, after rescue workers finally managed to get inside.</p>

<p>Kim told media that they had managed to put out the largest fire at the factory and were pulling bodies out of the charred building.</p>

<p>"A rescue team has gone inside and is carrying out search and rescue operations," he said.</p>

<p>Images shared by Yonhap after the fire broke out showed huge plumes of billowing grey smoke rising into the sky above the factory, with orange flames inside the building. Dozens of fire engines were seen outside.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The vast factory had an estimated 35,000 battery cells on the second floor in storage, with more batteries stored in other areas.</p>

<p>Lithium batteries burn hot and fast, and are difficult to control with conventional fire extinguishing methods.</p>

<p>"Due to fears of additional explosions, it was difficult to enter," Kim said.</p>

<p>"As it is a lithium battery manufacturer, we determined that spraying water will not extinguish the fire, so we are currently using dry sand," he added.</p>

<p>The lithium battery plant is owned by Aricell, a South Korean primary battery manufacturer. It is located in Hwaseong city, just south of the capital Seoul.</p>

<p>Lithium batteries are used in everything from laptops to electric vehicles -- but can be highly explosive, with airlines, for example, imposing strict regulations on checking devices containing them.</p>

<h3><strong>'Mobilise all personnel'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol issued emergency instructions to authorities, telling them to "mobilise all available personnel and equipment to focus on searching for and rescuing people," his office said.</p>

<p>The president also warned authorities that they should "ensure the safety of firefighters considering the rapid spread of fire".</p>

<p>Firefighting and rescue efforts were ongoing, and the cause of the fire was unknown.</p>

<p>Authorities in Hwaseong sent out a series of alerts to residents warning them to stay inside.</p>

<p>"There is a lot of smoke due to factory fires. Please pay attention to safety, such as refraining from going out," one alert sent by text message said.</p>

<p>"Factory fire. Please detour to surrounding roads and nearby citizens please close windows," another one read.</p>

<p>South Korea is a major producer of batteries, including those used in electric vehicles.</p>

<p>Its battery makers supply EV makers around the world, including Tesla.</p>

<p>South Korea is also one of the world's largest producers of high-end semiconductors, and the government has invested heavily in key technologies including displays and batteries.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly 166 million people worldwide are estimated to need urgent action against hunger, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a global partnership which measures food insecurity.</p>

<p>That includes nearly everyone in the Gaza Strip, where the Israeli military launched an offensive in October following an attack on Israel by Hamas militants. More than one million of Gaza's inhabitants face the most extreme form of malnutrition - classified by the IPC as 'Catastrophe or Famine.'</p>

<p>Seven-month-old Majd Salem is one of them.</p>

<p>Born on Nov. 1, three weeks after Israel launched the offensive, the child was being treated for a chest infection in the neonatal ICU at Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza on May 9. The nurse caring for him said he was suffering from severe malnutrition.</p>

<p>Majd was born at a healthy weight of 3.5 kg (7.7 pounds), said his mother, Nisreen al-Khateeb.</p>

<p>By May, when he was six months old, his weight had barely changed to 3.8 kg, she said - around 3 kg less than would be expected for a baby his age.</p>

<p>Majd, whose eyes keenly followed visiting reporters in the ward, had to be given antibiotics for the infection and fortified milk to boost his weight, his mother said. Reuters was unable to trace them after May 21, when the hospital was evacuated following an Israeli raid.</p>

<p>One in three children in northern Gaza are acutely malnourished or suffering from wasting, according to the U.N. children's agency UNICEF, citing data from its partners on the ground. Ismail Al-Thawabta, director of the Hamas-run government media office, said their records showed 33 people had died of malnutrition in Gaza including 29 children, but added that the number could be higher.</p>

<p>COGAT, an Israeli defence ministry agency tasked with coordinating aid deliveries into Palestinian territories, did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Israel's foreign ministry in late May issued a detailed statement questioning the IPC's methods of analysis, which it said omitted measures Israel had taken to improve access to food in Gaza. The IPC declined to comment.</p>

<p>The plight of Gaza's children is part of a bigger trend. Globally last year more than 36 million children under 5 were acutely malnourished, nearly 10 million of them severely, according to the Global Report on Food Crises, a collaborative analysis of food insecurity by 16 international organizations.</p>

<p>The food shortage in Gaza, while particularly widespread, comes amid a broader spike in extreme hunger as conflicts around the world intensify.</p>

<p>Two other countries - South Sudan and Mali - each have thousands of people living in zones listed on the IPC website as facing famine. Another 35 - including Sudan, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo - have many people in the IPC's next-most acute category of food deprivation.</p>

<p>The IPC, a grouping of United Nations agencies, national governments and non-governmental organizations, is expected to update its assessment of the picture in war-torn Sudan in the coming weeks. A preliminary projection reported by Reuters earlier this month said as many as 756,000 people in Sudan could face catastrophic food shortages by September.</p>

<p>Gaza's hunger crisis is also a product of war. The Israeli military invaded the Strip in response to the Oct. 7 cross-border assault by Hamas on Israel. More than 37,000 Palestinians and nearly 1,500 Israelis have been killed since then, Gazan and Israeli tallies show.</p>

<p>The Israeli assault has destroyed swathes of Gazan farmland. In the early days of the war, Israel imposed a total blockade on Gaza. It later allowed some humanitarian supplies to enter but is still facing international calls to let in more.</p>

<p>The International Criminal Court's prosecutor, in seeking arrest warrants for Israeli and Hamas leaders, last month accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant of using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, among other alleged crimes. Netanyahu, calling that move "a moral outrage of historic proportions," said Israel is fighting in full compliance with international law and taking unprecedented measures to ensure aid reaches those in need.</p>

<p>Israel has accused Hamas of stealing aid, which Hamas strongly denies. Israel has also said any distribution problems within Gaza are the fault of the international agencies.</p>

<p>Even when children survive, nutrition experts say food deprivation in the early years can do lasting damage.</p>

<p>A child's brain develops at its fastest rate in the first two years of life. So even if they don't starve to death or die from illness due to their weakened immune system, children may face delays in growth and development, said Aashima Garg, adviser on nutrition at UNICEF for the Middle East and North Africa.</p>

<p>"While they may be alive, they may not thrive that well in childhood and beyond," she said.</p>

<p>Three families in Gaza told Reuters about their day-to-day diets, and four global health experts explained how such deprivation affects the growing body. Damage done in weeks manifests over years, they said.</p>

<p>"It can have a long-term impact on their immune system, their ability to absorb good nutrition, and on their cognitive and physical development," said Hannah Stephenson, global head of nutrition and health at Save The Children, a non-profit.</p>

<h3><strong>FIRST DAYS</strong></h3>

<p>Gaza has the most households globally in the most extreme stage of food poverty, according to the IPC, which classifies levels of hunger in five categories, the worst of which is famine.</p>

<p>Households in North Gaza, where Majd lives, are already suffering a full-blown famine, Cindy McCain, Executive Director of the World Food Programme, said on May 5.</p>

<p>It can take months for the international measurement system to declare a famine. But the first damage to a child's body is counted in days.</p>

<p>Nine out of 10 children aged 6 months to 2 years in Gaza live in severe child food poverty, a UNICEF survey in late May found. This means they are eating from two or fewer food groups a day, which UNICEF's Garg said means grains or some form of milk.</p>

<p>This has been the case since December 2023, with only a slight improvement in April 2024, she said. As many as 85% of children of all ages did not eat for a whole day at least once in the three days before the survey was conducted.</p>

<p>The main cause of acute malnutrition in North Gaza is a lack of diversity in the diets of children and pregnant and breastfeeding women, according to a report in February 2024 from the Global Nutrition Cluster, a group of humanitarian agencies led by UNICEF.</p>

<p>This deficient intake, both prior to and during pregnancy and breastfeeding, harms both mothers and infants.</p>

<p>Abed Abu Mustafa, 49, a father of six, was still living in Gaza City in early April. He said people there already had eaten "almost every green plant we could find" and he hadn't had meat or chicken for at least five months.</p>

<p>In Rafah in the south, Mariam, 33, a mother of five, has been living in a school along with two dozen of her relatives. She described a typical meal for her family before the conflict and what they are currently eating, shown below.</p>

<p>Before the war, Majd's mother said an average family meal consisted of rice with chicken or meat, along with vegetables such as okra, cauliflower or peas. During the war, flour scarcity forced the family to make bread from animal feed. Recently, bread and canned goods like tuna and beans started to reappear, but these are not widely available.</p>

<p>Unable to find food to feed herself and forced to flee Israeli bombardment early in the war, Khateeb said she had found great difficulty in breastfeeding Majd.</p>

<p>She said she could find neither good quality baby formula nor clean water to mix it, so she fed him various types of powdered feed mixed with rainwater or brackish water from Gaza's polluted wells, causing diarrhoea.</p>

<p>"There is no chance to get proper food to have breastmilk, there is no meat, no proteins, no calcium, none of the elements that produce good milk for the child," she said.</p>

<p>Garg, the UNICEF adviser, said the nutrition of breastfeeding mothers in Gaza was severely compromised, and with it their ability to produce milk.</p>

<p>"They are not eating fruits and vegetables. They are not eating meat. They are not having much milk," she said. This lack of nutrients translates into poor quality breast milk. Diluted formula is not safe and risks diarrhoea, which itself can be deadly.</p>

<p>Moderately malnourished mothers can still breastfeed, with their bodies effectively sacrificing their own nutritional needs to save the child. But severely malnourished women struggle.</p>

<p>Ahmed al-Kahlout, the nurse who heads the unit, said Majd's infection was due to malnutrition.</p>

<p>"There is no immunity, so any disease that the child catches in the shelters ... afflicts the child with these severe lung infections," he said.</p>

<p>Susceptibility to infections typically increases after two weeks with insufficient food.</p>

<p>The body's consumption of its fat reserves eats away muscle tissue, which is why aid workers in the field use basic tape measures to assess the gravity of children's conditions.</p>

<p>The tapes measuring Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) have been used for decades. If the upper arm's circumference is 11.5 cm (4 1/2 inches) or smaller for a child between 6 months and 5 years old, the child is assessed as having severe acute malnutrition, according to standards drawn up by the United Nations.</p>

<p>MUAC screening data across Gaza since mid-January found more than 7,000 children aged 6 months to about 5 years were already acutely malnourished as of May 26, the United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA said.</p>

<p>This is how that looks.</p>

<p>Gaza has the most people at risk of starvation, but according to the IPC classifications, many millions are one step behind the enclave in food poverty.</p>

<p>The IPC categorises the severity and scale of food insecurity and malnutrition. Readings of 3, 4 or 5 on the five-category scale require urgent action.</p>

<p>Households in Phase 3 are in "Crisis," the IPC says. They have high or more than usual acute malnutrition, or can meet their minimum food needs but only by selling assets or through crisis measures.</p>

<p>Phase 4 is an "Emergency." Households have either "very high" acute malnutrition and death rates or are only able to make up for the lack of food by taking emergency measures and selling assets.</p>

<p>Phase 5 is "Catastrophe" or "Famine." Households have an extreme lack of food and/or other basic needs and starvation, death, destitution and extremely critical acute malnutrition levels are evident. An entire area is only classified as in Famine if high food insecurity comes with certain levels of acute malnutrition and mortality.</p>

<p>For the IPC, areas in Famine meet at least two of the following three criteria:</p>

<p>* the area has at least 20% of households facing an extreme lack of food,</p>

<p>* About one in three children there suffer from acute malnutrition,</p>

<p>* Two adults or four children out of every 10,000 die each day due to outright starvation, or to the interaction of malnutrition and disease.</p>

<p>The IPC report issued in March projected that the entire population of the Gaza Strip would fall into Phases 3 to 5 between March and July. U.N. officials told Reuters they expect the next IPC analysis on Gaza to be released on June 25.</p>

<p>South Sudan and Mali are the other two other countries with households projected to fall into the same Phase 5 category as Gaza, based on the IPC's latest published analyses.</p>

<p>Overall, the three countries with the largest numbers of people at Phase 3 and above are Nigeria (25 million), the Democratic Republic of Congo (23.4 million) and Sudan (17.7 million), according to the IPC website.</p>

<p>The IPC said its latest analysis of Sudan, conducted in December, was too outdated to include in the tables Reuters used for this chart.</p>

<p>As a consequence of severe malnutrition, various complications arise.</p>

<p>This is the impact of starvation after just three weeks. Like many children in Gaza, Majd's lack of adequate food dates back months.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Most people in Karachi feel unsafe as the rate of violent crime has soared in the metropolitan city of nearly 20 million population, said Bashir Babu, a factory worker who has been a mugging victim twice.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most people in Karachi city of Pakistan's Sindh province feel unsafe as the metropolitan city reported about 45,000 incidents of street crimes and mugging in the first eight months of 2024, the police said on Monday.</p>

<p>Last year, 118 people were killed in street crimes and mugging incidents while this year the figure is close to 100, the Police Citizens Liaison Committee said.</p>

<p>Most people in Karachi feel unsafe as the rate of violent crime has soared in the metropolitan city of nearly 20 million population, said Bashir Babu, a factory worker who has been a mugging victim twice.</p>

<p>"Criminals are operating brazenly during daytime or night and one doesn't feel safe going out as the fear of mugging hangs over you," claimed Babu.</p>

<p>The spread of social media has only added to the environment of anxiety and fear in the city as every day new videos are uploaded showing criminals snatching valuables in broad daylight on busy streets, at restaurants, at traffic lights, outside ATMs, at barbershops, even at mosques.</p>

<p>In such an environment, the people of Karachi are now faced with a new crime menace, the "Auto-Rickshaw gang".</p>

<p>"Auto-rickshaws remain an affordable and main mode of public transport for many people but in recent days there have been several cases of passengers, including ladies, being robbed of their valuables and belongings while using these rickshaws," police officer Abid Fazal said.</p>

<p>Fazal said they investigated cases where some criminal gangs were linked up with some auto-rickshaw drivers and teamed up to rob passengers.</p>

<p>"The modus operandi is the driver after carefully studying his passengers makes a call on whether they have cash and valuables with them," he said.</p>

<p>Fazal said the driver then uses his phone to either text the drop-off location or give the impression to the unsuspecting passenger he is talking to his family and lays out all the details of where he is.</p>

<p>Sumayya Firdous, a bank teller who was robbed of all her belongings just the other day while returning home, reported to the police that she never suspected the driver was informing his gang about where she was headed.</p>

<p>"As soon as we neared my drop-off location, two people on motorbikes with guns told the driver to stop the rickshaw to the side and one of them came in and sat with me and calmly took everything. I never suspected the driver was involved until the public had gathered there and stopped the driver from leaving. A police mobile, which arrived later, checked his phone," she recalled.</p>

<p>No wonder ineffective policing, growing corruption in police ranks, and general apathy from government and police officials in response to complaints about the law and order situation in Karachi has led citizens to now resort to mob justice, she said.</p>

<p>On Saturday, one robber was lynched and killed in the densely populated Federal B area after he and two others tried to rob a house.</p>

<p>Two of the robbers managed to escape with their lives.</p>

<p>There have been other incidents of vigilante justice where people have used firearms to kill robbers or beat them to death if any of them are caught.</p>

<p>This month itself there have been at least four recorded incidents of mob justice by people enraged by robberies.</p>

<p>In one incident, people chased down two fleeing men, killing one and injuring the other, before police rescued them.</p>

<p>Dr Humaira Yousuf, an expert on crime and violence who works for a Karachi-based Centre for Research and Security, said mob justice was a worrying trend in Karachi.</p>

<p>"People are frustrated when public trust in the law enforcement agencies is low."</p>

<p>This year, dozens of police officers and constables have been fired or suspended after being implicated with criminal gangs involved in street crime.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[India supports an immediate ceasefire in West Asia and favours a two-state solution in the long-term, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Monday as he condemned terrorism, hostage-taking and civilian casualties in military operations.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India supports an immediate ceasefire in West Asia and favours a two-state solution in the long-term, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Monday as he condemned terrorism, hostage-taking and civilian casualties in military operations.</p>

<p>Speaking at the 10th edition of the MED Mediterranean Dialogue in Rome, Mr Jaishankar said that the situation in West Asia is deeply concerning, both for what has happened and what may still come.</p>

<p>"India unequivocally condemns terrorism and hostage-taking. It also regards large-scale civilian casualties in military operations to be unacceptable. International humanitarian law cannot be disregarded," he said.</p>

<p>"In immediate terms, we should all support a ceasefire. India has also extended relief directly and through UNRWA. In the longer term, it is imperative that the future of the Palestinian people be addressed. India favours a two-State solution," he said.</p>

<p>Voicing concerns over the widening of the conflict in West Asia, Mr Jaishankar said that India has been in regular touch with both Israel and Iran at the highest levels to advocate restraint and enhance communication.</p>

<p>"Where Lebanon is concerned, there is an Indian contingent like Italy, that is part of UNIFIL. With regard to the Gulf of Aden and the northern Arabian Sea, Indian naval ships have been deployed since last year to protect commercial shipping. Given our capacity to engage various parties, we are always willing to contribute meaningfully to any international diplomatic endeavours, " he said.</p>

<p>United Nations Interim Force in South Lebanon (UNIFIL) has around 10,500 peacekeepers drawn from 50 troop-contributing countries. India has more than 900 people as part of UNIFIL in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Noting that the Ukraine-Russia conflict is in its third year, Mr Jaishankar said that the continuation of this conflict has serious destabilizing consequences, including for the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>"What is clear is that no solution is going to emerge from the battlefield. India has consistently held the view that disputes in this era cannot be settled by war. There must be a return to dialogue and diplomacy; the sooner the better. This is a widespread sentiment in the world today; especially in the Global South," he asserted.</p>

<p>Since June, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has personally engaged leaders of both Russia and Ukraine. This has included his visiting Moscow and Kyiv, he said.</p>

<p>"Our senior officials remain in continuous touch. We firmly believe that those who have the ability to explore finding common ground must step up to that responsibility," the minister said.</p>

<p>Talking about the growing challenges of these two major conflicts, he said the world is experiencing severe stress.</p>

<p>"Two major conflicts are underway. Supply chains are insecure. Connectivity, especially maritime, stands disrupted. Climate events are more extreme and frequent. And the Covid pandemic has left deep scars," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said the Mediterranean presents both opportunities and risks in an uncertain and volatile world. "Beyond extrapolating current trends, the new element of our relationship will be connectivity," he said.</p>

<p>He said that the conflict underway currently in West Asia has undoubtedly been a major complication. But the IMEEC (India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor), which can be a game changer, is proceeding ahead on the Eastern side, especially between India, UAE and Saudi Arabia, he added.</p>

<p>He also talked about the I2U2 grouping of India, Israel, UAE and the US, saying it is expected to be more active in times to come.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said India's trade with the Gulf alone is in the range of USD 160 to 180 billion annually. The rest of MENA (Middle East and North Africa) adds about another USD 20 billion. More than nine million Indians live and work in West Asia.</p>

<p>"Whether it is energy, technology, industrial projects or services, we have big stakes. It is also a region to which we are connected in history, culture and security," he said.</p>

<p>Talking about opportunities, Mr Jaishankar said a closer and stronger relationship between India and the Mediterranean will serve them well.</p>

<p>"We are today on the threshold of a new era. It is one of re-globalizing, re-balancing and multi-polarity. It is also a more technology-centred future, with a premium on the mobility of talent and greener growth. Opportunities in this world are as indivisible as anxieties. A closer and stronger relationship between India and the Mediterranean will serve both of us well," he said.</p>

<p>"Our annual trade with the Mediterranean nations is about USD 80 billion. We have a diaspora here of 460,000. About 40% of that in Italy. Our key interests are in fertilizers, energy, water technology, diamonds, defence and cyber," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said that India has significant projects underway as airports, ports, railways, steel, green hydrogen, phosphates and submarine cables.</p>

<p>"Our political relations with the Mediterranean are strong and our defence collaboration is growing, including more exercises and exchanges," he added.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar, who arrived here on Sunday on a three-day visit, will participate in the Outreach session of the G7 Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Fiuggi, where India has been invited as a guest country.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The deadliest place for women is home because a staggering 140 women and girls are killed every day by an intimate partner or family member, according to a report released by UN Women and the UN Office of Drugs and Crime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This translates to approximately 51,100 victims globally in 2023, a slight increase from the previous year.</p>

<p>But the two agencies stressed that "Women and girls everywhere continue to be affected by this extreme form of gender-based violence and no region is excluded." And they said, "the home is the most dangerous place for women and girls."</p>

<p>The report, released on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, highlights the alarming rates of domestic violence worldwide. Africa recorded the highest number of intimate partner and family killings, with an estimated 21,700 victims in 2023. Africa also had the highest number of victims relative to the size of its population - 2.9 victims per 100,000 people.</p>

<p>The Americas and Oceania also reported high rates of domestic violence, with 1.6 and 1.5 female victims per 100,000 people, respectively.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In contrast, Asia and Europe reported significantly lower rates, with 0.8 and 0.6 victims per 100,000 people, respectively.</p>

<p>However, the majority of male homicides happen outside of home.</p>

<p>"Even though men and boys account for the vast majority of homicide victims, women and girls continue to be disproportionately affected by lethal violence in the private sphere," the report said.</p>

<p>"An estimated 80% of all homicide victims in 2023 were men while 20% were women, but lethal violence within the family takes a much higher toll on women than men, with almost 60% of all women who were intentionally killed in 2023 being victims of intimate partner/family member homicide," it said.</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://apnews.com/article/un-killing-women-girls-partners-family-global-c2f26290b8158e1d97b1b16ef76e85a8" rel="noindex,nofollow">Associated Press</a>, despite steps being taken to prevent the killing of women, the killings "remain at alarmingly high levels."</p>

<p>The report emphasises that domestic violence is a preventable crime, often resulting from repeated episodes of gender-based violence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The UN agencies urge countries to take timely and effective interventions to prevent domestic violence and protect women and girls from lethal violence in the private sphere.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 73-year-old Indian national was charged in a Singapore court on Monday for allegedly molesting four women while on board a Singapore Airlines (SIA) flight from the United States to Singapore.</p>

<p>Balasubramanian Ramesh is accused of molesting one of the women four times and is said to have targeted the three others once each on the flight on November 18.</p>

<p>He was handed seven molestation charges in a district court on Monday, The Straits Times reported.</p>

<p>Court documents do not disclose if the women were the carrier's passengers or crew, and they cannot be named due to a gag order to protect their identities.</p>

<p>Balasubramanian is accused of molesting the first woman at around 3:15 am and the second woman about five minutes later during the flight. He allegedly molested the second woman three more times between 3:30 am and 6 am.</p>

<p>He is also said to have outraged the modesty of a third woman at around 9:30 am and allegedly molested the fourth woman at around 5:30 pm.</p>

<p>He is expected to plead guilty on December 13, according to the Singapore daily.</p>

<p>For each count of molestation, an offender can be jailed for up to three years, fined or caned, or receive any combination of such punishments.</p>

<p>However, Balasubramanian cannot be caned as he is over 50 years old.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Since the start of this year, 122 women have been killed, according to the feminist group NousToutes.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France announced Monday a new campaign to combat violence against women, including raising awareness about the use of drugs to commit sexual abuse, as the country reckons with a mass rape trial that has shocked the public.</p>

<p>Equality Minister Salima Saa unveiled a raft of initiatives two days after tens of thousands of people demonstrated in major French cities against violence targeting women, where protestors denounced government actions as "window-dressing".</p>

<p>A case in the southern city of Avignon for 51 men, including one who drugged his wife over a decade and dozens of others are charged with accepting his invitations to abuse her at their home in Mazan in southern France, has stoked widespread anger.</p>

<p>There will be "a before Mazan, and an after Mazan just like there was a before and after #MeToo," Saa said during an interview with broadcaster Franceinfo.</p>

<p>But advocates are calling for more far-reaching measures, including a dedicated 2.6 billion euro ($2.7 billion) budget and a stronger legal framework to tackle the problem.</p>

<p>The government will extend the network of hospitals where victims can report an incident from 236 to 377 by the end of 2025, Saa said, marking the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women.</p>

<p>"A woman will be able to lodge a complaint at all hospitals with an emergency department and a gynaecological service," she said.</p>

<p><strong>Focus on drugs</strong></p>

<p>She also announced an awareness campaign about the use of drugs to commit sexual abuse, which she called "a new scourge".</p>

<p>As part of the campaign, a helpline "can provide answers and advice and tell you which laboratory to go to, what to do with your hair, blood tests, and urine tests", Saa said.</p>

<p>The budget for emergency assistance to help victims of domestic violence leave their homes will increase from 13 million euros to 20 million in 2025, a measure that has benefited 33,000 people since it was introduced at the end of 2023.</p>

<p>"We have succeeded in obtaining a 10 percent increase in the budget" devoted to gender equality, totalling 85.1 million euros, Saa said.</p>

<p>But that number falls far short of demands coming from women's rights associations, which are calling for 2.6 billion euros and a "comprehensive legal framework" to replace current legislation that advocates say is "fragmented and incomplete".</p>

<p>During his first term as president, Emmanuel Macron vowed to work to eliminate violence against women, a message Saa reiterated, calling it the "great cause" of his presidency.</p>

<p>In 2023, police recorded more than 110,000 victims of sexual violence -- 85 percent of them women.</p>

<p>And since the start of this year, 122 women have been killed, according to the feminist group NousToutes (All of us Women).</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Protesters in Bangladesh on Monday surrounded the offices of one of the few remaining independent newspapers, Prothom Alo, in the latest mass demonstrations demanding that critical media close.</p>

<p>Government security forces guarding the building held off an angry crowd of around 300 people, a day after protesters were pushed back from storming the offices by a barrage of tear gas canisters.</p>

<p>The country's largest Bengali-language newspaper faced significant challenges under the previous regime of ousted autocrat Sheikh Hasina, who fled a student-led revolution on August 5 to neighbouring India.</p>

<p>But protesters on Monday accused the newspaper's journalists of having been supportive of Hasina, something Prothom Alo's executive editor Sajjad Sharif strongly denied.</p>

<p>"We have consistently upheld the highest professional standards in our work and will continue to do so," he told AFP, recalling a history of "defying harassment" stretching back decades.</p>

<p>The overthrow of Hasina has triggered a spate of protests in Muslim-majority Bangladesh, including a surge in Islamist groups emboldened to take to the streets after years of being suppressed.</p>

<p>Chanting protesters accused the daily of an alleged "anti-Islam" and "pro-India" bias, with many demanding its immediate shutdown.</p>

<p>Outside Dhaka, protesters also targeted the newspaper's office in the city of Rajshahi, and marched through the streets of the port city of Chittagong.</p>

<p>It follows protests earlier this month that targeted Dhaka's English-language Daily Star.</p>

<p>Protester Alif Bin Labib Shuvo, 20, a student injured during anti-Hasina protests in July, alleged that both Prothom Alo and the Daily Star seek to "destabilise" Bangladesh.</p>

<p>"If they don't change their current strategy, they should be closed," said Mir Farhad, 35, another protester.</p>

<p>Interim leader Muhammad Yunus has repeatedly insisted he wants media freedom.</p>

<p>Press watchdogs say dozens of journalists -- seen by critics as having supported Hasina when she was in power -- face police investigations in apparent retaliation for their past work.</p>

<p>At least four are in custody, accused of inciting the killing of protesters in the days before Hasina's downfall.</p>

<p>Reporters Without Borders say as many has 140 journalists are facing police investigations into violence, calling it "systematic judicial harassment".</p>

<p>The US-based Committee to Protect Journalists this month urged reforms to guarantee press freedom at "this critical juncture in the country's history".</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"At the moment, the Russians are not the same threat as in February 2022, so we have a bit of time to prepare ourselves," he said, adding that this meant ramping up investments into the defence industry.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia said Monday its air defences had shot down eight ballistic missiles fired by Ukraine, amid heightened tensions over Kyiv's use of Western-supplied long-range arms against Russia.</p>

<p>Ukraine also targeted a Russian fuel depot while Russian aerial attacks wounded more than 30 in strikes on Odesa and Kharkiv, the latest wave of attacks.</p>

<p>The nearly three-year war has escalated dramatically over the last week, with both sides deploying new weapons as they try to secure an upper hand on the battlefield before Donald Trump enters the White House in January.</p>

<p>The Republican has vowed to secure a peace deal, though has not said how, and is a critic of American aid to Kyiv.</p>

<p>Ukraine fired US-made ATACMS ballistic missiles into Russia for the first time last week after receiving approval from Washington, prompting a furious reaction from Moscow.</p>

<p>"Air defence forces shot down eight ballistic missiles," the Russian defence ministry said in a daily briefing on Monday, without saying what kind of missiles were used or where they were shot down.</p>

<p>Moscow and Kyiv have escalated their use of long-range missiles after the United States gave Ukraine approval, long requested by Kyiv, to use the weapons against Russia.</p>

<p>Moscow fired an experimental hypersonic missile at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro last Thursday, with President Vladimir Putin warning the weapon, which he called Oreshnik, could be used again in combat.</p>

<p>Adding to tensions, a Ukrainian drone attack on the Russian border town of Shebekino on Monday killed a civilian, according to local governor Vyacheslav Gladkov.</p>

<p>The attack wounded another man, he said, while separate Ukrainian shelling damaged several apartments.</p>

<p><strong>Russian fuel depot ablaze</strong></p>

<p>Ukrainian drones meanwhile hit a fuel facility in the Russian region of Kaluga, a source in Ukrainian military intelligence said, in Kyiv's latest attack on Moscow's energy sites.</p>

<p>That claim came as Ukrainian authorities said a Russian missile strike had wounded nearly two dozen people in the eastern city of Kharkiv.</p>

<p>"As a result of an operation by the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine, a fuel and energy facility in the Kaluga region of Russia was hit overnight," the source said.</p>

<p>The Russian governor of Kaluga, which lies just south of the capital Moscow, said air defence systems in the region had downed eight drones and confirmed that an "industrial enterprise" had caught fire.</p>

<p>Unverified images on social media of the alleged attack showed tracer ammunition cutting through the night sky and a large blaze next to two industrial chimneys.</p>

<p>"The target of the attack was an oil depot of Kaluganefteprodukt JSC, which is involved in supporting Russia's armed aggression against Ukraine," the source said.</p>

<p><strong>Attacks 'can be stopped'</strong></p>

<p>On Monday, AFP journalists in Kharkiv saw residents and rescue workers assessing the damage and clearing rubble after the Russian strike on the town that has come under repeated bombardments since the Kremlin launched its invasion in early 2022.</p>

<p>Mayor Igor Terekhov said 23 people had been wounded and some 40 buildings were damaged, including official or administrative offices.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian air force said it had shot down 71 drones -- including the Iranian-designed Shahed -- launched by Russian forces while another 71 were "presumably" downed using electronic jamming defensive systems.</p>

<p>"Previously, the Shahed attacks were carried out only at night. Now the enemy is using attack UAVs during the daytime as well," the air force said in its statement.</p>

<p>In the southern port city of Odesa meanwhile, authorities said a Russian attack had damaged infrastructure facilities and wounded 11 people.</p>

<p>"These Russian attacks on Ukrainian life can be stopped -- through pressure, sanctions, blocking the occupiers' access to the components they use to create the tools of this terror, military aid packages for Ukraine, and a determination that must be unwavering," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday that a war crimes case against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the Gaza war was insufficient and that he deserved a "death sentence".</p>

<p>In his first remarks since the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu last week, Khamenei told a Tehran meeting that it was "not enough".</p>

<p>His country, Israel's arch nemesis, backs armed movements in the region including Palestinian militant group Hamas, whose October 7, 2023 attack sparked the war.</p>

<p>The ICC's judges said there were "reasonable grounds" to believe that Netanyahu and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant bore "criminal responsibility" for using starvation as a method of warfare and intentionally attacking civilians in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>"They issued an arrest warrant for him, it's not enough," said Khamenei, speaking to a group from the Basij paramilitary force which is linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guards.</p>

<p>Instead, the Iranian leader called for "Netanyahu's death sentence" -- which the ICC cannot order.</p>

<p>"The death sentence of these criminal leaders should be issued," said Khamenei.</p>

<p>Israel's campaign in Gaza over the past 13 months "is not a victory but a war crime", added the supreme leader, who has the final say in all matters of state.</p>

<p>The judges of The Hague-based ICC can order prison terms of up to 30 years and under exceptional circumstances life sentences. The court cannot issue death sentences.</p>

<p>The pre-trial arrest warrant theoretically limits Netanyahu's movement, as any of the court's 124 member states would be obliged to arrest him on their territory.</p>

<p>The court's chief prosecutor Karim Khan urged national members to act on the warrants, and for non-members -- a category that includes Israel, Iran, the United States, China and others -- to work together in "upholding international law".</p>

<p>Tehran does not recognise Israel and is a staunch ally of Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah, whose militants have been fighting Israeli forces for months.</p>

<p>Khamenei told the Basij paramilitaries that Iranian forces, which have largely avoided direct involvement in the ongoing regional conflict, "will eventually destroy the Zionist regime".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, a Hindu priest and a religious minority leader in Bangladesh, was arrested in Dhaka amid tensions over minority rights in the country that has seen widespread political violence since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The arrest follows protests led by the Hindu community in the city of Rangpur, located nearly 300 km north of Dhaka, demanding stronger legal protections and a ministry dedicated to minority affairs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I just received the shocking news that Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, a Hindu monk &amp; the face and leader of Bangladeshi minorities in these difficult times, has been arrested by the Dhaka police and taken to an undisclosed location. Kind attention," wrote&nbsp;Radharamn Das, ISKCON spokesperson, tagging External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and the Indian High Commission in Dhaka.</p>

<p>While the Bangladeshi authorities have not issued an official statement, reports suggest Brahmachari was detained at Dhaka airport earlier this week. His arrest comes after a sedition case was filed against him earlier this month, allegedly for his outspoken stance against violence targeting Hindus.</p>

<p>Hindus comprise approximately 8 per cent of Bangladesh's 170 million people. Since the ouster of former PM Sheikh Hasina, the new military-backed interim government led by Mohammed Yunus has faced criticism for failing to curb a spike in violence against minorities.</p>

<p>In recent months, Hindu businesses, homes, and temples have been vandalised, with the unrest worsening since Sheikh Hasina's departure. &nbsp;Earlier this month, sedition charges were filed against 19 people who participated in a minority rights rally in Chittagong.&nbsp;</p>

<p>BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari slammed the Yunus government in Bangladesh, adding that Chinmoy Brahmachari is leading a "fight for survival" of Hindu minorities.</p>

<p>"Renowned firebrand Hindu Leader; Shri Chinmoy Krishna Das Prabhu has been abducted by the Detective Branch at Dhaka Airport in Bangladesh. He is leading the fight for the survival &amp; dignity of the Hindu Minorities of Bangladesh.

@DrSJaishankar &nbsp;Ji to kindly take note of the matter and take urgent steps," Mr Adhikari posted on X.</p>

<p>Kanchan Gupta, senior advisor to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, described the arrest as "a targeted move to stifle voices of protest."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Hindu leader and ISKCON monk Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari is reported arrested in Dhaka by Yunus Regime Police. Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari was charged with sedition after he led a massive rally of Hindus protesting targeted hate attacks and demanding protection from Islamists. Tallest leader of the Hindu community, Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari is believed to have been taken to Detective Branch of Yunus Regime," Mr Gupta wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The interim regime in Bangladesh had announced plans to unveil an election roadmap, promising reforms in the electoral system. However, critics remain sceptical of its commitment to democracy, especially as reports of targeted attacks against minorities continue to emerge.</p>

<p>During a speech, Mohammed Yunus pointed to the government's security measures during Durga Puja, celebrated at over 32,000 venues nationwide, as evidence of its commitment to protecting minorities. Yet, activists argue these measures are inadequate.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One woman was killed by a partner or relative every 10 minutes worldwide in 2023, the United Nations warned Monday, stressing that femicides remained at "alarmingly high levels".</p>

<p>Almost 85,000 women and girls were murdered by people last year, according to a joint report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the UN Women agency published Monday.</p>

<p>About 60 percent - or more than 51,000 women and girls - died at the hands of their partner or relative, the report found.</p>

<p>This equates to 140 women killed per day or one every 10 minutes by those closest to them.</p>

<p>"The home remains the most dangerous place for women and girls in terms of the risk of lethal victimisation," the report said.</p>

<p>While men were four times more likely than women to fall victim to homicide - forming 80 percent of all murder victims last year - they more often than not died at the hands of a stranger.</p>

<p>Africa had the most severe toll with 21,700 women killed by someone close to them in 2023.</p>

<p>The lowest femicide rates were in Europe (2,300 murders in absolute numbers) and Asia.</p>

<p>Despite efforts in some countries to prevent femicides, they remain "at alarmingly high levels" due to deep-rooted gender inequality and damaging stereotypes.</p>

<p>"We must confront and dismantle the gender biases, power imbalances, and harmful norms that perpetuate violence against women," UNODC Executive Director Ghada Waly said in a statement accompanying the report.</p>

<p>Data from countries including France indicated that femicides are often the "culmination" of repeated episodes of violence and can be prevented by measures such as restraining orders.</p>

<p>UN Women Executive Director Sima Bahous said robust legislation, greater government accountability, and increased funding for women's rights organisations and institutional bodies are needed to stem violence against women.</p>

<p>Furthermore, improved data collection from different national sources - including media reports - and a "zero-tolerance culture" are essential in tackling femicides, she said.</p>

<p>The report is based on available data from 107 countries or territories, and information the UNODC has collected from responses submitted by member states.</p>

<p>Its release coincides with the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Monday social media firms would be required to destroy personal data used to verify ages of users, as part of what the government says is a world-leading ban on under-16s using the services.</p>

<p>Australia plans to trial an age-verification system that may include biometrics or government identification to enforce a social media age cut-off, some of the toughest controls imposed by any country to date.</p>

<p>"There will be very strong and strict privacy requirements to protect people's personal information, including an obligation to destroy information provided once age has been verified," Albanese told parliament on Monday.</p>

<p>The laws would impact Meta Platforms' Instagram and Facebook, Bytedance's TikTok and Elon Musk's X and Snapchat.</p>

<p>They have been criticised by figures including Musk, who said on Friday the legislation was a backdoor attempt to control access to the internet for all Australians.</p>

<p>The proposals are the highest age limit set by any country, and would have no exemption for parental consent and no exemption for pre-existing accounts. Platforms face fines of up to $32 million for failing to comply with the legislation.</p>

<p>The government has said it aims to pass the bill into law by the end of the parliamentary year on Thursday, fast-tracking it through the upper and lower houses of parliament.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Malaysian court ordered the government on Monday to return rainbow-coloured watches and accessories made by Swatch Group that were seized last year for designs celebrating LGBTQ rights, a prosecutor told Reuters.</p>

<p>Homosexuality is illegal in Muslim-majority Malaysia, and rights groups have warned of growing intolerance toward the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) community in the Southeast Asian country.</p>

<p>In May 2023, Malaysia confiscated 172 rainbow-coloured watches from the Swiss watchmaker's 'Pride collection' from 16 outlets due to the presence of the acronym 'LGBTQ' on the timepieces.</p>

<p>The government later prohibited any LGBTQ references on Swatch watches, boxes, wrappers, accessories or other items, saying such products may harm morality and public interest.</p>

<p>Swatch Group filed a lawsuit challenging the seizure, saying it was illegal and damaged its reputation.</p>

<p>On Monday, government prosecutor Mohammad Sallehuddin Md Ali said the Kuala Lumpur High Court had ruled the watches must be returned to Swatch Group within 14 days.</p>

<p>"No order (was given) as to costs," he said in a brief text message to Reuters.</p>

<p>A lawyer for Swatch Group declined to comment on the decision.</p>

<p>Home Minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail said the government respected the court's decision and would wait for the full judgement to be released before deciding whether to challenge the verdict.</p>

<p>The watches are unlikely to be sold in Malaysia due to the government's prohibition order.</p>

<p>In July 2023, the government halted a music festival in Kuala Lumpur after the frontman of British pop rock band The 1975 kissed a male bandmate onstage.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who came into power two years ago on a progressive campaign, has said LGBTQ rights will not be recognised by his administration.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The 2024 FIDE World Chess Championship kicked off today at the Equarius Hotel in Singapore. The 18-year-old Indian chess prodigy, Grandmaster D Gukesh, is set to face off against the reigning world champion, Ding Liren of China.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">​​​​​​After a decade-long wait, India is once again on the brink of chess history. Gukesh, a young Indian Grandmaster, is the first Indian, besides the legendary Viswanathan Anand, to compete for the prestigious World Chess Championship title.&nbsp;Anand, a five-time world champion, last contested for the title in 2014, losing to Magnus Carlsen. Carlsen, a dominant force in chess for nearly a decade, recently decided to step down from the championship cycle, opening the door for new challengers.&nbsp;Gukesh's participation in the World Championship marks a significant moment for Indian chess, as the country continues to produce world-class talent.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The 2024 FIDE World Chess Championship offers a lucrative prize pool of $2.5 million (approximately Rs 20.8 crore). Each victory in a classical game is rewarded with $200,000 (around Rs 1.67 crore). However, if the match progresses to tiebreaks, the stakes rise significantly. The eventual champion will claim a substantial $1.3 million (Rs 10.83 crore), while the runner-up will receive $1.2 million (Rs 10.1 crore).</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">At just 18 years old, Indian Grandmaster Gukesh Dommaraju has made history by qualifying for the 2024 FIDE World Chess Championship. This remarkable achievement makes him the youngest player ever to compete for the prestigious title. Gukesh's exceptional talent was evident early on. With unwavering support from his father, he became the second-youngest Grandmaster in history at 12 years, 7 months, and 17 days. His recent success in the 2024 FIDE Candidates Tournament, where he defeated top players like Alireza Firouzja and Hikaru Nakamura, further solidified his position as a rising star in the chess world. A victory over the reigning World Champion, Ding Liren, would make Gukesh the youngest Classical World Champion in history.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Ding Liren's victory over Ian Nepomniachtchi in the 2023 FIDE World Chess Championship was a historic moment, making him the first Chinese player to claim the coveted title. This achievement cemented his position as one of the world's top chess players. Liren has consistently ranked among the world's elite.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acclaimed Indian author Amitav Ghosh has won the coveted Dutch Erasmus Prize for his writings on climate change and its impact on humanity, especially on the Indian subcontinent.</p>

<p>Ghosh "has delved deeply into the question of how to do justice to this existential threat that defies our imagination," the prize committee said in a statement.</p>

<p>The Erasmus Prize, due to be presented by Dutch King Willem-Alexander on Tuesday, is awarded for an "exceptional contribution to the humanities, the social sciences or the arts, in Europe and beyond."</p>

<p>The winner receives a cash prize of 150,000 euros ($157,000).</p>

<p>The Praemium Erasmianum Foundation, which awards the prize, noted that Ghosh had described how the effects of climate change have been "inextricably linked" to human destiny on the Indian subcontinent.</p>

<p>It cited his work "The Hungry Tide", which portrayed how rising sea levels were devastating life in the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest.</p>

<p>The 68-year-old's work is also political, with "The Great Derangement" setting climate change in the context of war and trade.</p>

<p>"Through understanding and imagination he creates space for hope, a prerequisite for change," said the prize committee.</p>

<p>Born in Kolkata, Ghosh has won several literary prizes, including the 2018 Jnanpith Award, India's top award.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan has reported three new poliovirus cases from Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces taking the total number of infections this year to 55, according to a media report on Monday.</p>

<p>The Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health has confirmed the three wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases, The Dawn newspaper reported.</p>

<p>The victims were two girls aged eight and 20 months and a five-month-old boy. The new cases were reported from Dera Ismail Khan, Zhob and Jaffarabad districts, a lab official was quoted as saying. All three districts have already reported a case of poliovirus this year.</p>

<p>Dera Ismail Khan, which has now reported six polio cases this year, has been one of the seven polio-endemic districts in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Routine immunisation programmes have faced significant challenges in accessing all vulnerable children in the district during the last three years, the newspaper said.</p>

<p>Similar challenges are prevalent in Balochistan, where Zhob and Jaffarabad districts have reported three and two cases respectively, in 2024. Of the 55 cases reported so far, 26 have been reported from Balochistan, 14 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 13 from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Islamabad.</p>

<p>The new cases were reported days after a Global Polio Eradication Initiative delegation met with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to discuss "strategies to combat the poliovirus outbreak and to address emerging challenges".</p>

<p>There is no cure for polio. Only multiple doses of the oral polio vaccine and completion of the routine vaccination schedule for all children under the age of five can keep them protected.</p>

<p>Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries in the world where polio remains endemic, according to the World Health Organisation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Romania's political landscape was left shocked after pro-Russia populist Calin Georgescu won the first round of the presidential election. The far-right leader knocked the EU-leaning premier out of the race that will be decided in a December run-off.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">Ahead of Sunday's first election round, opinion surveys had shown 62-year-old Mr Georgescu, an independent candidate, polling in single digits. But in recent days, his popularity surged after his TikTok campaign calling for an end to aid for Ukraine went viral.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Mr Georgescu was a member of the hard-right opposition Alliance for Uniting Romanians (AUR), which touted him as their choice for prime minister.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">He left AUR in 2022 after senior party members said his pro-Russian and anti-NATO stance damaged the party's image. Mr Georgescu has sounded a sceptical note on Romania's North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) membership.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">In a 2021 interview, Mr Georgescu called NATO's ballistic missile defence shield in Romania's Deveselu a "shame of diplomacy" and said the alliance will not protect any of its members should they be attacked by Russia.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">He has also termed Ion Antonescu and Corneliu Zelea Codreanu as Romania's national heroes. Antonescu was Romania's de facto World War Two leader, who was sentenced to death for his part in Romania's Holocaust. Codreanu was the pre-World War Two leader of the Iron Guard- one of Europe's most violent anti-Semitic movements.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">In another public address, Mr Georgescu said Romania wasn't ready to handle anything diplomatically and strategically and that its best chance lay with "Russian wisdom." However, he has refused to explicitly say whether he supports Russia.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Russia on Monday said it did not know much about Mr Georgescu, who is in pole position to become the EU member's next president. "I can't say that we are very familiar with the worldview of this candidate, as far it concerns relations with our country," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">In an unexpected outcome that threatens Romania's staunchly pro-Ukraine stance, far-right Mr Georgescu will likely face centre-right contender Elena Lasconi in a December 8 presidential run-off vote.&nbsp;Sunday's results are one of the biggest surprises in Romanian post-communist elections, with the leaders of the two largest parties, the leftist Social Democrats and centre-right Liberals - which are in a coalition government - eliminated in the first round.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Outgoing two-term president Klaus Iohannis, 65, had cemented Romania's strong pro-Western stance but was accused of not doing enough to fight corruption.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Romania shares a 650-km (400-mile) border with Ukraine and since Russia attacked Kyiv in 2022, it has enabled the export of millions of tons of grain through its Black Sea port of Constanta and provided military aid, including the donation of a Patriot air defence battery.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The supreme leader of Iran, which backs the Hamas and Hezbollah militants fighting Israel in Gaza and Lebanon, said on Monday that death sentences should be issued for Israeli leaders, not arrest warrants.</p>

<p>Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was commenting on a decision by the International Criminal Court to issue arrest warrants on Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defence chief and a Hamas leader, Ibrahim Al-Masri.</p>

<p>"They issued an arrest warrant, that's not enough... Death sentence must be issued for these criminal leaders", Khamenei said, referring to the Israeli leaders.</p>

<p>In their decision, the ICC judges said there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant were criminally responsible for acts including murder, persecution and starvation as a weapon of war as part of a "widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Gaza".</p>

<p>The decision was met with outrage in Israel, which called it shameful and absurd. Gaza residents expressed hope it would help end the violence and bring those responsible for war crimes to justice.</p>

<p>Israel has rejected the jurisdiction of the Hague-based court and denies war crimes in Gaza.</p>

<p>The warrant for a Hamas leader, Ibrahim Al-Masri, lists charges of mass killings during the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on Israel that triggered the war on the long-blockaded Palestinian enclave, and also charges of rape and the taking of hostages.</p>

<p>Israel has said it killed Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, in an airstrike in July but Hamas has neither confirmed nor denied this.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iraq's population has risen to 45.4 million, according to preliminary results from a national census, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said on Monday.</p>

<p>The census, conducted on November 20, was Iraq's first nationwide survey in more than three decades, marking a crucial step for future planning and development.</p>

<p>Prior to the census, the planning ministry estimated the population at 43 million.</p>

<p>The last census, conducted in 1997, did not include the Iraqi Kurdistan region, which has been under Kurdish administration since the 1991 Gulf War.</p>

<p>It counted 19 million Iraqis and officials estimated there were another 3 million in the Kurdish north, according to official statistics.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bestselling British-American writer Barbara Taylor Bradford, whose first novel "A Woman of Substance" turned her into an overnight success, has died aged 91, a spokeswoman said on Monday.</p>

<p>Taylor Bradford, who wrote 40 novels and notched up 91 million book sales worldwide during her career, died peacefully at her home on Sunday following a short illness.</p>

<p>She "was surrounded by loved ones to the very end", the spokeswoman said, adding that a private funeral would be held in New York.</p>

<p>"A Woman of Substance" tells the story of servant Emma Harte who overcomes a humble start in Taylor Bradford's native Yorkshire in northern England to head of a business empire, navigating personal tragedy along the way.</p>

<p>Many of her subsequent novels were also set in Yorkshire and followed a similar theme of great success against the odds, powered by grit and hard work.</p>

<p>Her most recent novel "The Wonder of it All" was published last year.</p>

<p>Born in Leeds in northern England in May 1933, Taylor Bradford began her working life as a typist for her local newspaper The Yorkshire Evening Post before becoming a reporter.</p>

<p>She moved to London aged 20 where she continued working as a journalist while dipping her toe into the world of fiction.</p>

<p>She started and abandoned several novels before striking gold with "A Woman of Substance", which was an instant success when it was published in 1979.</p>

<h2><strong>POWERHOUSE</strong></h2>

<p>The novel was turned into a double Emmy-nominated miniseries in 1985 and starred Liam Neeson with British actress Jenny Seagrove in the role of Emma Harte.</p>

<p>Seagrove paid tribute to a "dear friend" and "powerhouse of glamour and warmth".</p>

<p>"Success never diluted her warmth and humour or her ability to relate to everyone she met, whether a cleaner or a princess. She never, ever forgot that she was just a girl from Yorkshire that worked hard and made good," she said.</p>

<p>Charlie Redmayne, chief executive of publisher HarperCollins, described Taylor Bradford as a "truly exceptional writer".</p>

<p>"'A Woman Of Substance' changed the lives of so many who read it -– and still does to this day," he said.</p>

<p>"She was a natural storyteller, deeply proud of her Yorkshire roots. For 45 years, she was a huge part of our company and a great, great friend –- we will miss her so much," he added.</p>

<p>Taylor Bradford had lived in the United States since 1964 following her marriage a the previous year to American film producer Robert Bradford.</p>

<p>The couple were married for 55 years until his death in 2019.</p>

<p>Taylor Bradford's spokeswoman said she would be buried alongside her late husband at New York's Westchester Hills Cemetery.<br />

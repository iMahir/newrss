       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump pledged on Friday to conduct mass deportations of Haitian immigrants from the Ohio city of Springfield, even though the majority of them are in the United States legally.</p>

<p>The city for days has found itself at the center of a social media maelstrom after right-wing agitators latched onto false claims that Haitian arrivals were eating household pets.</p>

<p>"We will do large deportations in Springfield, Ohio," Trump said at a press conference at his golf resort near Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The majority of the 15,000 Haitians in Springfield are there legally. Trump's longstanding pledge to conduct mass deportations usually refers to those in the country illegally.</p>

<p>Trump did not repeat the assertion he made during Tuesday's presidential debate with Democrat Kamala Harris that immigrants were eating dogs and cats, remarks that have been widely mocked.</p>

<p>Two elementary schools were evacuated and one middle school in Springfield was closed on Friday after anonymous bomb threats were made against the community for the second day in a row, according to ABC News.</p>

<p>At the White House, President Joe Biden urged the attacks on the Haitian community to cease.</p>

<p>"It's simply wrong. There's no place in America. This has to stop - what he's doing. It has to stop," Biden said.</p>

<p>The Biden administration extended Temporary Protected Status to hundreds of thousands of Haitians in the United States in June, a decades-old program that protects legal immigrants from deportation and gives them work permits. Gang wars in Haiti have displaced over half a million people and nearly five million are facing severe food insecurity.</p>

<p>Trump has cited the tensions in Springfield as another example of the need for hardline immigration polices. The influx of Haitians has boosted the economy but also has strained social services.</p>

<p>"I'm angry about illegal Haitian migrants taking over Springfield, Ohio. You see that mess, don't you?" Trump said at a rally in Las Vegas, later on Friday.</p>

<p>"I'm angry about young American girls being raped and murdered by savage criminal aliens that come into our country very easily, but very illegally," he added later in his speech.</p>

<p>Haitian community leaders across the United States said the Republican candidate's remarks could put lives at risk and further inflame tensions in Springfield.</p>

<p>"We need help, not hate," Springfield's mayor Rob Rue told ABC News.</p>

<p>City officials say they have received no credible reports of anybody eating household animals. Karen Graves, a city spokesperson, said she was not aware of recent hate crimes targeting Haitian residents but that some had been victims of "crimes of opportunity," such as property theft.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Norwegian police said on Saturday that the 27-year-old son of Crown Princess Mette-Marit had been arrested for violating a restraining order.</p>

<p>Marius Borg Hoiby was initially detained on August 4 following a night-time row at a woman's apartment in Oslo and accused of causing bodily harm to the resident, with whom he was having a relationship.</p>

<p>Norwegian media reports said police found a knife stuck into one of the walls of the woman's bedroom at the time.</p>

<p>"At the beginning of September, police received information that Marius Borg Hoiby had, on several occasions, made unwanted contact with the woman, who has the status of victim in the incident," police said in a statement on Saturday.</p>

<p>They "filed a report for reckless behaviour and imposed a restraining order on Hoiby", it said.</p>

<p>They subsequently "received information that Hoiby had violated the restraining order" and he was rearrested late on Friday due to the "risk of recurrence".</p>

<p>Police now suspect Hoiby of crimes against three other victims -- domestic abuse of two women and threats to another person.</p>

<p>Hoiby's lawyer Oyvind Bratlien said his client denied the allegations.</p>

<p>"In my 17 years as a defence lawyer, I have never experienced or heard of an arrest on such a flimsy factual and legal basis," Bratlien told broadcaster NRK.</p>

<p>Hoiby was born in 1997 from a relationship prior to Mette-Marit's 2001 marriage to Crown Prince Haakon, the heir apparent to the Norwegian throne.</p>

<p>He and his step-siblings -- Princess Ingrid Alexandra, 20 and Prince Sverre Magnus, 18 -- were raised together by Mette-Marit and Haakon.</p>

<p>Unlike them, he has no official public role.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Walking into court each day with her head held high, the ex-wife of a Frenchman on trial for orchestrating her mass rape in her own bed for almost a decade has become a feminist icon.</p>

<p>With her now trademark auburn bob and dark glasses, 71-year-old Gisele Pelicot has become a figurehead in the battle against the use of drugs to commit sexual abuse.</p>

<p>Her life was shattered in 2020 when she discovered that her partner of five decades had for years been secretly administering her large doses of tranquilisers to rape her and invite dozens of strangers to join him.</p>

<p>But she has decided not to hide and demanded the trial of Dominique Pelicot, 71, and 50 co-defendants since September 2 be open to the public because, as she has said through one of her lawyers, it should be up to her alleged abusers - not her - to be ashamed.</p>

<p>"It's a way of saying... shame must change sides," her attorney Stephane Babonneau said as the trial opened.</p>

<p>Since then, feminist activists have used her stylised portrait by Belgian artist Aline Dessine, daubed with the words "Shame is changing sides", to show support and call for protests.</p>

<p>The artist with 2.5 million followers on TikTok has given up all rights to the image.</p>

<h2><strong>'VERY BRAVE'</strong></h2>

<p>Outside the courtroom in the southern town of Avignon on Friday, protester Nadege Peneau said she was full of admiration for the trial's main plaintiff.</p>

<p>"What she's doing is very brave," she said.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Gisele Pelicot, flanked by her lawyer Stephane Babonneau (R), arrives to attend court session." id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/u74lkshg_gisele-pelicot-french-mass-rape-survivor-afp_625x300_14_September_24.jpg" title="Gisele Pelicot, flanked by her lawyer Stephane Babonneau (R), arrives to attend court session." /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">Gisele Pelicot, flanked by her lawyer Stephane Babonneau (R), arrives to attend court session.</p>
</div>

<p>"She's speaking up for so many children and women, and even men" who have been abused, she added.</p>

<p>Gisele Pelicot in August obtained a divorce from her husband, who has confessed to the abuse after meticulously documenting it with photos and videos.</p>

<p>She has moved away from the southern town of Mazan where, in her own words, for years he treated her like "a piece of meat" or a "rag doll".</p>

<p>She now uses her maiden name, but during the trial has asked the media to use her former name as a married woman.</p>

<p>Her lawyer Antoine Camus said she had transformed from a devoted wife and retiree, who loved walks and choir singing, into a woman in the seventies ready for a battle.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">Gisele Pelicot leaves court after a session of the trial of Pelicot's former partner Dominique Pelicot..</p>
</div>

<p>"I will have to fight till the end," she told the press on September 5, in her only public statement outside court in the first days of the four-month trial.</p>

<p>"Obviously it's not an easy exercise and I can feel attempts to trap me with certain questions," she added calmly.</p>

<h3><strong>'NOT IN VAIN'</strong></h3>

<p>The daughter of a member of the military, Gisele Pelicot was born on December 7, 1952 in Germany, returning to France with her family when she was five.</p>

<p>When she was only nine, her mother, aged just 35, died of cancer.</p>

<p>"In my head, I was already 15, I was already a little woman," she said, describing growing up "without much love".</p>

<p>Her older brother Michel died of a heart attack aged 43, before her 20th birthday.</p>

<p>She has said she was never one to publicly show emotions.</p>

<p>"In the family, we hide tears and we share laughter," one of her lawyers had reported her as saying.</p>

<p>She met Dominique Pelicot, her future husband and rapist, in 1971.</p>

<p>She had dreamt of becoming a hairdresser but instead studied to be a typist. After a few years temping, she joined France's national electricity company EDF, ending her career in a logistics service for its nuclear power plants.</p>

<p>At home, she looked after her three children, then seven grandchildren, and did a little gymnastics.</p>

<p>Only when the police caught her husband filming up women's skirts in a supermarket in 2020 did she find out the true reason behind her troubling memory lapses.</p>

<p>Camus, her lawyer, said his client "never wanted to be a role model".</p>

<p>"She just wants all this not to be in vain," he said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moscow and Kyiv swapped 103 prisoners of war each on Saturday in a deal brokered by the United Arab Emirates, a rare moment of coordination between the two warring sides as Russia pushes ahead in east Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Russians released in the swap were captured during Ukraine's incursion into the Kursk region, Moscow said, while some of the Ukrainians freed had been held prisoner since Moscow seized the Azovstal steel plant in May 2022.</p>

<p>"Another 103 soldiers were returned to Ukraine from Russian captivity," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Telegram.</p>

<p>Among the freed were 82 privates and sergeants as well as 21 officers, Zelensky said.</p>

<p>"The defenders of Kyiv, Donetsk, Mariupol and Azovstal, Lugansk, Zaporizhzhia and the Kharkiv regions," he added.</p>

<p>Russia confirmed it had "handed over" 103 Ukrainian army prisoners, and received 103 Russian servicemen captured by Kyiv in its Kursk offensive in return.</p>

<p>"At present, all Russian servicemen are on the territory of the Republic of Belarus, where they are being provided with the necessary psychological and medical assistance, as well as an opportunity to contact their relatives," the Russian defence ministry said.</p>

<p>Despite ongoing hostilities, Russia and Ukraine have managed to swap hundreds of prisoners throughout the two-and-half-year conflict -- often in deals brokered by the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia or Turkey.</p>

<p>The announcement comes a day after Zelensky said 49 Ukrainian POWs had been returned from Russia, and three weeks ago both sides swapped 115 prisoners each in a deal also mediated by the UAE.</p>

<p>The UAE's foreign ministry hailed the deal as a "success" and thanked both sides for their cooperation on Saturday.</p>

<p><strong>Russian advances</strong></p>

<p>The prisoner swap came as Russia pushed ahead in east Ukraine, where it claims to have captured a string of villages in recent weeks.</p>

<p>The Russian defence ministry said in a daily briefing it had "liberated" the village of Zhelanne Pershe, less than 30 kilometres (19 miles) from the key Ukrainian-held logistics hub of Pokrovsk.</p>

<p>Pokrovsk lies on the intersection of a key road that supplies Ukrainian troops and towns across the eastern front and has long been a target for Moscow's army.</p>

<p>More than half of the city's 60,000 residents have fled since the invasion began in February 2022, with evacuations ramping up in recent weeks as Moscow's army closes in.</p>

<p>Ukraine had hoped its major cross-border incursion into the Kursk region last month would slow down Russia's advances in the east.</p>

<p>On Friday, Zelensky said Moscow had been slowed down somewhat but conceded the situation on the eastern front was "very difficult".</p>

<p>Russia meanwhile claimed this week to have clawed back a swath of territory in the Kursk region, as it mounted what appeared to be a counter-offensive.</p>

<p><strong>Missile spat</strong></p>

<p>Tensions between Russia and the West over the conflict reached dire levels this week over UK and US discussions about letting Ukraine use longer-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia.</p>

<p>The discussions came after a visit to Kyiv by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and British counterpart David Lammy.</p>

<p>President Vladimir Putin warned the West on Thursday that green-lighting the use of the long-range weapons deep inside Russia would put the NATO military alliance "at war" with Moscow.</p>

<p>"This would in a significant way change the very nature of the conflict," Putin told a state television reporter.</p>

<p>"It would mean that NATO countries, the US, European countries, are at war with Russia," he added.</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and US President Joe Biden on Friday delayed a decision on the move.</p>

<p>US officials believe the missiles would make a limited difference to Ukraine's campaign and also want to ensure that Washington's own stocks of the munitions are not depleted.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The study suggests that AI could play a significant role in combating misinformation, though questions remain about how AI achieves this and whether it would be embraced in real-world settings.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Researchers have now found that artificial intelligence can alter conspiracy beliefs, challenging the long-held idea that those who embrace these ideas are very unlikely to change. A number of conspiracy theories include the assertion that moon landings were fabricated, and another reports that microchips have been placed in the Covid-19 vaccines. Such beliefs sometimes have a devastating consequence.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq1814">study</a>, headed by associate professor of American University Dr Thomas Costello, revealed that AI indeed effectively promotes critical thinking and disproves fact-based counterarguments. They conducted experiments involving 2,190 people who already subscribed to conspiracy theories using an <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.debunkbot.com/conspiracies">AI system called "DebunkBot.".</a></p>

<p>Participants shared their conspiracy theory and evidence supporting it with the AI and then engaged in a three-round conversation. Afterward, they rated the truth of their beliefs on a 100-point scale. Those who discussed their conspiracy theory with the AI showed a 20% drop in belief, while the change was minimal for those discussing non-conspiracy topics.</p>

<p>"About one in four people who began the experiment believing a conspiracy theory came out the other end without that belief," said Dr Costello.</p>

<p>"In most cases, the AI can only chip away-making people a bit more sceptical and uncertain-but a select few were disabused of their conspiracy entirely."</p>

<p>Effects lasted at least two months and applied to almost all types of conspiracy theories, except for those based on factual information. One in four participants who initially believed in a conspiracy theory completely abandoned it by the end of the experiment.</p>

<p>This would suggest that AI may play a pivotal role in warding off the scourge of misinformation, especially on social media. However, Professor Sander van der Linden of the University of Cambridge and others posed questions over whether people would eagerly participate with AI in real-life situations and, quite frankly, how they really managed to win over participants with their methods, including empathy and affirmation. At any rate, this study has worthwhile lessons to impart upon us about the capacity of AI when it comes to countering conspiracy theories.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South America is being ravaged by fire from Brazil's Amazon rainforest through the world's largest wetlands to dry forests in Bolivia, breaking a previous record for the number of blazes seen in a year up to September 11.</p>

<p>Satellite data analyzed by Brazil's space research agency Inpe has registered 346,112 fire hotspots so far this year in all 13 countries of South America, topping the earlier 2007 record of 345,322 hotspots in a data series that goes back to 1998.</p>

<p>A Reuters photographer traveling in the heart of Brazil's Amazon this week witnessed massive fires burning in vegetation along roadways, blackening the landscape and leaving trees like burned matchsticks.</p>

<p>Smoke billowing from the Brazilian fires has darkened the skies above cities like Sao Paulo, feeding into a corridor of wildfire smoke seen from space stretching diagonally across the continent from Colombia in the northwest to Uruguay in the southeast.</p>

</div>

<p>Brazil and Bolivia have dispatched thousands of firefighters to attempt to control the blazes, but remain mostly at the mercy of extreme weather fueling the fires.</p>

<p>Scientists say that while most fires are set by humans, the recent hot and dry conditions being driven by climate change are helping the fires spread more quickly. South America has been hit by a series of heatwaves since last year.</p>

<p>"We never had winter," said Karla Longo, an air quality researcher at Inpe, of the weather in Sao Paulo in recent months. "It's absurd."</p>

<p>Despite still being winter in the Southern Hemisphere, high temperatures in Sao Paulo have held at over 32 degrees Celsius (90 degrees Fahrenheit) since Saturday.</p>

<p>Hundreds of people marched in Bolivia's highland, political capital La Paz to demand action against the fires, holding banners and placards saying "Bolivia in flames" and "For cleaner air stop burning."</p>

<p>"Please realize what is really happening in the country, we have lost millions of hectares," said Fernanda Negron, an animal rights activist in the protest. "Millions of animals have been burned to death."</p>

<p>In Brazil, a drought that began last year has become the worst on record, according to national disaster monitoring agency Cemaden.</p>

<p>"In general, the 2023-2024 drought is the most intense, long-lasting in some regions and extensive in recent history, at least in the data since 1950," said Ana Paula Cunha, a drought researcher with Cemaden.</p>

<p>The greatest number of fires this month is in Brazil and Bolivia, followed by Peru, Argentina and Paraguay, according to Inpe data. Unusually intense fires that hit Venezuela, Guyana and Colombia earlier in the year contributed to the record but have largely subsided.</p>

<p>Fire from deforestation in the Amazon create particularly intense smoke because of the density of the vegetation burning, Longo said.</p>

<p>"The sensation you get flying next to one of these plumes is like that of an atomic mushroom cloud," said Longo of Inpe.</p>

<p>Roughly 9 million sq km (3.5 million sq miles) of South America have been covered in smoke at times, more than half of the continent, she said.</p>

<p>Sao Paulo, the most populous city in the Western Hemisphere, earlier this week had the worst air quality globally, higher than famous pollution hotspots like China and India, according to website IQAir.com. Bolivia's capital of La Paz was similarly blanketed in smoke.</p>

<p>Exposure to the smoke will drive up the number of people seeking hospital treatment for respiratory issues and may cause thousands of premature deaths, Longo said.</p>

<p>Inhaling wildfire smoke contributes to an average 12,000 early deaths a year in South America, according to a 2023 study in the academic journal Environmental Research: Health.</p>

<p>September is typically the peak month for fires in South America. It's unclear whether the continent will continue to have high numbers of fires this year.</p>

<p>While rain is forecast next week for Brazil's center south, where Sao Paulo is located, drought conditions are expected to continue through October in Brazil's northern Amazon region and center-west agricultural region.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada is in discussions about joining an expanded AUKUS deal between the US, Britain, and Australia formed to counter China's growing military influence in the Indo-Pacific region, Canadian Defence Minister Bill Blair said.</p>

<p>Canada has said it wants to join a second pillar of AUKUS that will collaborate on new military technologies, including artificial intelligence and quantum computing, but has not so far revealed any details of those talks.</p>

<p>The military alliance AUKUS stands for Australia, United Kingdom, United States.</p>

<p>"There have been important discussions about processes and platforms on a project-specific basis on where other nations, including Japan and ourselves, might participate," Blair said in an interview in Tokyo where he met his Japanese counterpart Minoru Kihara.</p>

<p>"I would respectfully wait until they've come to their determination, but I'm very optimistic," he said.</p>

<p>Blair said he and Kihara discussed AUKUS, which is already considering working with Japan. The initial phase of AUKUS involves the three founding members working on nuclear submarine technology for Australia.</p>

<p>Blair, who was on his first trip to Japan as defence minister, arrived in Tokyo from South Korea, which is also in talks about a role in AUKUS.</p>

<p>Canada is looking for a bigger security role in Asia and has made forging deeper ties with Japan and South Korea a priority. As its defence commitments expand at home and overseas the country is expanding military spending.</p>

<p>"Next year, my defence budget will rise by 27% over this year, and, frankly, in the next three or four years, our defence spending will triple," Blair said.</p>

<p>He and Kihara also discussed Chinese incursions into Japanese territory that last month prompted Tokyo to lodge protests with Beijing.</p>

<p>Concerns about that Chinese military activity may be discussed at a meeting of the Group of Seven defence ministers in Italy next month, Blair said.</p>

<p>"It's an important opportunity for us to have a conversation among the G7 partners about some of the activities that are deeply concerning to Japan and to Canada and to the United States and others," he said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Global pop sensation Taylor Swift's support for Kamala Harris may have boosted the Democratic vice president's hopes of attracting young voters, but the question remains: Will the celebrity endorsement make a difference on Election Day?</p>

<p>Locked in a tight White House race, both Kamala Harris and her rival, Republican former President Donald Trump are doing all they can to lure voters on Election Day Nov. 5 and in early voting starting next week.</p>

<p>For his part, Trump dismissed Swift's Tuesday night endorsement of Harris, saying he was "not a Taylor fan."</p>

<p>With voter registrations down among young people in a country where 18 is the voting age, the first challenge for either campaign may be getting them to register to vote at all.</p>

<p>Young voters played a decisive role in Democratic President Joe Biden's victory over the then-incumbent Trump in 2020. Biden captured about 61% of the vote to Trump's 36% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29, according to data from Tufts University.</p>

<p>A July 2024 analysis by Tufts University's youth civic engagement group, CIRCLE, found that voter registrations have dropped significantly since then in 36 states among those aged 18-29. Harris launched her campaign on July 21 after Biden withdrew.</p>

<p>"Registering youths remains a major task in the months ahead," the analysis said.</p>

<p>Enter Swift, an artist so successful she tied hip-hop star Beyonce's record of 30 lifetime awards at the MTV Video Music Awards on Wednesday night. A 2023 Morning Consult poll found that 55% of self-described Swift fans were Democrats and 45% were millennials aged 28 to 43.</p>

<p>"I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them," Swift wrote on Tuesday to her 284 million Instagram followers, urging them to register to vote and make their own choice.</p>

<p>Her post drew 10.4 million "likes." The vote.gov website received 405,999 visitors in the 24 hours after Swift shared a custom URL with followers, a U.S. government spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Harris aides say they would love for Swift to actively campaign, such as by appearing at a rally in her native Pennsylvania, a battleground state that could well decide the election.</p>

<p>But the campaign itself was not involved in Swift's decision to back Harris.</p>

<p>The vice president's aides said they learned of Swift's support only when the entertainer, 34, posted it on Instagram minutes after the vice president stepped off the debate stage in Philadelphia on Tuesday night.</p>

<h2><strong>A QUESTION OF INFLUENCE</strong></h2>

<p>What difference does a celebrity endorsement make?</p>

<p>A 2008 Northwestern University report found Oprah Winfrey's endorsement added a million votes to Barack Obama's tally.</p>

<p>But a 2010 North Carolina State University report found celebrity endorsements by George Clooney and Angelina Jolie did little to move the political needle.</p>

<p>Margaretha Bentley, a professor at Arizona State University whose class studies Swift's social importance, is unsure whether the pop singer will have an impact. She asked her students earlier this year whether a Swift endorsement would matter.</p>

<p>Some said they would follow Swift's lead and others said it would prompt them to do more research. "Some students told me they listen to celebrities when it comes to, like, what coffee they would drink, not politics," Bentley said.</p>

<p>A Swift fan at the VMA awards on Wednesday, Morgan Paris, said: "It's good that she said what she feels. And I mean, I feel like her politics and her music are two separate things, so you can't really combine them."</p>

<p>Ashley Spillane wrote in a study published last month by Harvard's Kennedy School that non-profits found "higher rates of online voter registration or poll worker sign-ups when a celebrity promotes these calls to action."</p>

<p>"While some polling shows that people claim they aren't influenced by celebrity voices when it comes to politics, more rigorous evidence indicates that these voices are incredibly powerful," Spillane said.</p>

<h3><strong>SWIFT ACTION ON BEHALF OF HARRIS</strong></h3>

<p>The Harris campaign and their supporters are building on the endorsement, announcing pre-orders for its latest campaign wear: Swift fan-inspired friendship bracelets.</p>

<p>The progressive group MoveOn.org is selling Swift T-shirts that play on Swift's ongoing Eras concert tour. The shirt, reading "In My Voting Era," is the fastest selling item the group has sold this year, spokesperson Britt Jacovich said.</p>

<p>Voters of Tomorrow, which seeks to boost the youth vote, is teaming up with the informal group "Swifties for Harris" on a phone bank on Saturday to target college students in Georgia and Wisconsin, both battleground states like Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Swift "is one of the most influential people of our generation, and we're definitely excited to see how we can take her message and turn that into more political action and get more people involved," said Jessica Siles, a spokesperson for Voters of Tomorrow.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earth's moon will soon have a temporary junior companion, an apparent mini moon revolving around our planet for about two months. In a rare event, an asteroid will be captured by Earth's gravity and will orbit the earth from September 29 to November 25 this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The asteroid 2024 PT5 was spotted on August 7 using the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), a NASA-funded asteroid impact early warning system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a report published in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/ad781f">Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society</a>, the asteroid is not too big with a diameter of just 10 metre (33 feet). During its 53-day tenure around the earth, 2024 PT5 will not be able to make a full orbit, instead it will perform a horseshoe loop before breaking away from the earth's gravitational pull.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The RNAAS report, authored by Carlos de la Fuente Marcos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos, says that Earth has a tendency to capture asteroids and pull them into its orbit. These asteroids sometimes perform one or more full revolutions around our planet while other times, they break away from the earth's elliptical path before completing an orbit. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2006, an asteroid captured by Earth's gravity revolved around it for a year from July 2006 to July 2007. However, the newly discovered 2024 PT5 seems to resemble the path of 2022 NX1, a temporary flyby that revolved around Earth in 1981 and 2022 without ever completing an orbit and will likely return to take another semi round in 2051.</p>

<p>While Earth may sometimes pull space junk into its orbit, the report says that 2024 PT5 is a natural object as "its short-term dynamical evolution closely resembles that of 2022 NX1, a confirmed natural object." The report also indicates that its orbital properties resemble that of asteroids that come from the Arjuna asteroid belt.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris will join celebrity Oprah Winfrey in a livestream event next week to rally support in key battleground states in the Nov. 5 presidential election, Harris' campaign said.</p>

<p>The "Unite for America" event will be in collaboration with Win With Black Women volunteer network, and will gather more than 140 grassroots groups to support Harris, the Democratic nominee, virtually on Thursday. Harris faces former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, in the election.</p>

<p>"What is essential to me is getting people motivated to vote - and that's my intention in hosting this event," Winfrey said in a statement. "My goal is to get people excited about the privilege and power of the vote."</p>

<p>Winfrey was the host of the long-running "The Oprah Winfrey Show," as well as a businesswoman and philanthropist.</p>

<p>The event, which will stream at 8 pm EDT (05:30 am IST) across online platforms including YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and Twitch, will feature representatives from dozens of groups that have organized over Zoom since the Harris campaign launched in July, including Latinas for Harris, White Dudes for Harris, Win With Black Men and Republicans for Harris.</p>

<p>Winfrey spoke at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August, to press the case for Harris.</p>

<p>"I'm calling on all you independents and all you undecided," Winfrey said then, describing herself as an independent voter. "Decency and respect are on the ballot in 2024."</p>

<p>Harris will also participate in an interview with the ABC News affiliate in Philadelphia that will air later on Friday, her campaign said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Athos Salome, known as the 'Living Nostradamus,' has claimed that four of his forecasts have become reality in 2024, including a looming asteroid threat, according to <em>The Daily Star.</em> This 36-year-old Brazilian parapsychologist has been celebrated for accurate predictions regarding the Covid-19 pandemic, Elon Musk buying Twitter (now X), and the death of Queen Elizabeth II.</p>

<p>The latest warning by Salome coincides with the recent confirmation by NASA over the asteroid now dubbed 'God of Chaos.' According to the Near-Earth Object Observations Programme, the gigantic asteroid that Salome had predicted would be a concern in July is expected to come close to Earth this Sunday. As Salome's past predictions start to materialise, his reputation as a psychic grows, leading to a whole Pandora's box of questions about the validity and consequences of his predictions.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/webstories/feature/meet-athos-salome-living-nostradamus-and-social-media-sensation-15710"><strong>Also Read | Meet Athos Salome, 'Living Nostradamus' And Social Media Sensation&nbsp;</strong></a></p>

<p>Speaking to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/living-nostradamus-made-seven-predictions-33643183"><em>Daily Star,</em></a> the Brazilian seer insists he isn't seeking praise or "unnecessary personal accolades," he just wants public validation of his realised visions.</p>

<p>Athos admitted: "I have noticed that, on several occasions, my predictions are appropriated by other individuals (not clairvoyants or paranormal experts) who present themselves as the originators of these ideas."</p>

<p>"On 28 July this year, I posted a video in my Instagram stories again about the asteroid, predicting that NASA would make an announcement in September, confirming that the asteroid would enter a collision course with Earth by November. My predictions are not coincidences. They are grounded and come true," he told the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/living-nostradamus-made-seven-predictions-33643183"><em>Daily Star.</em></a></p>

<p>Low and behold NASA has confirmed its Near-Earth Object Observations Program has been monitoring a huge asteroid dubbed 'God of Chaos'. It's expected to brush past us at a mere 620,000 miles away on Sunday.</p>

<p><strong>The beginning of World War 3</strong></p>

<p>Athos Salome has warned that World War 3 won't start in Ukraine or Gaza but will start in the disputed waters of the South China Sea through "some surprise event or a catastrophic cyber attack," as per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/living-nostradamus-made-seven-predictions-33643183"><em>Daily Star report.</em></a></p>

<p>Talking about the natural disasters, Athos told the news portal: "In September of 2024 real events supported these expectations with typhoon Yagi, which affected and brought a large amount of damages to these parts of the world.</p>

<p>"The typhoon had winds in excess of 93 mph causing devastating floods and landslides with casualties and major destruction of structures. I said that more and worse cases of the event would occur, and going by the observed natural disasters this year, I was right.</p>

<p>"The increase of these events deepens the discussion on climate change and the poor readiness of countries for the consequences of climate change."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Boeing's first strike in 16 years could further compound global shortages of jetliners that have been pushing up airfares and forcing airlines to keep older jets flying longer, industry executives and analysts said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Boeing's first strike in 16 years could further compound global shortages of jetliners that have been pushing up airfares and forcing airlines to keep older jets flying longer, industry executives and analysts said.</p>

<p>The US planemaker's West Coast workers went on strike at midnight on Friday after overwhelmingly rejecting a contract deal, halting production of Boeing's workhorse 737 MAX.</p>

<p>It is Boeing's first strike since 2008, and Boeing Chief Financial Officer Brian West warned a prolonged walkout could hurt output and "jeopardize our recovery".</p>

<p>"Boeing is a systemically important company for global aviation," Ross O'Connor, chief financial officer of Irish leasing company Avolon, told Reuters on Friday.</p>

<p>A strike "could have an impact on production levels, which could exacerbate some of the supply shortages that are in the market at the moment for sure," he said after Avolon announced it had acquired a large portfolio of jets from Castlelake.</p>

<p>Airlines have struggled to expand capacity to meet rising demand as supplies of jetliners are curtailed by parts shortages, industry-wide recruitment problems and overloaded maintenance shops.</p>

<p>Analysts have been warning the most promising part of the industry's all-important business cycle could run out before airlines have a chance to enjoy the full benefits of demand.</p>

<p>"It's going to be a significant amount of time before we see that balance. I'm starting to evolve the hypothesis that it won't be (extra) supply that corrects it, but instead a softening of demand," said Rob Morris, global head of consultancy at Cirium Ascend.</p>

<p>Some say high air fares - although good for airlines in the short term - could themselves accelerate that tipping point.</p>

<p>"My view is that (average fares) will rise; and when ticket prices go up, then all other things being equal, you have lower traffic levels," said aviation economist Adam Pilarski, senior vice-president at AVITAS consultancy.</p>

<p>As Boeing halts production of its most-sold jet, European rival Airbus is also struggling to meet its goals.</p>

<p>Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury expressed optimism at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce conference this week that the European planemaker would meet a recently lowered target of 770 deliveries this year, following a profit warning and engine supply glitch in the summer.</p>

<p>But following a short-lived spike in deliveries in July, industry sources questioned how comfortably the world's largest planemaker would exceed last year's 735.</p>

<p>Dwindling numbers of planes in storage and record-high utilization of existing planes confirm the supply squeeze.</p>

<p><strong>FLEET AGE RISING</strong></p>

<p>For now, Boeing's lower production levels compared to Airbus may limit the incremental effect of the strike. Yet analysts said airlines have little room to maneuver.</p>

<p>With leasing companies also running out of available capacity, carriers need to keep existing jets flying longer.</p>

<p>For most of the past 15 years, the average age of the fleet declined as airlines and leasing companies took advantage of low interest rates to invest in new fuel-saving jets.</p>

<p>In 2010, the average age of the widely flown single-aisle jet fleet was about 10.2 years, according to Cirium data.</p>

<p>After dipping to 9.1 years during the pandemic as airlines grounded fleets, the age started growing again. It now stands at 11.3 years "and still heading upwards," Morris said.</p>

<p>That is despite efforts to reach net zero emissions by 2050, which rely partly on modernizing the planes in service.</p>

<p>"It must mean that we're burning more CO2 than we should be because we're using more old aircraft...so one of the things that can go wrong is sustainability," Morris said.</p>

<p>The airline industry says it is confident of reaching a target of net zero emissions by 2050.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is meeting US President Joe Biden for talks on the next steps in supporting Ukraine, centring on whether to allow Western missiles to be used to hit targets in Russia.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been pleading with allies for months to let Ukraine fire Western missiles including long-range US ATACMS and British Storm Shadows deep into Russia to limit Moscow's ability to launch attacks.</p>

<p>The New York Times reported, citing European officials, that the United States looks set to approve the use by Ukraine of long range missiles against targets in Russia on the condition that the weapons were not those provided by the United States.</p>

<p>President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that the West would be directly fighting with Russia if it allowed Ukraine to strike Russian territory with Western-made long-range missiles, a move he said would alter the nature and scope of the conflict.</p>

<p>Focus now turns to talks in Washington after a joint fact-finding trip to Kyiv by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and British Foreign Secretary David Lammy earlier this week during which both allies offered new support for Ukraine, but no commitment on the missile use.</p>

<p>On Wednesday Lammy suggested discussions could continue beyond Friday, tempering expectations of a solid announcement from Starmer's Washington visit.</p>

<p>In remarks made on his way to Washington, reported by British media travelling with him, Starmer said:</p>

<p>"We will, of course, be talking about many things in the round, but this is not a sort of a series of individual decisions that we want to arrive at. It is making sure that all the decisions we made are within the strategic context."<br />

       <description><![CDATA[A woman sold three Taylor Swift concert tickets, initially purchased for her daughter's 13th birthday, after being upset by Swift's endorsement of Kamala Harris.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman has put up for sale three Taylor Swift concert tickets that she had purchased for her daughter's 13th birthday because of the popstar's recent endorsement of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. In a viral video she posted on social media, the woman said she no longer supports Swift due to the singer's political stance and what she described as "non-Christian beliefs." She has put the tickets up for sale for the Toronto stop of Swift's Eras tour. The woman was very disappointed with Swift's political endorsement and her lifestyle.</p>

<p>Addressing Swift in the video, she said, "My tickets are now up for sale because I don't want to spend another dollar supporting you and your private planes and your non-Christian beliefs."</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/taylor-swift-endorses-kamala-harris-on-instagram-after-debate-with-trump-6537920"><strong>Also Read | "I Will Vote For...": Taylor Swift's Long Post After Trump-Harris Debate</strong></a></p>

<p>In the three-minute clip, the woman claimed that Taylor Swift had planned her endorsement with Kamala prior to the debate.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">This concern mother has three tickets to the Taylor Swift concert in Toronto on November 15th. It was a special gift for her daughter who turns 13 that day. Her daughter has been a Taylor Swift fan forever, but because of Taylor's endorsement of Kamala, she now has those… <a href="https://t.co/frZxCUNm3Y">pic.twitter.com/frZxCUNm3Y</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"One, I think it's really interesting how you had that one long letter for all your fans already printed out two seconds after Kamala and Donald Trump had their debate, which only tells me you already had this written up before the debate, which also tells me that you did not have an open mind. Kamala lied to everyone on that stage and those of us that know, know," she said.</p>

<p>The woman whose name has not been revealed criticised the singer for her alleged lack of concern for the economy.</p>

<p>"Taylor, you are a billionaire. The rest of us are not; the rest of us are struggling; people can't afford homes, and some of us are losing our businesses. If Harris gets into office, our economy is screwed, but I know that doesn't affect you because you have all that money and private planes. You just don't even live in that kind of world," she said.</p>

<p>She also voiced her support for former President Donald Trump, whom she called "the right guy for the job," and criticised Swift as being "out of touch" with the concerns of everyday Americans.</p>

<p>'Donald Trump is the right guy for the job. If the economy of the United States suffers, the whole world suffers, Taylor. If the whole world suffers, there goes your job and your career because nobody is going to be able to afford going to your concerts,' she added.</p>

<p>The woman had originally purchased the tickets to attend Swift's November 15th concert to celebrate her daughter, whom she described as a long-time fan of the singer. But Swift's endorsement of Harris following a recent debate changed her mind.</p>

<p>As such, Swift wrote on <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C_wtAOKOW1z/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">Instagram in support of Harris:</a> "I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia launched a new overnight drone attack on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities on Saturday, prompting President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to issue a fresh appeal for more air defence and long-range capabilities.</p>

<p>Ukrainian air defences shot down 72 out of 76 Shahed drones over 12 regions in the centre, south and east of the country, the air force said.</p>

<p>"We need more capabilities to strengthen the air shield, air defence, and long-range capabilities to continue protecting life and our people," Zelenskiy, who is due to travel to the United States later this month, said on the Telegram messaging app.</p>

<p>There were no immediate reports of casualties but authorities described damage to buildings in several parts of the country.</p>

<p>Kyiv city authorities said that drone fragments fell on a municipal building in the city's Obolon district north of the centre early on Saturday, but no fire broke out at the site.</p>

<p>The governor of the region surrounding Kyiv said drone debris damaged several private houses and a commercial property, and also smashed windows at a high-rise residential building.</p>

<p>In the southern Odesa region, debris damaged several commercial buildings and private houses and also caused several fires.</p>

<p>Air alerts sounded for three to five hours during the night in many regions across Ukraine. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said air defence units had been in action in the capital during the night. Ukraine also deploys mobile groups of drone hunters and uses electronic warfare to repel frequent Russian drone strikes.</p>

<p>During nearly 31 months of the war, Moscow's forces bombarded Ukraine with thousands of drones and missiles, killing thousands of civilians, damaging the country's infrastructure and power sector and wrecking tens of thousands of residential and commercial buildings.</p>

<p>Moscow denies intentionally targeting civilians and says its long-range attacks aim to reduce Ukraine's ability to fight.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran has launched a research satellite into orbit with a rocket built by the Revolutionary Guards, state media reported.</p>

<p>The launch comes as the United States and European countries accuse Iran of transferring ballistic missiles to Russia that would be likely used in its war with Ukraine within weeks. Iran has denied this.</p>

<p>The Chamran-1 satellite, which was launched into space by the Qaem-100 satellite carrier, was put into a 550-kilometre (340-mile) orbit and its first signals had been received, the media said, adding that the solid fuel carrier was designed and built by the Aerospace Force of the Revolutionary Guards.</p>

<p>The primary mission of the satellite, which weighs 60 kg (132 pounds), "is to test hardware and software systems for demonstrating orbital manoeuvring technology in height and phase," according to state media.</p>

<p>In January, Iranian media reported that the Sorayya satellite had been launched into a 750 km orbit, the highest by the country so far.</p>

<p>The US military alleges the long-range ballistic technology used to put satellites into orbit could also allow Tehran to launch long-range weapons, possibly including nuclear warheads.</p>

<p>Tehran denies its satellite activities are a cover for ballistic missile development and says it has never pursued the development of nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Chamran-1's other mission was to "evaluate the cold gas propulsion subsystem in space systems and the performance of the navigation and attitude control subsystems", state media reported.</p>

<p>Iran, which has one of the biggest missile programmes in the West Asia (Middle East), has suffered several failed satellite launches in recent years due to technical issues.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese hit back at Elon Musk on Saturday after the tech mogul called his government "fascists" for proposing laws that would fine social media giants for spreading misinformation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Australia introduced a "combating misinformation" bill earlier this week, which includes sweeping powers to fine tech giants up to five per cent of their annual turnover for breaching online safety obligations.</p>

<p>"Fascists," Musk posted Thursday on his social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Albanese fired back at Musk on Saturday, saying social media "has a social responsibility".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"If Mr Musk doesn't understand that, that says more about him than it does about my government," he told reporters Saturday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The exchange between Musk and Australian officials is the latest in a long-running spat with the Australian government over social media regulation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Australia's government is exploring a raft of new measures that would see social media companies take greater accountability for the content on their platforms -- including a ban for those under 16 years old.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The country's online watchdog took Musk's company to court earlier this year, alleging it had failed to remove "extremely violent" videos that showed a Sydney preacher being stabbed.</p>

<p>But it abruptly dropped its attempt to force a global takedown order on X after Musk scored a legal victory in a preliminary hearing, a move he celebrated as a free speech triumph.</p>

<p>Musk, a self-described "free speech absolutist", has clashed with politicians and digital rights groups worldwide, including in the European Union, which could decide within months to take action against X with possible fines.</p>

<p>In Brazil, where X has effectively been suspended after it ignored a series of court directives, Musk has responded by blasting the judge as an "evil dictator cosplaying as a judge".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Social media is being flooded by digitally created "deepfake" videos using the trusted identities of famous doctors to promote dangerous miracle cures for serious health problems, experts warn.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media is being flooded by digitally created "deepfake" videos using the trusted identities of famous doctors to promote dangerous miracle cures for serious health problems, experts warn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Videos on Facebook and Instagram have taken advantage of the credibility of star TV doctors to advertise untested "natural" syrups for diabetes, even claiming that the proven, first-line drug metformin "could kill" patients.</p>

<p>These scams risk endangering lives, experts said, particularly because they deploy the likenesses of popular health experts such as British TV presenter Michael Mosley, who died earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"People do seem to trust these videos," British doctor John Cormack told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A lot of these media doctors have spent a great deal of time creating an image of trustworthiness, so they are believed even when they make incredible claims," said Cormack, who has worked with the British Medical Journal (BMJ) on the subject.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) expert Henry Ajder said that doctor deepfakes "really took off this year". &nbsp;</p>

<p>The AI videos typically target older audiences by faking the identity of doctors who appear regularly on daytime television, Ajder said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>French doctor Michel Cymes, who often appears on TV in France, told AFP in May that he was taking legal action against Facebook owner Meta about "scams" using his image.&nbsp;</p>

<p>British doctor Hilary Jones even hired an investigator to track deepfakes that featured his likeness.</p>

<p>One video depicted Jones selling a false cure for high blood pressure -- as well as weed gummies -- on a UK TV show on which he regularly appears.</p>

<p>"Even if they're taken down, they just pop up the next day under a different name," Jones lamented in the BMJ.</p>

<h3><strong>'Game of cat and mouse'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Recent advances in AI have made the quality of deepfake images, audio and video far more convincing, explained French academic and AI expert Frederic Jurie.</p>

<p>"Today we have access to tens of billions of images, and we are able to build algorithms that can model everything that appears in the images and regenerate them. This is what we call generative AI," he said.</p>

<p>It is not just the likenesses of widely respected doctors being misused.</p>

<p>The appearance of controversial French researcher Didier Raoult -- who has been accused of spreading misleading information about COVID-19 drugs -- has also been used in several deepfake videos.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Australian naturopath Barbara O'Neill, who has been roundly condemned for claiming that baking soda can cure cancer, has been falsely depicted selling pills that "clean blood vessels" in TikTok videos.</p>

<p>Contacted by AFP, her husband Michael O'Neill deplored that "a lot of unethical people" were using his wife's name "to sell products that she does not recommend, and in some cases, they are just outright scams".</p>

<p>Some fake videos spiral even further down the rabbit hole, falsely claiming that O'Neill died from a miracle oil sold on Amazon.</p>

<p>AI expert Adjer was not surprised that such controversial health figures were also falling victim to deepfakes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"They are highly trusted by people in circles that, let's say, are unorthodox or conspiratorial," he said.</p>

<p>The experts were not optimistic that newly developed AI detection tools were capable of fighting back against the onslaught of deepfakes.</p>

<p>"It's a game of cat and mouse," Jurie said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rather than trying to find all the fake videos out there, he pointed to technology that can "guarantee that content has not been altered, such as for messaging, thanks to software that produces digital signatures like a certificate", he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/i6ubmn8g_modi-malaysia-pm_625x300_20_August_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>As India steps into its third term under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration, Southeast Asia has emerged as a central focus of its foreign policy. The region plays a crucial role in the Indo-Pacific theatre and has become pivotal to India's strategic, economic, and diplomatic interests.</p>

<p>Recent high-level engagements, such as Modi's visit to Singapore and Brunei in early September, External Affairs Minister Jaishankar's articulation of India's stance on the South China Sea, and the visits of Vietnamese and Malaysian Prime Ministers to India, signal a continuity in the strategic significance of Southeast Asia to India's foreign policy vision.</p>

<h2><strong>'Look East' To 'Act East'</strong></h2>

<p>The central government's "Act East Policy," an evolution from the previous "Look East Policy," signifies a more proactive engagement with Southeast Asian nations. Under Modi, this policy has become a cornerstone of India's Indo-Pacific strategy, which promotes a free, open, inclusive, and rules-based order.</p>

<p>The region's strategic importance is underscored by its geographical proximity to India and its role as a gateway to the South China Sea, a vital maritime corridor for global trade. Southeast Asia is a crucial part of the Indo-Pacific's geopolitical framework, and India's growing relationship with the region is seen as a counterbalance to China's expanding and often predatory influence. In Modi 3.0, India aims to solidify its position as a reliable partner in the Indo-Pacific region, with Southeast Asia being a crucial element of this strategy.</p>

<p>New Delhi has placed particular emphasis on fostering closer ties with ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) member states. Trade between India and ASEAN has grown steadily in recent years, with bilateral trade exceeding $100 billion in 2023. In addition to economic cooperation, India's strategic interests in the region have also deepened.</p>

<h2><strong>Singapore, Brunei, Vietnam</strong></h2>

<p>In Singapore, Modi's talks with newly elected Prime Minister Lawrence Wong resulted in substantive agreements, particularly in the semiconductor sector in addition to health, skilling, and digital security. The "India-Singapore Semiconductor Ecosystem Partnership" inked during the visit, aims to facilitate the entry of Singaporean companies into India. This partnership is integral to New Delhi's ambitions to become a global semiconductor hub, leveraging complementary strengths to build resilience in the global chip supply chain. Parallelly, Modi's visit to Brunei, a strategically located nation in the South China Sea, marked a key moment in India's Act East Policy and Indo-Pacific vision. It was the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister and coincided with the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p>

<p>In Modi 3.0, Vietnam has emerged as one of India's most important Southeast Asian partners. The two countries share concerns over China's growing assertiveness in the South China Sea, where both India and Vietnam have vested interests in oil exploration and freedom of navigation. Discussions on defence cooperation, trade, and energy security marked the visit of Vietnamese Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính to India. Vietnam is a linchpin in India's Act East Policy and Indo-Pacific strategy, strengthening their naval ties and defence collaboration. India and Vietnam have signed several agreements on defence, maritime security, and energy and economic cooperation. Both countries are committed to upholding international law in the South China Sea, further aligning their strategic interests. The bilateral relationship has also expanded into renewable energy, IT, and infrastructure development, with India playing a significant role in Vietnam's development plans.</p>

<h2><strong>Resetting Ties With Malaysia</strong></h2>

<p>Similarly, the visit of Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to India highlighted a much-needed reset in bilateral ties following a dip in relations before 2022. Malaysia's importance to India stems from its strategic location along vital maritime routes in the Indo-Pacific and its role as a significant trading partner. During Anwar's visit, the two leaders discussed enhancing economic cooperation, particularly in technology, renewable energy, and digital connectivity. Malaysia's support for India's Act East Policy and its role in ASEAN make it a valuable partner for India as it seeks to expand its presence in Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2><strong>The South China Sea Question</strong></h2>

<p>Finally, India's position on the South China Sea has evolved significantly over the years, shifting from a cautious, neutral stance to one that has now clearly articulated its support for the Philippines' sovereign maritime territorial claims, freedom of navigation and maritime resource exploitation, in line with international law. This aligns India with Southeast Asian nations against unilateral actions by China, while also serving India's strategic interests by ensuring freedom of navigation and bolstering regional security. India's nuanced stance, informed by its own territorial tensions with China on its northern land border, underscores its intent to deter unilateral and unlawful advances.</p>

<p>Modi 3.0 marks a significant evolution in India's engagement with Southeast Asia, driven by geopolitical imperatives and economic interests. The Modi administration has steadily deepened the extent and scope of its ties with Southeast Asian countries, and his third consecutive tenure in office looks poised to build on the gains of the last ten years.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump has defended his ties with Laura Loomer, who has drawn fire from some of his Republican allies for embracing conspiracy theories and making racist comments, including against Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>"Laura has been a supporter of mine. Just like a lot of people are supporters, and she's been a supporter of mine. She speaks very positively of the campaign," Trump, the former president, said on Friday at a news conference in Southern California.</p>

<p>He was responding to a question from a reporter about his allies expressing concern about his close relationship with Loomer in recent days.</p>

<p>"I don't control Laura. Laura - she's a free spirit. Well, I don't know. I mean, look, I can't tell Laura what to do," Trump said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;"She is a strong person, she's got strong opinions, and I don't know what she said, but that's not up to me," he added.</p>

<p>Several of Loomer's posts on social media this week came under fire, including one where she nodded to a conspiracy theory about the 9/11 attacks.</p>

<p>"23 years later, and there's still a lot of unanswered questions," Loomer posted on Friday, alongside a video of Trump in 2001 questioning whether aeroplanes could cause explosions like the ones that happened at the Twin Towers on 9/11," Loomer wrote.</p>

<p>Loomer, often seen as a right-wing conspiracy theorist, in another post on Sunday, said the "White House will smell like curry &amp; White House speeches will be facilitated via a call centre" if Harris wins the November 5 presidential election.</p>

<p>Harris, a Democrat, will take on Trump in the November election.</p>

<p>NBC News asked Trump whether he'd been informed of Loomer's conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>"I don't know that much about it. No, I don't," he said, adding, "I know she's a big fan of the campaign, but I really don't know." Trump later sought to distance himself from Loomer's statements, though without specifying which ones.</p>

<p>In a Truth Social post, Trump said that Loomer "doesn't work for the Campaign. She's a private citizen and longtime supporter. " Even in that post, Trump defended Loomer and said: "Like the many millions of people who support me, she is tired of watching the Radical Left Marxists and Fascists violently attack and smear me." Several Republicans denounced Loomer for her remarks.</p>

<p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis said Loomer was a "crazy conspiracy theorist who regularly utters disgusting garbage intended to divide Republicans".</p>

<p>"The history of statements by Ms. Loomer are beyond disturbing," Senator Lindsey Graham, also a Republican told The Washington Post on Thursday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

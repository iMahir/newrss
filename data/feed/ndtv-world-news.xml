       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's powerful army sent its officers to London in 2022 to convince former prime minister Nawaz Sharif to return to the country to "save" it from destruction under Imran Khan's regime, the ruling PML-N supremo's son-in-law claimed on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Nawaz, 74, had returned from London in October last year after spending four years in self-imposed exile on medical grounds. Upon his arrival, he was acquitted in all the cases he was facing including the Al-Azizia Mills corruption case in which he was serving a seven-year imprisonment before leaving for the UK.</p>

<p>"The Army had gone to London (in 2022) and touched the knees of Nawaz Sharif and requested him to come to Pakistan and save it from the destruction of (former prime minister) Imran Khan," Capt Muhammad Safdar (retd.) while addressing party workers of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N). He said when Nawaz returned to become prime minister for the fourth time then the powerful circles (a reference to the powerful military) decided against it.</p>

<p>"To stop him from becoming the premier they ensured that Nawaz lost the election from NA-15 Mansehra," he said and chided the Election Commission of Pakistan for manipulating the result of Nawaz, a three-time former prime minister.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Nawaz had won Lahore's seat in the February 8 general election which Khan's party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf alleged that he had also lost this seat but the ECP declared him successful in the country's worst-ever rigged polls.</p>

<p>Nawaz himself had admitted that he was a candidate to become premier but his party failed to get a simple majority therefore it was decided that his younger brother Shehbaz Sharif should be made the prime minister.</p>

<p>The PTI has alleged that the PML-N had won only six per cent seats of the National Assembly and the military establishment gifted dozens of its winning seats after getting the results changed through ECP to the PML-N so that its puppet setup led by Shehbaz Sharif could come to power and serve its interests.</p>

<p>PML-N sources said that Nawaz had agreed not to contest for the Prime Minister's slot after the military establishment offered him to make his daughter Maryam Nawaz Punjab Chief Minister.</p>

<p>The powerful Army, which has ruled the coup-prone country for more than half of its 75-plus years of existence, has hitherto wielded considerable power in the matters of security and foreign policy.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Conflict, economic turbulence and extreme weather scuppered efforts to curb hunger last year, with around nine per cent of the world's population affected, UN agencies said on Wednesday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Conflict, economic turbulence and extreme weather scuppered efforts to curb hunger last year, with around nine per cent of the world's population affected, UN agencies said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>About 733 million people may have faced hunger in 2023, a level that has held steady for three years after a steep rise following the COVID-19 pandemic, they said in a report.</p>

<p>But the picture is uneven. While hunger affected one in every five people in Africa, compared with a global average of one in 11, Latin America and the Caribbean progressed and Asia stalled in the goal of eliminating undernourishment.</p>

<p>The broader goal of securing regular access to adequate food for everyone also stalled in that period.</p>

<p>Moderate or severe food insecurity, which forces people to occasionally skip meals, hit 2.33 billion people last year -- almost 29 per cent of the global population.</p>

<p>The report by the Food and Agriculture Organization, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, UNICEF, the World Food Programme and the World Health Organization suggests the UN goal of a world without hunger by 2030 is fading further.</p>

<p>Conflicts, climate chaos and economic downturns are already known as major drivers of food insecurity and malnutrition that combine with underlying factors including persistent inequality, the unaffordability of healthy diets and unhealthy food environments.</p>

<p>But these major drivers are becoming more frequent and intense -- and occurring concurrently more often -- meaning more people are exposed to hunger and food insecurity, the report said.</p>

<p>A healthy diet was unaffordable for more than one-third of the world's population in 2022, the report added, citing updated estimates.</p>

<p>Here too regional inequalities were stark: more than 71 percent of people in low-income countries could not afford healthy diets, compared with just over six percent in high-income nations.</p>

<h3><strong>'No time to lose'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>According to David Laborde, an economist at the Food and Agriculture Organization and one of the report's authors, the post-Covid economic rebound was unequal within and between countries.</p>

<p>Wars and extreme weather events also raged unabated in 2023, but the world has failed to put in place a "Marshall Plan" to bolster funds earmarked for fighting hunger, he told AFP.</p>

<p>The UN agencies' report, which was presented for a G20 summit in Brazil, suggested a major reform of financing food security and nutrition to alleviate the scourge.</p>

<p>This would start with adopting common definitions putting all actors on the same page. According to current estimates, between $176 billion and $3,975 billion are needed to eradicate hunger by 2030.</p>

<p>Yet the "highly fragmented" financial architecture "makes the scale-up and effective implementation of financing for food security and nutrition unfeasible", the report said.</p>

<p>Donors, international agencies, NGOs and foundations must coordinate better as the current set-up lacks shared priorities and is characterised by "an over-proliferation of actors delivering mostly small, short-term projects", it added.</p>

<p>Food security and nutrition is not simply a question of "distributing bags of rice in emergency situations", Laborde said, but also aid to small-scale farmers and access to energy in rural areas that could electrify irrigation systems.</p>

<p>Another weakness of the current system is that donor intentions do not always meet the needs of populations, according to the report.</p>

<p>Debates over animal husbandry in some European countries may discourage investment in intensifying it in Africa, which is necessary, said Laborde.</p>

<p>He pointed to Africa's Sahel region, where chronic instability and military coups have seen donors suspend their aid just as the population needs it most.</p>

<p>The report also recommended developing financial instruments combining private and public funds so that private actors invest in food security, a source of productivity and political stability.</p>

<p>"There is no time to lose, as the cost of inaction greatly exceeds the cost of action this report calls for," it concluded.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli forces carried out new raids in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, hours before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was due to address the U.S. Congress.</p>

<p>The latest Israeli attacks destroyed homes in towns east of Khan Younis in southern Gaza and thousands of people were forced to head west to seek shelter, residents said.</p>

<p>The Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said it had received distress calls from residents trapped in their homes in Bani Suhaila, east of Khan Younis, but were unable to reach the town.</p>

<p>Medics later said two Palestinians had been killed in an airstrike on Bani Suhaila, where the armed wing of the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas said fighters had detonated a bomb against an Israeli army personnel carrier.</p>

<p>Israel's military, which is trying to eradicate Hamas after the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, said it had been operating in areas from which fighters had been able to fire rockets into Israel and attack Israeli troops.</p>

<p>Gaza health officials said Israeli military strikes in the past 24 hours had killed at least 55 people, the latest casualties in a war that health authorities in the enclave say has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians.</p>

<p>"Where should we go? Shall we cross into the sea?" said Ghada, who has been displaced with her family six times during the war, via a chat app from Hamad City in northwestern Khan Younis.</p>

<p>"We are exhausted, starved, and want the war to end now, now not an hour later."</p>

<p>Residents said they had been ordered to head west towards a designated humanitarian area, but that the area was now unsafe. The Israeli military issued the evacuation orders on social media, and some residents received orders to leave by phone.</p>

<p>Israeli forces also launched airstrikes on several areas of central and northern Gaza, including one on Al-Bureij camp in central Gaza which health officials said killed nine people.</p>

<h3><strong>PALESTINIANS CRITICISE US</strong></h3>

<p>Hamas-led fighters triggered the war on Oct. 7 by storming into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 captives, according to Israeli tallies. Some 120 hostages are still being held though Israel believes one in three are dead.</p>

<p>Some Palestinians who gathered at a hospital in Khan Younis before funerals criticised the United States, Israel's most important international ally, for welcoming Netanyahu.</p>

<p>He was due to address Congress later on Wednesday and to meet President Joe Biden at the White House on Thursday. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he would meet Netanyahu in Florida on Friday.</p>

<p>"The United States is a main partner in what is happening in Gaza. We are being killed because of the United States. We are being slaughtered by American planes, American ships, American tanks, and American troops," said Kazem Abu Taha, a displaced resident from Rafah.</p>

<p>A senior Hamas official, Sami Abu Zuhri, told Reuters: "The Congress invitation to Netanyahu to make a speech gives legitimacy to the crimes of the war of genocide in Gaza. Receiving a war criminal is a shame to all Americans."</p>

<p>Israel has rejected accusations brought by South Africa at the U.N.'s top court that its military operation in Gaza is a state-led genocide campaign against Palestinians. It has reacted angrily to a decision by the International Criminal Court's prosecutor to seek an arrest warrant against Netanyahu.</p>

<p>Netanyahu says a deal to release Israelis from captivity in Gaza could be near, but Hamas officials say they see no change in Israel's stance.</p>

<p>Hamas wants a ceasefire agreement to end the war in Gaza. Netanyahu says the war cannot end before Hamas is eradicated.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Heavy rains in the Houston area of Texas have brought out poisonous, foot-long worms that can regenerate if cut in half..]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Heavy rains in the Houston area of Texas have brought out poisonous, foot-long worms that can regenerate if cut in half. The hammerhead flatworm, an invasive species, secretes toxins that can cause skin irritation and is poisonous to pets if ingested.</p>

<p>These worms are often found on lawns, sidewalks and roads after rainstorms, posing a risk to people and animals. They prefer hot and humid climates, experts say.</p>

<p>Ashley Morgan-Olvera, M.S., with the Texas Invasive Species Institute, warned that the worm regenerates. "So if you chop it into two pieces, you get two worms," she told KHOU.</p>

<p>Instead, residents are advised to wear gloves and put the worms in a plastic bag with salt, vinegar or citrus oil, and then freeze them overnight. Touching it is not recommended even if the worm is dead. If touched, wash the affected area with soap and water, and apply hand sanitiser.</p>

<p>The hammerhead worm, also known as a shovelhead or arrowhead, is a menacing pest that gets its name from its distinctive head shape, similar to that of a hammerhead shark. Growing up to 15 inches long, these worms have often even been mistaken for snakes. But what makes them truly dangerous is their toxic slime, which they use to paralyse earthworms - a vital component of crops, gardens and natural environments.</p>

<p>Dr Blake Layton Jr, an entomology expert with Mississippi State University, explains the hammerhead worm's "mouth" stretches out to digest the earthworm's body after coating it with the same toxic slime that causes skin irritation in humans and sickness in animals.</p>

<p>Hammerhead worms also have the potential to carry parasites, making them an even greater threat. When they reproduce asexually, they can create new worms that are genetically identical to the parent, according to KHOU.</p>

<p>As Dr Layton Jr explains, "A portion of the rear of the worm breaks off and grows a new head, producing a new flatworm genetically identical to its parent, a literal 'chip off the old block'."</p>

<p>This means that a single hammerhead worm can quickly become multiple worms, spreading its toxic slime and parasites throughout your yard.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Garment factories and banks reopened in Bangladesh Wednesday after authorities eased a curfew imposed to contain deadly clashes sparked by student protests over civil service employment quotas.</p>

<p>Last week's violence killed at least 186 people, according to an AFP count of victims reported by police and hospitals, during some of the worst unrest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's tenure.</p>

<p>Thousands of troops are patrolling cities around the South Asian country to keep order, and most Bangladeshis remain without internet nearly a week after a nationwide shutdown was imposed.</p>

<p>But with calm returning to the streets after several days of unbridled mayhem, the country's economically vital textile factories resumed operations after government clearance.</p>

<p>"We were worried about the future of our company," 40-year-old factory worker Khatun, who gave only one name, told AFP.</p>

<p>Despite the disruption, Khatun said she supported the demands of student protesters to reform government hiring rules and was shocked by last week's violence.</p>

<p>"The government should implement all their demands," she said. "A lot of them were killed. They sacrificed for future generations."</p>

<p>The garment industry generates $50 billion in yearly export revenue for Bangladesh, employing millions of young women to sew clothes for H&amp;M, Zara, Gap and other leading international brands.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association told AFP that garment factories had resumed business "across the country".</p>

<p>Hasina's home minister Asaduzzaman Khan agreed to exempt textile workers from an ongoing curfew to allow them to return to work, the peak body's spokesman said.</p>

<p>The curfew was eased Wednesday to allow some commerce to resume but remains in effect for most Bangladeshis for 19 hours each day.</p>

<p>Banks, the stock exchange in the capital Dhaka, and some government offices also opened between 10:00 am and 3:00 pm to match the daily break in the stay-home order, government spokesman Shibli Sadiq told AFP.</p>

<h3><strong>'So much blood'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The student group which led this month's protests has suspended demonstrations until at least Friday, with one leader saying they had not wanted reform "at the expense of so much blood".</p>

<p>Police have arrested at least 2,500 people since the violence began last week.</p>

<p>Hasina's government says the stay-home order will be relaxed further as the situation improves.</p>

<p>Broadband internet was being gradually restored on Tuesday evening but mobile internet -- a key communication method for protest organisers -- remained inoperative.</p>

<p>Internet connectivity across Bangladesh was still around 20 percent of normal levels, according to data published by US-based monitor Netblocks.</p>

<p>With around 18 million young people in Bangladesh out of work, according to government figures, the June reintroduction of the quota scheme -- halted since 2018 -- deeply upset graduates facing an acute jobs crisis.</p>

<p>Critics say the quota is used to stack public jobs with loyalists to Hasina's Awami League.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court on Sunday cut the number of reserved jobs but fell short of protesters' demands to scrap the quotas entirely.</p>

<p>Hasina, 76, has ruled the country since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.</p>

<p>Her government is also accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including by the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[At least 50 people have been killed and more than 400 wounded since the start of the protests on June 18, according to rights groups]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dozens of journalists joined marches in Kenya on Wednesday in protest at what they see as heavy-handed government tactics to stifle media freedoms, including police attacks on journalists during the demonstrations that have rocked the country for the past five weeks.</p>

<p>The journalists -- many wearing white -- held placards reading "Journalists lives matter", "Shoot not the messenger" and "End the brutality" as they staged rallies across several towns and cities.</p>

<p>The protests were organised in the wake of attacks on journalists covering the anti-government demonstrations, among other grievances.</p>

<p>Launched last month by young Gen-Z Kenyans over tax increases, the rallies have spiralled into deadly violence and morphed into wider anger against President William Ruto's government.</p>

<p>At least 50 people have been killed and more than 400 wounded since the start of the protests on June 18, according to rights groups.</p>

<p>Journalists covering the events have been shot at, tear-gassed and hit with batons and water cannon, media groups say, further eroding trust in the East African nation's security forces.</p>

<p>"Freedom of the media and freedom of expression generally is on the verge of being eroded, courtesy of a rogue security apparatus," the Kenya Editors Guild said in a statement last week.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, journalists in the capital Nairobi presented a petition to the police headquarters before marching to parliament.</p>

<p>"We are asking for protection from the police and for them to stop shooting and attacking journalists with a lot of excessive force," said the secretary general of the Kenya Union of Journalists, Erick Oduor.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Full-blown conflict' -</strong></p>

<p>State-funded regulator the Media Council of Kenya said it was "deeply concerned" about the deterioration of the relationship between the media and the government.</p>

<p>"What started as a perception about biased media coverage of the 2022 general election has now escalated into full blown conflict pitting the government against the media; resulting in unwarranted threats, blame games, coercion, intimidating and bad blood," it said in a statement on Monday.</p>

<p>Kenya -- an East African economic powerhouse -- has long stood as an oasis of democracy in a volatile region.</p>

<p>Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders, known by its French acronym RSF, ranks Kenya 102nd out of 180 countries on its global list of press freedom, saying "investigations into abuses committed against journalists rarely result in convictions".</p>

<p>Kenyan police are often accused by rights groups of using excessive force and carrying out unlawful killings, especially in poor neighbourhoods.</p>

<p>A Kenyan court this month found police acted unlawfully over the October 2022 killing of Pakistani journalist Arshad Sharif in a town south of Nairobi.</p>

<p>Sharif, a strident critic of Pakistan's powerful military establishment and a supporter of former premier Imran Khan, was shot in the head when Kenyan police opened fire on his car.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Mr Trump might still make an appearance at smaller outdoor rallies, but they will take place in places like stadiums with strictly restricted admissions.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump is planning to stop holding campaign rallies outdoors in the wake of the 13 July assassination attempt, as per a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-stop-holding-outdoor-rallies-report-us-presidential-election-1929388"><em>Newsweek</em></a>. The team of the Republican contender for 2024 has stated that campaigning will be held indoors for security reasons. Mr Trump might still make an appearance at smaller outdoor rallies, but they will take place in places like stadiums with strictly restricted admissions.</p>

<p>Notably, Mr Trump has hosted hundreds of outdoor rallies since he announced his presidential campaign. For his fans and supporters, these events have taken on the character of festivals, complete with parties and vendors selling campaign memorabilia and products.</p>

<p>The move, which was first reported by the <em>Washington Post</em>, coincides with the resignation of Kimberly Cheatle, the director of the Secret Service, on Tuesday. Ms Cheatle was subjected to a hostile grilling by both Democrats and Republicans before a congressional committee over apparent security lapses before a 20-year-old gunman's attempt on Mr Trump's life.</p>

<p>In a letter of resignation, Ms Cheatle stated she had decided to leave the agency "with a heavy heart," citing the Butler rally as the reason it "fell short" of the agency's mandate to "protect our nation's leaders."</p>

<p>According to the <em>Washington Post </em>report, Mr Trump's team informed the Secret Service that the 2024 re-election campaign intended to host big events and would require more resources and security. However, it is believed that the agency rejected the requests due to a shortage of funding.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the 45th US President was hit in the ear in an assassination bid by a gunman at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania today. Blood was visible on his cheeks and mouth. The shooter was identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks. He has been killed. A spectator was also killed in the shooting and two others were "critically" injured, officials said.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old Republican presidential contender, whose team claimed he was "fine," was attacked shortly as he began his speech. "I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin," Mr Trump said on his Truth Social account.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People with anxiety could be at three times the risk of developing dementia compared to those without anxiety, according to a study.</p>

<p>People aged 60-70 years with chronic (persistent) anxiety were found to be more likely to develop the mental condition in which memory and decision-making are impaired, affecting daily activities, according to the study published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.</p>

<p>Researchers, including those from the University of Newcastle, UK, said that people whose anxiety was resolved did not have a higher dementia risk compared to those who never had it.</p>

<p>Therefore, the researchers suggested that successfully resolving anxieties could help mitigate risk of developing dementia.</p>

<p>"The findings suggest that anxiety may be a new risk factor to target in the prevention of dementia and also indicate that treating anxiety may reduce this risk," Kay Khaing from the University of Newcastle and corresponding author of the study said.</p>

<p>Previous studies examining links between anxiety and dementia have largely measured anxiety at the start, according to the authors.</p>

<p>However, few studies have looked at how persistent anxiety, along with age when one develops anxiety, impacted dementia risk, they said.</p>

<p>For the study, the researchers included more than 2,000 individuals with an average age of 76 years, of whom close to 450 (21 per cent) had anxiety to begin with. The group was followed for over 10 years.</p>

<p>During an intermediate follow-up after five years, the participants were deemed to have 'chronic anxiety' if anxiety persisted and 'new onset anxiety' if they developed it.</p>

<p>Anxiety was measured using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), a 10-item questionnaire used as a brief screen to identify distress levels.</p>

<p>Those with chronic anxiety and those who developed anxiety during the study had 2.8 and 3.2 times higher risks of having dementia, respectively, the authors found. The average time taken for dementia diagnosis from the study's start was 10 years, they said.</p>

<p>"Chronic and new anxiety were associated with increased risk of all-cause dementia, and this association was significant in those 70 years and younger," the authors wrote.</p>

<p>They also found that anxiety resolved at follow-up lowered dementia risk levels down to those in people who never had anxiety.</p>

<p>"These results suggest that timely management of anxiety may be a viable strategy in reducing the risk of dementia," the authors wrote.</p>

<p>Possible processes through which anxiety can heighten dementia risk can include inflammation, cell death, along with higher chances of such individuals engaging in unhealthy behaviours, such as physical inactivity and smoking, they said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recounting the harrowing experience of witnessing the Nepal plane crash that claimed 18 lives the eyewitnesses said that if the plane wouldn't have hit the container, it would have definitely hit the residential area.</p>

<p>Eyewitness, Aadesh Lama, who witnessed the crash, said, "I was working here at my garage in the morning and then I heard a loud sound. We thought a tyre had burst but we came to know that a plane had crashed. It had knocked a container, if it wasn't the container then it surely would have slid down and hit the residential area. The container saved us. It struck the container and came to the ground and got engulfed by fire."</p>

<p>Another witness, Krishna Bahadur Thapa, detailed his initial reaction.<br />
"I heard a loud bang, about three to four of us were here. We first assumed it to be a vehicle accident but it turned out to be an aircraft that had crashed. The plane slid down and stopped, at first there was the sound, then after the smoke billowed and then it was engulfed by fire. I rushed near to the site where the plane crashed and there again was an explosion and then I ran backwards with fear," Thapa said while speaking to ANI.</p>

<p>An aircraft of Saurya Airlines crashed during take-off at the Tribhuvan International Airport on Wednesday, Nepal-based daily, The Himalayan Times reported. The plane was scheduled to leave for Pokhara from Kathmandu when the accident happened.</p>

<p>The Tribhuvan International Airport, in an official release, said that 18 dead bodies were recovered from the site and only 1 person survived the crash.</p>

<p>The TIA said "CRJ7 (Reg-9NAME) of Sourya Airlines took off from Kathmandu at 11:11 am local time during the flight to Pokhara, turned right and crashed at a place on the east side of the runway. It is reported that the fire was brought under control and the rescue work was started immediately. The dead bodies of 18 people were recovered and 1 injured person was rescued and taken to the hospital."<br />
The Pilot of the Saurya Airline plane that crashed at the Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) in Kathmandu is the lone survivor of the crash.</p>

<p>The plane 9N-AME (CRJ 200) was only carrying technical staff of the airline, with no passengers on board. Gyanendra Bhul, information officer at TIA, confirmed that the plane was carrying a few technical staff members.</p>

<p>The plane crashed shortly after taking off from the runway, at around 11:00 AM today. Following the crash, smoke was seen coming from the plane. Firefighters and security personnel, including Nepal Police and the Nepali Army, were deployed to the crash site.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[A French police source told that security is "expecting actions and disturbances around the stadium" on Wednesday and said it was possible that "people shout insults from the stands" or that there is "whistling and flags shown during the match.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Around 1,000 French police officers will be on duty on Wednesday to protect Israel's football match against Mali at the Paris Olympics where protests are also expected, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said.</p>

<p>The game involving the Israeli team at the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris, as well as the Ukraine-Iraq match in the southeastern city of Lyon, have been identified by French security forces as high risk.</p>

<p>"All the competitions have a security plan, but it's true that these two matches, and particularly the match at the Parc des Princes, will have security, an anti-terror perimeter," Darmanin told BFM television and RMC radio.</p>

<p>"Tonight at the Parc des Princes there will be a thousand police officers who will ensure that we are there for the sport," he added.</p>

<p>All Israeli athletes at the Paris Games, which start officially on Friday, will have round-the-clock personal security provided by elite French police, both inside the Olympic village and every time they leave the compound in northern Paris.</p>

<p>A French police source told AFP that security forces were "expecting actions and disturbances around the stadium" on Wednesday and said it was possible that "people shout insults from the stands" or that there is "whistling and flags shown during the hymns, for example."</p>

<p>The game kicks off 9:00 pm (1900 GMT).</p>

<p>Europalestine, a French activist group behind recent protests, told the Guardian newspaper that it was planning a peaceful demonstration inside the stadium to protest the "genocide" in Gaza.</p>

<p>The head of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Thomas Bach and French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday rejected a Palestinian demand that Israel be barred from the Paris Games over the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>The Palestine Olympic Committee asked for a ban on Israel in a letter to the IOC, citing the bombings of the besieged Gaza Strip as a breach of the Olympic truce.</p>

<p>The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Tuesday at least 39,090 people have been killed in more than nine months of war between Israel and Palestinian fighters.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About 3,000 people carrying bags, water and small children trod through intense heat along a highway in southern Mexico on Tuesday, traveling in two groups aiming to reach the US border.</p>

<p>Over the past week migrants have launched two caravans - large groups of people walking together - bound for the United States. In the past such caravans have stirred intense debate in the United States, where immigration is likely to be a key topic ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election.</p>

<p>"Whoever is (in charge of the US government), we will continue the fight to be there," said Leivi Galvna, a migrant from Honduras. "We have to fight for our dream."</p>

<p>As they walked, the group shouted phrases like "yes we can," while pushing worn-out strollers.</p>

<p>In recent years, caravans have been a means for tens of thousands of migrants to cross Mexico, often as a safety measure amid reports that robberies, rapes and kidnappings of migrants are common.</p>

<p>The caravans are often a lifeline for those who cannot afford to pay a smuggler or human trafficker for a "safer" journey.</p>

<p>"I travel more safely in a caravan, I don't want to be killed in Mexico," said Yoisy, a Venezuelan migrant who was tired of waiting for an appointment through the US Customs and Border Protection CBP One platform to apply for asylum.</p>

<p>The Security Ministry in Chiapas, Mexico's southernmost state, bordering Guatemala, told Reuters there were between 2,500 and 3,000 people in the caravan and most were Venezuelans.</p>

<p>Another local government source said there had been a significant increase in the number of children in recent caravans.</p>

<p>In June, when the Biden administration early in the month implemented a policy prohibiting migrants caught crossing the US-Mexico border illegally from applying for asylum, the daily average of arrests ranged between 2,500 and 3,000 migrants per day for a week, a huge decline from prior months.</p>

<p>But thousands of migrants continue to take a shot at seeking asylum in the United States with the hope of leaving behind insecurity, poverty and other problems in their home countries.</p>

<p>Jose Maria Garcia, director of the Juventud 2000 migrant shelter in Tijuana, said he did not know to which border town the caravans were headed, but said the uncertain outcome of the upcoming US elections could be a motivating catalyst.</p>

<p>"The migrant community is very confused," he said, of how migrants view the future of US immigration policy.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An explosion at a factory producing Jose Cuervo tequila in Mexico killed five people Tuesday, local authorities said.</p>

<p>"So far the deaths of five people are confirmed, workers of the company," the civil protection unit in the western state of Jalisco said in a statement.</p>

<p>Two others were injured, one seriously, the statement added.</p>

<p>It was not yet known what caused the blast in Tequila municipality, with the company saying it happened during maintenance work.</p>

<p>It impacted four containers with a capacity of 219,000 litres each, two of which collapsed, said Victor Hugo Roldan, state director of civil protection.</p>

<p>"The Jalisco Institute of Forensic Sciences is already here to do their expert report," he told journalists.</p>

<p>Footage from a municipal security camera shows one of the containers flying meters into the air after the explosion, which caused a fire that was brought under control hours later.</p>

<p>The incident occurred at around 4:30 pm (2230 GMT) at the distillery, known as La Rojena.</p>

<p>Fifty firefighters attended the scene, in addition to the firm's internal civil protection team, the authorities said.</p>

<p>Those living near the factory were evacuated temporarily, returning to their homes after a few hours, while the electricity supply was briefly cut as a safety measure.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Australian woman was allegedly gang-raped by five men in Paris just days before the city is set to host the opening ceremonies of the 2024 Olympic Games. According to France's Le Parisien newspaper, the "disoriented" 25-year-old woman entered a local restaurant on the famed Boulevard de Clichy in Paris' Pigalle neighbourhood on Saturday, wearing her dress backwards. Authorities in Paris confirmed that a "gang-rape" likely took place between Friday and Saturday, and an investigation is currently underway.</p>

<p>Local media reported that the woman took refuge in a kebab shop in the Pigalle district with her dress partially torn off. Restaurant owners called for help upon seeing her state, and she was attended to by firefighters before being taken to Bichat Hospital for a medical examination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The timing of this incident is particularly troubling as security officials are already grappling with a multitude of potential threats, including terrorist attacks, cyberattacks, crowd crushes, and the impact of potential labour strikes during the Olympics.</p>

<p>Strath Gordon, Chief of Public Affairs and Communication for Australia's Olympic team, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/23/paris-attack-olympics-australia/">stated </a>that Australian athletes in Paris had been informed of the alleged attack. "They are advised not to wear team kit when in public places," Mr Gordon said in an email on Tuesday. He emphasized that the athletes had not received any threats since their arrival in France and were "getting on with their preparations for the Games."</p>

<p>The Australian consulate and French police are providing support to the victim. Anna Meares, the Australian chef de mission, expressed her shock and concern over the incident. "I have been informed, it sounds horrific. Obviously, our hearts go out to the woman involved, and we hope she's being cared for and supported in the trauma she's experienced," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/23/olympic-officials-briefed-after-australian-woman-allegedly-raped-by-five-men-in-paris">Ms Meares said on Tuesday morning.</a></p>

<p>Ms Meares reiterated that team members had been thoroughly briefed on security and safety precautions. "What information we're passing on to our athletes is that security presence is really, really high and that's in order for them to act as quickly as possible to keep them safe," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/24/significant-assault-two-staff-from-nines-olympic-broadcast-team-attacked-in-paris-in-suspected-robbery">she said</a>. "We don't yet have any feedback from our athletes that they have felt unsafe. We are encouraging them, if they go out of the village, not to go out on their own, not to wear team uniform, just to wear plain clothes."</p>

<p>The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is working to confirm the details of the incident. "The Australian embassy in Paris is making urgent inquiries with French authorities following reports of an Australian citizen assaulted in Paris," a spokesperson stated.</p>

<p>In June, the alleged rape of a 12-year-old Jewish girl in a suburb of Paris triggered protests and sparked condemnations from politicians, who linked the crime to rampant antisemitism in France.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

The video captures the final few seconds of the crash.</p>

<p>The clip begins shortly after take-off, with the plane already out-of-control and just a few hundred feet off the ground.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The plane crash in Nepal that left 18 people dead has yet again put the spotlight on table-top runways that have been the site of major plane accidents across the world.</p>

<p>Table-top runways are located on an elevated level than the surrounding terrain. This means there is a steep drop on one or more sides of the runway and this leaves a very slim margin of error for the pilot because if the plane overshoots the runway, it will crash down.</p>

<p>Five airports in India have table-top runways -- Shimla, Calicut, Mangalore, Lengpui (Mizoram) and Pakyong (Sikkim). Of these, the airports in Kerala and Mangalore have seen big crashes in the past.&nbsp;On May 22, 2010, Air India Express Flight 812 from Dubai to Mangaluru crashed on landing at and 158 passengers, including six crew members, were killed.</p>

<p>Ten years later, on August 7, 2020, another table-top runway became the site of a tragedy. The Air India Express flight from Dubai to Kozhikode was part of the Vande Bharat mission to bring back Indian nationals stranded due to Covid pandemic. The plane skidded off the table-top runway and crashed below. Nineteen passengers and both pilots died, but 169 others survived.</p>

<p>Civil Aviation regulator, Directorate General of Civil Aviation, holds periodical reviews of table-top airports to ensure passenger safety. Back in 2022, an official of the DGCA had told the media that the objective behind the review was to prevent any unforeseen incidents and look for ways to make landings in these airports less challenging.</p>

<p>Portugal's Madeira airport, which has a table-top runway, reported a crash back in 1977 when an Air Portugal Flight 425 overshot and crashed onto a beach, killing 131 people.</p>

<p>Even Nepal, which has a poor air travel safety record, has reported crashes involving table-top runways in the past. On May 27, 2017, a cargo plane at crashed at the Tenzing-Hillary airport in Solukhumbu, which has such a runway.</p>

<p>In the crash that took place this morning, the Bombardier CRJ 200 flight skidded off the runway and burst into flames, a spokesperson of the airport has told NDTV. Tribhuvan airport in Kathmandu, where the crash took place, is on the top of a plateau and is surrounded by deep gorges and valleys on all sides. Kathmandu airport is among the most risky airports to land and was the site of a huge crash back in 1992, when 167 passengers of a Pakistan International Airlines plane had died. The Saurya Airlines flight that crashed today had crew and technical staff on board and was on its way to Pokhara.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The release comes as tech companies are racing to show that their growing portfolios of resource-hungry large language models can deliver significant enough gains in known problem areas like advanced reasoning to justify fundings.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta Platforms released the biggest version of its mostly free Llama 3 artificial intelligence models on Tuesday, boasting multilingual skills and general performance metrics that nip at the heels of paid models from rivals like OpenAI.</p>

<p>The new Llama 3 model can converse in eight languages, write higher-quality computer code and solve more complex math problems than previous versions, the Facebook parent company said in blog posts and a research paper announcing the release.</p>

<p>With 405 billion parameters, or variables that the algorithm takes into account to generate responses to user queries, it dwarfs the previous version released last year though is still smaller than leading models offered by competitors.</p>

<p>OpenAI's GPT-4 model, by contrast, is reported to have one trillion parameters and Amazon is preparing a model with 2 trillion parameters.</p>

<p>Promoting Llama 3 across multiple channels, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said he expected future Llama models would overtake proprietary competitors by next year. The Meta AI chatbot powered by those models was on track to become the most popular AI assistant by the end of this year, with hundreds of millions of people using it already, he said.</p>

<p>The release comes as tech companies are racing to show that their growing portfolios of resource-hungry large language models can deliver significant enough gains in known problem areas like advanced reasoning to justify the gargantuan sums that have been invested in them.</p>

<p>Meta's own top AI scientist has said he believes such models will hit up against limits on reasoning and that other types of AI systems will be needed to produce breakthroughs.</p>

<p>In addition to its flagship 405 billion parameter model, Meta is also releasing updated versions of its lighter-weight 8 billion and 70 billion parameter Llama 3 models initially introduced in the spring, the company said.</p>

<p>All three new models are multilingual and can handle larger user requests via an expanded "context window," which Meta's head of generative AI, Ahmad Al-Dahle, said would improve the experience of generating computer code in particular.</p>

<p>"That was the number one feedback we got from the community," Al-Dahle told Reuters in an interview, noting that bigger context windows give the models something akin to a longer memory that aids in processing multi-step requests.</p>

<p>Separately, Al-Dahle said his team had been able to improve the Llama 3 model's performance on tasks such as solving math problems by using AI to generate some of the data on which they were trained.</p>

<p>Meta releases its Llama models largely free-of-charge for use by developers, a strategy Zuckerberg says will pay off in the form of innovative products, less dependence on would-be competitors and greater engagement on the company's core social networks. Some investors have raised their eyebrows at the costs entailed, however.</p>

<p>The company also stands to benefit if developers opt to use its free models over paid ones, which would undercut the business models of its rivals. With its announcement, Meta touted gains on key math and knowledge tests that may make that prospect more appealing.</p>

<p>Although measuring progress on AI development is notoriously difficult, test results provided by Meta appeared to suggest that its largest Llama 3 model was nearly matching and, in some cases, besting Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet and OpenAI's GPT-4o, which are widely regarded as the two most powerful frontier models on the market.</p>

<p>On the MATH benchmark of competition level math word problems, for example, Meta's model posted a score of 73.8, compared to GPT-4o's 76.6 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet's 71.1.</p>

<p>The model scored 88.6 on MMLU, a benchmark that covers dozens of subjects across math, science and the humanities, while GPT-4o scored 88.7 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet scored 88.3.</p>

<p>In their paper, Meta researchers also teased upcoming "multimodal" versions of the models due out later this year that layer image, video and speech capabilities on top of the core Llama 3 text model.</p>

<p>Early experiments indicate those models can perform "competitively" with other multimodal models such as Google's Gemini 1.5 and Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet, they said.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

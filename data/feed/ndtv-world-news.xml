       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's Punjab government in a bid to combat the hazardous smog conditions in the province, shut down amusement parks and museums for 10 days, from November 8 to 17, ARY News reported.</p>

<p>As per the ban imposed on Friday, the districts affected by this ban include Lahore, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Multan, Sheikhupura, Kasur, Nankana Sahib, Gujarat, Hafizabad, Mandi Bahauddin, Sialkot, Narowal, Chiniot, Jhang, and Toba Tek Singh, ARY News reported. Lodhran, Vehari, and Khanewal districts are also under smog-related restrictions.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Pakistan's air pollution reached an alarming level, with seven cities topping the list of the world's most polluted cities, as per ARY News. Pakistan's meteorologists predicted worsening smog conditions due to low wind speeds of 11km/h around Lahore and 7km/h near Multan.</p>

<p>Multan's air quality had an AQI score of 2,135, and that of Lahore was 676. Peshawar, Islamabad, Hariput, Rawalpindi and Karachi fell under the 'hazardous air quality' category, ARY News reported.</p>

<p>Earlier on Thursday, Lahore ranked number one on the most polluted city rankings, released by IQAir at a staggering 784.</p>

<p>Lahore's atmosphere has remained dangerous for its residents for weeks following its position as one of the cities with the world's highest AQI. The pollution levels have time and again touched 1,000 for the city.</p>

<p>As per Geo News, the prolonged exposure has increased hospital admissions for respiratory issues, with Lahore and other cities like Multan, Kasur, Sheikhupura, and Gujranwala severely affected.</p>

<p>The persistent dangerous atmosphere has made it difficult for citizens to breathe, leaving them vulnerable to respiratory diseases, as they struggle to continue with their daily activities.</p>

<p>Doctors have advised the residents of Lahore to wear masks when stepping outside their homes.</p>

<p>Geo News reported that private and government educational institutions, teaching up to the higher secondary level, in the city as well as other districts of Pakistan's Punjab have also been closed by the government till November 17, as per notification.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Punjab education department has ordered to keep tuition centres and academies closed.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Florida Governor Ron DeSantis took to X (formerly Twitter) and announced an investigation into the matter.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The disaster relief workers in the US state of Florida were directed to "avoid homes" with signs supporting President-elect Donald Trump when Hurricane Milton ravaged the area, according to a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/08/us-news/fema-workers-told-to-avoid-homes-with-trump-signs-in-hurricane-ravaged-florida-community/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>NY Post</em></a>, citing the Daily Wire. Marn'i Washington, a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) supervisor passed the order to her workers both verbally and in a Microsoft Teams chat used by the group, which was working to secure homes and rescue people around Lake Placid - one of the worst-affected areas.</p>

<p>"Avoid homes advertising Trump," Washington wrote in a "best practices" memo sent to employees. As many as 20 homes displaying signs for the Republican leader - a common sight during the election season, were ignored between the end of October and into November, as part of the directive by Washington.</p>

<p>"I thought we could go help and make a difference. When we got there we were told to discriminate against people. It's almost unbelievable to think that somebody in the federal government would think that's okay," one of the workers was quoted as saying by the outlet.</p>

<p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis took to X (formerly Twitter) and announced an investigation into the matter, calling it a "blatant weaponization of government by partisan activists".</p>

<p>"At my direction, the Division of Emergency Management is launching an investigation into the federal government's targeted discrimination of Floridians who support Donald Trump," wrote DeSantis.</p>

<p>"New leadership is on the way in DC, and I'm optimistic that these partisan bureaucrats will be fired," he added.</p>

<p></p>

<p>A FEMA official conceded that they were aware of the incident and "taking action at this moment regarding the situation". Meanwhile, Washington had not been punished for the guidance but shifted to a different Florida county, according to the last update.</p>

<p>Notably, Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance had criticised the current Biden-Harris administration for their slow response to the disaster as the region was pummeled by several two hurricanes in a relatively short period.</p>

<h3><strong>Hurricane Milton's impact</strong></h3>

<p>At least 16 people lost their lives when Hurricane Milton dumped around 229 mm of rainfall in just three hours in Florida, causing flash flooding. Powerful tornadoes that preceded the hurricane's landfall further added to the destruction. At one point, over three million people were without electricity as the hurricane tore through the region.</p>

<p>A study last year stated that storms originating in the Atlantic Ocean were now more than twice as likely to strengthen from Category 1 to Category 3 in just 36 hours, based on data from 2001-2020 compared with 1971-1990.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As the diplomatic standoff between India and Canada continues, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has admitted for the first time the presence of Khalistanis in his country.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the diplomatic standoff between <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/india-canada" target="_blank">India and Canada</a> continues, Canadian Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/justin-trudeau" target="_blank">Justin Trudeau</a> has admitted for the first time the presence of Khalistanis in his country. In an unexpected statement, Trudeau acknowledged the presence of a Khalistan support base within Canada but quickly added that they do not represent the Sikh community as a whole. His remark came during a Diwali celebrations event at Ottawa's Parliament Hill.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Relations between India and Canada have deteriorated since the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Khalistani terrorist, outside a gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, in June 2023. Trudeau's allegation that India may have been involved in the murder set off a diplomatic firestorm that continues to rage. During his Diwali address, Trudeau stated that while there are supporters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government in Canada, they do not represent all Hindu Canadians either.</p>

<p>"There are many supporters of Khalistan in Canada, but they do not represent the Sikh Community as a whole. There are supporters of the Modi government in Canada, but they do not represent all Hindu Canadians as a whole," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Growing Tensions</strong></h3>

<p>Earlier this week, protesters, some waving Khalistani flags, clashed with devotees at a temple in Canada's Brampton, throwing punches, swinging poles, and disrupting a consular event that had drawn Indian nationals and Canadian citizens alike. Videos that quickly went viral on social media appeared to show protesters physically confronting worshippers outside the temple grounds. The footage depicted chaotic scenes of fistfights, with people hitting each other with poles as the tension escalated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned the violence, stressing that every Canadian has the right to practice their faith in peace. "The acts of violence at the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton today are unacceptable. Every Canadian has the right to practice their faith freely and safely," Trudeau wrote on X (formerly Twitter). "Thank you to the Peel Regional Police for swiftly responding to protect the community and investigate this incident."</p>

<p>The Centre expressed deep concern over the safety of Indian nationals in Canada, while unequivocally condemning the attack on the Hindu Sabha temple.</p>

<p>"We have seen violent disruption today (November 3), orchestrated by anti-India elements outside the consular camp co-organised with the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton, near Toronto," said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal in a statement. "We also remain very concerned for the safety of applicants, including Indian nationals, on whose demand such events are organised in the first place. Despite these efforts by anti-India elements, our Consulate was able to issue more than 1,000 life certificates to the Indian and Canadian applicants."</p>

<h3><strong>No Evidence, Only Intelligence</strong></h3>

<p>India has consistently rejected any link to the murder of Nijjar, a designated terrorist by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), and accused Trudeau's administration of pandering to Khalistani sympathisers for political gain. The Trudeau government has accused India of being complicit in Nijjar's killing, a claim India has vehemently denied.</p>

<p>India has termed the allegations as politically motivated, pointing to Canada's failure to address the rising tide of pro-Khalistan sentiment in the country. In the aftermath of Nijjar's death, Canadian police suggested that six Indian diplomats were involved in the plot, a claim that India quickly dismissed as "preposterous." Despite multiple exchanges, including meetings at international forums like the G20 Summit, Canada has failed to provide any conclusive evidence linking India to the murder.</p>

<p>Last month, the Centre issued a blistering response to Canada's charges, rejecting claims that India's High Commissioner to Canada, Sanjay Kumar Verma, was a "person of interest" in Nijjar's murder. India not only dismissed the claims about Verma but also pointed out that despite repeated requests for evidence, Canada had failed to share any substantive proof to substantiate its allegations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a startling admission during a public inquiry in October, Trudeau admitted that Canada had no "hard evidentiary proof" in 2023 to support allegations linking Indian government agents to the killing of Nijjar. &nbsp;Speaking during a public inquiry into alleged foreign interference in Canada's federal electoral processes and democratic institutions, Trudeau revealed that his claims about India's involvement were based on intelligence rather than conclusive evidence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I was briefed on the fact that there was intelligence from Canada, and possibly from Five Eyes allies that made it fairly clear, incredibly clear, that India was involved in this... Agents of the government of India were involved in the killing of a Canadian on Canadian soil," he said.</p>

<p>Trudeau explained that Canada had the option to go public with the allegations during the G20 summit held in New Delhi in September 2023 but chose not to.</p>

<p>"Our response was, well, it's within your security agencies," Mr Trudeau said, recounting Canada's exchanges with India. "At that point, it was primarily intelligence, not hard evidentiary proof. So we said, let's work together and look into your security services."</p>

<p>The Indian government has argued that Canada provides a safe haven for pro-Khalistani extremists and separatists who pose a threat to India's security. New Delhi also said that it had requested action against these elements, which Canada had failed to take seriously.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden on Friday (local time) condemned the recent attacks on Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam Friday, calling the incident "despicable and echo dark moments in history when Jews were persecuted."</p>

<p>Biden said he has been in touch with Israeli and Dutch officials and that he appreciates "Dutch authorities' commitment to holding the perpetrators accountable."</p>

<p>In a post on X, Biden said, "The Antisemitic attacks on Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam are despicable and echo dark moments in history when Jews were persecuted. We've been in touch with Israeli and Dutch officials and appreciate Dutch authorities' commitment to holding the perpetrators accountable.

<p>His statement comes a day after Israeli soccer fans were assaulted by young people in hit-and-run scooter attacks. Dutch authorities said the incident was likely a result of calls on social media to attack Jewish people.</p>

<p>The state of Israel in a post on X condemned the attacks and recalled the attack on Jews during the Nazi rule in Germany.</p>

<p>"Hundreds of fans of Israel's Maccabi Tel Aviv Football Club were ambushed and brutally attacked in Amsterdam last night after the match against AFC Ajax. Mobs chanted anti-Israel slogans and proudly shared videos of their violent acts on social media--kicking, beating, even running over Israeli citizens. On the eve of Kristallnacht--when Jews in Nazi Germany faced brutal attacks--it is horrifying to witness antisemitic violence on the streets of Europe once again. Israeli PM Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar announced Israel is sending an aid mission, including two rescue planes."</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Over the last 30 years, the magnetic field strength in the region has dropped to a level that is barely above the global average.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese scientists have claimed that the magnetic shield over North America is weakening rapidly while strengthening in the eastern hemisphere. Led by Professor Fang Hanxian of the National University of Defence Technology, the study, published in&nbsp;<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.sjdz.org.cn/en/article/doi/10.19975/j.dqyxx.2024-012" rel="nofollow, noindex">Review of Geophysics and Planetary Physics</a></em>, claims the shift of the geomagnetic poles from the western to the eastern hemisphere might be the possible reason for the "exceptionally fast" loss of the field strength. Fang's team used the latest models and data to reconstruct the global magnetic field strength change since 1900.</p>

<p>The findings showed that between 1930 to 1990, the field strength in North America increased and was higher than in many other regions of the world. However, over the last three decades, especially by 2020, the magnetic field strength in the region had dropped to a level that is barely above the global average.</p>

<p>"After 2000, the speed exceeded 50km per year, far surpassing the movement speed of the magnetic pole in the southern hemisphere," Fang was quoted as saying by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3285683/magnetic-shield-over-north-america-losing-strength-exceptionally-fast-pla-scientists" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>SCMP</em></a>.</p>

<p>"Apart from the weakening magnetic field in North America, the strength in other major regions is showing an increasing trend," Fang said, adding that Australia, the North Atlantic Ocean and Africa were experiencing the fastest growth.</p>

<p>Over the past century, the magnetic pole in the northern hemisphere had drifted eastward at a speed of about 10 km per year, the study highlighted.</p>

<h3><strong>The geomagnetic shield</strong></h3>

<p>Earth's geomagnetic field, also called the magnetosphere, is a kind of natural barrier that protects the planet from harmful cosmic radiation which can cause erosion of our atmosphere by solar wing. Unlike planets in our immediate vicinity such as Mercury, Venus and Mars, Earth is surrounded by powerful, dynamic forces that play the role of gatekeeper, repelling unwanted energy and trapping most of it at a safe distance from the planet in a twin doughnut-shaped zones called the Van Allen Belts.</p>

<p>In 2018, a study by the National Autonomous University of Mexico found that low geomagnetic fields prevailed in the Maya area, just before the Mayan civilisation collapsed. Some other studies have also attributed the downfall of ancient civilisations in Iran and Syria to the sudden changes in the magnetic field.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The latest round of UN climate talks begin next week during what is expected to be the hottest year in recorded history -- and in the shadow of climate sceptic Donald Trump's re-election as US president.</p>

<p>The COP29 negotiations will be held in Azerbaijan as the world continues to emit increasing levels of planet-heating fossil fuels, even as many nations have been lashed by devastating floods, droughts, heatwaves and storms.</p>

<p>"Climate change is making us sick, and urgent action is a matter of life and death," the World Health Organization warned this week.</p>

<p>Here are some of the ways that global warming affects health.</p>

<p><strong>Extreme Heat</strong></p>

<p>The EU's climate monitor said this week that 2024 is "virtually certain" to surpass last year to become the hottest year in recorded history. It is also expected to be the first year that is more than 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Out of 15 ways that climate change impacts health being tracked by experts as part of The Lancet Countdown, 10 have now "reached concerning new records", according to the group's latest report.</p>

<p>The number of over-65s who died from heat has risen by 167 percent since the 1990s, just one of the recent all-time highs, the report said.</p>

<p>Extreme heat leads to numerous health risks such as kidney disorders, strokes, adverse pregnancy outcomes, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, organ failure and ultimately death.</p>

<p>Jeni Miller, executive director of the Global Climate and Health Alliance, said "this year has underlined the growing impacts of a warming climate on people's health and wellbeing".</p>

<p>She pointed to extreme heat leading to 700 deaths and more than 40,000 cases of heat stroke in India, "climate-exacerbated" rains causing a dam to collapse in Nigeria killing 320, and 48 out of 50 US states "experiencing moderate or worse drought".</p>

<p>Spain is meanwhile still recovering from its deadliest floods in a generation, while parts of the United States and Cuba are picking up the pieces after recent hurricanes.</p>

<p>Droughts, floods and other extreme weather events are also expected to hit global crops, leading to rising hunger in many regions.</p>

<p><strong>Air Pollution</strong></p>

<p>Almost all -- 99 percent -- of the world's population breathes air that exceeds the World Health Organization's guidelines for air pollution.</p>

<p>This pollution has been found to increase the risk of respiratory diseases, strokes, heart disease, lung cancer, diabetes and other health problems, posing a threat that has been compared to tobacco.</p>

<p>Almost seven million premature deaths a year are linked to air pollution, according to the WHO.</p>

<p>Just last week, Pakistan's second-biggest city Lahore recorded air pollution at 40 times the level deemed acceptable by the WHO.</p>

<p>In better news, the Lancet Countdown report found that deaths from fossil fuel-related air pollution fell by nearly seven percent from 2016 to 2021, mainly due to efforts to reduce pollution from burning coal.</p>

<p><strong>Infectious Diseases</strong></p>

<p>The changing climate means that mosquitoes, birds and mammals will roam beyond their previous habitats, raising the threat that they could spread infectious diseases with them.</p>

<p>Dengue, chikungunya, Zika, West Nile virus and malaria are all mosquito-borne diseases that could spread wider in a warming world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The transmission risk of one dengue-spreading mosquito has risen by 43 percent over the last 60 years, according to the Lancet Countdown. A new global record of over five million dengue cases was recorded last year.</p>

<p>Storms and floods create stagnant water that are breeding grounds for mosquitoes, and also increase the risk of water-borne diseases such as cholera, typhoid and diarrhoea.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Myanmar's war-ravaged Rakhine state could face imminent famine according to a United Nations report, which estimates that more than two million people could be at the risk of starvation.</p>

<p>Rice production in Rakhine, a western state that borders Bangladesh, has declined due to shortages of seeds and fertilizers, severe weather and the displacement of people who can no longer farm, according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).</p>

<p>Aid agencies, including the Red Cross, have faced severe difficulties in assessing humanitarian needs and delivering aid due to restrictions from Myanmar's military government.</p>

<p>"Rakhine stands on the precipice of an unprecedented disaster," the UNDP said in a report late on Thursday.</p>

<p>"Combined with the near-total halt of trade, over two million people are at risk of starvation."</p>

<p>The number of internally displaced people in Rakhine has risen by more than 60% from October 2023 to August this year, with more than 500,000 now relying entirely on aid, the UNDP said.</p>

<p>Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military ousted the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021, sparking mass protests that escalated into an armed rebellion on multiple fronts.</p>

<p>With more than three million people displaced and much of the country in chaos, humanitarian aid has become critical in Myanmar.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the junta did not answer calls seeking comment on the report.</p>

<p>Violence has been on the increase since conflict reignited in Rakhine last November following the collapse of a ceasefire between the Arakan Army (AA) and the military. Rebel forces have since made substantial gains.</p>

<p>Though the military has for years been accused of persecuting the Muslim minority Rohingya community in Rakhine, the Arakan Army has also been accused of targeting them, which it has denied. An AA spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>The fighting has triggered a new wave of Rohingya refugees fleeing into Bangladesh, where more than a million Rohingya live in huge refugee camps.</p>

<p>"Without urgent action, 95% of the population will regress into survival mode," the UNDP report said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Federal and state authorities are investigating a wave of bigoted text messages sent anonymously that have spread alarm among Black Americans across the country this week, officials and recipients told Reuters.</p>

<p>The messages urged recipients in multiple states, including Alabama, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Virginia, to report to a plantation to pick cotton, an offensive reference to past enslavement of Black people in the United States.</p>

<p>It is unclear who is behind the reported texts, how many people had received them, or how the recipients were targeted.</p>

<p>The Federal Communications Commission said on Friday its enforcement bureau was among those probing the incidents.</p>

<p>Lousiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, a Republican, told Reuters on Friday that her office is among those investigating the text messages, adding that some targets - herself included - also received emails.</p>

<p>Murrill, who is white, said one of the messages hit her personal email box at 8:17 a.m. Friday, according to a screenshot of the message she shared with Reuters.</p>

<p>The message greeted her with an ethnic slur and said "Now that trump is president, you have been selected to pick cotton at the nearest plantation" and that "Our guys will come get you in a van."</p>

<p>She said the FBI was also looking into the messages.</p>

<p>The FBI on Thursday said in a statement it was "aware of the offensive and racist text messages sent to individuals around the country," and that it was in contact with the Justice Department and other federal authorities on the matter.</p>

<p>"It could be coming from a basement in Baton Rouge, or it could be a basement in Bangladesh," said Murrill. "It's obviously intended to play on people's emotion in the wake of the election. I'm urging people to rise above it, don't give these malcontents the benefit of capturing any of emotional bandwidth."</p>

<p>Monèt Miller, an Atlanta-based publicist, said that when she shared on social media that she had received a text message telling her to report to her "nearest plantation," she was shocked at how many other Black Americans chimed in to say they had gotten similar messages.</p>

<p>"To find out that all these African American people are getting it, that was the scariest part about it," she said. "Who is doing that?"</p>

<p>People in at least 21 states received the texts, including high school and college students, CNN and the Associated Press reported.</p>

<p>"These actions are not normal. And we refuse to let them be normalized," NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a statement from the civil rights organization, which advocates for racial justice and rights for Black Americans.</p>

<p>"These messages represent an alarming increase in vile and abhorrent rhetoric from racist groups across the country."</p>

<p>Some Black Americans have said they fear a rollback of civil rights after Republican Donald Trump, who won Tuesday's presidential election over Democrat Kamala Harris, takes office on Jan. 20. Trump, who made racist and sexist attacks against his Black opponent, has pledged to end federal diversity and inclusion programs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"President Trump's campaign has absolutely nothing to do with these text messages," his spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement on Friday.</p>

<p>At least some of the messages were distributed via the TextNow messaging service, which enables people to send texts via app, TextNow said. It said once they were made aware of the situation the account or accounts responsible were shut down within an hour, adding that the texts were sent across multiple carriers nationwide in what it called "an attack."</p>

<p>Some school districts issued warnings and urged students and parents to report any such texts to school staff or local authorities.</p>

<p>The run-up to Tuesday's election included the biggest rise in U.S. political violence since the 1970s, including some racist attacks on Harris supporters, according to cases identified by Reuters.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk-owned SpaceX is working on a Starlink equivalent for Mars that will allow relatively quick communication to and fro from the Red Planet to Earth. The project was mentioned during Thursday's (Nov 7) meeting for the Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG), dedicated to supporting NASA missions to the Martian surface, according to the minutes of the meeting. Under the proposed pitch to NASA, SpaceX will place multiple satellites in Mars orbit to provide "full visibility and interoperability for the ground and orbital assets".</p>

<p>Starlink will leverage its advanced laser communication tech to maintain a constant data flow between planets. The high-speed data relay system will be capable of transmitting 4 MBPS or more, across 1.5 astronomical units which is the distance between Earth and Mars. This network could serve Mars missions, allowing real-time images and data streams from Mars to Earth, as well as supporting future ground operations and Mars orbit assets.</p>

<p>Musk took to X (formerly Twitter) to confirm the development, adding that the ultimate goal was to increase the speed of data transfer across such vast distances.</p>

<p>"This is just a very basic first step. Earth and Mars will ultimately need &gt;petabit/sec connectivity," Musk said on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

<h3><strong>'Sci-fi concept'</strong></h3>

<p>Netizens, in awe of the sci-fi concept, applauded the move, while some cast doubts over the speed of the transfer which might be plagued by latency issues.</p>

<p>"Preparing internet access on Mars now before most people can even grasp the concept of traveling there is amazing. This is confidence in the future. I love this determination," said one user, while another added: "I have to admit this is pretty remarkable stuff."</p>

<p>A third added: "The latency of a ping though...that would still lead to one heck of a lag. Even if you put the game servers in the middle, on the best day, you're not going to do Diablo players from Mars and Earth in the same game."</p>

<p>Starlink has been a revolutionary piece of tech which allows users to access high-speed internet from any corner of the planet. Using thousands of satellites in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO), the internet data is beamed through radio signals.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Iranian man has been charged over an alleged plot by Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) to kill Donald Trump - the United States president-elect who has already survived two attempts on his life. The Republican leader, set to return to the White House this January, was shot in his ear during an assassination attempt in July.</p>

<p>The Justice Department termed Farhad Shakeri as an "Iranian asset" who was tasked by the Iranian regime on October 7 to plot Trump's assassination. Shakeri, 51, allegedly told law enforcement that he did not intend to propose a plan to kill Trump within the timeframe set by the IRGC, according to an official statement.</p>

<p>"The Justice Department has charged an asset of the Iranian regime who was tasked by the regime to direct a network of criminal associates to further Iran's assassination plots against its targets, including President-elect Donald Trump," said Attorney General Merrick B Garland.</p>

<p>The US has designated the IRGC as a terrorist organization.</p>

<p>FBI director Christopher Wray said the charges reveal that Iran continues to target US citizens, which includes Trump and other leaders and government officials who criticize the Iran regime. "The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has been conspiring with criminals and hitmen to target and gun down Americans on US soil and that simply won't be tolerated," he said.</p>

<p>The statement said Shakeri had immigrated to the US as a child and was deported around 2008 after he was convicted in a robbery case. The prosecutors believe Shakeri is now in Iran.</p>

<p>Shakeri has also been charged with hiring two men in New York, whom he had met in prison, to kill a US citizen of Iranian origin who had publicly opposed the Iranian government. The two New York residents - Carlisle Rivera and Jonathan Loadholt - have also been charged for their alleged involvement in the murder plot.</p>

<p><strong>Threats And Robotic Dogs</strong></p>

<p>Having survived two attempts on his life and now on the path to the most powerful office, protecting the president-elect has become the top priority for the US Secret Service. Robotic dogs are being used to patrol Trump's Mar-a-Lago house in Florida.</p>

<p>A bullet had pierced Trump's ear during an earlier attempt on his life at a rally in Pennsylvania in July. A second attempt was reported three months later at the Florida golf club when shots were fired in the former president's vicinity. Trump was not injured this time.</p>

<p>After the election results on November 6 made it clear he would return for a second term, Trump said in his victory speech that he was told God had spared his life for a reason. "And that reason was to save our country and to restore America to greatness," he had said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The research suggests that human childbirth may not be complicated due to our need for large brains and pelvises suitable for upright walking.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Human childbirth may not be complicated due to our need for large brains and pelvises suitable for upright walking, referred to as the "obstetrical dilemma", according to research published in the journal <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-024-02558-7.epdf?sharing_token=4HWcowvWDA-ssDyg8rm_Y9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0P6-cvuDc-KX935fVFPMFOrzr_RwBx9qmKuERWaITL5UArCts6_7hCx6vgXxLefEJfrGGL-YgnR74cVYPOmemXz1HxUeBKRhyyWisqVI7DhUMfiI9vrlGuBlWTdK07P4OnML7sKbl3tgU6JGFrmND61WnyFJhbdlmbtwFWXxQjV8svX3JHtRYJ2LvQU92n9we8%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=www.livescience.com" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</em>.</a> The human birth canal is framed by the bones of the pelvis which is barely larger than the baby's head. During labour, the joint between pubic bones softens a little, allowing the baby's head to make its way out into the world. But despite the slight evolutionary tweaks, the childbirth is a difficult process - much more difficult than in most other animal.</p>

<p>The study analysed chimpanzee pelvic bones and found that females had human-like pelvic characteristics despite having easier births due to small brains, which surprised the scientists. Using three-dimensional simulations, the researchers also found that apes had "similarly constricted midpelvis as in humans, with even narrower outlet dimensions".</p>

<p>Based on the findings, the study posited that substantial obstetric constraints "did not arise abruptly in humans but evolved gradually through a series of obstetric compromises from an already constricted birth canal shared across anthropoid primates" over millions of years.</p>

<p>"It is not primarily an adaptation to giving birth to large-brained infants because we show in this study that these changes happen prior to significant brain expansion," study lead author Nicole Webb, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Zurich was quoted as saying by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.livescience.com/animals/humans-big-brains-may-not-be-the-reason-for-difficult-childbirth-chimp-study-suggests" rel="Nofollow, noindex"><em>Live Science</em></a>.</p>

<p>"Our ancestors the australopithecines likely were already susceptible to the birth complications that we encounter today. and they may have even required some sort of birth assistance like us," Webb added.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/human-evolution-unfolding-before-us-in-the-high-altitudes-of-tibetan-plateau-6847024" rel="nofollow, noindex"><strong>Also read | Human Evolution Unfolding Before Us In The High Altitudes Of Tibetan Plateau</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>What do the study findings suggest?</strong></h3>

<p>Apes have small fetal heads which aids in the uncomplicated birth. In contrast, in modern humans, the fetal head is 10 per cent longer than the anteroposterior inlet diameter, whose length is reduced compared to that of apes. Webb stated that akin to humans, chimpanzees may be "subtly trending towards this pattern" as well where human babies are born helpless but their brains continue to grow afterwards.</p>

<p>If the research stands true, the scientists may have found an explanation as to why some of our ancestors seemingly had a challenging time giving birth despite having small brains. They may have faced the same birthing challenges as that common ancestor shared with chimpanzees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In its final months, President Joe Biden's administration has decided to allow US defense contractors to work in Ukraine to maintain and repair Pentagon-provided weaponry, US officials told Reuters on Friday, in a significant policy shift that aims to aid Kyiv's fight against Russia.</p>

<p>A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the contractors would be small in number and located far from the front lines. They will not be engaged in combat.</p>

<p>They will help ensure US-provided equipment "can be rapidly repaired when damaged and be provided maintenance as needed," the official said.</p>

<p>Since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the United States has given Kyiv tens of billions of dollars in weaponry. But Kyiv either had to move US-provided weaponry out of the country for heavy repair or rely on video-conferencing and other creative solutions to fix those systems inside the country.</p>

<p>The restrictions in the past have sometimes slowed down repairs and proven increasingly difficult as the US has provided Kyiv with more complicated systems, like F-16 fighter jets and Patriot air defenses, officials say.</p>

<p>A lot of equipment in the country is not being used because it is damaged, a second US official told Reuters.</p>

<p>The move is the latest easing of restrictions by Biden's administration, which has sought to help Ukraine defend itself against Moscow's 2 1/2 year-old invasion without becoming directly engaged against nuclear-armed Russia.</p>

<p>A third US official said the decision would move the Pentagon in line with the US State Department and US Agency for International Development, which already have US contractors in Ukraine.</p>

<p>The official added that no US troops would be required to defend contractors in Ukraine, and that issues like safety and risk mitigation would be the responsibility of those companies entering into contracts with the Pentagon.</p>

<p>Some US defense contractors have already gone to Ukraine in small numbers in the past, servicing weapons that weren't being provided by the Pentagon, the official said.</p>

<p>Given there are already are a "wide array of American companies" who have personnel in Ukraine fulfilling contracts for the Ukrainian government, there would not be a substantial increase in US company employees working on the ground, the first official said.</p>

<p>The decision comes at a critical time for the conflict. Russian forces are advancing at their fastest rate since Ukraine first repulsed their invasion at the outskirts of Kyiv in early 2022. Ukraine, for its part, has launched its first major incursion into Russian territory.</p>

<p>Still, it's unclear how sustainable the policy shift will be with so little time left in Biden's administration. President-elect Donald Trump has criticized the scale of US military and financial support for Kyiv and vowed to end the war with Russia quickly, without saying how. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.</p>

<p>As the biggest contributor by far to Kyiv's war effort, US support has been essential to Ukraine's survival against a much larger and better equipped Russian enemy.</p>

<p>Moscow's forces occupy around a fifth of Ukraine, and it is increasing pressure on Kyiv, which is facing problems fielding a strong enough fighting force to stand up to Russia's steady onslaught - bolstered recently by the addition of North Korean troops.</p>

<p>Ukraine has called on the West to lift restrictions on using missiles to attack deep into Russia, which Kyiv says is necessary to disrupt long-range Russian attacks.</p>

<p>But Biden's administration has not announced any changes to that policy, which officials say might not be sufficient to change the tide in the war, and which Moscow says would escalate the conflict.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Sean "Diddy" Combs on Friday proposed a new $50 million bail package backed by his Florida mansion that the music mogul hopes will win his release from the Brooklyn jail where he has been held for eight weeks on criminal sex trafficking charges.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sean "Diddy" Combs on Friday proposed a new $50 million bail package backed by his Florida mansion that the music mogul hopes will win his release from the Brooklyn jail where he has been held for eight weeks on criminal sex trafficking charges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Combs has been denied bail three times since his arrest, with multiple judges citing a risk that he might tamper with witnesses. The rapper and producer on Sept. 17 pleaded not guilty to charges that he used his business empire including his record label Bad Boy Entertainment to transport women and male sex workers across state lines, to take part in recorded sexual performances called "Freak Offs."&nbsp;</p>

<p>In another development on Friday, US District Judge Arun Subramanian, who oversees the criminal case, denied Combs' request for a gag order barring his accusers from speaking publicly about the matter. His lawyers had argued that the approximately 30 civil cases accusing Combs of misconduct or abuse were interfering with his right to a fair trial.</p>

<p>Combs, 55, has denied wrongdoing, and his lawyers have argued that the sexual activity described by prosecutors was consensual.</p>

<p>In a court filing on Friday, defense lawyer Alexandra Shapiro asked Subramanian to release Combs on the $50 million bond, which would be backed by his $48 million Miami home and co-signed by several of his family members.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shapiro also proposed that Combs be monitored around the clock by security personnel, be subjected to home detention, and have no contact with alleged victims or witnesses. His trial is scheduled for May 5.</p>

<p>In seeking bail, Shapiro said new evidence undermined part of the prosecution's justification for detaining Combs. She said the evidence shed new light on a 2016 hotel surveillance video of him physically assaulting former girlfriend Casandra Ventura, known as Cassie.</p>

<p>"The video is not evidence of a coerced 'freak off,' but rather a minutes-long glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship," Shapiro wrote.</p>

<p>Shapiro also said it is impossible for Combs to prepare for trial from behind bars because of the "incredibly voluminous" amount of material to review, especially without a laptop computer. She also said his preparation has been stymied by conditions at the jail, including frequent lockdowns and even officers taking away the pens he uses to take notes.</p>

<p>Detention is stripping Combs of "any real opportunity" to be ready for trial, violating his rights under the US Constitution, Shapiro said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has prepared executive orders and proclamations on withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement and shrinking the size of some national monuments to allow more drilling and mining, the New York Times reported on Friday.</p>

<p>Trump is also expected to end the pause on permitting new liquefied natural gas exports to big markets in Asia and Europe and revoke a waiver that allows California and other states to have tighter pollution standards, according to the report.</p>

<p>Trump promised during his campaign to take many of the actions listed in the report. Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for the Trump transition team, said in a response to a Reuters request that the results of Tuesday's election gave him a "mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail. He will deliver."</p>

<p>The administration of President Joe Biden paused approvals of new LNG exports in January in order to complete a study on the environmental and economic impact of the exports. The US Energy Department will have a draft updated analysis out for a 60-day public comment period before the end of the year, a department official said.</p>

<p>Some people on the transition team are discussing moving the headquarters of the Environmental Protection Agency out of Washington, the report said, citing unnamed people involved in the discussions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For Rabab al-Hajj Youssef, every trip to the bathroom to change her sanitary pad is a painful experience. After Israeli strikes displaced her family from their home in Lebanon to a shelter, she shares limited water with hundreds of people.</p>

<p>"Sometimes there's no water for a girl to wash and change. There's no basket in the bathroom - there's no basket for a girl to put her sanitary pad," Youssef, 29, told Reuters.</p>

<p>She had fled with her young children from her home in the city of Baalbek, in eastern Lebanon, just days earlier to a school-turned-shelter further west.</p>

<p>Thousands of people have fled the same region over the last two weeks, after the Israeli military issued evacuation orders for Baalbek and nearby towns and began pounding the region with deadly strikes. They are among more than 1.2 million displaced by Israel's escalating campaign against armed group Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Nearly 200,000 of them now live across 1,145 collective shelters - most of which are at capacity. The numbers are growing and as winter sets in, so are the needs.</p>

<p>In the school where Youssef and her family have sought refuge, the biggest shortage is clean water.</p>

<p>"You have to take your underwear and wash it. I wait for my daughter at the bathroom door to wash in freezing water - freezing - so she can change and wear the sanitary pad," she told Reuters.</p>

<p>Privacy is also an issue. There are no baskets in some of the shared bathrooms, Youssef said, so girls need to bring bags with them, which some girls deem embarrassing if men are around.</p>

<p>"Without water, there is a lot of humiliation," she added.</p>

<p>More than 11,000 pregnant women are among the newly displaced population in Lebanon, according to the UN sexual health and reproductive rights agency (UNFPA), needing access to prenatal care, nutrition, clean water and hygiene supplies.</p>

<p>One pregnant woman in the displaced shelter told Reuters she was afraid she would have a pre-term baby.</p>

<p>"We are really concerned about the nutrition of the newborn babies and the nutrition of the underaged (minors) as well," said Hussein Alharati, Relief International's Health Program Coordinator in the Bekaa valley.</p>

<p>The World Health Organisation said it had already documented cases of measles, hepatitis A and other infectious diseases among the displaced, and warned this week that a resurgence may be possible as the number of displaced people "in suboptimal shelter conditions" grows.</p>

<p>Rita Abou Nabhan, a lactation specialist with Relief International, said that despite distributions of hygiene kits and sanitary pads to women at the shelter in the Bekaa, the biggest fear is lack of water.</p>

<p>"We can see it in their eyes and hear it in their words, how afraid they are that they will get infections that grow," she said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US has told Qatar that the presence of Hamas in Doha is no longer acceptable in the weeks since the Palestinian group rejected the latest proposal to achieve a ceasefire and a hostage deal, a senior administration official told Reuters on Friday.</p>

<p>The tiny Gulf state Qatar, alongside the US and Egypt, has played a major role in rounds of so-far fruitless talks to broker a ceasefire to the year-long war in Gaza. The latest round of talks in mid-October failed to produce a deal, with Hamas rejecting a short-term ceasefire proposal.</p>

<p>"After rejecting repeated proposals to release hostages, its leaders should no longer be welcome in the capitals of any American partner. We made that clear to Qatar following Hamas's rejection weeks ago of another hostage release proposal," the senior official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>Qatar then made the demand to Hamas leaders about 10 days ago, the official said. Washington has been in touch with Qatar over when to close the group's political office, and it told Doha that now was the time.</p>

<p>Three Hamas officials denied Qatar had told Hamas leaders they were no longer welcome in the country. The spokesperson for Qatar's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>It was unclear if the Qataris provided a specific deadline to the Hamas leaders to leave the country.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden's administration has been preparing to make a final push to end Israeli assaults in Gaza and Lebanon. Republican Donald Trump's election this week as the next US president has significantly diminished Biden's leverage during his last weeks in office.</p>

<p>In previous rounds of ceasefire talks, disagreements over new demands that Israel introduced about future military presence in Gaza obstructed a deal, even after Hamas accepted a version of a ceasefire proposal that Biden unveiled in May.</p>

<p>Hamas at the time viewed Israel as having moved the goal post for a deal "last-minute," and worried any concessions it made would be met by more demands, a source close to the talks told Reuters in August.</p>

<p>Last November, this negotiation track in Doha led to a seven-day truce in Gaza, permitting the release of dozens of hostages held there in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Humanitarian aid also flowed into the shattered coastal strip but hostilities swiftly resumed and have continued ever since.</p>

<p><strong>"END HOSPITALITY TO HAMAS"</strong></p>

<p>Qatar, an influential Gulf state designated as a major non-NATO ally by Washington, has hosted Hamas' political leaders since 2012 as part of an agreement with the US.</p>

<p>Following last year's Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, in which Hamas killed 1,200 people and abducted 250 others, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told leaders in Qatar and elsewhere in the region that there could be "no more business as usual" with Hamas.</p>

<p>Qataris told Blinken they were open to reconsidering the presence of Hamas in the country when the time comes.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory strikes on the Gaza Strip killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, reduced the enclave to a wasteland and unleashed a humanitarian catastrophe.</p>

<p>Doha has come under criticism from US lawmakers over its ties with the group.</p>

<p>On Friday, 14 Republican US senators wrote a letter to the Department of State asking Washington to immediately freeze the assets of Hamas officials living in Qatar, extradite several senior Hamas officials living in Qatar and ask Qatar "to end its hospitality to Hamas" senior leadership."</p>

<p>Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani has said repeatedly over the last year that the Hamas office exists in Doha to allow negotiations with the group and that as long as the channel remained useful Qatar would allow the Hamas office to remain open.</p>

<p>It is unclear how many Hamas officials live in Doha, but they include several leaders touted as possible replacements for leader Yahya Sinwar, whom Israeli forces killed in Gaza last month.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime conspiracy theorist and opponent of vaccines, now has the ear of President-elect Donald Trump to promote what he's calling the "Make America Healthy Again" agenda.</p>

<p>It's something of an unlikely alliance between the Kennedy family scion, once a celebrated environmental champion who called for prosecuting climate change deniers, and the returning Republican leader.</p>

<p>What they share, however, is a profound distrust of institutions. In the final stretch of the campaign, Trump announced that RFK Jr. would "have a big role in health care" if he won.</p>

<p>The announcement immediately raised alarm, given Kennedy's reputation as a notorious vaccine skeptic.</p>

<p>Not long ago, though, Kennedy was a high-powered climate attorney and was even in the mix to become former president Barack Obama's environment chief.</p>

<p>This makes him a complex figure, some experts say, who brings some valuable ideas to the table.</p>

<p>In recent days, he's tried to reassure critics, telling NPR, "We're not going to take vaccines away from anybody," while adding, ominously, "We are going to make sure that Americans have good information."</p>

<p>Kennedy has spent two decades promoting vaccine conspiracy theories, especially around Covid-19 shots -- ironically, the very vaccines developed in record time under Trump's first administration.</p>

<p>The nephew of the assassinated president John F. Kennedy, he was polling at around five percent of the popular vote before he withdrew to endorse Trump, to the dismay of his own family.</p>

<p><strong>MAHA</strong></p>

<p>Since then, the duo have been promoting the "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) movement, a play on Trump's "Make America Great Again" (MAGA) slogan -- having reportedly approached Vice President Kamala Harris for a role, without success.</p>

<p>His mission: "to transform our nation's food, fitness, air, water, soil, and medicine," he said in a video, his voice unsteady due to a neurological condition.</p>

<p>"Our big priority will be to clean up the public health agencies," he declared, naming the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and more.</p>

<p>"Those agencies have become sock puppets for the industries that they're supposed to regulate," said the 70-year-old, echoing common progressive criticisms.</p>

<p>On X, he wrote: "If you work for the FDA and are part of this corrupt system, I have two messages for you: 1. Preserve your records, and 2. Pack your bags."</p>

<p>He has also stirred controversy by suggesting he would stop the addition of fluoride to tap water -- a practice aimed at preventing cavities that the CDC considers one of the top 10 health achievements of the 20th century.</p>

<p><strong>Cabinet position?</strong></p>

<p>Will he serve as an advisor or even health secretary? With a Republican Senate majority, a cabinet confirmation is now possible.</p>

<p>At a recent rally, Trump said that Kennedy -- once arrested for protesting the Keystone XL pipeline -- won't be involved in his "Drill, baby, drill" agenda.</p>

<p>But he will be responsible for "women's health", Trump said in an announcement that angered Democrats already frustrated by Republican-led abortion restrictions.</p>

<p>Yet RFK Jr.'s stance on reproductive rights defies easy categorization. This spring, he defended a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy at any stage, saying, "Ultimately, I don't trust government to have jurisdiction over people's bodies."</p>

<p>He later revised his position, favoring a ban after fetal viability, around 24 weeks -- the limit set by a Supreme Court ruling that held sway for half a century before it was overturned in 2022, thanks to Trump-appointed justices.</p>

<p><strong>Healthy eating</strong></p>

<p>Kennedy will also tackle the nation's food health, a curious task considering Trump's well-known affection for McDonald's.</p>

<p>America must end its chronic disease epidemic, says Kennedy, focusing in particular on obesity. But he's also a fan of raw milk, a practice health experts strongly discourage.</p>

<p>In an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, Kennedy called for bringing prescription drug prices significantly down, citing the diabetes medication Ozempic -- an issue championed by left wing Senator Bernie Sanders.</p>

<p>He also proposes preventing food stamp recipients from purchasing soda and ultra-processed foods, a policy "which I have advocated for the past 15 years," Tom Frieden, CDC director under Obama, said in Stat News.</p>

<p>While agreeing with Kennedy's focus on chronic disease, Frieden remains wary. "The MAHA combination of sound science, pseudo-science, and profiteering by so-called 'wellness' companies isn't the answer."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two survivors of the 2017 bomb attack at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, on Friday won £45,000 ($58,000) in damages from a former TV producer who claimed the attack was a hoax.</p>

<p>Martin Hibbert and his daughter Eve sued Richard Hall over claims made in videos and a book that they were "crisis actors" employed by the state as part of an elaborate deception.</p>

<p>Martin Hibbert sustained a spinal cord injury in the attack, and his daughter suffered severe brain damage.</p>

<p>Richard Hall argued that he was acting in the public interest by filming Martin Hibbert's daughter outside her home, but the High Court in London agreed with Martin Hibbert's claim for harassment.</p>

<p>Judge Karen Steyn called Richard Hall's behaviour "a negligent, indeed reckless, abuse of media freedom" and on Friday ordered him to pay Martin Hibbert and his daughter each £22,500 in damages.</p>

<p>Richard Hall must also pay 90 percent of their legal costs, currently estimated at £260,000.</p>

<p>"The claimants are both vulnerable. The allegations are serious and distressing," said the judge.</p>

<p>Jonathan Price, lawyer for the claimants, said that Richard Hall "insisted that the terrorist attack in which the claimants were catastrophically injured did not happen and that the claimants were participants or 'crisis actors' in a state-orchestrated hoax, who had repeatedly, publicly and egregiously lied to the public for monetary gain."</p>

<p>Martin Hibbert welcomed the ruling, adding: "I want this case to open up the door for change, and for it to protect others from what we have been put through.</p>

<p>"It proves and has highlighted... that there is protection within the law, and it sends out a message to conspiracy theorists that you cannot ignore all acceptable evidence and harass innocent people."</p>

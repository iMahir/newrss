       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Air Europa flight from Madrid to Montevideo made an emergency landing in Brazil after it was hit by severe turbulence that left passengers stuck inside overhead bins and dozens of others with head, neck and chest and chest injuries. The plane, a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner with 325 people on board, was diverted in the early morning hours to the airport of Natal in northeast Brazil, where more than a dozen ambulances waited.</p>

<p>Videos from inside the plane have surfaced on social media which shows passengers helping a fellow flyer out of an overhead bin storage area. It remains unclear how the man came to be lodged in the space. Several passengers said that those not wearing seatbelts were thrown from their seats by the strong turbulence, hitting the ceiling.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hurricane Beryl barreled toward Jamaica as a powerful Category 4 storm on Tuesday, threatening to dump rain on parts of Hispaniola after leaving at least three people dead on smaller islands in the eastern Caribbean.</p>

<p>Tropical storm conditions were expected on parts of the southern coasts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic on Tuesday evening, according to an advisory from the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC).</p>

<p>"Beryl is expected to bring life-threatening winds and storm surge to Jamaica on Wednesday and the Cayman Islands Wednesday night and Thursday," the NHC said. A hurricane warning is in effect for both places.</p>

<p>In Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince, which is in the grips of entrenched gang violence and an ongoing humanitarian crisis, strong winds took residents by surprise on Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>The country's southwestern peninsula could get 4-8 inches (10-20 cm) of rain, with as much as 12 inches in some places, the NHC said. New Haitian Prime Minister Garry Conille warned residents to take precautions and stay alert.</p>

<p>The unusually early hurricane, whose rapid strengthening scientists said was likely fueled by human-caused climate change, is expected to still be a hurricane when it passes near Jamaica and the Cayman Islands later this week.</p>

<p>Beryl, the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane and the earliest storm on record to reach the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson Scale, felled power lines and unleashed flash floods across smaller islands.</p>

<p>The storm hit St. Vincent and the Grenadines especially hard, according to Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves.</p>

<p>"The hurricane has come and gone, and it has left in its wake immense destruction," he said. On one island in the Grenadines archipelago, Union Island, 90% of homes had been "severely damaged or destroyed," he added.</p>

<p>The prime minister confirmed one death and said more fatalities could be confirmed in the coming days.</p>

<p>In a video briefing on Tuesday, Grenada's prime minister, Dickon Mitchell, stressed that Carriacou and Petite Martinique, two of the three islands that make up the country, bore the brunt of the natural disaster.</p>

<p>"The situation is grim. There is no power. There is almost complete destruction of homes and buildings," he said, citing impassable roads due to downed power lines and destroyed fuel stations crimping supplies.</p>

<p>Mitchell said at least two deaths were attributed to the impact of Beryl so far.</p>

<p>The hurricane, packing maximum sustained winds of 150 miles per hour (241 kph), is currently located about 360 miles (579 km) east-southeast of the Jamaican capital of Kingston, according to the NHC.</p>

<p>The Miami-based hurricane centre estimates that the massive weather system is moving toward the west-northwest at a speed of 22 mph (35 kph).</p>

<p>In Jamaica, men hauled fishing boats out of the water and tied them down in preparation for the hurricane's arrival, while others noted there was still time to prepare on Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>"We Jamaicans don't take things serious," said Standford Pusey, as he showed off items secured with plastic tarps.</p>

<p>In Fort-de-France on the French Caribbean island of Martinique, north of St. Vincent, a video shared on social media showed heavy flooding in the streets as locals attempted to clear away debris.</p>

<p>In addition to Haiti's southern coast, the NHC also posted a hurricane watch for Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, dotted with beach resorts popular with tourists.</p>

<p>Ahead of the storm's approach expected Thursday night, Mexico's defense ministry said the army, air force, and national guard had activated emergency response protocols in the three Yucatan states, with 120 shelters opened and nearly 4,900 troops on guard on the peninsula.</p>

<p>The unusually early timing and rapid intensification of the storm is partly due to warmer ocean temperatures, scientists say.</p>

<p>Climate change likely contributed to Beryl's early formation, while also driving how quickly it intensified, according to scientists surveyed by Reuters, which could provide an unsettling preview of future storms.</p>

<p>Global warming has helped push temperatures in the North Atlantic to record highs, said Christopher Rozoff, an atmospheric scientist at the U.S.-based National Center for Atmospheric Research. The warmer waters lead to more evaporation, which fuels more intense hurricanes featuring higher wind speeds, he said.</p>

<p>Beryl jumped from a Category 1 to a Category 4 storm in under 10 hours, according to Andra Garner, a Rowan University meteorologist. That marked the fastest intensification ever recorded before September, the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, she added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden today blamed jet lag from his recent travels overseas for his disastrous debate performance against Republican rival Donald Trump.</p>

<p>"It's not an excuse, but an explanation," he said while addressing a fundraiser.</p>

<p>Biden said he "wasn't very smart" for "traveling around the world a couple times... shortly before the debate."</p>

<p>"I didn't listen to my staff," he said. "And then I almost fell asleep on stage."</p>

<p>Biden had flown to France, back to the United States, to Italy, among other travels, over a 14-day period before taking just a few days to rest at his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.&nbsp;He was dragging, according to several people who observed him during this period.</p>

<p>Joe Biden, who has always been gaffe-prone, appeared to struggle while responding to former US President Donald Trump's charges during the debate.</p>

<p>A bombastic Trump lashed out at his successor, calling him a failure on the economy and the world stage. Biden looked to hit back, but his delivery was hesitant as he spoke rapidly in a soft, trailing-off voice and stumbled on his words several times.</p>

<p>It was the first debate ever between a president and former president -- and each accused each other of being history's worst.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old's fumbling, halting performance has sparked calls from Democrats for him to end his quest for a second term and for "soul-searching".</p>

<p>Biden's remarks could invite even more scrutiny over whether the 81-year-old is fit for rigorous traveling, packed schedule.</p>

<p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre today admitted the debate was "a bad night" but added that Biden "knows how to come back" from adversity.</p>

<p>Responding to the criticism, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said people around the world were looking at what Biden has done since coming into office, not just one night, and that they appreciate his policies.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK Labour Party is 99 per cent "certain" to secure more seats in Thursday's general election than when it won a landslide victory in 1997, a major new poll said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The centre-left opposition party -- out of power since 2010 -- is predicted to claim 484 out of a total of 650 seats in what would be an unprecedented victory in modern British history, pollster Survation said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the right-wing ruling Conservatives and the centrist Liberal Democrats (Lib Dems) are in a close race to come a distant second and form the country's official opposition, it added.</p>

<p>The prediction is the latest in a series of so-called MRP polls -- which use large national samples to forecast results for every UK constituency -- that estimate Labour will win emphatically on July 4.</p>

<p>Such a scenario would see its leader Keir Starmer replace the Conservatives' Rishi Sunak as prime minister.</p>

<p>Labour has led the Tories in the polls by double-digit margins for nearly two years, and the gap has failed to narrow during a six-week election campaign widely seen as having gone badly for Sunak.</p>

<p>Survation said its data indicated that Labour would win around 42 per cent of the overall vote, ahead of the Conservatives on 23 per cent.</p>

<p>However, due to the UK's winner-takes-all electoral system in each of its 650 constituencies, that would see the Conservatives capture just 64 seats, with the Lib Dems predicted to claim 61.</p>

<p>Labour's estimated 484 seats would exceed the 418 won by ex-prime minister Tony Blair in 1997, and even top the Tories' landslide haul of 470 in 1931.</p>

<p>The pollster also predicted that Labour would again become the largest party in Scotland, winning 38 of its 57 seats and supplanting the Scottish National Party (SNP), which it estimated would secure just 10 seats.</p>

<p>The pro-independence SNP won 48 Scottish constituencies at the last election in 2019.</p>

<p>The Conservatives are "virtually certain" to win a lower share of the vote than at any past general election, according to Survation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it forecasted that Reform UK, the anti-immigration party founded by Brexit figurehead Nigel Farage, would only win a handful of seats despite taking the third-largest overall share of the vote, again due to the electoral system.</p>

<p>The Survation prediction, based on nearly 35,000 electorate interviews, is likely to intensify warnings by Sunak in the final hours of the campaign that voters should be weary of voting Labour and handing it a so-called "super-majority".</p>

<p>Starmer has accused his Conservative rivals of running "an increasingly desperate, negative campaign".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google, despite its goal of achieving net-zero emissions, is pumping out more greenhouse gas than before as it powers data centers needed to support artificial intelligence, the company said.</p>

<p>Google's climate-changing emissions have increased 48 per cent in the past five years, at odds with a touted goal of becoming carbon neutral for the sake of the planet, according to an annual environmental report released on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Total greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 were 13 per cent higher than they were the prior year, primarily driven by increased data center energy consumption and its supply chain, the report stated.</p>

<p>The increase came even though Google has been ramping up the use of solar and wind-generated clean energy.</p>

<p>"In spite of the progress we're making, we face significant challenges that we're actively working through," chief sustainability officer Kate Brandt and senior vice president Benedict Gomes said in the report.</p>

<p>"As we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment."</p>

<p>Google is not alone in facing the challenge of feeding power-hungry AI data centers, while trying to curb the creation of climate-changing greenhouse gas.</p>

<p>Microsoft said in its recent sustainability report that its greenhouse gas emissions last year were up 29 per cent from 2020 as it continues "to invest in the infrastructure needed to advance new technologies."</p>

<p>Microsoft and Google have been front runners in an AI race since OpenAI released ChatGPT in late 2022.</p>

<p>AI has been a theme for the rivals in blockbuster earnings performances quarter after quarter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Google and Microsoft have each pledged to be carbon neutral by the end of this decade.</p>

<p>Microsoft has an added goal of being carbon-negative, taking climate-harming gas out of the air, by 2050.</p>

<p>Amazon, also an AI contender with its AWS cloud computing division, has said it is aiming to be carbon neutral by 2040.</p>

<p>"A sustainable future requires systems-level change, strong government policies, and new technologies," Google said in its report.</p>

<p>"We're committed to collaboration and playing our part, every step of the way."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to hear a challenge to a law in Republican-led Texas that requires pornographic websites to verify the age of visitors in order to limit minors' access to online sexual content.</p>

<p>Passed last summer, the law mandating adult websites to require state-issued identification from users was challenged in court by a trade association representing the adult entertainment industry that argued it violates First Amendment free speech rights.</p>

<p>A federal court sided with the trade association, called the Free Speech Coalition, and blocked the law, saying it was too restrictive.</p>

<p>But in March a conservative appeals court agreed with Texas authorities and upheld the age verification requirement, prompting the trade group to appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>In its legal brief to the high court, the group cited the risk of "disclosures, leaks and hacks" and argued that "by verifying information through government identification, the law will allow the government to peer into the most intimate and personal aspects of people's lives."</p>

<p>In his brief to the Supreme Court, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton argued "there is nothing unconstitutional" about the law.</p>

<p>"This statute does not prohibit the performance, production, or even sale of pornography but, more modestly, simply requires the pornography industry... to take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that those who access the material are adults," Paxton wrote.</p>

<p>Texas authorities have been raising alarm over minors' access to adult content, calling it a public health crisis.</p>

<p>Similar age verification laws have been passed in other states including Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas and others.</p>

<p>Oral arguments in the case will take place during the Supreme Court term which begins on October 7.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Laughing and joking, Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un cruised around Pyongyang last week in a Russian-made Aurus limousine to showcase their strengthened anti-Western alliance.</p>

<p>The luxury sedan was intended to epitomize Russia's domestic prowess and reduced dependence on imported technology and goods when unveiled in 2018.</p>

<p>But customs records show that the company that builds it uses millions of dollars in imported parts, many arriving in Russia from what Kim has described as his country's "primary foe", South Korea.</p>

<p>The imports point to Russia's ongoing reliance on Western technology as it seeks to navigate Western attempts to cut it off from global supply chains as punishment for its invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>The two leaders took turns driving the armoured limousine during Putin's pomp-filled visit, his first in nearly a quarter of a century to North Korea, in a demonstration of the two nuclear powers' increasingly close ties.</p>

<p>Russia imported equipment and components worth at least $34 million between 2018 and 2023 for assembling Aurus cars and motorcycles, customs records seen by Reuters showed. Reuters does not have access to more recent data.</p>

<p>The imports included car body parts, sensors, programmable controllers, switches, welding equipment and other components worth almost $15.5 million imported from South Korea. Parts were also imported from China, India, Turkey, Italy and other EU countries.</p>

<p>Foreign supplies for Aurus kept coming after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with goods worth almost $16 million, including $5 million produced in South Korea, imported since February 2022, the records showed.</p>

<p>Reuters could not determine specifically which imported foreign parts ended up in the car gifted to Kim, and the imports were not in breach of sanctions - Aurus LLC was sanctioned by the United States in February, 2024.</p>

<p>The Aurus sedan was developed by Russian state-owned research institute NAMI in partnership with Russian carmaker Sollers, which has since sold its stake.</p>

<p>Aurus Motors and its CEO Andrey Pankov did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment on the use of foreign parts, including from South Korea, in its vehicles.</p>

<p><strong>GROWING PRODUCTION</strong></p>

<p>The company launched official production in Russia's Tatarstan region, around 1,000 km (620 miles) from Moscow, in 2021 - before then it was made on a small, experimental scale at NAMI. It will start additional production in St Petersburg later this year at Toyota's former factory.</p>

<p>Toyota is one of many foreign carmakers to exit the Russian market since the invasion, which Russia calls a "special military operation".</p>

<p>The exodus has left a gap that Chinese producers have been quick to fill, rapidly seizing more than half the market share and exposing Russia's limited domestic production capacity.</p>

<p>South Korean firms were among the largest suppliers to Aurus, including industrial equipment producer Kyungki Industrial Co, car body parts manufacturer BYT CO LTD and batteries supplier Enertech International Inc.</p>

<p>Italian plastic parts producer Industrie Ilpea Spa and Hong Kong company Rain Electronics also supplied goods.</p>

<p>Kyungki Industrial Co said in a statement to Reuters on Monday that it had not signed any contract with Aurus or Russian suppliers since 2021 or participated in any further projects in Russia since 2022. It also said that it would be concerned about any potential sanctions.</p>

<p>A company representative had earlier told Reuters the company continued to supply Aurus and was not concerned about potential sanctions. The representative later referred Reuters to Monday's statement.</p>

<p>Rain Electronics could not be reached for comment. When a Reuters correspondent visited the address listed on the internet as the company's office in Hong Kong, there was no trace of Rain Electronics on the floor listed online or in the office building.</p>

<p>BYT CO LTD, Enertech International and Industrie Ilpea Spa did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.</p>

<p>The Aurus Senat, retro-styled after the Soviet-era ZIL limousine, is Russia's official presidential car and was used by Putin at his presidential inaugurations in 2018 and 2024.</p>

<p>Putin has now given Kim, believed to be a keen automobile fan, two Aurus cars, first during Kim's visit to Russia in February, and a slightly different model in North Korea in June.</p>

<p>Prices for Aurus cars - there are four models including an SUV and armoured version - start from 46.625 million roubles ($528,356). Customers include Turkmenistan President Serdar Berdymukhamedov.</p>

<p>Aurus sold 107 cars in Russia in 2023, according to data from Russian analytical agency Autostat. Aurus does not disclose production numbers.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Chinese officials boarded and then seized a Taiwanese fishing boat operating near China's coast close to a Taiwan-controlled island and took it to a Chinese port, the Taiwan coast guard said late on Tuesday in a further escalation of tensions.</p>

<p>China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and has ramped up pressure on Taipei since President Lai Ching-te took office in May, a man Beijing accuses of being a "separatist".</p>

<p>The fishing boat was operating near the Taiwan-administered Kinmen islands, which sit next to the Chinese cities of Xiamen and Quanzhou, on Tuesday night when it was boarded and seized by two Chinese maritime administration boats, Taiwan's coast guard said.</p>

<p>Taiwan sent it own coast guard ships to assist and broadcast warnings asking China to release the fishing boat, but China's ships broadcast back saying not to interfere, Taiwan's coast guard said in a statement.</p>

<p>Taiwan's ships then backed off to avoid a conflict and the Taiwanese fishing vessel was then taken to a Chinese port, it added.</p>

<p>China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not answer calls seeking comment outside of office hours.</p>

<p>Chinese maritime enforcement and coast guard ships have been regularly operating around Kinmen since February after two Chinese fishermen died trying to flee Taiwan's coast guard.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel has killed about 900 militants in Rafah since the beginning of Israel's ground assault on the southernmost city in Gaza in early May, Israel's military Chief Herzi Halevi said.</p>

<p>The casualties include "at least one battalion commander, many company commanders, and many operatives," Halevi said on Tuesday when inspecting a military logistic post in the southern Gaza Strip, according to a statement released by the Israel Defense Forces.</p>

<p>He added that the offensive in Rafah is expected to be completed within weeks, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>"Now the effort focuses on the destruction of the infrastructure and the destruction of the underground infrastructure, and it takes time," he said, noting, "This campaign is long because we don't want to leave Rafah with the infrastructure intact."</p>

<p>Before the launch of the ground offensive, Rafah was one of the few locations where civilians sought refuge from the massive Israeli bombardments across the Palestinian enclave.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden on Tuesday blamed his recent foreign travels for his debate debacle.</p>

<p>"I wasn't very smart. I decided to travel around the world a couple of times … shortly before the debate," Biden said while talking to donors at a fundraiser in a Virginia suburb of Washington DC. "I didn't listen to my staff … and then I almost fell asleep on stage."</p>

<p>In his remarks, Biden admitted that he did not have a good debate, and said he "wasn't very smart" for "travelling around the world a couple times" before the debate.</p>

<p>Biden also apologised by saying he was sorry for the performance. "It's not an excuse but an explanation." The president's remarks at the fund raiser was just for six minutes, which is far shorter than what he speaks on such occasions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the White House said Biden will travel to Wisconsin on Friday. He will conduct a sit-down interview with George Stephanopoulos from ABC News, while on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>He will travel to Philadelphia on Sunday. And next week, he will host a NATO press conference, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at her daily news conference.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrats shocked by Joe Biden's dismal debate performance urged the US president Tuesday to be transparent about his mental fitness as he faced the first call from his own side to drop out of the election.</p>

<p>Some supporters have expressed growing doubts about the 81-year-old after last week's televised showdown with Donald Trump when Biden stumbled over his words and lost his train of thought -- exacerbating fears about his age.</p>

<p>Congressman Lloyd Doggett became the first Democratic lawmaker to publicly call on Biden to make way for another candidate, saying he was hopeful the president would "make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw."</p>

<p>Nancy Pelosi, a former House speaker and a grandee of the Democratic Party, said in her own statement it was "legitimate" to ask whether Biden's debate disaster was indicative of a deeper problem rather than a one-off.</p>

<p>Biden has not given a live interview or held a press conference since the debacle, meaning he has not had to give unscripted comments under pressure again.</p>

<p>ABC News announced that he would be interviewed by the network on Friday, with the first clips released that day.</p>

<p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Tuesday admitted the debate was "a bad night" for the president but added that Biden "knows how to come back" from adversity.</p>

<p>"We understand. We're not taking away from what you all saw," she told reporters. "I think the president's work record certainly speaks for itself."</p>

<p>She dismissed questions about Biden needing a cognitive test, and said the president would speak to high-ranking Democrats, before holding a press conference during a NATO summit in Washington next week.</p>

<p>- 'Horrified' -</p>

<p>The polling margins between the president and his Republican predecessor have been razor-thin and almost static for months, with Trump showing a slight advantage in the all-important swing states.</p>

<p>Biden pushed for an unusually early first debate in hopes that he could jolt the race while there was still time to build on any momentum gained -- but the plan backfired.</p>

<p>Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse told WPRI-TV he was "pretty horrified" by the president's performance during the 90-minute CNN match-up, watched by more than 50 million Americans.</p>

<p>Jared Golden, a vulnerable Democrat in conservative-leaning House district, raised eyebrows with an op-ed in his local paper in Maine in which he said Biden's poor showing "was not a surprise."</p>

<p>"It also didn't rattle me as it has others, because the outcome of this election has been clear to me for months: While I don't plan to vote for him, Donald Trump is going to win. And I'm OK with that," he said, explaining he believed US democracy would endure.</p>

<p>The White House has always shrugged off concern about Biden's mental acuity, sometimes with marked irritation.</p>

<p>His campaign -- under pressure over its tactics -- hit out at "self-important podcasters" in a memo widely seen as a swipe at a group of former Barack Obama staffers and slammed demands from "the bedwetting brigade" for Biden drop out.</p>

<p>But Vermont Senator Peter Welch, a Democrat, told news website Semafor on Tuesday that Biden's team had "a dismissive attitude towards people who are raising questions for discussion."</p>

<p><strong>- Slowed down -</strong></p>

<p>Biden has visibly slowed over the last year.</p>

<p>It has been several months since the president, who has fallen in public on several occasions, stopped using his plane's high gangway, preferring a shorter, more stable staircase.</p>

<p>He has also surrounded himself with aides for the short walk from the White House to his helicopter on the lawn, preventing cameras from focusing on his stiff gait.</p>

<p>Biden, who has always been gaffe-prone, has not given a long press conference since January 2022 and spends almost every weekend in one of his Delaware homes, with no official schedule.</p>

<p>When he recently visited France to commemorate the 1944 Allied landings, he went straight from the airport to his hotel, where he remained for an entire day, with no public appearances.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, who is of Indian and African heritage, has a better chance of retaining the White House in the November presidential polls than her boss President Joe Biden has, according to a latest CNN poll.</p>

<p>The approval rating of Biden, 81, has plummeted after his dismal debate performance in Atlanta last week against his predecessor Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Since the debate, there has been increasing voices in the ruling Democratic party for Biden to step down and let someone else run the race for the crucial November 5 presidential elections.</p>

<p>According to the CNN poll conducted by SRS, Trump is ahead of Biden by six points.</p>

<p>The poll also finds Harris within striking distance of Trump in a hypothetical matchup: 47 per cent of registered voters support Trump, 45 per cent Harris, a result within the margin of error that suggests there is no clear leader under such a scenario.</p>

<p>"Harris' slightly stronger showing against Trump rests at least in part on broader support from women (50% of female voters back Harris over Trump vs. 44% for Biden against Trump) and independents (43% Harris vs. 34% Biden)," the polls said.</p>

<p>White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre refrained to give a direct comment on the polls.</p>

<p>"I'm constrained to speaking directly to your poll and I get it and I hear the question. I got to be mindful, that is something for the campaign as you started saying, what the campaign has laid out their argument of the case. That is something for them to take up and that is something for them to answer," she told reporters when asked about it.</p>

<p>"What I can speak to is the president's record. What I can speak to, what he's been able to accomplish and the things that he's been able to do and get done is actually in line with majority of Americans. And I think that's important too, to note. And again, I will say with age comes wisdom and experience and that's certainly something that the president brings," she said.</p>

<p>Former First Lady Michelle Obama leads Trump by a whopping 11 points in an Ipsos poll—50 per cent to 39 per cent — though her office told NBC News in March she would not be running for president this year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday urged Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu to prevent a "conflagration" between Israel and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, during a telephone call between the two leaders.</p>

<p>Macron "reiterated his serious concern over a deepening of tensions between Hezbollah and Israel... and underscored the absolute need to prevent a conflagration that would harm the interests of Lebanon as well as Israel," the French presidency said in a statement.</p>

<p>He also insisted on the "urgency for all parties to move rapidly toward a diplomatic solution" to end the conflict sparked by the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas militants in Gaza.</p>

<p>"The two leaders discussed the diplomatic efforts underway towards this," the Elysee Palace said, ahead of a visit by the US envoy for the conflict, Amos Hochstein, to Paris on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Macron also called on Netanyahu to refrain from any "new operation" in Gaza near Rafah or Khan Yunis, "which would only aggravate the human toll and a humanitarian situation that is already catastrophic", the Elysee said.</p>

<p>The Israeli army on Monday ordered the evacuation of most areas east of Khan Yunis and Rafah along the Egyptian border.</p>

<p>It did not explicitly announce a military operation, but such orders have typically preceded major offensives.</p>

<p>The announcement sparked a mass exodus of Palestinians from parts of southern Gaza on Tuesday as Israeli forces launched deadly strikes and clashed with militants.</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 the army says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive aimed at eradicating the Palestinian militants in Gaza has killed at least 37,925 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A judge postponed on Tuesday Donald Trump's sentencing following his conviction for covering up hush money payments until September 18 to allow time for a Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity to be considered.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge postponed Tuesday Donald Trump's sentencing for covering up hush money payments until September 18, the first fallout of a Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity, pushing it to after the Republican convention.</p>

<p>The United States' top court ruled Monday that Trump enjoys some immunity from prosecution as a former president, a decision also set to delay his trial for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election.</p>

<p>Hours after the ruling was announced, Trump's legal team said in a letter to the New York court that the immunity ruling vindicated Trump's position that he should not be judged for his "official acts," and reiterated his call for the conviction to be set aside.</p>

<p>The sentencing had been scheduled for July 11, days before the Republican National Convention on July 15 at which Trump is expected to be proclaimed the party's nominee for the battle against President Joe Biden for the White House.</p>

<p>"The matter is adjourned to September 18, 2024, at 10 am for the imposition of sentence, if such is still necessary," Judge Juan Merchan said in a court filing to allow time for consideration of the bombshell Supreme Court ruling.</p>

<p>Manhattan prosecutor Alvin Bragg had earlier said in a filing that he was not opposed to the delay, but that he believed the "defendant's arguments to be without merit."</p>

<p>The conviction in New York in May made Trump the first former US president ever convicted of a crime. He was found guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments over his alleged affair with an adult film star in the run-up to the 2016 election.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Loud and clear' -</strong></p>

<p>In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote he "was Totally and Completely Innocent from the beginning of this Giant and Highly Illegal Scam, long before the Supreme Court's Decision."</p>

<p>"The impact of the Immunity Ruling is a loud and clear signal for Justice in the United States. I AM PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!" he added.</p>

<p>Biden warned Monday that the US Supreme Court's landmark ruling sets a "dangerous precedent" that Trump would exploit if elected in November.</p>

<p>Former FBI agent Yale University law professor Asha Rangappa told AFP that the conduct for which Trump was convicted appeared "far removed from his official duties."</p>

<p>But because the Supreme Court gave limited guidance in its ruling "it's hard to really know, what will count and what won't."</p>

<p>Facing four criminal cases, Trump has been doing everything in his power to delay the trials until after the election.</p>

<p>The conservative-dominated top court ruled that Trump -- and all presidents -- enjoy "absolute immunity" from criminal prosecution for "official acts" taken while in office, but can still face criminal penalties for "unofficial acts."</p>

<p>Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, in his majority opinion, said a president is "not above the law" but does have "absolute immunity" from criminal prosecution for official acts taken while in office.</p>

<p>"The president therefore may not be prosecuted for exercising his core constitutional powers," Roberts said.</p>

<p>"As for a President's unofficial acts, there is no immunity," the chief justice added, sending the case back to a lower court to determine which of the charges facing Trump involve official or unofficial conduct.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta Platforms said on Tuesday it would lift its blanket ban on the word "shaheed", or "martyr" in English, after a year-long review by its oversight board found the social media giant's approach was "overbroad".</p>

<p>The company has been criticized for years over its handling of content involving the Middle East, including in a 2021 study Meta itself commissioned that found its approach had an "adverse human rights impact" on Palestinians and other Arabic-speaking users of its services.</p>

<p>Those criticisms have escalated since the onset of hostilities between Israel and Hamas in October.</p>

<p>The oversight board, which is funded by Meta but operates independently, started its review last year because the word accounted for more content removals on the company's platforms than any other single word or phrase.</p>

<p>Meta is the parent company of Facebook and Instagram.</p>

<p>The review found in March that Meta's rules on "shaheed" failed to account for the word's variety of meanings and resulted in the removal of content not aimed at praising violent actions.</p>

<p>Meta acknowledged the findings of the review on Tuesday and said its tests showed that removing content when "shaheed" was "paired with otherwise violating content captures the most potentially harmful content without disproportionally impacting the voice".</p>

<p>The oversight board welcomed the change, saying Meta's policy related to the word had led to the censoring of millions of people across its platforms.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hurricane Beryl was hurtling towards Jamaica Tuesday as a monster Category 5 storm, after killing at least five people and causing widespread destruction in a deadly sweep across the southeastern Caribbean.</p>

<p>Though expected to weaken slightly later Tuesday, the hurricane is still on track to slam into Jamaica on Wednesday as a "near-major" storm, bringing life-threatening winds, storm surge, rain and flash flooding, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned.</p>

<p>Beryl has already razed parts of the southeastern Caribbean as a Category 4 storm, killing at least three people in Grenada, one in St Vincent and the Grenadines, and one in Venezuela, officials said.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister of Grenada, Dickon Mitchell, said the island of Carriacou -- which the NHC said took a direct hit from the storm -- has been all but cut off, with houses, telecommunications and fuel facilities there flattened by 150 miles (90 kilometers) per hour winds.</p>

<p>"We've had virtually no communication with Carriacou in the last 12 hours except briefly this morning by satellite phone," he told a news conference.</p>

<p>The 13.5-square mile (35-square kilometer) island is home to around 9,000 people. At least two people there died, Mitchell said, with a third killed on the main island of Grenada when a tree fell on a house.</p>

<p>The family of UN climate chief Simon Stiell is among the residents of Carriacou. His office said his parents' property was damaged.</p>

<p>Some 90 percent of the homes along with the airport on Union Island, in St Vincent, have also been damaged or destroyed, Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said. The three-square mile island has a population of around 3,000.</p>

<p>Gonsalves said the storm also killed one person on another island, Bequia.</p>

<p>Beryl "has left in its wake immense destruction, pain and suffering," he said in a Facebook video late Monday.</p>

<p>One man also died when swept away by a flooded river in the state of Sucre on Venezuela's northeastern coast, officials there said.</p>

<p>Barbados appeared to have been spared the worst but was still hit with high winds and pelting rain, although officials reported no injuries so far.</p>

<p>Martinique was also largely spared, with damage to boats and some flooding in downtown Fort-de-France.</p>

<p><strong>'Alarming precedent'</strong></p>

<p>Experts say it is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.</p>

<p>Beryl is the first hurricane since NHC records began to reach the Category 4 level in June, and the earliest to reach Category 5 in July.</p>

<p>A Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale is considered a major hurricane.</p>

<p>Oceans are the main drivers of hurricanes, and there are many factors that go into their formation and intensity -- but heat is a significant one.</p>

<p>The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said Beryl "sets an alarming precedent for what is expected to be a very active hurricane season."</p>

<p>The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in late May that it expects this year to be an "extraordinary" hurricane season, with up to seven storms of Category 3 or higher.</p>

<p>The agency also cited warm Atlantic Ocean temperatures and conditions related to the weather phenomenon La Nina in the Pacific for the expected increase in storms.</p>

<p><strong>Climate crisis 'chief culprit'</strong></p>

<p>Stiell, the UN climate chief, said climate change was "pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction".</p>

<p>"Disasters on a scale that used to be the stuff of science fiction are becoming meteorological facts, and the climate crisis is the chief culprit," he said Monday.</p>

<p>Beryl had maximum sustained winds of 165 miles (270 kilometers) per hour as it headed towards Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, the NHC said in its latest update from 1200 GMT.</p>

<p>The storm is moving rapidly across the Caribbean Sea at 22 miles (35 kilometers) per hour, forecast to pass near Jamaica on Wednesday and the Cayman Islands by Thursday.</p>

<p>Tropical storm warnings have also been issued for the southern coasts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic.</p>

<p>Hurricane force winds extend some 40 miles (65 kilometers) from the eye of the storm, the NHC said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A UK jury on Tuesday convicted child serial killer Lucy Letby of attempting to murder another baby girl at the hospital neo-natal unit where she worked.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A UK jury on Tuesday convicted child serial killer Lucy Letby of attempting to murder another baby girl at the hospital neo-natal unit where she worked.</p>

<p>It comes nearly a year after a different jury convicted the former nurse of murdering seven newborn babies and attempting to kill six others, making her Britain's most prolific child serial killer in modern history.</p>

<p>Letby, 34, faced a retrial at Manchester Crown Court for the attempted murder of the baby girl, referred to in court as Child K, at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwest England in 2016.</p>

<p>Jurors at her original trial last year failed to reach a verdict on that charge.</p>

<p>However, the jury hearing the case this time took just over three hours to reach their unanimous guilty verdict.</p>

<p>Letby, who is already serving a whole-life prison sentence and was earlier this year refused an appeal bid, will be sentenced for the latest offence on Friday.</p>

<p>During the re-trial, jurors heard that the former nurse was "caught virtually red-handed" by a senior consultant as she displaced Child K's breathing tube.</p>

<p>The prosecution detailed how the consultant paediatrician walked into the unit's intensive care nursery room and saw Letby standing next to the incubator "doing nothing", as the infant's blood oxygen levels dipped.</p>

<p>The jury was also told of Letby's convictions last August of the other murders and attempted murders between 2015 and 2016.</p>

<p>Reporting restrictions prevent publication of the identities of the surviving and dead children in the cases.</p>

<p>- Ongoing probes -</p>

<p>Appearing in the witness box last month, Letby denied attempting to murder or harm Child K, or any baby ever in her care.</p>

<p>Child K was transferred to a specialist hospital later the same day because she was born extremely prematurely.</p>

<p>She died there three days later. The prosecution has not alleged Letby caused her death.</p>

<p>The young girl's parents thanked the jury and said "justice has been served". "But this justice will not take away the extreme hurt, anger and distress that we have all had to experience," they added.</p>

<p>"It also does not provide us with an explanation of why these crimes have taken place," a statement read.</p>

<p>Letby, from Hereford, western England, was arrested and then charged in 2020 following a string of baby deaths at the hospital's neo-natal unit.</p>

<p>The prosecution at her first trial said she attacked her vulnerable prematurely born victims, often during night shifts, by either injecting them with air, overfeeding them with milk or poisoning them with insulin.</p>

<p>A public inquiry into events at the hospital unit will start to hear evidence in September.</p>

<p>Cheshire Police said Tuesday that a "complex and sensitive" corporate manslaughter probe into the hospital -- launched following Letby's convictions last year -- was ongoing alongside the original investigation into the ex-nurse.</p>

<p>It is "considering areas including senior leadership and decision-making to determine whether any criminality has taken place," Detective Superintendent Simon Blackwell said.</p>

<p>"At this stage we are not investigating any individuals in relation to gross negligence manslaughter," he added.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the continuing probe into Letby includes a review of 4,000 baby admissions during a four-year period when she worked at the Chester hospital and at the Liverpool Women's Hospital.</p>

<p>Detective Superintendent Paul Hughes said only cases "highlighting any medical concern" will be further reviewed.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak hit the campaign trail on Tuesday, the penultimate day of campaigning ahead of polling day on Thursday, urging voters to not "do something they regret" and warning against the Opposition Labour being handed a "supermajority".</p>

<p>All pre-election opinion polls indicate a strong mandate for the Labour Party, forcing the incumbent Rishi Sunak-led Conservatives on the back foot to caution voters against "Labour without limits" under the leadership of Sir Keir Starmer.</p>

<p>Both main party leaders are using the final two days of campaigning to zigzag as many parts of the United Kingdom as possible, especially where they hope there are still some undecided voters to win over.</p>

<p>"Once you make that decision on Thursday, there's no going back. Don't do something you might regret," posted Rishi Sunak on X, driving home his central message that a Labour-led government would raise taxes for everyone in the country.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Once you make that decision on Thursday, there's no going back.<br />
<br />
Don't do something you might regret.</p>
— Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak) <a href="https://twitter.com/RishiSunak/status/1808065633294204968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 2, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"You have 48 hours to put the brakes on a Labour supermajority that will put up your taxes," the 44-year-old British Indian leader, adding: "Stop the supermajority. Vote Conservative on 4th July." Speaking to the BBC, he said: "My point is if the polls are to be believed and Labour win a big majority, they will be unchecked and unaccountable to people and that will give them licence to put up everyone's taxes and make us a soft touch on migration when it comes to the entire European continent.</p>

<p>"I don't want people to sleepwalk into that. So, I'm fighting very hard for every vote. I want to continue in this job so I can cut people's taxes, protect their pensions and secure our borders." It came as the BBC's polling expert Sir John Curtice declared there is more chance of lightning striking twice in the same place, than there is of Rishi Sunak remaining Prime Minister come Friday.</p>

<p>"That's his view, that's not going to stop me from working as hard as I can over these final few days. I'll be out until the last moment of this campaign," reacted a defiant Rishi Sunak.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Keir Starmer, 61, has been keen to highlight that "every single vote counts" to counter any chance of disapproval among the voters who may feel the election was a done deal in favour of his party.</p>

<p>"There's tough yards ahead in terms of the inheritance if we come in to serve the country, almost everything is broken, nothing is working, nothing is better than it was 14 years ago. We need a strong mandate for that," he said.</p>

<p>In an interview with 'The Times', the Labour leader sought to make a virtue out of Tory warnings of "Labour supermajority" as he emphasised the need for a strong mandate to "seriously change" the country so that people would have "more money in their pockets".</p>

<p>Keir Starmer, who hopes to be in 10 Downing Street by Friday evening, stressed that a bigger majority "means we can roll up our sleeves and get on with the change we need".</p>

<p>The Labour Party has set out its vision as being focussed on creating more growth, driven by major planning reforms and skill overhauls and has denied plans to raise taxes across the board.</p>

<p>"The most important thing is growing the economy and wealth creation. I do think that's been the Achilles' heel for 13 years now. You can talk about public services but if you haven't got your economy working then you can't do that. If you haven't settled the planning, the infrastructure challenges, then you can't get your economy going," stressed Keir Starmer.</p>

<p>Both party leaders will use the last hours of campaigning to drive home their respective messages before polling booths open across the country at 7 am local time on Thursday. After they close at 10 pm local time, Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer will eagerly await results from the UK Parliament's 650 constituencies - needing 326 for a majority. Meanwhile, the traditional election night exit poll at 10pm will give them and the country a snapshot of what to expect nationally.</p>

<p>If opinion polls are to be believed, the incumbent Tories are in line to win anywhere between 53 and 150 seats, with Labour projected to win a landslide. Some polls even suggest a greater victory margin than when Tony Blair beat John Major in 1997, achieving a 179-seat majority and a total of 418 seats which remains the highest ever won by Labour yet.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

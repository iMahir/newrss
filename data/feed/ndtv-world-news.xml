       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanese militant group Hezbollah on Sunday aired an audio recording of its slain leader Hassan Nasrallah just over two weeks after an Israeli air strike killed him in southern Beirut.</p>

<p>"We count on you... to defend your people, your families, your nation, your values and your dignity, and to defend this holy and blessed land and this honourable people," said Nasrallah, who was killed on September 27, in a recording it said was made as he addressed the Iran-backed group's fighters during a military manoeuvre.</p>

<p>Many other senior commanders of the movement have also been killed.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said about 115 projectiles fired by Hezbollah had crossed into Israeli territory by Sunday afternoon.<br />
A Hezbollah fighter was captured emerging from a tunnel in south Lebanon on Sunday, Israel's military said, the first such announcement since the start of the ground offensive.</p>

<p><strong>'Shocking violations'</strong></p>

<p>United Nations peacekeepers on Sunday accused Israeli troops of breaking through a gate and entering one of their positions in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>It is the latest of several incidents the UNIFIL mission has reported since Thursday, leaving five Blue Helmets previously injured.</p>

<p>"At around 4:30 am, while peacekeepers were in shelters, two IDF (Israeli military) Merkava tanks destroyed the position's main gate and forcibly entered the position" in the Ramia area, before leaving 45 minutes later, said the peacekeeping force (UNIFIL).</p>

<p>On Saturday, several kilometres (miles) to the northeast, Israeli "soldiers stopped a critical UNIFIL logistical movement near Mais al-Jabal, denying it passage", it added.</p>

<p>"We have requested an explanation from the IDF for these shocking violations," UNIFIL said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military later said a tank "backed several meters into a UNIFIL post" while "under fire" and attempting to evacuate injured soldiers.</p>

<p>Netanyahu had earlier on Sunday called on the UN chief to remove peacekeepers in southern Lebanon out of harm's way, after the mission rejected requests to abandon their positions.</p>

<p>He said that the peacekeepers' presence had "the effect of providing Hezbollah terrorists with human shields".</p>

<p>Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned Netanyahu's call, saying it "represents a new chapter in the enemy's approach of not complying with international" norms.</p>

<p>UNIFIL, with about 9,500 troops, is in southern Lebanon under the longstanding UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which stipulated that only the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers should be deployed in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday called it "absolutely unacceptable" that UN troops are "deliberately targeted by the Israeli armed forces".</p>

<p><strong>Lebanon calls for ceasefire</strong></p>

<p>Earlier Sunday Israeli warplanes also hit a 100-year-old mosque in the village of Kfar Tibnit near the border, NNA said.</p>

<p>"It was a significant place because families used to gather in the square right next to it (the mosque) on special occasions," Mayor Fuad Yassin told AFP.</p>

<p>Hamas sparked the ongoing war in Gaza with the deadliest-ever attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The number includes hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza says 42,227 people, the majority civilians, have been killed since Israel's military campaign began there. The UN acknowledges these figures to be reliable.</p>

<p>In support of Hamas, Hezbollah started firing into northern Israel in October last year, triggering a near-daily exchange of fire until the war escalated in late September.</p>

<p>Netanyahu vowed to fight Hezbollah until Israelis displaced by the violence could return to their homes.</p>

<p>Since then, more than 1,200 people have been killed in Lebanon and a million others have been displaced, according to Lebanese officials.</p>

<p>Mikati said his government would ask the UN Security Council to issue a new resolution calling for a "full and immediate ceasefire".</p>

<p>In a visit to Baghdad ahead of Israel's expected retaliation for Iran's October 1 missile attack on Israel, Iran's top diplomat Abbas Araghchi on Sunday said Tehran was "fully prepared for a war situation".</p>

<p>He added: "We do not want war."</p>

<p>The Pentagon later said it would deploy a high-altitude anti-missile system and its US military crew to Israel to help the ally protect itself from potential Iranian attack.</p>

<p>In north Gaza, Israeli forces have for days essentially besieged an around Jabalia, with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, saying the fighting was causing more suffering for hundreds of thousands of people trapped there.</p>

<p>"For over a week there has been no hope, no water and no means of life," said local resident Muhammad Abu Halima, 40.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea's artillery units near the border with South Korea have been ordered to be ready to fire amid frictions over drones that Pyongyang says are being flown over the frontier, state media cited the government as saying on Sunday.</p>

<p>Some defectors and activists in South Korea fly aid parcels into the North and drop leaflets criticising leader Kim Jong Un.</p>

<p>North Korea has blamed the South Korean military for the practice. It has also been floating balloons with trash into the South in reprisal.</p>

<p>North Korean state news agency KCNA quoted the defence ministry's spokesperson as saying Pyongyang sees a high likelihood of more drones flying over the capital, with its military told to prepare for all scenarios including conflict.</p>

<p>On Friday, North Korea accused South Korea of sending drones into Pyongyang at night this week and last, and said the intrusion demanded retaliatory action.</p>

<p>Kim Yo Jong, powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, warned Seoul on Saturday of a "horrible disaster".</p>

<p>She said the blame lies with the South Korean military if it failed to identify drones sent by a non-governmental organization crossing the border.</p>

<p>South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it could not confirm the North's accusations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Pentagon said Sunday it will deploy a high-altitude anti-missile system and its US military crew to Israel to help the ally protect itself from potential Iranian missile attacks.</p>

<p>At the direction of US President Joe Biden, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin "authorized the deployment of a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery and associated crew of US military personnel to Israel to help bolster Israel's air defenses following Iran's unprecedented attacks against Israel on April 13 and again on October 1," Pentagon press secretary Pat Ryder said in a statement.</p>

<p>Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi warned earlier that there would be "no red lines" in defending the country's people and interests, but efforts would continue to "contain an all-out war in our region".<br />
Israel has vowed a response to Iran's October 1 missile attack which Tehran said was in retaliation for the killing of militant leaders in the region and a general in its Revolutionary Guards.</p>

<p>Araghchi arrived in Baghdad on Sunday for talks with Iraqi officials in Iran's latest high-level diplomatic efforts ahead of Israel's anticipated attack.</p>

<p>At a joint news conference with his Iraqi counterpart, Araghchi said Iran was "fully prepared for a war situation ... but we do not want war, we want peace."</p>

<p>He said Iran would continue consultations "to prevent the escalation of tension in the region and to work for peace and ceasefire" in Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

<p>Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said Baghdad was against a regional war spreading to Iran.</p>

<p>"The continuation of the war and its expansion towards the Islamic Republic of Iran and (Israel's) exploitation of Iraqi airspace as a corridor is completely unacceptable and rejected," Hussein said.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has vowed that his country's response will be "deadly, precise, and surprising".</p>

<p>After Baghdad, Araghchi will head to Oman, the Iranian ISNA news agency reported.</p>

<p>On Thursday in Qatar Araghchi met Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani for talks on the wars in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon.</p>

<p>Doha has been mediating talks aimed at a Gaza ceasefire and has also called for a truce in Lebanon.</p>

<p>A day earlier, Araghchi met Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his Saudi counterpart, Prince Faisal bin Farhan.</p>

<p>Tehran had said the talks were aimed at providing "better conditions" for Palestinians and Lebanese under Israeli attacks.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump, who is the Republican presidential candidate, said he spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu "like two days ago."</p>

<p>Trump was asked when last he spoke to the Israeli leader during a Fox News interview that aired on Sunday.</p>

<p>"Like two days ago and he came to my house in Florida, Mar-a-Lago with his wife who was lovely," he responded.</p>

<p>Trump met with Netanyahu at his resort in Palm Beach, Florida, in July. It was their first meeting since the end of Trump's presidency.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden also spoke with Netanyahu last week amid tensions with Iran. Their Wednesday call was the first known conversation between the two leaders since August. It coincided with a sharp escalation of Israel's conflict with Iran and the Iran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Trump called the lack of conversation between Biden and Netanyahu in nearly two months "pathetic."</p>

<p>"I can tell you that Bibi has been very strong," Trump said. "He's not listening to Biden."</p>

<p>Relations between Biden and Netanyahu have been tense, strained over the Israeli leader's handling of the war in Gaza and the conflict with Hezbollah. Israel has said it will pursue its military operations until Israelis are safe.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The United Nations said on Sunday Israeli tanks had burst through the gates of a base of its peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, the latest accusation of violations and attacks that have been denounced by Israel's own allies.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations said on Sunday Israeli tanks had burst through the gates of a base of its peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, the latest accusation of Israeli violations and attacks that have been denounced by Israel's own allies.</p>

<p>The UNIFIL peacekeeping force said two Israeli Merkava tanks destroyed the main gate of a base and forcibly entered before dawn on Sunday morning. After the tanks left, shells exploded 100 metres (yards) away, releasing smoke which blew across the base and sickened UN personnel, causing 15 to require treatment despite wearing gas masks, it said in a statement.</p>

<p>In its version of events, the Israeli military said militants of the Iran-backed group Hezbollah had fired anti-tank missiles at Israeli troops, wounding 25 of them. The attack was very close to a UNIFIL post and a tank that was helping evacuate the casualties under fire then backed into the UNIFIL post.</p>

<p>"It is not storming a base. It is not trying to enter a base. It was a tank under heavy fire, mass casualty event, backing up to get out of harm's way," the military's international spokesperson, Nadav Shoshani, told reporters.</p>

<p>In a statement, the military said it used a smoke screen to provide cover for the evacuation of the wounded soldiers but its actions posed no danger to the UN peackeeping force.</p>

<p>Five peacekeepers have been wounded in a series of strikes in recent days, most blamed by UNIFIL on Israeli forces.</p>

<p>The UN force said any deliberate attack on peacekeepers was "a grave violation of international humanitarian law and Resolution 1701" that established the mission.</p>

<p>Earlier on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a statement addressed to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres: "The time has come for you to withdraw UNIFIL from Hezbollah strongholds and from the combat zones."</p>

<p>"The IDF has requested this repeatedly and has met with repeated refusal, which has the effect of providing Hezbollah terrorists with human shields."</p>

<p>Hezbollah, which Israel has been battling on the ground in southern Lebanon since it launched an incursion at the start of this month, denies Israel's accusation that it uses the proximity of peacekeepers for protection.</p>

<p>The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah resumed a year ago when the Iranian-backed group began firing rockets at northern Israel in support of Hamas at the start of the Gaza war and has sharply escalated in recent weeks.</p>

<p>On Sunday, a drone attack wounded at least 20 people in the northern Israel town of Binyamina, N12 News television said.</p>

<p>'UNACCEPTABLE'</p>

<p>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, typically one of Israel's most vocal supporters among Western European leaders, spoke to Netanyahu by phone on Sunday and denounced the "unacceptable" Israeli attacks, her government said.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said he told Meloni that he regretted "any harm done to UNIFIL personnel" in Lebanon.</p>

<p>"Israel will make every effort to prevent UNIFIL casualties and will do what it takes to win the war," he said on X.</p>

<p>Italy has more than a thousand troops in the 10,000-strong UNIFIL force, making it one of the biggest contributors of personnel. France and Spain, which each have nearly 700 soldiers in the force, have also condemned the Israeli attacks.</p>

<p>The presence of UNIFIL puts peacekeepers from 50 separate countries in harm's way, in a force initially set up in southern Lebanon in 1978.</p>

<p>The area has seen decades of conflict, with Israel invading in 1982, occupying southern Lebanon until 2000 and again fighting a major five-week war against Hezbollah in 2006, which ended with a ceasefire monitored by UNIFIL.</p>

<p>Israel's assault against Hezbollah over the past three weeks has uprooted 1.2 million Lebanese and inflicted an unprecedented blow on the group by killing most of its senior leadership.</p>

<p>Lebanon's government says more than 2,100 people have been killed and 10,000 wounded in over a year of fighting, mainly over the past few weeks. The toll does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but includes scores of women and children.</p>

<p>Israeli officials say UNIFIL has failed in its mission of upholding UN Resolution 1701, passed after the 2006 war, which calls for the border area of southern Lebanon to be free of weapons or troops other than those of the Lebanese state.</p>

<p>US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in a call with Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant on Saturday, expressed "deep concern" about reports Israeli forces had fired on peacekeeper positions. He urged Israel to ensure their safety and that of the Lebanese military, which is not party to Israel's conflict with Hezbollah.</p>

<p>The Israeli military has already told UN peacekeepers to get out of the way, asking them weeks ago to prepare to relocate more than 5 km (3 miles) from the border, according to an excerpt from a message seen by Reuters.</p>

<p>HIGH ALERT</p>

<p>The Middle East meanwhile remains on high alert for Israel to retaliate against Iran for an October 1 barrage of long range missiles launched in response to Israel's assaults on Lebanon.</p>

<p>Iran said on Sunday it has "no red lines" in defending itself. Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi's comments appeared intended to counter suggestions that Iran would absorb an Israeli strike without a response, as it did earlier this year when Israel last struck Iran after a volley of Iranian missiles.</p>

<p>Later, Revolutionary Guards Aerospace Commander Amir Ali Hajizadeh said Tehran was ready to respond to any Israeli action, according to the semi-official Tasnim news agency.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[British climber Andrew Irvine vanished in 1924 alongside his climbing partner, George Mallory.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A documentary team has discovered human remains on Mount Everest that are believed to belong to a climber who went missing 100 years ago while attempting to summit the peak, according to a report by<em> <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/article/sandy-irvine-body-found-everest" rel="nofollow, noindex">National Geographic</a></em>. Due to climate change, melting snow and ice in the Himalayas is increasingly revealing the bodies of climbers who lost their lives in pursuit of scaling the world's highest mountain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>British climber Andrew Irvine vanished in 1924 alongside his climbing partner, George Mallory, as they attempted to be the first to reach Everest's summit, standing at 8,848 meters (29,029 feet). Mallory's body was recovered in 1999, but Irvine's fate remained a mystery until the recent discovery by a National Geographic team on Everest's Central Rongbuk Glacier. They found a boot containing a human foot, and a sock with a label that read "A.C. IRVINE" stitched into it.</p>

<p>This discovery could provide significant clues regarding the location of the climbers' personal effects and potentially resolve one of mountaineering's most enduring mysteries: whether Irvine and Mallory reached the summit before they died. If proven, they would have successfully scaled the peak nearly three decades before the first confirmed ascent in 1953 by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay.</p>

<p>"It tells the whole story about what probably happened," said Julie Summers, Irvine's great-niece, in an interview with National Geographic. She added, "I have lived with this story since I was a 7-year-old when my father told us about the mystery of Uncle Sandy on Everest. When Jimmy told me that he saw the name A.C. Irvine on the label of the sock inside the boot, I was moved to tears. It was and will remain an extraordinary and poignant moment."</p>

<p>The first documented ascent of Everest occurred on May 29, 1953, when New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Nepalese Sherpa Tenzing Norgay successfully reached the summit. Ten years later, in 1963, Jim Whittaker became the first American to achieve the feat.</p>

<p>Members of the Irvine family have reportedly offered to provide DNA samples to confirm the identity of the remains.</p>

<p>Irvine, who was only 22 years old when he disappeared, was last seen on the afternoon of June 8, 1924, along with Mallory, as they made their final push toward the summit.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Mallory's last letter to his wife was digitized and published online by Cambridge University. In it, he wrote that their chances of reaching the summit were "50 to 1 against us."</p>

<p>Irvine is believed to have been carrying a small camera at the time, and finding it could potentially rewrite the history of mountaineering.</p>

<p>"This was a monumental and emotional moment for us and our entire team on the ground, and we just hope this can finally bring peace of mind to his relatives and the climbing world at large," said Jimmy Chin, a climb team member and National Geographic explorer. Chin chose not to disclose the exact location of the remains to deter potential trophy hunters, but he remains hopeful that other artefacts, including the camera, might be nearby. "It certainly reduces the search area," he said.</p>

<p>Since the 1920s, over 300 climbers have lost their lives on Mount Everest.<br />

<p>But just a few days after her arrival in Beirut, Yassine began to regret her decision. Israel intensified its military campaign in Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah strongholds in the south, the Bekaa Valley in the east and the southern suburbs of Beirut, close to her home.</p>

<p>Although her area wasn't directly hit, the strikes were unnervingly close, and the boom of Israeli warplanes breaking the sound barrier overhead filled her with fear.</p>

<p>Anxious for the safety of her unborn child, the 36-year-old moved to an apartment closer to hospital where she was due to deliver.</p>

<p>"My doctors told me that I was too far along in my pregnancy to travel. I had no choice but to stay and deliver here," she told Reuters just hours after giving birth at Trad Hospital in central Beirut on Oct. 10.</p>

<p>Lying in her hospital bed, with her newborn girl nestled next to her in a crib, Yassine expressed her relief that both she and her baby were healthy - a very different experience to many expectant mothers in the escalating conflict in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Nicolas Baaklini, an obstetrician and gynaecologist in Beirut, says he has noticed an increase in premature births and foetal deaths since hostilities began last year.</p>

<p>"What has increased the most, and what was shocking to me, is the number of foetal deaths in in-utero babies who died in their mothers' wombs," said Baaklini, 61, who has a private clinic and also works in several Beirut hospitals.</p>

<p>"There are many malformations, and surprisingly, several colleagues have observed the same. When ... in one year, you have two foetal deaths in-utero, and then suddenly, in two months, you have about 15, it indicates that something is wrong," he added.</p>

<p><strong>MOTHERS FLEE THEIR HOMES</strong></p>

<p>Around 11,600 pregnant women remain in Lebanon, of whom around 4,000 are expected to deliver in the next three months, according to a flash appeal published by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in October.</p>

<p>Many of them are displaced and lack adequate shelter, nutrition and sanitation. Access to safe antenatal, post-natal, and paediatric care is increasingly difficult.</p>

<p>Since the war intensified in late September, the Israeli campaign has forced about 1.2 million people from their homes, according to the Lebanese government.</p>

<p>The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah militants erupted a year ago when the Iranian-backed group began launching rockets at northern Israel in support of Hamas at the start of the Gaza war.</p>

<p>Dressed in white scrubs in the neonatal intensive care unit of Trad Hospital, Baaklini stroked the tiny feet of a baby girl in one of the incubators. The baby and her twin brother had been delivered prematurely by a mother who had to evacuate her home in southern Beirut due to Israeli airstrikes.</p>

<p>He believed that the mother's early contractions were partly caused the stress of the bombardments and having to flee.</p>

<p>He said all the ICU beds were occupied, attributing this to the intensifying bombardments.</p>

<p>"It is not panic that makes you give birth," Baaklini said, as machines monitoring the premature babies beeped in the background. "It is the act of running, falling, and experiencing trauma to the abdomen that triggers contractions, leading to premature delivery."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX successfully "caught" the first-stage booster of its Starship megarocket Sunday as it returned to the launch pad after a test flight, a world first in the company's quest for rapid reusability.</p>

<p>The "super heavy booster" had blasted off attached to the Starship rocket minutes earlier, then made a picture-perfect controlled return to the same pad in Texas, where a pair of huge mechanical "chopsticks" reached out from the launch tower to bring the slowly descending booster to a halt, according to a livestream from Elon Musk's SpaceX company.</p>

<p>"Folks, this is a day for the engineering history books," a SpaceX spokesperson said in a voiceover on the company's livestream, after the booster was safely in the tower's grasp and company staffers had erupted in cheers.</p>

<p>"The tower has caught the rocket!!" SpaceX founder Musk posted on X.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Booster starts in top right corner. Watch to the end. Sound on <a href="https://t.co/jS70tHLNcr">pic.twitter.com/jS70tHLNcr</a></p>
— ?????? ???? ? (@kimbal) <a href="https://twitter.com/kimbal/status/1845451222750306344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Liftoff occurred at 7:25 am (1225 GMT) in clear weather. While the booster returned to the launchpad, the upper stage of Starship was due to splash down in the Indian Ocean within the hour.</p>

<p>During its last flight in June, SpaceX achieved its first successful splashdown with Starship, a prototype spaceship that Musk hopes will one day carry humans to Mars.</p>

<p>NASA is also keenly awaiting a modified version of Starship to act as a lander vehicle for crewed flights to the Moon under the Artemis program later this decade.</p>

<p>SpaceX said its engineers have "spent years preparing and months testing for the booster catch attempt, with technicians pouring tens of thousands of hours into building the infrastructure to maximize our chances for success."</p>

<p>Teams were monitoring to ensure "thousands" of criteria were met both on the vehicle and at the tower before any attempt to return the Super Heavy booster.</p>

<p>Had the conditions not been satisfied, the booster would have been redirected for a splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico, as in previous tests.</p>

<p>Instead, having been given the green light, the returning booster decelerated from supersonic speeds and the powerful "chopstick arms" embraced it.</p>

<p>'Fail fast, learn fast'</p>

<p>The large mechanical arms, called "Mechazilla" by Musk, have generated considerable excitement among space enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Starship stands 397 feet (121 meters) tall with both stages combined -- about 90 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty.</p>

<p>Its Super Heavy booster, which is 233 feet tall, produces 16.7 million pounds (74.3 Meganewtons) of thrust, about twice as powerful as the Saturn V rockets used during the Apollo missions.</p>

<p>SpaceX's "fail fast, learn fast" strategy of rapid iterative testing, even when its rockets blow up spectacularly, has ultimately accelerated development and contributed to the company's success.</p>

<p>Founded only in 2002, it quickly leapfrogged aerospace industry giants and is now the world leader in orbital launches, besides providing the only US spaceship currently certified to carry astronauts.</p>

<p>It has also created the world's biggest internet satellite constellation -- invaluable in disaster and war zones.</p>

<p>But its founding vision of making humanity a multiplanetary species is increasingly at risk of being overshadowed by Musk's embrace of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his alignment with right-wing politics.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, the company has openly sparred with the Federal Aviation Administration over launch licensing and alleged violations, with Musk accusing the agency of overreach and calling for its chief, Michael Whitaker, to resign.</p>

<p>"He's trying to position himself for minimal regulatory interference with SpaceX once Donald Trump becomes president," said Mark Hass, a marketing expert and professor at Arizona State University. "But it's a calculated gamble if things go the other way."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[When Pisciotta told West she had no memory of that studio session, West allegedly laughed.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kanye West's former assistant has filed a lawsuit, accusing him of drugging and sexually assaulting her during a studio session he co-hosted with Sean "Diddy" Combs. Lauren Pisciotta, who was employed by West from 2021 to 2022, claims in an amended complaint obtained by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/lawsuit-accuses-kanye-west-of-drugging-and-sexually-assaulting-ex-assistant-8727602" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>PEOPLE </em></a>that West committed "sexual battery" after giving her a drink that was laced with a substance.</p>

<p>Pisciotta's allegations are an extension of her earlier wrongful termination lawsuit against West, in which she alleged she was subjected to explicit messages, pornographic images, videos, and phone calls from him before she was fired. She began working with West in July 2021 to assist with his Yeezy women's fashion line and collaborate on his 2021 album, Donda.</p>

<p>Previously, a legal representative for West denied Pisciotta's other claims and stated that "Ye will be filing a lawsuit against Ms. Pisciotta."</p>

<p>According to the now-amended complaint filed on Oct. 8 in Los Angeles County Court, Pisciotta alleges that before her employment with West, he invited her to a studio session in Santa Monica, Calif., where "drinks were served to others in attendance, followed by an announcement that everyone had to drink if they wanted to stay."</p>

<p>The lawsuit claims that West and Combs co-hosted the studio session, and Pisciotta attended with a "former artist management client." Although Combs is named in the amended complaint as a co-host, Pisciotta is not accusing him of any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>The filing further alleges that the drink served to Pisciotta-allegedly by a studio assistant at West's request- was "laced with an unidentifiable drug," causing her to feel disoriented after just "a few small sips."</p>

<p>"As plaintiff began to slip into an altered and heavily impaired state, she felt less in control of her body and speech, and that is where plaintiff's memories of that night escape her," the complaint reads.</p>

<p>According to the filing, Pisciotta woke up the next day "feeling physically ill and confused" and experienced "immense shame and embarrassment" for not being able to recall what happened after drinking at the studio session.</p>

<p>For years, West's former assistant believed she had been drugged and humiliated herself at a work event. Later on, after West hired Pisciotta as an assistant, Chief of Staff, and A&amp;R representative, he allegedly brought up that night for the first time. During the conversation, West told Pisciotta that they had "kind of hooked up a little one time," referring to the night at the Santa Monica studio where the alleged assault occurred.</p>

<p>When Pisciotta told West she had no memory of that studio session, West allegedly laughed and remarked, "Women love to say they don't remember," according to the complaint.</p>

<p>"Up until that very moment, right before that very conversation, Plaintiff was unaware that she had been subjected to gender violence and sexual battery on that studio night by KANYE WEST a.k.a YE," the document states.</p>

<p>The amended complaint also states that Pisciotta felt "overcome with immense shame, discomfort, and utter disgust."</p>

<p>Additionally, Pisciotta alleges that in July 2021, during an "album workshop" at the St. Regis Hotel in San Francisco, West "aggressively pounded" on her hotel room door at 6 a.m., forced his way into her room, and claimed he needed to use her shower because his was out of order. She further alleges that West later approached her, "dropped his towel," and attempted to "forcefully thrust his naked body onto and penis into Plaintiff's face," ignoring her pleas to stop. According to the complaint, West then "swiftly left" after saying "sorry" and continued his day as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>The complaint also claims that Pisciotta, who alleges she received lewd messages from West and was fired from her Chief of Staff position at his companies just a month after her promotion in September 2022, "could not stomach the fact that she worked for the man who had sexually assaulted her while she was drugged, who then successfully lured her back into his orbit through a job opportunity to repeat the assault."</p>

<p>West is also facing a separate lawsuit filed in April 2024 by a former employee who claimed to have suffered "severe discrimination [and] harassment" while working for Yeezy and at his Donda Academy school. Additionally, a former staffer recently filed a lawsuit alleging emotional distress, retaliation, and labour code violations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's top diplomat vowed Sunday there would be "no red lines" for the country in defending its people and interests, ahead of Israel's expected retaliation for Iran's recent missile attack.</p>

<p>"While we have made tremendous efforts in recent days to contain an all-out war in our region, I say it clearly that we have no red lines in defending our people and interests," Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi wrote in a post on X.</p>

<p>Iran fired 200 missiles at Israel on October 1 in what it said was retaliation for the killing of Tehran-aligned operator leaders in the region and a general in Iran's Revolutionary Guards.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has vowed Israel's response will be "deadly, precise, and surprising".</p>

<p>Araghchi was in Baghdad to discuss the wars in Gaza and Lebanon with Iraqi officials, according to the ministry.</p>

<p>Ali al-Moussawi, political advisor to the Iraqi prime minister, told AFP Araghchi's visit was part of a diplomatic effort "to silence weapons and violence... to establish security and stability in the region".</p>

<p>After Baghdad, Araghchi will head to Oman, the Iranian ISNA news agency reported.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Araghchi was in Qatar where he met Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani over the wars in Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

<p>Qatar has been mediating talks aimed at a Gaza ceasefire and has called for a truce in Lebanon.</p>

<p>A day earlier, Araghchi met Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his Saudi counterpart Prince Faisal bin Farhan.</p>

<p>In a recent interview, Araghchi said Iran does "not want war" but it was "not afraid of it."</p>

<p>"We will be ready for any scenario," he told Al Jazeera news network.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a bid to connect with male voters ahead of the upcoming US elections, Democratic Vice Presidential candidate and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz participated in the annual Minnesota Governor's Pheasant Hunting Opener on Saturday. However, his trip took an unexpected turn when he struggled to load his shotgun, a Beretta A400.</p>

<p>Dressed in hunting attire, including chaps and an orange vest, Walz was seen struggling while attempting to load shells into the semi-automatic shotgun. “It never fits quite right,” he said in a video that quickly made the rounds online. Despite his best efforts, the governor was unable to fire the gun or bag any pheasants during the hunt.</p>

<p>Tim Walz, who once held a top rating from the National Rifle Association during his 12 years in Congress, has since shifted towards supporting stricter gun control measures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Initially, Walz held more conservative stances, earning “A” ratings from the National Rifle Association (NRA) while representing a rural Minnesota district from 2007 to 2019. However, after mass shootings like the 2017 Las Vegas tragedy, Walz distanced himself from the NRA, donating his NRA contributions to veterans' charities and advocating for stronger gun control measures.</p>

<p>As Minnesota's governor, he has supported universal background checks, red-flag laws, and an assault weapons ban, prioritising public safety over gun lobby positions. This has earned him criticism from the NRA, which labelled him a “political chameleon” for altering his stance as his political ambitions grew. However, groups like Everytown for Gun Safety praise Walz for balancing responsible gun ownership with common-sense safety laws.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese premier Li Qiang could inaugurate operations at a Chinese-funded airport in Pakistan's Balochistan province during his visit to the country in the coming week, information minister Attaullah Tarar told reporters on Sunday.</p>

<p>The start of operations at the $200-million Gwadar International Airport has been pushed back for a security review after deadly attacks by separatist militants in August in the area, government and aviation sources said.</p>

<p>Li, along with ministers and government officials will visit Pakistan from Oct. 14 to 17, Pakistan's foreign affairs ministry said on Sunday.</p>

<p>Pakistan is hosting the meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which comprises nine full members, including China, India, Iran and Russia, and is scheduled for Oct. 15 and 16 in Islamabad.</p>

<p>The new airport will handle domestic and international flights, according to Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority, and will be one of the country's biggest airports.</p>

<p>The initial plan was for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to inaugurate the airport on Aug. 14 alongside Chinese officials, but that was called off after an ethnic Baloch rights group started a sit-in protest, the officials said.</p>

<p>A decades-long insurgency in Balochistan by separatist militant groups has led to frequent attacks against the government, army and Chinese interests in the region to press demands for a share in mineral-rich regional resources.</p>

<p>Two Chinese nationals were killed in an explosion near the international airport of the southern Pakistani city of Karachi last week, the Chinese embassy in Pakistan said.</p>

<p>Separatist militant group the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack, which it said had targeted Chinese nationals, including engineers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>China said on Thursday it would work with Pakistan to protect the safety and security of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan.</p>

<p>Besides the separatists, the region is also home to Islamist militants, who have been active again since 2022 after revoking a ceasefire with the government.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military said on Sunday its troops in Lebanon had captured a Hezbollah operator, the first such announcement since it launched a cross-border ground offensive.</p>

<p>"During limited, localised and targeted raids based on precise intelligence... soldiers discovered an underground tunnel shaft," the army said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The troops encircled the building, scanned the tunnel shaft, and discovered an underground compound... where a Hezbollah terrorist was embedded alongside weapons and equipment."</p>

<p>The military did not specify when he was captured, while Hezbollah did not offer an immediate comment.</p>

<p>The army said that the fighter surrendered to its soldiers, who "interrogated him on-site and then transferred him to a detention facility for further questioning within Israel".</p>

<p>In a video clip released with the statement, a group of Israeli soldiers can be seen speaking in Arabic with the Hezbollah fighter as he slowly emerges from the tunnel.</p>

<p>"Come out before your life is over," the Israeli soldiers are heard calling to the Hezbollah fighter.</p>

<p>The fighter then asks the soldiers if they want a cigarette, to which one of the soldiers replies: "Cigarettes, coffee and $5,000."</p>

<p>The Israeli army launched a ground operation in southern Lebanon on September 30, carrying out "targeted raids" in the villages along the border.</p>

<p>The army says it has detected multiple tunnel shafts under homes, including one it said was about 25 meters long and crossed into Israel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A German neo-Nazi fell to his death while climbing Adolf Hitler's "favourite mountain" on September 29. Andreas Munzhuber, a senior member of the Bavarian faction of the neo-Nazi group The Third Way, was part of a climbing group of 30.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A German neo-Nazi fell to his death while climbing what is known as Adolf Hitler's “favourite mountain” on September 29. Andreas Munzhuber, a senior member of the Bavarian faction of the neo-Nazi group The Third Way, was part of a climbing group of 30 when he slipped on a wet root and plummeted 196 feet down rocky terrain, according to reports from German news outlets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Andreas Munzhuber's friends, along with two other climbers on the 1,972-metre mountain, quickly called emergency services after the fall. However, he was pronounced dead at the scene. An emergency rescue helicopter was dispatched, and a medical doctor was lowered to the site, but Munzhuber was already dead, according to the German publication Merkur.</p>

<p>Hitler had a fondness for Untersberg mountain, having chosen the area to build his Eagle's Nest retreat nearby, reported the Telegraph. This mountain has become a site of pilgrimage for fascist groups over the years. In 2017, a group was spotted performing Nazi salutes and shouting “Sieg Heil” at passersby. The following morning, the owners of the guest house where the group had stayed discovered beer mats decorated with swastikas.</p>

<p>Andreas Munzhuber was the treasurer and assessor of the regional association of the small right-wing extremist party known as The Third Way. He is said to have left behind a partner and a baby born in June.</p>

<p>The Prisoner Aid Friends Circle, a group that supports imprisoned neo-Nazis, along with other right-wing groups, said, “His death hits us all hard. I ask you to support a little girl who will never know her father,” as per the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/11/world-news/german-neo-nazi-plummets-to-his-death-hiking-hitlers-favorite-mountain/">NY Post</a>.</p>

<p>Right-wing extremist groups are now raising donations to support Munzhuber's wife and child, and to erect a memorial stone at the site of his death, according to German news reports. A tribute on a fundraising page seeking donations for his funeral said, "Munzi, as everyone called him, was only 37 years old and still had many plans in life. His death hits us all hard." It continued," But the biggest gap has emerged at the dinner table at home. His wife now has to raise their daughter alone."</p>

<p>"She is not yet four months old and was the sunshine of Munzi's life. She is the spitting image of Munzi. He will live on in her and in our hearts." As of Friday afternoon, around £10,000 (around Rs 11 lakh) had been donated to the page.</p>

<p>Andreas Munzhuber was described as a "senior board member" of the neo-Nazi group Der III Weg (The Third Way), according to German news outlet T-Online. The Third Way (Der Dritte Weg) was founded in the southwestern city of Heidelberg in September 2013 as an offshoot of the far-right National Democratic Party (NPD).</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The lawsuit claims that Brett Kimmel groped the student, pressured her to perform oral sex and attempted to have sex with her just before her 18th birthday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former Manhattan public school principal is facing a federal lawsuit alleging that he sexually abused a student "nearly every day," referring to her as "baby" and "princess." The lawsuit claims that Brett Kimmel who now lives in Maryland groped the student, pressured her to perform oral sex and attempted to have sex with her just before her 18th birthday, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/12/us-news/nyc-principal-sexually-abused-student-nearly-every-day-lawsuit/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>New York Post</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The court papers further claimed that the accused allegedly "set his sights" on the girl when she was in eighth grade at the Washington Heights Expeditionary Learning School more than a decade ago.</p>

<p>Kimmel sent the victim multiple inappropriate texts and emails every day during her freshman year, and later asked her to send him shirtless selfies, she claimed in her April Manhattan federal court lawsuit against Kimmel and the city Department of Education. The court papers further contended that the messages didn't stop even after the teen's older sister confronted Kimmel about his deranged notes in the summer of 2012.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She claimed that the principal used to drive her to and from school, molesting her during the car rides during her sophomore and junior years.</p>

<p>The woman claimed that her prolonged abuse was due to the Department of Education's (DOE) "negligent supervision," including a lack of staff and faculty training to report suspicious behaviour and ignoring students' comments about the abuse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to city payroll records, the Special Commissioner of Investigation for city schools had no reports on file for Kimmel, who earned $182,844 in the fiscal year 2015 and left the DOE in the fall of that year.</p>

<p>Years after the abuse ended, the woman decided to file a lawsuit "to hold the wrongdoer accountable so he doesn't get to do this again to someone else," her attorney, Julia Kuan, told The Post.</p>

<p>Kuan noted that the woman did not report the abuse to the police at the time but declined to elaborate due to client confidentiality.</p>

<p>Court documents indicate that she is seeking unspecified damages.</p>

<p>Kimmel, now working as an education consultant in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., denied the sexual abuse allegations through his lawyer, Alan Sash, and requested that the case be dismissed in court filings.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taiwan said it was "on alert" as it detected a Chinese aircraft carrier group to its south on Sunday, days after the United States warned Beijing against taking "provocative" actions on the self-ruled island.</p>

<p>US State Secretary Antony Blinken warned China on Friday against taking action in response to a speech by Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te during the island's National Day celebrations.</p>

<p>China has ramped up military activity around Taiwan in recent years, sending in warplanes and other military aircraft while Chinese ships maintain a near-constant presence around its waters.</p>

<p>Taiwan's defence ministry said Sunday that a Chinese Liaoning aircraft carrier group had entered the Bashi Channel, a waterway that separates the island from the Philippines, "and is likely to proceed into the western Pacific".</p>

<p>"The Taiwanese military is employing joint intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems to closely monitor related activities and remains on alert, prepared to respond as necessary," it said in a statement.</p>

<p>China's military meanwhile released a video on Sunday saying it was "prepared for battle", with a small map of Taiwan included in its title.</p>

<p>The video, posted on the People's Liberation Army Eastern Theater Command's social media channels, shows missiles, jets, helicopters, and warships. China's military was "ready for battle at any time" the post added.</p>

<p>Taiwan and US officials had warned of possible Chinese military drills in response to Lai's speech.</p>

<p>The United States is Taiwan's most important backer and biggest supplier of weapons, but does not hold formal diplomatic relations with Taipei.</p>

<p><strong>'Resist annexation'</strong></p>

<p>Lai, who took office in May, has been more outspoken than his predecessor Tsai Ing-wen in defending Taiwan's sovereignty, angering Beijing, which calls him a "separatist".</p>

<p>In his speech on Thursday, Lai vowed to "resist annexation" of the island, and insisted Beijing and Taipei were "not subordinate to each other".</p>

<p>China warned after the speech that Lai's "provocations" would result in "disaster" for the people of Taiwan.</p>

<p>Taiwan's National Day on Thursday marked the 113th anniversary of the toppling of China's Qing dynasty and the subsequent founding of the Republic of China -- which remains Taiwan's official name.</p>

<p>The current dispute between China and Taiwan dates back to a civil war in which the nationalist forces of Chiang Kai-shek were defeated by Mao Zedong's communist fighters and fled to Taiwan in 1949.</p>

<p>Lai's Democratic Progressive Party has long defended the sovereignty and democracy of Taiwan, which has its own government, military and currency.</p>

<p>Beijing has sought to erase Taipei from the international stage, blocking it from global forums and poaching its diplomatic allies.</p>

<p>China has held three rounds of large-scale war games in the past two years, deploying aircraft and ships to encircle the island.</p>

<p>Taiwan's defence ministry said Sunday that 11 Chinese military aircraft and eight navy vessels were detected around the island in the 24 hours to 6:00 am.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 32-year-old mother from Minnesota, US, has become the face of a rare and painful condition often referred to as "vampire disease." Phoenix Nightingale has a severe allergy to sulphur – a compound found in garlic – which can lead to potentially fatal reactions if ingested. "People call it the vampire disease," she explained in an interview with Jam Press.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This unusual disorder, known as acute intermittent porphyria, can cause severe pain, migraines, constipation and vomiting for days when triggered. This condition shares a historical connection with the legendary Count Dracula, as it is suspected that Vlad III, the inspiration for Dracula, also suffered from porphyria.</p>

<p>The condition has led to myths about vampires' aversion to garlic, sunlight and their pale appearance. Ms Nightingale said, “It comes from the legend about them needing to avoid garlic, having to stay out of the sun, looking pale and having receding teeth.” She adds that the neurological side effects of the disorder can lead people to mistakenly view those affected as “monsters or possessed," as per the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/11/lifestyle/i-have-the-same-rare-vampire-condition-as-dracula-garlic-can-kill-me/">NY Post</a>.</p>

<p>Due to her condition, Ms Nightingale is forced to strictly avoid foods containing sulphur. “Eating high amounts or over an extended period could be fatal,” she said. Symptoms can appear suddenly or develop over weeks, making it challenging to navigate her daily life. “I'm very careful about what I put in my body. I avoid a lot of food. I stick to what I know is safe. I can't even take most medications,” she shared.</p>

<p>Since her diagnosis, she has not eaten garlic, saying, “I could never eat garlic bread. It could send me into an attack.” The debilitating attacks can last for days, during which she may vomit up to 60 times, and can also lead to breathing difficulties.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I've experienced over 480 attacks in my life, searching for answers, desperate for a diagnosis that only came last year,” she said, adding that the pain is worse than childbirth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I had one attack where I didn't go to the hospital, and it went on for 40 hours. It was non-stop vomiting, losing consciousness, screaming, and crying.”</p>

<p>Dining out is an additional challenge for Ms Nightingale, as garlic is a common ingredient in many dishes. She avoids other sulphur-rich foods, including red grapes, soy, alcohol and coffee. “When I go out for dinner, unless it's a place I know, I look at a menu and I cry because I don't know what I can eat,” she confessed.</p>

<p>Ms Nightingale has chosen to share her story publicly to raise awareness about her condition and to support others who may be struggling with similar undiagnosed symptoms. “It took 31 years to get diagnosed, and I had to pay out of pocket and spend years running analytics on it,” she explained. “It's hard as a diagnosed person not being able to find a doctor who can help. When I see a doctor or go to the hospital, they have to Google the condition.”</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the 2024 US presidential race heats up, billionaires across the country are quietly taking sides, providing significant financial backing to either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump. While some, like Elon Musk, are vocal about their support, others, such as Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg, are opting to stay on the sidelines, despite rumours and speculation about their political leanings.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/12/kamala-harris-has-more-billionaires-openly-backing-her-than-trump-but-many-are-staying-silent/">Forbes</a>, 76 billionaires are backing Kamala Harris, while 49 billionaires have been identified as supporters of Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Many more billionaires may still commit to a candidate, but their contributions won't be made public until after the election when the final Federal Election Commission reports are released in December.</p>

<h3><strong>Why are billionaires leaning toward Harris?</strong></h3>

<p>Despite Kamala Harris's criticism of pro-billionaire policies, many ultra-wealthy individuals support her due to pragmatic reasons. A letter from more than a dozen billionaires endorsing Harris emphasised that she is expected to maintain “fair and predictable policies” that ensure economic stability. This resonates particularly well with Silicon Valley billionaires who have known Harris since her days as a California prosecutor. A recent survey also revealed that sectors like technology, healthcare and sustainability would thrive under a Harris presidency.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Kamala Harris backers</strong></h3>

<p>Among the 76 billionaires supporting Harris, 28 have donated $1 million or more to groups backing her. Here are some notable names:</p>

<ul>
	<li aria-level="1">Michael Bloomberg (Former New York mayor, Bloomberg)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Arthur Blank (Atlanta Falcons)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Vinod Khosla (Khosla Ventures)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Dustin Moskovitz (Facebook)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Steven Spielberg (Hollywood director)</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, 36 billionaires contributed between $50,000 and $999,999. Some of these include:</p>

<ul>
	<li aria-level="1">Tory Burch (Fashion designer)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Reed Hastings (Netflix)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Chris Larsen (Ripple)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Laurene Powell Jobs (Apple)</li>
</ul>

<p>Further, Melinda French Gates, Joe Gebbia (Airbnb), and several other prominent figures have financially backed the Democratic Presidential candidate. High-profile individuals such as Mark Cuban and Magic Johnson signed an open letter endorsing her.</p>

<h3><strong>Donald Trump's billionaire supporters</strong></h3>

<p>Trump, who has positioned himself as a champion of the ultra-wealthy and working-class alike, has garnered significant backing from 49 billionaires. Notable supporters include:</p>

<ul>
	<li aria-level="1">Miriam Adelson (Las Vegas Sands Corp.)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Don Ahern (Las Vegas construction)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Diane Hendricks (ABC Supply)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Linda McMahon (WWE)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Steve Wynn (Wynn Resorts)</li>
</ul>

<p>Another 16 billionaires have contributed between $50,000 and $999,999, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li aria-level="1">Tilman Fertitta (Houston Rockets)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">John Paulson (Paulson &amp; Co.)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Thomas Siebel (Siebel Systems)</li>
</ul>

<p>Trump's supporters also include tech magnate Elon Musk, who has actively stumped for him, appearing at a rally and offering incentives to swing state voters through his political action committee.</p>

<h3><strong>Billionaires staying neutral (For now)</strong></h3>

<p>While many billionaires are openly supporting either Harris or Trump, others are keeping their distance for the time being:</p>

<ul>
	<li aria-level="1">Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, has praised Donald Trump's resilience after he was shot but has yet to publicly endorse a candidate.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Warren Buffett is a known Democrat but has stayed quiet this cycle.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Mark Zuckerberg reportedly had private discussions with Donald Trump but has not endorsed any candidate.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Bill Gates has not officially endorsed a candidate. However, in a July interview, he expressed positive sentiments toward Harris, noting, “It's great to have somebody who's younger, who can think about things like AI and how we shape that in the right way.”&nbsp;</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank, has not endorsed any candidate, according to his spokesperson. However, last week, Trump shared a false social media post claiming Dimon's endorsement.&nbsp;</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, described the upcoming election as “the most consequential” of his life. Yet, he has not endorsed either Harris or Trump.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Sergey Brin, Google co-founder, who previously found Trump's election “deeply offensive” as an immigrant, has kept his feelings private during this election cycle, with no public statements regarding the current candidates.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Larry Ellison and Ken Griffin: These two billionaires have remained surprisingly silent in the final months leading up to the election, despite their past financial support for Republican causes.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>As the election approaches, more billionaires may reveal their preferences.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On October 7, 2023, Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, launched a devastating and unprecedented attack on Israel. The scale and brutality of the assault left more than 1,200 people dead, and hundreds taken hostage, plunging the region into renewed violence and sparking an all-out war.</p>

<p>While the attack appeared sudden and shocking to the international community, recently unearthed documents suggest that it had been years in the making and could have been executed even earlier, potentially launching strikes akin to the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Centre in the United States.</p>

<p>According to a series of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/world/middleeast/hamas-israel-war.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">reports</a> by international media outlets, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal, Hamas had originally planned the October 7 assault for the previous year. The group delayed the attack to coordinate with Iran and Hezbollah, seeking to strengthen their military capabilities and secure additional funding. These findings, drawn from documents and correspondences between Hamas leaders and Iranian officials, reveal meticulous planning, with ambitions that stretched far beyond the deadly events of October 7.</p>

<h2><strong>'The Big Project'</strong></h2>

<p>According to the findings, as early as January 2022, Hamas leaders had been discussing a large-scale operation, referred to in internal communications as "the big project." As per the minutes from 10 high-level meetings held by Hamas's military and political leadership over the course of two years, the group had been preparing for an assault designed to cripple Israel's military infrastructure and target its civilian population.</p>

<p>Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who played a central role in these discussions, was joined by top commanders Muhammed Deif, Marwan Issa, and his brother, Muhammad Sinwar. The meetings began in January 2022 and continued until August 2023, with participants discussing logistical strategies and potential targets. During one early meeting in 2022, attendees decided to avoid prematurely escalating tensions with Israel, instead focusing on the "big project," which would involve unprecedented coordination and resources.</p>

<p>But Hamas's ambitions stretched beyond Gaza. The group actively sought the financial and military support of regional powers, particularly Iran. As early as June 2021, Sinwar had written to Iranian officials, seeking financial assistance to fund what would eventually become the October 7 attack. "We promise you that we will not waste a minute or a penny unless it takes us toward achieving this sacred goal," Sinwar reportedly wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This request yielded an initial $10 million in funding, and later, Hamas asked for a staggering $500 million to be distributed over two years.</p>

<h2><strong>Change In Strategy</strong></h2>

<p>Though the attack was initially scheduled for late 2022, Hamas postponed it for over a year. According to documents obtained by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/10/12/exclusive-hamas-documents-sinwar-planning-iran/" rel="nofollow,noindex">shared</a> with The Washington Post, this delay was largely due to ongoing efforts to enlist more substantial help from Iran and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>In August 2023, Hamas's deputy, Khalil al-Hayya, allegedly travelled to Lebanon to meet with a senior commander in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Mohammed Said Izadi, to discuss the operational details of the assault. Izadi expressed Iran and Hezbollah's tentative support but said that they needed more time to "prepare the environment" for a broader regional escalation.</p>

<p>Though Hamas had hoped for more direct involvement from these regional actors, the group ultimately launched the attack without their immediate assistance. The precise reasons for this decision remain unclear, but the timing suggests several geopolitical factors. For instance, by mid-2023, Israel had been on the verge of deploying a new, advanced air defence system, which Hamas feared could thwart their assault if they delayed any further, the New York Times reported.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-06/j16pmol_hamas-reuters-_625x300_11_June_24.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Additionally, the warming relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia - a potential breakthrough in regional diplomacy - likely pushed Hamas to act before these ties could solidify.</p>

<p>The internal turmoil within Israel also played a role. By 2023, Israel had been grappling with mass protests and political unrest sparked by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's controversial judicial overhaul. Hamas leaders saw Israel's "internal situation" as a key vulnerability, reasoning that the state was distracted by its own domestic crises and, therefore, more susceptible to a major attack.</p>

<h2><strong>Plot For A 9/11-Style Attack</strong></h2>

<p>One of the most chilling revelations from these documents is Hamas's original plan to carry out a 9/11-style bombing in Israel, targeting the iconic Azrieli Towers in Tel Aviv, the Washington Post reported. These skyscrapers house offices, a shopping mall, and a central train station. The plan envisioned a devastating strike reminiscent of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, with the aim of toppling the towers and causing mass casualties.</p>

<p>However, after months of discussions, Hamas concluded that it lacked the capability to execute such an ambitious plan. The group scrapped the 9/11-style bombing, along with other audacious proposals, such as using horse-drawn carriages as a "fast and light mechanism" to transport fighters across Israeli defences without arousing suspicion.</p>

<p>By September 2022, Hamas leaders believed they were ready to launch their attack, beginning with strikes on Israeli military bases before expanding to civilian areas. However, the assault was again postponed. Sinwar and his top commanders continued to refine the plan, holding covert meetings with Iranian officials and planning a broader regional conflict, the reports claimed.</p>

<h2><strong>Element Of Surprise</strong></h2>

<p>One of the key factors behind the success of Hamas's attack on October 7 was its ability to mislead Israeli intelligence. For nearly two years, Hamas carefully cultivated the impression that it was more focused on governing Gaza and avoiding conflict with Israel. According to the documents, this deception was deliberate, with Hamas leadership frequently discussing the need to lull Israel into a false sense of security.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">

</div>

<p>In April 2022, after the Muslim holy month of Ramzan passed without major incidents, Hamas leaders expressed relief that they had been able to "camouflage the big idea." According to the findings, by avoiding skirmishes, Hamas convinced Israel that it was not planning a major offensive. The group continued this strategy throughout 2022 and 2023.</p>

<p>To ensure the success of this deception, Hamas kept its plans tightly compartmentalised. Only a select few of its senior commanders, including Sinwar and Ismail Haniyeh, the group's political leader in Qatar, who was recently killed in Tehran, were privy to the full extent of the attack plans. Lower-ranking operatives were not informed until mere hours before the assault, the findings claim.</p>

<h2><strong>The Decision To Strike</strong></h2>

<p>After years of planning and months of preparation, Hamas finally decided to strike on October 7, 2023. The timing was significant: it coincided with Simhat Torah, a Jewish holiday when Israel would be vulnerable due to holiday observances and lower military readiness. The group debated launching the attack earlier, on Yom Kippur in late September, but ultimately chose Simhat Torah as the optimal moment, the findings claim.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the morning of October 7, Hamas militants crossed into southern Israel, executing a devastating multi-pronged attack. The group's fighters targeted Israeli military bases, and civilian communities, and took hundreds of hostages, many of whom remain in captivity in Gaza.</p>

<p>While Hamas launched the attack without the immediate participation of its regional allies, the conflict quickly escalated beyond Gaza's borders. Within 24 hours of the assault, Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militant group based in Lebanon, began firing missiles at Israeli positions along the northern border. This opened a second front in the conflict, with the possibility of further escalation involving Iran and its regional proxies.</p>

<h2><strong>What Iran Said&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>The extent of Iran and Hezbollah's involvement in the October 7 attack remains a subject of debate. Iranian leaders have denied direct involvement, with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stating that Tehran was not responsible for the planning or execution of the assault. US and Israeli intelligence agencies have also suggested that key Iranian officials may have been caught off-guard by the timing of the attack.</p>

<p>Iran's permanent mission to the United Nations in New York rejected the claims linking Tehran to Hamas' October 7 surprise attack.</p>

<p>The Iranian mission responded to questions from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, saying, "While Hamas officials based in (the Qatari capital) Doha have announced that they had no information about the operation and solely Hamas' military wing based in Gaza had been responsible for the planning, deciding about and directing the operation, any claim aiming to partially or entirely link the operation to Iran or Hezbollah is invalid and comes from fabricated documents."&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX's next test flight of its Starship megarocket this Sunday could mark a world first: catching the returning first-stage booster using the launch tower's "chopstick" arms -- a crucial step in the company's quest for rapid reusability.</p>

<p>The launch window opens at 7:00 am (1200 GMT) from the company's Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas. A live webcast will be carried on SpaceX's website and its X account.</p>

<p>During its last flight in June, SpaceX achieved its <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/spacexs-megarocket-starship-nails-historic-ocean-splashdown-5835757" target="_blank">first successful splashdown in the Indian Ocean</a> with the upper stage of Starship, a prototype spaceship that the company's founder Elon Musk hopes will one day carry humanity to Mars.</p>

<p>NASA is also keenly awaiting a modified version of Starship to act as a lander vehicle for crewed flights to the Moon under the Artemis program later this decade.</p>

<p>The primary objectives for Sunday's test, Starship's fifth, will be attempting "the first ever return to launch site and catch of the Super Heavy booster, and another Starship reentry and landing burn, aiming for an on-target splashdown of Starship in the Indian Ocean," SpaceX said in a statement.</p>

<p>The company added that its engineers have "spent years preparing and months testing for the booster catch attempt, with technicians pouring tens of thousands of hours into building the infrastructure to maximize our chances for success."</p>

<p>Teams will be monitoring to ensure "thousands" of criteria are met both on the vehicle and at the tower before any attempt to return the Super Heavy booster to the tower and "catch" it.</p>

<p>If these conditions aren't satisfied, the booster will be redirected for a splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico, as in previous tests.</p>

<p>But if things do go to plan, the returning booster will decelerate from supersonic speeds, generating audible sonic booms around the landing site, and the powerful "chopstick arms" will embrace it as it descends about seven minutes after launch.</p>

<p><strong>'Fail fast, learn fast'</strong></p>

<p>The large mechanical arms, called "chopsticks" and even "Mechazilla" by Musk, have generated considerable excitement among space enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Starship stands 397 feet (121 meters) tall with both stages combined -- about 90 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty.</p>

<p>Its Super Heavy booster, which is 233 feet tall, produces 16.7 million pounds (74.3 Meganewtons) of thrust, about twice as powerful as the Saturn V rockets used during the Apollo missions.</p>

<p>SpaceX's "fail fast, learn fast" strategy of rapid iterative testing, even when its rockets blow up spectacularly, has ultimately accelerated development and contributed to the company's success.</p>

<p>Founded only in 2002, it quickly leapfrogged aerospace industry giants and is now the world leader in orbital launches, besides providing the only US spaceship currently certified to carry astronauts.</p>

<p>It has also created the world's biggest internet satellite constellation -- invaluable in disaster and war zones.</p>

<p>But its founding vision of making humanity a multiplanetary species is increasingly at risk of being overshadowed by Musk's embrace of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his alignment with right-wing politics.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, the company has openly sparred with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) over launch licensing and alleged violations, with Musk accusing the agency of overreach and calling for its chief, Michael Whitaker, to resign.</p>

<p>"He's trying to position himself for minimal regulatory interference with SpaceX once Donald Trump becomes president," said Mark Hass, a marketing expert and professor at Arizona State University. "But it's a calculated gamble if things go the other way."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

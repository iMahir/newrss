       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fuel tanker explosion in northern Nigeria has killed at least 94 people and left 50 injured, police said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Many of the victims had been trying to collect fuel spilt on the road after the tanker crashed in northern Jigawa state late on Tuesday, police spokesman Lawan Shiisu Adam told AFP.</p>

<p>The tanker had veered to avoid colliding with a truck in the town of Majia, he said.</p>

<p>"We have so far confirmed 94 people dead and around 50 injured," he said, warning the death count could rise.</p>

<p>Following the crash, residents crowded around the vehicle, collecting fuel that had spilled on the road and in drains, Adam said.</p>

<p>He said the residents had "overwhelmed" officers trying to stop them.</p>

<p>The Nigerian Medical Association has urged doctors to rush to nearby emergency rooms to help with the influx of patients.</p>

<p>Fuel tanker explosions are common in Africa's most populous nation, where roads can be poorly maintained and residents often look to siphon off fuel following accidents.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A giant sphere 700 m (2,300 ft) underground with thousands of light-detecting tubes will be sealed in a 12-storey cylindrical pool of water in coming months for an experiment that will shine new light on elusive subatomic particles known as neutrinos.</p>

<p>After years of construction, the $300 million Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) in China's southern Guangdong province will soon start gathering data on neutrinos, a product of nuclear reactions, to help solve one of the biggest mysteries in particle physics.</p>

<p>Every second, trillions of extremely small neutrinos pass through matter, including the human body. In mid-flight, a neutrino, of which there are three known varieties, could transform into other types. Determining which types are the lightest and the heaviest would offer clues to subatomic processes during the early days of the universe and to explaining why matter is the way it is.</p>

<p>To that end, Chinese physicists and collaborating scientists from all over the world will analyse the data on neutrinos emitted by two nearby Guangdong nuclear power plants for up to six years.</p>

<p>JUNO would also be able to observe neutrinos from the sun, gaining a real-time view of solar processes. It could also study neutrinos given off by the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in the Earth to better understand mantle convection driving tectonic plates.</p>

</div>

<p>Due to go operational in the latter half of 2025, JUNO will outpace the far larger Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) under construction in the United States. DUNE, backed by the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) under the US Department of Energy's (DOE) top particle physics laboratory, Fermilab, will come online around 2030.</p>

<p>The race to understand neutrinos and advance the study of particle physics, which has transformed medical imaging technologies and developed new energy sources, intensified when the DOE abruptly cut funding for U.S. institutes collaborating on JUNO. It instead focused on building DUNE, which has since been plagued by delays and budget overruns, with costs skyrocketing to more than $3 billion.</p>

<p>"China had supported Fermilab's LBNF at the time, but later the cooperation could not continue," Wang Yifang, chief scientist and project manager of JUNO, told Reuters during a recent government-backed media tour of the facility.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">Chinese physicists and collaborating scientists from all over the world will analyse the data on neutrinos.</p>
</div>

<p>"Around 2018-2019, the US DOE asked all national laboratories not to cooperate with China, so Fermilab was forced to stop working with us."</p>

<p>The DOE, the largest US funding agency for particle physics, did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.</p>

<p>Sino-US tensions have risen sharply over the past decade. A trade war erupted during the Trump administration and President Joe Biden later cracked down on the sale of advanced technology to China.</p>

<p>In August, a bilateral science and technology cooperation pact signed in 1979 lapsed, potentially pushing more scientists to seek alternative partners, creating duplication in research and missing out on collaboration that otherwise might have led to beneficial discoveries.</p>

<p>In the 2010s, the countries jointly produced a nuclear reactor that could use low-enriched uranium, minimising the risk of any fuel being weaponised.</p>

<p>China's foreign ministry said Beijing was "in communication" with Washington about the lapsed science agreement. The U.S. State Department did not comment.</p>

<h2><strong>SOLE US COLLABORATOR</strong></h2>

<p>Institutions collaborating on JUNO hail from locations including France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the US, and even self-governed Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory.</p>

<p>Neutrino observatories are also being constructed in other places.</p>

<p>"The one in the US will be six years behind us. And the one in the France and in Japan, they will be two or three years later than us. So we believe that we can get the result of mass hierarchy (of neutrinos) ahead of everybody," Wang said.</p>

<p>So far, real-life neutrino applications remain a distant prospect. Some scientists have mulled the possibility of relaying long-distance messages via neutrinos, which pass through solid matter such as the Earth at near light speed.</p>

<p>Researchers are keeping their distance from politics to focus on the science, although they remain at the mercy of governments providing the funding.</p>

<p>One US group remains in JUNO, backed by the National Science Foundation, which recently renewed its funding for its collaboration for another three years, the group's leading physicist told Reuters.</p>

<p>In contrast, more than a dozen US institutes participated in the predecessor to JUNO, the Daya Bay experiment, also in Guangdong.</p>

<p>"Despite any political differences, I believe that through our collaboration on this scientific endeavour, we are setting a positive example that may contribute, even in a small way, to bringing our countries closer together," said J. Pedro Ochoa-Ricoux of the University of California, Irvine.</p>

<h3><strong>DATA INTEGRITY</strong></h3>

<p>The passage of neutrinos from the two power stations will be logged by JUNO's 600 metric ton spherical detector, which will immediately transmit the data to Beijing electronically. The data will be simultaneously relayed to Russia, France and Italy, where it can be accessed by all of the collaborating institutions, said Cao Jun, JUNO's deputy manager.</p>

<p>Data integrity has been a concern among foreign companies in China since a law was enacted in 2021 on the use, storage and transfer of data in the name of safeguarding national security.</p>

<p>"We have a protocol to make sure that no data is missing," Cao said.</p>

<p>For data on the more crucial aspects of the experiment, at least two independent teams will conduct analyses, with their results cross-checked.</p>

<p>"When these two groups get a consistent result, we can publish it," Cao said.</p>

<p>US-based Ochoa-Ricoux, who previously collaborated on China's Daya Bay experiment, will lead the data analysis for JUNO. He will also be involved in the DUNE data analysis.</p>

<p>"We welcome the Americans," said Wang, also director of the Institute of High Energy Physics, the Chinese counterpart of Fermilab.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dynamiting inter-Korea roads and railways. Threatening war over drone incursions. Moving nuclear-capable weapons to the border. North Korea appears very unhappy with the South at the moment -- but why?&nbsp;</p>

<p>What we know:&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What has changed?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>For decades, North Korea was officially committed to reunification, and in their constitutions, both North and South Korea claim sovereignty over the whole of the peninsula.</p>

<p>But in January, the North's leader Kim Jong Un declared South Korea his "principal enemy", cut all communications to an "irretrievable level", and had mentions of "reconciliation" or "fellow countrymen" scrubbed from record.</p>

<p>Since then, the North has ramped up weapons testing, bombarded the South with trash-carrying balloons, threatened war over drone incursions, and blown up roads and railways connecting the countries.</p>

<p>"North Korea is simply following through on what they said they would do," Lim Eul-chul, a professor at Kyungnam University, told AFP.</p>

<p>"It seems to reflect the North's determination to completely eliminate any premise of 'unification by absorption' into the South."</p>

<p>Kim even said recently that his country was no longer interested in "liberating the South".</p>

<p><strong>Why now?</strong></p>

<p>It might be the weather.</p>

<p>Swathes of North Korea were hit by devastating floods this summer that destroyed thousands of homes and farms, killing and displacing people.</p>

<p>Pyongyang could have orchestrated this latest round of conflict with the South to deflect from growing domestic discontent, Seoul officials have said.</p>

<p>The North's claims that Seoul flew drones over Pyongyang -- a major security breach -- have appeared on the front pages of the country's tightly controlled state media.</p>

<p>This is a bid to rally "North Korean citizens, who have grown weary of the fake dictatorship of the Kim family", South Korea's military has said.</p>

<p>Seoul's national security adviser Shin Won-sik said "North Korea is escalating tensions in order to tighten its grip over its unstable internal affairs".</p>

<p>"North Korea is a regime that, paradoxically, maintains its stability by the existence of external threats to its system," he added in a state broadcast interview.</p>

<p><strong>What about the drones?</strong></p>

<p>The North says South Korea's military has been flying drones over the capital Pyongyang to drop anti-regime propaganda -- a "remarkable" development which "showcases one of the pathways through which we could see a serious bout of escalation between the two countries," US-based analyst Ankit Panda told AFP.</p>

<p>North Korea, which lacks robust air defences, is insecure about the incursions.</p>

<p>"Drones over their national capital could provide the kind of reconnaissance in a time of war that would allow the South Koreans to strike directly at Kim Jong Un himself," he said.</p>

<p>Cheong Seong-chang, director of the Korean peninsula strategy at Sejong Institute, said the reports suggest "the breach was detected in the airspace above the headquarters of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea".</p>

<p>"The North Korean leadership would have been greatly shocked," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Even if these drones were just dropping propaganda rather than seeking to locate Kim's office, it is still a problem as the country regards all "foreign content as a subversive threat", said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul.</p>

<p>But Seoul's military has pointed out that the North has repeatedly sent drones into the South -- including to Seoul's district of Yongsan, where the presidential compound is located, in 2022.</p>

<p><strong>Is Russia involved?</strong></p>

<p>Historic allies Russia and North Korea have drawn ever closer since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022.</p>

<p>Seoul claims Kim has been shipping arms to Moscow to use against Kyiv, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently accused the North of sending troops to Russia's army.</p>

<p>After the North blew up inter-Korean roads and railways, ally China urged all sides to avoid escalation. But Russia blames Seoul for the drones, saying it was a "gross encroachment on the sovereignty" of North Korea.</p>

<p>"Russia and North Korea are not only engaging in sanctions-violating military trade and reviving Cold War-era diplomatic commitments," said Easley.</p>

<p>"They are also reinforcing and amplifying each other's political propaganda in attempts to justify and normalise their pariah state behaviour."</p>

<p><strong>Have they done this before?</strong></p>

<p>North and South Korea have long been locked in cycles of escalation, and Pyongyang has repeatedly blown up key infrastructure in the past to make foreign policy points.</p>

<p>In 2008, it blew up a cooling tower at a nuclear complex after the United States agreed to remove Pyongyang from its list of states that sponsor terrorism.</p>

<p>In 2018, after it signed a tension-reducing military deal with the South, it simultaneously detonated 10 guard posts.</p>

<p>After diplomatic outreach broke down, it then blew up a liaison office in 2020, largely out of frustration that activists in the South were sending balloons carrying anti-regime propaganda leaflets across the border.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The group, targeting men from Taiwan to Singapore and as far away as India, used AI-powered deepfakes to run a fraudulent cryptocurrency platform.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Globally, there is an increase in online and phone frauds. These frauds frequently include impersonation, emotional manipulation, and promises of quick gains. Deepfake technology has given these schemes a new dimension, resulting in incredibly convincing fake identities and movies.</p>

<p>According to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/15/asia/hong-kong-deepfake-romance-scam-intl-hnk/index.html"><em>CNN,</em></a> men had fallen prey to a romance scam that used deepfake artificial intelligence to lure its victims into parting with more than $46 million. In a news conference Monday, Hong Kong police in the Asian financial hub announced the arrests of more than two dozen members of the alleged scam ring, which they say targeted men from Taiwan to Singapore and as far away as India.</p>

<p>Police said the 21 men and six women were held on charges including conspiracy to defraud following a raid on the gang's alleged operating centre at a 4,000-square-foot industrial unit in the city's Hung Hom district.</p>

<p>As per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/15/asia/hong-kong-deepfake-romance-scam-intl-hnk/index.html"><em>the report</em></a>, aged 21 to 34, the suspects were mostly well-educated, with many of them digital media and technology graduates allegedly recruited by the gang after attending local universities, police said. The suspects allegedly worked with IT specialists overseas to build a fake cryptocurrency platform, where the victims were coerced to make investments, police added.</p>

<p>Deepfakes are comprised of realistic fake video, audio, and other content created with the help of AI. The technology is being increasingly adopted by a variety of bad actors, from people wishing to spread convincing disinformation to online scammers.</p>

<p>These scams can have major financial and emotional effects, so it's critical to be aware of the dangers and take precautions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foreign Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/cooperation-must-be-on-mutual-respect-says-s-jaishankar-in-pakistan-6800735">S Jaishankar</a> flagged concerns over terrorism and extremism at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)'s meeting of the Heads of Government in Islamabad. In a veiled message to Pakistan, he said that cooperation in areas like trade is unlikely to flourish if cross-border activities are characterised by terrorism.</p>

<p><strong>Here are the top 5 quotes from S Jaishankar's speech at the SCO summit:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>"It (SCO) should recognise territorial integrity and sovereignty. It must be built on genuine partnerships, not unilateral agendas. It cannot progress if we cherry-pick global practices, especially of trade and transit."</li>
	<li>"If activities across borders are characterised by terrorism, extremism, and separatism, they are hardly likely to encourage trade, energy flows, connectivity and people-to-people exchanges in parallel."</li>
	<li>"If trust is lacking or cooperation inadequate if friendship has fallen short and good neighbourliness is missing somewhere, there are surely reasons to introspect and causes to address."</li>
	<li>"We meet at a difficult time in world affairs. Two major conflicts are underway, each with its own global repercussions. Covid pandemic has left many in the developing world deeply devastated," he said."</li>
	<li>"Disruptions of various kinds - ranging from extreme climate events to supply chain uncertainties and financial volatility - are impacting growth and development."</li>

<p>"The five bodies have been retrieved through a long line rescue, and were brought to the base camp," Nima Nuru Sherpa, president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association, told AFP. "They are now being brought to Kathmandu."</p>

<p>Long line rescue is a dangerous operation used only when the terrain is too challenging for a helicopter to land, with a specialised rescuer attached to a rope.</p>

<p>As well as the helicopter pilot, the rescue team included two mountain guides and the long line rescue specialist.</p>

<p>Hundreds of people from around the world travel to the Himalayas each year for the autumn climbing season in Nepal.</p>

<p>The country is home to eight of the world's 14 highest peaks, and foreign climbers that flock to its mountains are a major source of revenue for the country.</p>

<p>Dhaulagiri's peak was first scaled in 1960 by a Swiss-Austrian team and has since been climbed by hundreds of people.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Legendary Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton's ship Endurance sank more than a century ago and its wreck lay undiscovered at the bottom of the Weddell Sea until March 2022.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Legendary Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton's ship Endurance sank more than a century ago and its wreck lay undiscovered at the bottom of the Weddell Sea until March 2022.</p>

<p>Now, the team behind its discovery has joined forces with an Oscar-winning film crew for a new National Geographic documentary showcasing how they located the storied vessel's last resting place.</p>

<p>"Endurance" features thousands of 3D scans shot by a 4K camera deployed to a depth of 3,000 metres (9,843 feet). It premiered at the London Film Festival last weekend before its release in cinemas and then on Disney+.</p>

<p>The never-before-seen footage captures everything from a flare gun and man's boot to dinnerware used by the crew and identifiable parts of the vessel.</p>

<p>"We were absolutely blown away," Mensun Bound, the 2022 discovery team's director of exploration, told AFP.</p>

<p>"We didn't expect to see the ship's wheel -- the most emblematic part of the ship -- just standing there, upright."</p>

<p>History broadcaster Dan Snow, an executive producer on "Endurance", called finding it in such a "stunning state" an "astonishing achievement".</p>

<p>"No one's ever found a wooden shipwreck 3,000 metres down in one of the most remote places on earth underneath the ice," he said.</p>

<p>"It's important because it is connected with this story of Shackleton and the 1914-16 expedition, which is one of the greatest stories ever told -- a story of leadership and survival like nothing else."</p>

<p><strong>'Takes the cake'</strong></p>

<p>Anglo-Irish explorer Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition was meant to make the first land crossing of the frozen continent.</p>

<p>But its three-masted timber sailing ship Endurance fell victim to the treacherous Weddell Sea, becoming ensnared in pack ice in January 1915. It was progressively crushed and sank 10 months later.</p>

<p>Shackleton, who died in 1922, described the site of the sinking as "the worst portion of the worst sea in the world".</p>

<p>He cemented his status as a legend of exploration by leading an epic escape for himself and his 27 companions, on foot over the ice and then in boats to the British overseas territory of South Georgia, some 1,400 kilometres (870 miles) east of the Falklands.</p>

<p>"I do believe of all the great survival stories I've ever heard of, this one takes the cake because it involves so many people," said Jimmy Chin, who directed and produced the new film jointly with Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi.</p>

<p>The husband-and-wife team behind Oscar-winning movie "Free Solo" saw the expedition organised by the Falklands Maritime Heritage Trust as a chance to "bring the story to a new generation".</p>

<p>The documentary alternates between accounts of the original and the 2022 missions, as the modern-day explorers conduct dozens of fruitless deep-sea dives using a state-of-the-art submersible as a deadline nears to leave before winter sets in.</p>

<p>Bound recounted the various challenges the latter-day team faced, including technology, research and climate, with one thing reminiscent of what Shackleton's men confronted.</p>

<p>"Ice, ice and ice," he said, adding that the documentary clearly highlights "the brutality" of the conditions they faced.</p>

<p>"This is probably the most difficult project I've ever been involved in... it wasn't called the unreachable Endurance for nothing, was it?"</p>

<p><strong>'Great payoff'</strong></p>

<p>Expedition leader John Shears also said there was a "real parallel" between the two endeavours and that like Shackleton he was drawn to "the ultimate polar challenge".</p>

<p>"More people have been into space orbit than have ever walked on the surface sea ice where the Endurance sank," said Shears, who previously led an unsuccessful attempt to find the wreck in 2019.</p>

<p>Chin and Vasarhelyi said combining the two stories was challenging but they were complementary.</p>

<p>"The two stories, even though they're separated by 110 years, speak to each other," said Vasarhelyi.</p>

<p>"They both chronicle this fundamental human condition of the audacity to dream big... have ambition, coupled with the diligence, determination, the grit and the ingenuity to see it through."</p>

<p>To tell the original story, they opted to use AI to capture Shackleton and six crew members' diary entries in their own voices, based on other recordings.</p>

<p>The filmmakers also used restored and colourised photographs and film expedition footage taken by Frank Hurley.</p>

<p>But audiences must wait until the closing stages of the documentary to see the new imagery of Endurance -- a choice Vaserhelyi admitted felt "terrible" but necessary.</p>

<p>"This was a great story with a great payoff, but you have to earn it, right?" she explained.</p>

<p>"What's nice is that the film really plays as this introduction... and it builds to this amazing moment."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>European Union countries that contribute to UN peacekeeping force UNIFIL in Lebanon have no intention of pulling back from the south of the country despite Israeli calls to do so, Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said.</p>

<p>Since an Israeli ground operation against Hezbollah militants began on Oct. 1, UNIFIL positions have come under fire and two Israeli tanks burst through the gates of one of its bases, the U.N. says. Five peacekeepers have been injured.</p>

<p>Sixteen EU countries, including Austria, contribute to UNIFIL and the recent incidents have sparked widespread alarm among European governments.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on the U.N. to withdraw UNIFIL "from Hezbollah strongholds and from the combat zones".</p>

<p>But Schallenberg, summarising a discussion among EU foreign ministers on Monday, said European nations were not minded to pull troops back or out.</p>

<p>"There was no debate about pulling back or whatever," he told Reuters in an interview in Brussels.</p>

<p>"They are there to stay but the security and the safety of our troops is paramount and has to be ensured by everybody," said Schallenberg, whose country has about 160 soldiers in UNIFIL.</p>

<p>European nations contribute about 3,600 troops to the 10,000-strong force.</p>

<p>EU contributors plan to hold a video call on Wednesday on their current posture and the longer-term role of the mission when it comes to troop levels, equipment and rules of engagement, according to European officials.</p>

<p>Israeli officials have said&nbsp;their forces are not deliberately targeting UNIFIL but Hezbollah has used peacekeepers' positions as cover for attacks and Israel has a right to respond.</p>

<p>Schallenberg said Israel had a right to defend itself against Hezbollah but even unintentional attacks on peacekeeping positions were a breach of international law.</p>

<p>"There's a clear demand on Israel to be very cautious on this," he said in the interview, which took place late on Tuesday afternoon.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ex-wife of Pakistan's former prime minister Imran Khan on Tuesday called for his immediate release, citing "serious and concerning" reports about his treatment in prison.</p>

<p>Jemima Goldsmith said the Pakistani authorities had stopped all visits to him by his family and lawyers, postponed court hearings, and prevented him calling his two sons since early September.</p>

<p>Electricity had been cut to his cell and he was no longer allowed out at any time, while the jail cook had been sent on leave, she wrote in a lengthy post on social media platform X.</p>

<p>"He is now completely isolated, in solitary confinement, literally in the dark, with no contact with the outside world," Goldsmith, who was married to the former Pakistan cricket team captain from 1995 to 2004.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">In the last few weeks there have been serious and concerning developments regarding my sons' father, Imran Khan's treatment in prison. The Pakistan authorities have stopped all visits to him by his family and his lawyers. They have also postponed all court hearings. In addition…</p>
— Jemima Goldsmith (@Jemima_Khan) <a href="https://twitter.com/Jemima_Khan/status/1846152372466094171?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>The couple have two sons, Sulaiman and Kasim, who live in London.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A panel of UN experts in July criticised Pakistan for arbitrarily detaining Khan in breach of international law to apparently prevent him for running for political office.</p>

<p>Khan, 72, was prime minister of Pakistan from 2018 to 2022, and has been embroiled in more than 200 legal cases since he was ousted in a parliamentary no-confidence vote he claims was orchestrated by the country's powerful generals.</p>

<p>He has been detained since August last year and barred from standing for office. He has since applied to become the next chancellor of Britain's Oxford University.</p>

<p>Goldsmith said Khan's family had also been targeted, and his sisters and nephew were arrested and jailed unlawfully, while she had faced rape and death threats from her ex-husband's political opponents.</p>

<p>The release of Khan, his nephew and sisters, plus the re-establishment of contact with his sons will provide "assurance first-hand that he is well and not being mistreated", she added.</p>

<p>"I disagree with IK on many political issues," she wrote. "But this is not about politics -- it's about my children's father, his human rights &amp; international law."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A wave of touching photos showing great moments in time is fascinating to amateur historians online. The problem? They are not real -- and may be clouding our view of the past.</p>

<p>Widely shared on social media, the atmospheric black and white shots -- a mother and her child starving in the Great Depression; an exhausted soldier in the Vietnam war -- may look at first like real historic documents.</p>

<p>But they were created by artificial intelligence, and researchers fear they are muddying the waters of real history.</p>

<p>"AI has caused a tsunami of fake history, especially images," said Jo Hedwig Teeuwisse, a Dutch historian who debunks false claims online.</p>

<p>"In some cases, they even make an AI version of a real old photo. It is really weird, especially when the original is very famous."</p>

<p>One photo shared on Facebook shows a pair of fresh-faced young men posing in front of an antique biplane: purportedly Orville and Wilbur Wright at the time of their first powered flight.</p>

<p>But those are not the Wright Brothers.</p>

<p>Real archive shots from the time show mustachioed Orville and his taller brother Wilbur in flat caps, looking nothing like the blond pair in the sepia-hued AI image.</p>

<p><strong>Hiroshima reproduction</strong></p>

<p>Among the images created using Midjourney, a popular AI online image generator, is a series of fake reproductions portraying the moment when the suspected assassin of president John F. Kennedy, Lee Harvey Oswald, was himself shot dead by Jack Ruby in 1963.</p>

<p>Other images on Midjourney purport to show the explosion of the atom bomb over Hiroshima in 1945, the invasion of Prague by Soviet-allied troops in 1968 and even a vision of the Roman Coliseum in ancient times.</p>

<p>"They often focus on events from too long ago to have been photographed or on moments that are poorly documented," said Marina Amaral, an artist who specialises in adding colour to black and white photographs.</p>

<p>"This creates a risk of false visuals being accepted as fact, which could, over time, distort our understanding of history and weaken public trust in visual evidence as a reliable source for learning about the past."</p>

<p><strong>Spotting fake images</strong></p>

<p>For now, Amaral and Teeuwissen believe they can still tell fake historical images from real ones just by looking at them.</p>

<p>AI-generated photos often have tell-tale glitches: too many fingers on a hand, missing details -- such as the lack of a propeller on the Wright brothers' plane -- or, on the other hand, compositions that are too perfect.</p>

<p>"AI-generated pictures can recreate the look, but they miss the human element, the intent, the reason behind the photographer's choices," said Amaral.</p>

<p>"They may be visually convincing, but they're ultimately hollow."</p>

<p>For Teeuwissen, "real photos are made by real people and there's usually something that's out of focus, or someone looks silly by accident, the makeup looks bad, et cetera."</p>

<p>But she judges it is "only a matter of time" before the quality of the AI image makes fakes hard to detect with the naked eye -- a "dangerous" prospect, she says, which would amplify disinformation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Indian engineer Sebin Saji has set a Guinness World Record by creating the world's smallest functioning washing machine, measuring just 1.28 by 1.32 by 1.52 inches.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sebin Saji has surprised the world with his extraordinary engineering skills by creating an offbeat gadget that a techie would not think of creating-the world's smallest functional washing machine. This little gadget measures 1.28 inches by 1.32 inches by 1.52 inches, making it smaller than a Tamagotchi digital pet, a popular handheld toy from the 1990s.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2024/10/worlds-smallest-washing-machine-unveiled-in-india-is-tinier-than-a-tamagotchi"><em>Guinness World Records</em></a> acknowledged that Saji's washing machine is the tiniest ever manufactured. Despite its microsize, the washing machine functions similarly to a standard-sized one; however, it is designed for exceedingly small loads. Saji's design has received attention for its precise craftsmanship, which demonstrates the possibility of miniaturisation in engineering.</p>

<p>According to the Guniess World Records, to qualify for the title, he had to design and assemble the washing machine and then demonstrate it could run for a full cycle: wash, rinse, and spin. He needed to use special digital callipers to measure it. Sebin is seen demonstrating his machine in a video, scooping up just a pinch of washing powder and pouring the water in before closing it up and setting it off.</p>

<p>A crowd had gathered to watch him show off his engineering skills, and applause broke out when the measurements were announced.And while it may be completely impractical for getting your washing done, it's a lot of fun. The world's smallest vacuum cleaner was also recently created in India, measuring just 0.65 cm (0.25 in) at its shortest axis.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two giant pandas arrived at the Washington zoo on Tuesday in the latest chapter in China's campaign of international "panda diplomacy."</p>

<p>Bao Li, a male panda, and Qing Bao, a female, were flown from Chengdu to Dulles airport in Virginia aboard a FedEx Boeing 777F cargo plane dubbed the "Panda Express," the Smithsonian National Zoo said.</p>

<p>The three-year-old bears were then loaded on to trucks and taken to their new home at the zoo in the US capital.</p>

<p>"Bao Li and Qing Bao exited their crates and began exploring their new indoor enclosures, in which keepers placed ample bamboo for the bears to eat," a zoo statement said.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">ICYMI: Two "treasures" arrived at the Zoo today! Join us in welcoming giant pandas Bao Li and Qing Bao, who entered Zoo grounds shortly after 11:30 a.m. today and are settling into their new homes at the David M. Rubenstein Family Giant Panda Habitat. <a href="https://twitter.com/smithsonian?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@smithsonian</a> <a href="https://t.co/gt8OfvpPXi">pic.twitter.com/gt8OfvpPXi</a></p>

<p>It said they will be quarantined for at least 30 days and will not go on public display until January 24, 2025.</p>

<p>"We're thrilled to welcome Bao Li and Qing Bao to Washington," said Brandie Smith, director of the National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute. "Today we joyfully celebrate a new chapter of our 52-year-long giant panda breeding and conservation program."</p>

<p>Only a few of the beloved black-and-white bears remain in the United States after almost all were returned to China in recent years under pre-arranged contracts -- including all three of the National Zoo's pandas last November.</p>

<p>The lack of immediate replacements was viewed by many as a symbol of the heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing.</p>

<p>China has been using so-called "panda diplomacy" since 1972, when the first animals were sent to Washington as a gift, following US president Richard Nixon's historic visit to the Communist nation.</p>

<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping said after meeting his counterpart Joe Biden at a summit in California last November that China could send new pandas as "envoys of friendship between the Chinese and American people."</p>

<p>In August, the San Diego Zoo welcomed two new giant pandas, the first to be sent by China to the United States in 21 years.</p>

<p>Renovations have been undertaken at the National Zoo's panda habitat "to enhance the safety of the facilities and maximize space for the bears to roam," according to the zoo's website.</p>

<p>The new structures constructed for the pandas include shallow pools to allow them to bathe and bamboo stands that require the bears to mimic the foraging techniques they would use in the wild.</p>

<p>A popular Giant Panda Cam will be relaunched once the bears make their public debut in January.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Coincidents are rare in diplomacy. It may be significant to keep a note of that as the issue of the killing of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar blows up between India and Canada. The timing of the allegations, each time, from Canada and the&nbsp;escalation of the row despite Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's domestic political troubles indicate that the actions may have been carefully thought through rather than being just a diversionary tactic, which it initially appeared to be. Here's why.</p>

<h2><strong>America Has Canada's Back</strong></h2>

<p>In the latest round of allegations, Canadian foreign minister Melanie Joly said about the Nijjar killing investigation that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) “gathered information that established linkages between the investigation and agents of the Government of India". It was this message that the Deputy Commissioner of Federal Policing, Mark Flynn, wanted to communicate to his Indian counterpart last week. When the attempts were unsuccessful, he met with officials of the Indian government, along with National Security and Intelligence Advisor (NSIA) Nathalie Drouin and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs David Morrison over the weekend.</p>

<p>The Canadian government's decision to expel the diplomats has been based on the RCMP's findings and was taken within a day of the stated meeting, where the NSIA was present along with his Indian counterpart, Ajit Doval, as reported by a US publication. What explains the hurry to present the evidence to India and then immediately act on it with expulsion? Could this have been prompted because the Indian enquiry committee looking into similar allegations by the US was visiting Washington DC just a day after Canada's action?</p>

<p>Now, turn the clock back to September last year when Justin Trudeau told the Canadian Parliament that Indian government agents possibly had a hand in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar outside a gurudwara in Surrey, British Columbia. Many were taken aback by the public announcement by Trudeau on a sensitive issue.</p>

<p>That Trudeau may have wanted to create a distraction from domestic issues only partly explained his action. What seemed more probable was the fact that he was possibly aware of the parallel investigations underway in the US. That Canada was sounded out by the US on the issue is now quite evident, even though what we know now is only that a Five Eyes country alerted Ottawa. Within 10 days of Trudeau's Parliament statement, the US released details of their investigations against Indian national Nikhil Gupta and an Indian government employee referred to as 'CC1' by the US Department of Justice, who plotted the foiled assassination bid on Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, another Khalistani extremist who lives in New York.</p>

<p>The unfolding of the events in September 2023 and today should give a clear sense that there is much greater coordination on this matter between the US and Canada than what meets the eye. Having America's backing on the issue can explain the steps that Canada has taken and the ones it has indicated when Joly did not rule out sanctions by saying that “everything is on the table”.</p>

<h2><b>Foreign Interference</b></h2>

<p>India has repeatedly raised the issue of&nbsp;Khalistan with Canada as a threat to its sovereignty and territorial integrity. With the killing of Nijjar, Canada is using the argument of sovereignty. The issue is also being conflated with the overarching concern over foreign interference. &nbsp;As a result, the matter has gained traction not just with the public but also politically from an otherwise adversarial opposition, the Conservatives. Pierre Poilievre said, “Any foreign interference from any country, including India, is unacceptable and must be stopped.”</p>

<p>A Parliamentary Committee report identified India as the second most significant&nbsp;foreign threat&nbsp;to Canada following China. The National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians report said, “In addition to interference against Canadian democratic processes and institutions by the&nbsp;PRC, India and to a limited extent Pakistan, other countries, notably Iran engaged in episodic foreign interference directed towards suppressing dissidents and critics in Canada. Known as 'transnational repression,' these activities represent one of the most egregious forms of foreign interference.”</p>

<p>The issue of foreign interference could be a prickly matter for any sovereign nation but more so for Canada and the US in the recent past with their concerns about China and Russia. Hence, this issue is one that generates fear or worry, and thus has the power to mobilise both public and political opinion around India.</p>

<p>Another Five Eyes country, Australia, had earlier reported about a "nest of spies" that was discovered by the Australian Security Intelligence Organization in 2020. Australian news channel <em>ABC </em>reported that “National security and government figures have now confirmed to the ABC that India's foreign intelligence service was responsible for the 'nest of spies', and 'a number' of Indian officials were later removed from Australia by the Morrison government.”</p>

<p>With these two broad factors – US backing and foreign interference&nbsp;– closely associated with the Nijjar killing, the Justin Trudeau government is making drastic and dramatic moves, but perhaps with the knowledge that any backfire will be cushioned.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[This study not only identifies the specific animals the lions preyed on but also provides clues as to why they targeted humans.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1898, two male lions in Kenya's Tsavo region gained infamy for killing several railway workers. These two male lions spent months terrorising workers building a railroad bridge across the Tsavo River, sparking tales of "man-eaters." Recent DNA analysis of animal hairs found inside the teeth of the lions has provided some real answers to not only what they were eating but also why they began attacking humans. The research works to debunk the myths that exist around the Tsavo lions while demonstrating unusual predatory behaviours, showing under which conditions wild animals may start hunting humans.</p>

<p>Researchers from the United States and Kenya used recent breakthroughs in technology for sequencing and analysing old and degraded DNA to analyse animal hairs lodged in lion teeth.</p>

<p>In a new study, researchers report on the exact species eaten by lions.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.sciencealert.com/human-dna-found-in-lions-teeth-confirms-a-tragic-legend-of-history"><em>ScienceAlert, </em></a>insight like this might help us not only fact-check stories about the episode but also better understand what could drive wild predators to behave so unusually.</p>

<p>The first reports of lion attacks began in March 1898, shortly after the arrival of Lieutenant-Colonel John Henry Patterson, a British army officer and engineer overseeing the project to connect the interiors of Kenya and Uganda with a railway.</p>

<p>The British had brought in thousands of workers to build the bridge, mostly from India, housing them in camps spanning several miles, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3810/3810-h/3810-h.htm">Patterson wrote.</a></p>

<p>Patterson initially doubted reports of two workers abducted by lions but was convinced weeks later when Ungan Singh, an Indian military officer accompanying him, suffered the same fate.</p>

<p>Patterson spent that night in a tree, promising to shoot the lion if it returned. He did hear "ominous roaring," he wrote, then a long silence, followed by "a great uproar and frenzied cries coming from another camp about half a mile away."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States has called on India to cooperate with Canada's investigation into "extremely serious allegations" linking "agents" of the Indian government with the killing of Khalistani terrorist and Canadian citizen <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/hardeep-singh-nijjar" target="_blank">Hardeep Singh Nijjar</a> in Vancouver in June last year.</p>

<p>At a press briefing in Washington, D.C. Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the US had made it clear that Canada's allegations "need to be taken seriously".</p>

<p>"When it comes to the Canadian matter, we have made clear the allegations are extremely serious. We wanted to see the Government of India cooperate with Canada... obviously they have not chosen that path," Mr Miller <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.state.gov/briefings/department-press-briefing-october-15-2024/" target="_blank">said</a> in response to a US reporter's question on 'round two' of the Delhi-Ottawa crisis.</p>

<p>The US - discreet since the row erupted in September last year - was similarly restrained Tuesday, only emphasising the need for cooperation between the two countries.</p>

<p>"I do not have any further comment beyond what the two countries have said publicly. We have urged them to cooperate and will continue to urge them to do so," Mr Miller said.</p>

<p>New Delhi has not yet responded to these comments but has repeatedly rejected the "absurd" and "motivated" allegations. Delhi has repeatedly asked for evidence and also pointed out the charges come as Mr Trudeau's popularity tanks before next year's general election.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr Miller also underlined the strength of India-US relations.</p>

<p>"India continues to be an incredibly strong partner. We've worked with them on a number of matters, including our shared vision for a free, open and prosperous Indo-Pacific, and, when we have concerns, we can take those concerns to them and have candid conversations..." he said.</p>

<p>The India-Canada crisis, simmering over the past 18 months, erupted in September last year after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused "agents" of Delhi of being involved in killing Nijjar. He claimed "credible information" had been <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/khalistani-terrorist-hardeep-singh-nijjar-justin-trudeau-pm-narendra-modi-us-envoy-confirms-canada-received-five-eyes-intel-against-india-report-4416628" target="_blank">shared with intelligence partners, including the US</a>.</p>

<p>India, though, has said it has not been presented with evidence to back the charges.</p>

<p>The September accusation led to tension that included a fierce response from the Indian side and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and a tit-for-tat expulsion of diplomats.</p>

<p>This week ties soured further after Royal Canadian Mounted Police said Indian government "agents" had colluded with organised criminal elements, particularly the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, to "target (Canada's) South Asian community... specifically pro-Khalistani elements".</p>

<p>That was followed by Mr Trudeau holding a press conference in which he backed the cops' charges and criticised "a fundamental error" - that India thinks it can "engage in supporting criminal activity against Canadians, here on Canadian soil".</p>

<p>"Whether it be murders or extortion or other violent acts, it is absolutely unacceptable," Mr Trudeau said, claiming also that his administration had "shared our concerns" with Delhi.</p>

<p>He said Canadian police had spoken to Indian government officials but been rebuffed.</p>

<p>The Canadian federal police's claims resulted by another round of diplomats being expelled from either side; this time Ottawa named India's High Commissioner, career diplomat Sanjay Kumar Verma, as a 'person of interest' in an ongoing criminal investigation and removed him.</p>

<p>A furious India retaliated by expelling Canada's acting High Commissioner, Stewart Wheeler, and five of his staff, and formally recalling Mr Verma and his staff over security concerns.</p>

<p>Nijjar - the mastermind behind banned terror outfit Khalistan Tiger Force - was on Delhi's list of 'most wanted' terrorists for multiple crimes, including the murder of Hindu priest in Punjab. Anti-terror agency NIA had offered a Rs 10 lakh reward for information leading to his capture.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Canadian Air Force aircraft is ferrying 191 stranded passengers of an&nbsp;Air India flight from Iqaluit airport to Chicago on Wednesday, a day after the flight was diverted to the airport owing to a bomb threat.</p>

<p>The aircraft departed from Iqaluit at 3.54 am UTC (9.30 am IST) and is expected to land in Chicago at around 7.48 am UTC (1.15 pm IST).&nbsp;&nbsp;Air&nbsp;India's Boeing 777-300 ER aircraft enroute to Chicago from Delhi was <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/air-india-delhi-chicago-diverted-to-canada-after-online-security-threat-6795199">diverted to the Canadian airport</a> following a bomb threat on Tuesday. It had&nbsp;211 people, including 20 crew members.</p>

<p>At least 10 Indian flights have received hoax bomb threats in the last 48 hours, an issue over which a Parliamentary Standing Committee and the Ministry of Civil Aviation will meet at 11 am.</p>

<p>Apart from the&nbsp;Air India Delhi-Chicago flight, the Dammam-Lucknow IndiGo flight, Ayodhya-Bengaluru Air India Express, a SpiceJet flight from Darbhanga to Mumbai (SG116), an Akasa Air flight from Bagdogra to Bengaluru (QP 1373) an Alliance Air Amritsar-Dehradun-Delhi flight (9I 650) and an Air India Express flight (IX 684) from Madurai to Singapore also received bomb threats on Tuesday.</p>

<p>On Monday,&nbsp;two IndiGo and one Air India flight received hoax threats.&nbsp;These included an Air India flight AI119 from Mumbai to New York's JFK Airport, and IndiGo flight 6E1275 bound for Muscat, and flight 6E56 heading to Jeddah.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Some of the most prominent artificial intelligence models are falling short of European regulations in key areas such as cybersecurity resilience and discriminatory output, according to data seen by Reuters.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some of the most prominent artificial intelligence models are falling short of European regulations in key areas such as cybersecurity resilience and discriminatory output, according to data seen by Reuters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The EU had long debated new AI regulations before OpenAI released ChatGPT to the public in late 2022. The record-breaking popularity and ensuing public debate over the supposed existential risks of such models spurred lawmakers to draw up specific rules around "general-purpose" AIs (GPAI).</p>

<p>Now a new tool designed by Swiss startup LatticeFlow and partners, and supported by European Union officials, has tested generative AI models developed by big tech companies like Meta and OpenAI across dozens of categories in line with the bloc's wide-sweeping AI Act, which is coming into effect in stages over the next two years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Awarding each model a score between 0 and 1, a leaderboard published by LatticeFlow on Wednesday showed models developed by Alibaba, Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta and Mistral all received average scores of 0.75 or above.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the company's "Large Language Model (LLM) Checker" uncovered some models' shortcomings in key areas, spotlighting where companies may need to divert resources in order to ensure compliance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Companies failing to comply with the AI Act will face fines of 35 million euros ($38 million) or 7% of global annual turnover.</p>

<p><strong>Mixed Results</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At present, the EU is still trying to establish how the AI Act's rules around generative AI tools like ChatGPT will be enforced, convening experts to craft a code of practice governing the technology by spring 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But LatticeFlow's test, developed in collaboration with researchers at Swiss university ETH Zurich and Bulgarian research institute INSAIT, offers an early indicator of specific areas where tech companies risk falling short of the law.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, discriminatory output has been a persistent issue in the development of generative AI models, reflecting human biases around gender, race and other areas when prompted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When testing for discriminatory output, LatticeFlow's LLM Checker gave OpenAI's "GPT-3.5 Turbo" a relatively low score of 0.46. For the same category, Alibaba Cloud's "Qwen1.5 72B Chat" model received only a 0.37.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Testing for "prompt hijacking", a type of cyberattack in which hackers disguise a malicious prompt as legitimate to extract sensitive information, the LLM Checker awarded Meta's "Llama 2 13B Chat" model a score of 0.42. In the same category, French startup Mistral's "8x7B Instruct" model received 0.38.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Claude 3 Opus", a model developed by Google-backed Anthropic, received the highest average score, 0.89.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The test was designed in line with the text of the AI Act, and will be extended to encompass further enforcement measures as they are introduced. LatticeFlow said the LLM Checker would be freely available for developers to test their models' compliance online.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Petar Tsankov, the firm's CEO and cofounder, told Reuters the test results were positive overall and offered companies a roadmap for them to fine-tune their models in line with the AI Act.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The EU is still working out all the compliance benchmarks, but we can already see some gaps in the models," he said. "With a greater focus on optimising for compliance, we believe model providers can be well-prepared to meet regulatory requirements."</p>

<p>Meta declined to comment. Alibaba, Anthropic, Mistral, and OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the European Commission cannot verify external tools, the body has been informed throughout the LLM Checker's development and described it as a "first step" in putting the new laws into action.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the European Commission said: "The Commission welcomes this study and AI model evaluation platform as a first step in translating the EU AI Act into technical requirements."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Viewed from above, Canada's newest Marine Protected Area (MPA) is deceptively simple: stretches of blue Pacific Ocean waters and a few patches of green forest.</p>

<p>But beneath the surface of the area known as the Great Bear Sea, off Vancouver Island, lies an area so rich in biodiversity it has been dubbed the "Galapagos of the North." It may also serve as a model for how to protect marine life elsewhere.</p>

<p>In July, the federal government took an unprecedented step, designating an area roughly as large as Greece an MPA. Previously, protected areas were significantly smaller in size.</p>

<p>The step followed years of consultation and aimed to pioneer a new model of holistic protection, which would see marine populations shielded from a variety of harmful activities across an enormous stretch of ocean, hopefully allowing them to replenish and thrive.</p>

<p>Crucially, the talks also involved a new approach to collaboration.</p>

<p>In addition to the government, fishing industry representatives and the indigenous communities who rely on the area's resources for their livelihoods worked together to develop a protection scheme that balances various interests.</p>

<p>"I am optimistic that we are going to be able to be a model for any future initiatives" on marine protection, said Danielle Shaw, chief of the Wuikinuxv nation, one of the indigenous communities in the area.</p>

<p>The UN COP Biodiversity Conference known as COP-16 opens in Cali, Colombia next week.</p>

<p>At the last conference, COP-15 held in Montreal in 2022, nations agreed to protect 30 percent of the seas by 2030, but there was no clear definition of what amounts to a protected area -- an uncertainty the Canadian model aims to help address.</p>

<p><strong>'Species at risk'</strong></p>

<p>Around the Great Bear Sea, overfishing, pollution and warming waters caused by climate change have altered the area substantially.</p>

<p>Shaw told AFP that "recently there's been some years where we've had to close (fishing) all together for our own people," in order to protect vulnerable fish populations.</p>

<p>That is devastating for the remote community as it means "people haven't been able to stock up their shelves and their freezers for the winter," she said.</p>

<p>The area newly designated for official protection includes 64 species of fish, 70 seabird species, as well as whales, bears, wolves and ancient cedar forest. The seafloor also counts more than 47 underwater mountains, or seamounts.</p>

<p>"It's home to really unique ecosystems and species, but also there are species that are at risk," said Kate MacMillan, conservation director for the ocean program at the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society - British Columbia.</p>

<p>Federal MPA guidelines aim to put a variety of new restrictions on the activities allowed across a vast marine area, including prohibitions on oil and gas exploration, mineral exploitation, waste disposal and the use of dredging gear, among others.</p>

<p>MacMillan described the MPA model as "an important tool," but warned it is not "a silver bullet."</p>

<p>"They don't stop everything. They won't solve every threat," she said.</p>

<p>Those threats are set to persist, especially with the region of British Columbia surrounding the MPA seeing an increase of maritime traffic, including shipments of liquefied natural gas.</p>

<p>Enforcement remains a challenge and the Canadian model aims to involve First Nations in monitoring potential violations, even if they won't have enforcement power.</p>

<p><strong>'We have no choice'</strong></p>

<p>Bo Owadi, a member of the Wuikinuxv nation, said she spends most of her days on the water and is among those who will be working with police and researchers to document misconduct to assess the health of marine life.</p>

<p>She said her generation has "an ingrained sense of responsibility to take care of the land," and that joining forces with the government and others was inevitable.</p>

<p>"We have to come together," she told AFP. "We have no choice."</p>

<p>Chief Shaw agreed that collaborating on protection efforts, including by weighing the economic considerations of the fishing industry, could help foster more durable support.</p>

<p>"The hope is, in the long term, a stronger ecosystem means more food sources for humans and also the stronger economy," she said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

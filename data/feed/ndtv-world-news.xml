       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The British government will allocate 75 million pounds ($96 million) to compensate LGBTQ military veterans sacked by the army over their sexual orientation, the defence ministry announced on Thursday.</p>

<p>Until a 2000 reform, lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people were barred from military service in Britain. Those who were found out were often harassed, abused and sacked, according to a government-commissioned report last year.</p>

<p>Seeking to right "historic wrongs", former armed forces members or employees sacked over their sexuality or gender identity will be eligible to receive £50,000 each, the defence ministry said -- a larger amount than initially expected.</p>

<p>"The historic treatment of LGBT veterans was a moral stain on our nation. Our government is determined to right the wrongs of the past and recognise the hurt that too many endured," Defence Secretary John Healey said in a statement.</p>

<p>Besides losing their jobs and being subjected to public humiliation, the veterans involved were sometimes stripped of their pension benefits, living the rest of their lives in poverty.</p>

<p>"We fully welcome our LGBT veterans back into Defence, and acknowledge their vital contribution to keeping the nation safe," said Minister for Veterans Alistair Carns.</p>

<p>Additional compensation of £1,000 to £20,000 will be offered based on the "suffering" of particular individuals, whether harassment, brutal interrogations or imprisonment, officials said.</p>

<p>Victims will also be able to request the reinstatement of their military rank and medals.</p>

<p>Parliament is due to debate the measure on Thursday, but veterans can already begin filing their compensation requests online.</p>

<p>In July 2023, a report ordered by Britain's then-Conservative Party government revealed the "horrendous" treatment of LGBTQ veterans who had served between 1967 and 2000.</p>

<p>The day it was published, former prime minister Rishi Sunak apologised on behalf of the government. He then set in motion the process that led to Thursday's reparations announcement.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump said "anything can happen" when asked about the chances of going to war with Iran during his next term in an interview with Time, coinciding with his being named the magazine's Person of the Year.</p>

<p>"Anything can happen. Anything can happen. It's a very volatile situation," Trump said, before going on to say he thinks the most dangerous thing happening now is Ukraine shooting missiles into Russia, which he said was a major escalation.</p>

<p>Trump has previously threatened Iran, whose elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps have sought to assassinate him, according to the US government. Iran has denied the claim.</p>

<p>During his first term in office, in 2020, Trump ordered a US air strike that killed Iran's top military commander, Qassem Soleimani.</p>

<p>Trump in 2018 also reneged on a nuclear deal struck by his predecessor Barack Obama in 2015 and re-imposed U.S. economic sanctions on Iran that had been relaxed. The deal had limited Iran's ability to enrich uranium, a process that can yield fissile material for nuclear weapons.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A unique and historic tinselled garland presented to Mahatma Gandhi during the iconic Dandi March in 1930 failed to meet its guide price at a recent UK auction. The garland, which was worn by Gandhi during the Salt March, was expected to fetch between GBP 20-30,000 but remains open for bids.</p>

<p>"I am very surprised that the 'Gandhi Garland' did not find a home on the day of the auction," said Kristina Sanne, Head of Sale at the auction house specialising in fine arts and antiques.</p>

<p>"That said, we have had quite a lot of interest since the sale and hope to sell it to the highest bidder. It deserves a great home," she said.</p>

<p>The garland is a significant piece of Indian history, composed of a large teardrop-shaped medallion of pink cloth backed on card, applied with silver and gold thread and sequins. It is edged with gold tinsel and features four smaller rectangular medallions and two triangular medallions similarly decorated.</p>

<p>The garland was presented to Gandhi by Nanduben Kanuga, the wife of Dr Balvantrai N Kanuga, Gandhi's personal physician. It has remained in the Kanuga family collection until now.</p>

<p>While the Gandhi garland failed to sell, other highlight lots in the auction attracted fierce bidding. A fine illustration from a Bhagavata Purana series from Punjab sold for GBP 27,700, exceeding its estimate. A group of six Rajput Equestrian Portraits from Rajasthan fetched GBP 20,160, and an album of Kalighat Paintings sold for GBP 21,420.</p>

<p>According to Kristina Sanne, Head of Sale at the auction house, the Indian Art section saw frantic bidding throughout, with over 90% of lots sold. This demonstrates the continued buoyancy of the Indian Art market.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rates of bowel cancer are rising among younger adults, a new study found that also revealed that rates are rising faster in England than in almost any other country. According to the <em>BBC</em>, global data suggests that doctors are seeing people under-50s develop early-onset bowel cancer. An increase in rates was reported in 27 of the 50 countries examined, with the greatest annual increases seen in New Zealand (4%), Chile (4%), Puerto Rico (3.8%), and England (3.6%), the researchers wrote in the study, published in the journal <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045%2824%2900600-4/fulltext" rel="noindex,nofollow">Lancet Oncology</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Experts are still trying to understand the reasons behind the rise. The authors of the study said consumption of junk food, high levels of physical inactivity and the obesity epidemic were likely to be among the factors, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4rnzq47z2o" rel="noindex,nofollow">outlet</a>. Eating too much-processed meat and not enough fibre can also increase the risk, per the study.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The increase in early-onset colorectal cancer is a global phenomenon," said Hyuna Sung, a senior principal scientist in cancer surveillance research at the American Cancer Society and lead author of the study. "Previous studies have shown this rise in predominately high-income western countries, but now it is documented in various economies and regions worldwide," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The study found bowel cancer rates in people aged between 25 and 49 rose in 27 of the 50 countries studied in the decade to 2017. Young women were found to have faster increases in early bowel cancer rates than men if they lived in England, Norway, Australia, Turkey, Costa Rica or Scotland.</p>

<p>Experts said people need to be aware of the early signs and symptoms, such as blood in poo. Other symptoms include a persistent change in bowel habits, abdominal pain, discomfort or bloating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The global scope of this concerning trend highlights the need for innovative tools to prevent and control cancers linked to dietary habits, physical inactivity and excess body weight," said Mr Sung.</p>

<p>"Ongoing efforts are essential to identify the additional factors behind these trends and to develop effective prevention strategies tailored to younger generations and local resources worldwide," he added.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Chess Champion title is a heavy and prestigious one to bear and although there are many great minds in chess, there are only a select few who have found a place in the sun at a young age.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are the five youngest World Chess Champions in the world:</p>

<h2><strong>Gukesh Dommaraju (India)</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">

<p>In a dramatic finale, 18 year old D. Gukesh dethroned Ding Liren of China and became the youngest World Chess Champion in history, in 2024. Gukesh started playing chess at the age of 7, and got his first taste of success at the Under-9 section of the Asian School Chess Championships in 2015.</p>

<p>But 2023 was an eventful year for Gukesh when he unleashed himself to the world as the youngest player to reach a rating of 2750. The same year, he outperformed Viswanathan Anand as the top-ranked Indian chess player and clinched India's first-ever Chess Olympiad gold.</p>

<h3><strong>Garry Kasparov (Russia)</strong></h3>

<p>Garry Kasparov was the youngest World Chess Champion at 22 years of age when he defeated Anatoly Karpov in 1985. He started playing chess at the age of 6 and at the age of 17, he became an international grandmaster in 1980. He was mentored by former world champion Mikhail Botvinnik.</p>

<p>In 1996, famously, Kasparov defeated an IBM custom built chess computer called Deep Blue. However, after an upgrade in 1997, the machine prevailed over Kasparov. He later retired from competitive chess in 2005.</p>

<p>Interestingly, he also started a political organisation called the United Civil Front to oppose President Vladimir Putin of Russia.</p>

<h3><strong>Magnus Carlsen (Norway)</strong></h3>

<p>Magnus Carlsen is a chess superstar who became the highest rated player at the age of 19. He has the highest Elo chess rating ever achieved by a human being - 2882. His father taught him how to play at the age of 5.</p>

<p>He made history by winning the FIDE World Chess Championship at the age of 22 years in 2013. Carlsen was only 13 when he drew Garry Kasparov and defeated Anatoly Karpov at the same event in 2004.</p>

<h3><strong>Mikhail Tal (Latvia-Soviet Union)</strong></h3>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India aims to move to a system of holding a singular, unified, gargantuan election in which citizens elect both the Central government and respective state (federal) governments.</p>

<p>This will not be the first time India attempts this system of election. When the country earned its Independence in 1947, the founding fathers had planned for this very model of election - simultaneous parliamentary and state assembly polls. From the very first election held in the country - in 1952 - this was the way India voted.</p>

<p>But all that changed in 1967 - when India voted for the last time under the 'One Nation, One Election' format. At the time, all of India voted in a single phase, except for Uttar Pradesh (formerly United Provinces), which voted in four phases. Polling was conducted between the 15th and 21st of February that year. This was India's fourth such election and polling was carried out to elect MPs and MLAs to 520 Lok Sabha seats and 3,563 Assembly constituencies.</p>

<p>Then the era of coalition politics peaked, and ultimately led to the end of simultaneous elections in the country. Till 1967, the Congress was the only party which governed India, but by then it was facing several challenges and setbacks. India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had died a few year ago, his daughter, Indira Gandhi was facing pressure from key allies; the Congress was facing large-scale anti-incumbency as well as struggling with an internal power tussle, and to top it all, India had lost the 1962 war against China.</p>

<p>Six decades hence, India now looks to resume the 'One Nation, One Election'. The Union Cabinet led by the Prime Minister has cleared the proposal and approved the bills to implement it. It will now likely be tabled in Parliament in the ongoing Winter Session, with an aim to be passed Constitutionally for it to become the norm.</p>

<h2><strong>OTHER NATIONS WITH SIMULTANEOUS ELECTIONS</strong></h2>

<p>Before this stage was reached, a high-level panel had been formed. It was led by former President Ram Nath Kovind. The panel not just studied how India carried out such elections in the past and what the loopholes were at the time, but also carried out extensive research on how such elections are carried out across the world.</p>

<p>During its global research, the panel focused on seven countries - South Africa, Sweden, Belgium, Germany, Indonesia, The Philippines, and Japan - all of which carry out simultaneous elections and have been doing so successfully. The panel then submitted its findings and a proposed working model to the President of India, Droupadi Murmu earlier this year.</p>

<p>In its report, the panel stated that a detailed comparative analysis of countries with similar electoral processes was studied to understand their workings of conducting simultaneous elections. The aim of understanding multiple models from different nations carrying out unified, simultaneous polls was to learn and adopt the best international practices and to ensure fairness and transparency in the electoral process.</p>

<p>"In South Africa, voters cast their ballots for both the National Assembly and Provincial Legislatures simultaneously. However, municipal elections are held separately from provincial ones in a five-year cycle," the report stated.</p>

<p>Sweden, the panel stated, functions on a proportional electoral system. This means that the number of seats a political party is assigned in the elected assembly is based on its share of votes in the election. "They have a system where elections for the Parliament (Riksdag), County Councils, and Municipal Councils all take place at the same time. These elections occur every four years on the second Sunday of September whereas elections to the municipal assemblies occur on the second Sunday of September, once every five years," it stated.</p>

<p>The panel also studied the German model of electioneering. In its report is stated that in Germany, there is a constructive vote of no-confidence in addition to the procedure for the appointment of a Chancellor made by the Bundestag (Germany's Lower House of Parliament). It is a variation on the motion of no confidence that allows a parliament to withdraw confidence from a head of government only if there is a positive majority for a prospective successor.</p>

<p>In Japan, the Prime Minister is firstly appointed by the National Diet and thereafter accepted by the Emperor. According to the report, a key member in the high-level panel had suggested that India should "adopt a model similar to that in Germany and Japan".</p>

<p>Like India, Indonesia also switched to the 'One Nation, One Election' format only recently - in 2019. The President, Vice-President, and members of both national and regional legislative bodies are elected on the same day. According to the report by the high-level panel "Political parties need 4 per cent of votes to qualify for the National Parliament. A Presidential candidate needs more than 50 per cent of votes cast overall and at least 20 per cent of votes in more than half the country's provinces to win."</p>

<p>The report also noted that "On February 14, 2024, Indonesia successfully conducted simultaneous elections. It was termed as the world's largest single day elections since nearly 200 million people voted across all five levels - President, Vice-President, Members of Parliament, Members of Regional Assemblies and Municipal elections."</p>

<p>India, a country of more than 1.4 billion (1,400 million / 140 crore) people, now aims to create the world record by conducting the largest-ever simultaneous elections. Whether that will happen in 2029 is not certain yet. It will first have to pass the test in Parliament.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Outgoing President Joe Biden said Thursday he had commuted the sentences of nearly 1,500 criminals and pardoned 39 others convicted of non-violent crimes, in what the White House called the largest single-day act of clemency in US history.</p>

<p>"I am pardoning 39 people who have shown successful rehabilitation," Biden said in a statement, adding that he was also "commuting the sentences of nearly 1,500 people who are serving long prison sentences."</p>

<p>The White House said the nearly 1,500 people granted commuted sentences -- "the most ever in a single day" -- had been serving them at home for at least one year.</p>

<p>"America was built on the promise of possibility and second chances," Biden said. "As President, I have the great privilege of extending mercy to people who have demonstrated remorse and rehabilitation."</p>

<p>Biden this month faced criticism for issuing an official pardon for his son Hunter, who was facing sentencing for two criminal cases, despite earlier assurances that he would not intervene in his son's legal troubles.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A British woman who died after a Brazilian butt-lift procedure in Turkey had undergone a "frankly barbaric medical practice" in which she gave no informed consent, a coroner ruled, as per the <em>BBC</em>. 26-year-old Demi Agoglia, from Greater Manchester, travelled to Turkey for the procedure in January after seeing social media advertisements for Istanbul-based Comfort Zone. She died in the hospital in Istanbul on January 8 three days after the operation and a catalogue of poor care, an inquest heard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Bolton Coroner John Pollard found that Ms Agoglia died from a microscopic fat embolism, caused when she was injected fat enters the bloodstream, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjwl2jnvn1wo" rel="noindex,nofollow">outlet </a>reported. He ruled that the 26-year-old died as a result of "misadventure contributed to by neglect".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I find there was no proper informed consent in this matter, there was no proper pre-operative care and advice, and no proper post-operative care. All of this meant the care in total fell well below the standard expected of this type of treatment and the lack of care contributed significantly to Demi's death," Mr Pollard said, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brazilian-butt-lift-turkey-demi-agoglia-b2662921.html" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>Independent</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The coroner also told Ms Agoglia's family that he would write to the Health Secretary, adding, "I do feel something further needs to be done to stop this frankly barbaric medical practice being conducted to such low standards that would certainly not be tolerated in the UK."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, Ms Agoglia travelled to Turkey with her partner, Bradley Jones. He said he did not want Ms Agoglia to have the surgery, but she had booked the trip months earlier after "she had seen some celebrity" advertising the procedure. The couple stayed in a shared villa in Istanbul before they were taken by taxi to the hospital.</p>

<p>Following the operation Ms Agoglia was "shaking" and appeared "very, very cold", Mr Jones said. Staff from Comfort Zone were called to the villa after Ms Agoglia complained of a tight chest and they checked her blood pressure but did not inspect the area of the operation or check her heart rate and pulse, the inquest heard.</p>

<p>The 26-year-old collapsed at the villa the following day and was taken back to the hospital where she died. The surgeon who conducted the operation later told Mr Jones they had done everything they could. It later emerged that the Comfort Zone staff who were called out to the villa were not qualified nurses.</p>

<p>A Brazilian butt lift (BBL) is a surgery where a doctor transfers fat from the abdomen, hips, lower back, or thighs to the buttocks. Women get the surgery to achieve an hourglass-shaped figure, with larger buttocks. Doctors remove the fat using liposuction. According to The Independent, the procedure can cost 3,500 pounds (Rs 3,71,049) in Turkey, but up to 10,000 pounds (Rs 10,60,021) in the UK, and carries the highest risk of all cosmetic surgeries.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Chinese influencer with 46 million followers, identified as Meng or Qi Tiandao, was detained for 10 days after harassing a woman during a live-stream. The incident, which took place in Sanya, involved Meng poking a woman's buttocks with a bamboo stick. The woman, later revealed to be hired for the stunt, was part of an act intended to boost online engagement. However, the police condemned the act for its negative societal impact.</p>

<p>The incident happened during a live-streaming session&nbsp;staged in Sanya at the end of November. In the stream, Meng showed a woman wearing a short skirt who was buying milk tea on the street. Meng then picked up a short bamboo stick, squatted down, and discreetly approached the woman. He used the stick to poke her backside, causing her visible distress.&nbsp;The woman turned to Meng and asked, "Why did you touch my bottom?" Meng responded with a cheeky comment, saying, "I'd like to remind you that half of your buttocks are revealed." The woman's response was not captured.</p>

<p>The scene was broadcast live to his followers. However, it was later revealed that the woman had been hired by Meng to pose as a passerby, according to the police.</p>

<p>After receiving numerous complaints from internet users, Kuaishou suspended Meng's account for 15 days, citing a violation of the platform's rules. Meanwhile, local police have stated that the case is still under investigation. The consequences, if any, for the woman involved in the incident remain unclear.</p>

<p>Meng, previously jailed for fraud, is known for provocative and controversial content to attract viewers. The 28-year-old, better known by his online alias Qi Tiandao on the short video platform Kuaishou, boasts an impressive 46 million followers. He is famous for his humorous live-streaming content, often filmed in outdoor locations across mainland China.</p>

<p>He has a history of legal issues, having served a three-year prison sentence for fraud in 2019. Following his release, he began a career as a blogger, but his content frequently included vulgar and harassing behaviour towards women.</p>

<p>Reacting to the stunt, one user wrote, "I wonder who his followers are. What kind of people are they?" Another commented, "The popularity of this individual, who primarily produces sleazy content, indicates a decline in society's moral standards."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has invited Chinese President Xi Jinping and other foreign leaders to his inauguration next month in Washington, a Trump transition spokesperson said on Thursday.</p>

<p>Asked if Xi had responded, Karoline Leavitt told Fox News in an interview that was "to be determined". She did not name the other world leaders who were also invited.</p>

<p>"This is an example of President Trump creating an open dialogue with leaders of countries that are not just our allies but our adversaries and our competitors, too," she added. "He is willing to talk to anyone and he will always put America's interests first."</p>

<p>The Kremlin separately on Thursday said that it had not received an invitation to attend the January 20 inauguration.</p>

<p>The offer for Xi to attend Trump's swearing-in was extended in early November, shortly after the Nov. 5 presidential election, according to CBS News, which first reported the invitation on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on Wednesday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta Platforms have donated $1 million to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's inaugural fund, a company spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed response.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news, said the donation was a departure from past practice by CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Meta.</p>

<p>Zuckerberg had declined to endorse either Donald Trump or Joe Biden for this year's election, in a media interview that took place before Biden stepped down as the Democratic nominee and was replaced by Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>The billionaire CEO, however, had complemented Trump's reaction to the July 13 assassination attempt as "one of the most badass things I've ever seen in my life," among his recent attempts to appeal to conservative users.</p>

<p>Zuckerberg had met Trump after the elections in late November, according to the New York Times, a meeting that the newspaper said was the latest attempt by the Meta boss to establish a positive rapport with Trump.</p>

<p>Trump and Zuckerberg's Meta have had strained relations in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election.</p>

<p>The president-elect accused Meta of suppressing content that would have hurt Biden in the 2020 election, and also criticized Zuckerberg's donations to bolster election infrastructure.</p>

<p>Meta suspended Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts for about two years following the January 2021 Capitol riots.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Time Magazine on Thursday named US President-elect Donald Trump its "person of the year," marking the second time he has won the accolade in acknowledgement of the mogul's stunning political comeback.</p>

<p>Trump, who defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in the November 5 election, adorns the magazine's title cover sporting his distinctive red tie and striking a pensive pose.</p>

<p>"For marshaling a comeback of historic proportions, for driving a once-in-a-generation political realignment, for reshaping the American presidency and altering America's role in the world, Donald Trump is Time's 2024 - Person of the Year."</p>

<p>This year saw Trump convicted on charges of business fraud and nearly assassinated twice -- and will end with him preparing to return to the White House with Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress.</p>

<p>"We are witnessing a resurgence of populism, a widening mistrust in the institutions that defined the last century, and an eroding faith that liberal values will lead to better lives for most people. Trump is both agent and beneficiary of it all," the magazine said in a statement.</p>

<p>The award, given out annually, is an acknowledgement of the year's most influential figure. Past winners include Taylor Swift and Volodymyr Zelensky -- and Trump himself, in 2016, after his shock defeat of Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p><strong>Trump influence</strong></p>

<p>Having dominated the news events of 2024, Trump's influence is set to continue when he assumes the presidency in January.</p>

<p>This time around, Trump is promising mass expulsions of undocumented immigrants and major tariffs that threaten to shake up not just the US economy, but those of key trade partners.</p>

<p>He's cast doubt on continued support for Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion, and has already become something of a shadow president, feting foreign leaders at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.</p>

<p>His comeback -- on the cover of Time magazine, but also at the helm of the US government -- was unthinkable a few years ago.</p>

<p>After his supporters stormed the US Capitol in an attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss, it seemed like Republicans might be ready to wash their hands of the brash outsider who had taken over the party.</p>

<p>Criminal cases were launched over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, and he was found liable in civil court for sexual abuse. He remains a polarizing figure in US and world politics.</p>

<p>Yet none of that prevented him from rising back up to the top of the Republican ticket, and then going on to win in the general election against Harris.</p>

<p>Harris was among those shortlisted for the award, alongside Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian economist Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of late opposition leader Alexei Navalny.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA["Joy Bangla" or "Victory to Bangla" was the symbol of patriotism and unity especially during the birth of Bangladesh. "Joy Bangla" was more than a political slogan - it was a war cry.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's Supreme Court has put a hold on a High Court verdict that declared "Joy Bangla" as the country's national slogan. This phrase, popularised by Bangbandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, has been a significant part of Bangladesh's history and identity.</p>

<p>"Joy Bangla" or "Victory to Bangla" was the symbol of patriotism and unity especially during the birth of Bangladesh. "Joy Bangla" was more than a political slogan - it was a war cry.</p>

<p>On March 2nd 2022, it was made the national slogan by the Awami League government and it became mandatory at all government offices to voice the two words during national celebrations.</p>

<p>The recent development comes after Sheikh Hasina, Rahman's daughter and the former Prime Minister, was ousted from power on August 5. Since then, the new government has taken steps to remove symbols associated with Hasina and her father, including the removal of Rahman's image from currency notes.</p>

<p>After the change of government, the state made a move to the High Court to hold the ruling and filed the leave to appeal petition with the SC on December 2nd seeking a stay on the High Court verdict of March 10, 2020.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court's decision was made on the grounds that the national slogan is a matter of government policy, and the judiciary should not interfere.</p>

<p>Additional Attorney General Aneek R Haque stated that "'Joy Bangla' will not be considered as the national slogan following this Appellate Division order".</p>

<p>This move is part of a broader effort by the new government to distance itself from the previous administration. The government has also decided not to observe August 15 as a national mourning day and public holiday, despite a High Court verdict justifying the observance.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, on August 13th, the advisory council of the interim government made a decision to not even have a national holiday on August 15th.</p>

<p>The Bangladesh Bank is also printing new currency notes that feature the July uprising, which refers to the student-led protests that forced Hasina to flee to India. Notably, these new notes will not include the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Miss Netherlands beauty pageant is being scrapped after 35 years, organisers said on Thursday, transforming into a new platform dealing with mental health and sharing positive stories.</p>

<p>"Times have changed and we are changing with the times," the organisers of the pageant said in a statement.</p>

<p>Instead of running the competition, director Monica van Ee has set up a platform entitled "no longer of this time."</p>

<p>This platform aims to share stories of successful women but also those struggling with, among other things, social media and unrealistic beauty standards.</p>

<p>"No more crowns, but stories that inspire. No dresses, but dreams that come to life," organisers said.</p>

<p>Van Ee said in a blog post on the new platform that her involvement in the pageant aimed to give young woman a springboard and show others what was possible.</p>

<p>"Perhaps a sash and a crown are no longer of this time. But women who support each other and help each other, that is timeless for us," she said.</p>

<p>The competition made headlines in 2023 when Rikkie Kolle, then 22, became the first transgender woman to win the pageant.</p>

<p>Kolle told AFP in an interview she hoped her victory would be an inspiration to young people from the transgender community.</p>

<p>Van Ee said the new platform should be "a place to show your authentic self and a world where we celebrate real life. Without the pressure to conform to a perfect image."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The practice of taking countless selfies, creating reels and making vlogs has become a common sight. In an attempt to go viral, several people are also seen engaging in rather risky feats, putting the lives of others in danger. Now, one such video going viral on social media has captured a terrifying moment a tourist fell from a train after being hit by a tree while dangling out of the carriage for a snap. According to <em>The Sun</em>, the incident took place on a train in Sri Lanka on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tourist, identified as a tourist from China, was holding onto the railings and leaning out of the carriage for a selfie video when she was bashed in the head by some tree branches. She was quickly dragged from the carriage, and the video captured her flailing her arms in a panic as she fell out of the train.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A Chinese tourist had a heart-stopping moment while traveling on Sri Lanka's coastal railway line. She fell from the train after being struck by a tree branch while trying to record a video," an X user wrote while sharing the video.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Fortunately, she landed on a bush, which broke her fall and miraculously left her unharmed. The police confirmed that she didn't sustain any injuries," the caption of the post read.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Local cops have reminded passengers on trains to pay attention to their surroundings at all times. They also urged people to follow safety precautions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The video has gone viral on social media, with many users criticising the woman for putting herself in danger just for a reel. Reacting to the clip, one user wrote, "She is lucky that it is only a bush." "No sense of fear?" commented another. "This is so silly," expressed a third.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, this is not the first time a person has attempted a dangerous stunt to go viral on social media. Earlier this year, a woman was slammed after a video captured her sitting on the edge of a well with a child clinging to her leg. The video captured the woman lip-syncing a song. A little child, on the other hand, clung to one of her legs while his body dangled in the air above an open well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The video prompted varied comments, with users calling it reckless, unnecessary and pointless to form such an act and risk their lives. Some social media users also demanded that the woman should be arrested for putting the child's life in danger.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK weather service forecast Thursday that 2025 would likely be among the top three warmest years globally, falling just behind the record-breaking temperatures set in the past months.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the Meteorological Office's 2025 forecast, average global temperatures next year will be 1.29 to 1.53 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels (1850-1900), slightly cooler than in 2024 and 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Met also said 2024 was expected to be the warmest year on record, confirming findings released this week by Europe's climate monitor Copernicus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The reports come at the end of a year in which rich and poor countries were devastated by climate disasters that scientists link to human activity that is rapidly warming the Earth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the Met forecast, 2024 is also "almost certain to exceed" for the first time the 1.5C (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) threshold to protect the planet from dangerously overheating, following the 1.45C reached in 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The major contribution" to warming temperatures is the rise of greenhouse gas emissions, driven by human activity like burning fossil fuels, according to the report.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2024 and 2023 temperatures were also "elevated slightly" by El Nino, a natural phenomenon that moves around warm water.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the Met warned that 2025 would remain warm, despite not experiencing the warming El Nino effect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Years, such as 2025, which aren't dominated by the warming influence of El Nino, should be cooler," said Adam Scaife, who led the Met's 2025 forecast.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>'Sobering milestone'</strong></p>

<p>Scaife compared 2025 to a decade earlier, when 2016, which was an El Nino year, was the warmest year on record at the time.</p>

<p>"In comparison to our forecast for 2025 though, 2016 is now looking decidedly cool," Scaife said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The average global temperature for 2025 is forecast to be between 1.29C and 1.53C above pre-industrial levels, with a central estimate of 1.41C. In 2016, the average was 0.77C.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Met's scientists also said 2024 crossing 1.5C was a "sobering milestone".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The world agreed under the 2015 Paris climate agreement to limit warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, with scientists warning that crossing the threshold for decades would be catastrophic for the planet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's important to recognise that a temporary exceedance of 1.5C doesn't mean a breach of the Paris Agreement," said the Met's Nick Dunstone, who worked on the forecast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"But the first year above 1.5C is certainly a sobering milestone in climate history."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The report comes days after the UK was battered by its fourth named storm of the season, causing flooding and deaths and knocking out power to tens of thousands of homes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Climate scientists say storms are becoming more powerful as the world heats up. Warmer ocean surfaces release more water vapour that provides additional energy for storms, strengthening winds.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Pakistani court indicted imprisoned former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife on fresh charges of illegally selling state gifts on Thursday, local broadcaster Geo reported.</p>

<p>The indictment was the latest in dozens of cases against the 72-year-old former cricket star, who has been in jail since late last year.</p>

<p>Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi have already been granted bail in the case, which is one of a series of state treasury charges known as "Toshakhana".</p>

<p>These charges revolve around allegations that Khan and his wife illegally procured and then sold gifts worth more than 140 million rupees ($501,000) in state possession, which he received during his 2018-22 premiership. They have denied committing an offence.</p>

<p>Khan and Bibi were both handed a 14-year sentence on those charges days before a national election earlier this year, following a three-year sentence handed to him in late 2023 in another version of the same case.</p>

<p>However, their sentences have been suspended in appeals at the high court.</p>

<p>The gifts included diamond jewellery and seven watches, six of them Rolexes - the most expensive being valued at 85 million rupees ($305,000).</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Khan was also indicted on charges of inciting attacks against the military, a case stemming from deadly anti-government rallies led by his party last year.</p>

<p>Bibi also led a deadly protest march by thousands of supporters in the capital Islamabad on Nov. 25, escalating a face-off with the government and its military backers.</p>

<p>Khan has been fighting court cases since he was ousted from power in 2022. He and his party say the cases were made up to keep him out of politics at the behest of the military after he had fallen out with the army's generals. The army denies the accusation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[An investigation into alleged rape and sexual assault in Stockholm which targeted Real Madrid forward Kylian Mbappe has been closed due to insufficient evidence, the Swedish prosecutor said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An investigation into alleged rape and sexual assault in Stockholm which Swedish media said targeted Real Madrid forward Kylian Mbappe has been closed due to insufficient evidence, the Swedish prosecutor said Thursday.</p>

<p>Mbappe, the 25-year-old Frenchman who is one of the highest-profile players in world football, visited the Swedish capital October 9-11 with a group of people after he was left out of his country's squad for a Nations League match.</p>

<p>Sweden's prosecution authority announced on October 15 that it was investigating an alleged incident that occurred at an upscale Stockholm hotel on October 10, without mentioning the suspect by name.</p>

<p>Several Swedish media outlets, including newspapers Aftonbladet and Expressen and public broadcaster SVT, identified Mbappe as the suspect.</p>

<p>"My assessment is that the evidence is not sufficient to proceed and the investigation is therefore closed," prosecutor Marina Chirakova said in a statement that also did not mention Mbappe by name.</p>

<p>Ms Chirakova said the person in question had not been interrogated and "not been notified of suspicion of a crime".</p>

<p>"I have concluded, based on what has emerged in the case, that new evidence, including interrogations of the person in question, would not change the evidence situation right now," she told AFP.</p>

<p>She said her team had nonetheless "conducted a large number of interviews in the investigation".</p>

<p>Petra Eklund, the lawyer for the plaintiff, whose name has not been disclosed, told AFP she had "no comment" to the news that the case had been closed.</p>

<p>Mbappe's lawyer said in October that he was "shocked" to see his name linked to the investigation.</p>

<p>Speaking for the first time about the case on Sunday, he told French television show Clique he was "not involved".</p>

<p>"I haven't received anything, no summons... I'm not involved," he said.</p>

<p>According to Aftonbladet, Mbappe and his entourage dined at a restaurant one evening before going on to a nightclub.</p>

<p>The complaint was filed on October 12 after the alleged victim had sought medical attention, according to the newspaper.</p>

<p>Expressen reported that police had seized some clothing as evidence, saying it consisted of women's underwear, a pair of black trousers and a black top. Photographs showed police officers leaving the hotel with brown bags.</p>

<p><strong>Difficult season</strong></p>

<p>Mbappe joined Madrid this summer after seven years at Paris Saint-Germain and has stayed clear of scandal in his private life.</p>

<p>The forward, who is known for carefully managing his image through a close network of family, lawyers and spokespeople, has become one of the world's highest paid players after a stellar career that began when he was barely into his teens.</p>

<p>He has had a difficult season since moving to reigning European champions Real Madrid from PSG in the summer, failing to find his top form.</p>

<p>However the Frenchman scored in Madrid's 3-2 win against Italian side Atalanta on Tuesday which revived Real's flagging bid to regain their Champions League title.</p>

<p>Mbappe, Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham were all on the scoresheet in Bergamo as Madrid moved up to 20th place in the Champions League table, on nine points from six matches.</p>

<p>The Spanish giants would have been at risk of dropping out of the Champions League play-off places if they had lost.</p>

<p>Mbappe won the World Cup as a teenager in 2018 in Russia and scored a hat-trick in the 2022 final in Qatar which France lost on penalties to Lionel Messi's Argentina.</p>

<p>At PSG he was part of a superstar trio with Messi and Brazilian forward Neymar, but the Qatar-owned club were unable to win the Champions League.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Almost a decade ago, a Syrian refugee's selfie with Germany's then chancellor Angela Merkel went viral. Today, Anas Modamani has a job, a German passport and a fiancee and no plans to return to his war-ravaged country.</p>

<p>While right-wing politicians in Europe have been quick to demand that Syrians "go home" after the fall of president Bashar al-Assad, Modamani's story typifies how many have put down roots in their host countries.</p>

<p>"I am a Berliner, I have my life here," said the 27-year-old cameraman who arrived in the German capital in 2015 at the age of 18, and is now part of the biggest Syrian refugee community in Europe.</p>

<p>Having financed his studies in communication with a part-time job at a supermarket, Modamani is now working as a freelancer video journalist for public broadcaster Deutsche Welle.</p>

<p>He lives with his Ukrainian fiancee, a mechanical engineer who herself arrived in Germany a few months before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of her country in February 2022.</p>

<p>"I have a wonderful apartment and a very beautiful woman, I have everything I need here," Modamani told AFP.</p>

<p>He said he originally fled Syria because he "did not want to perform military service" for Assad's regime, and that now he doesn't want to return as he had "experienced terrible things there".</p>

<p>"I lost friends," he said. "Members of my family died because of the regime."&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>'Worried' for friends</strong></p>

<p>Less than three months before early elections are expected in Germany on February 23, far-right and conservative politicians have made the repatriation of Syrians a campaign issue.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock of the Greens party on Wednesday criticised such calls, saying they revealed "a lack of realism about the situation in the Middle East".</p>

<p>Modamani said that "for my friends who, unlike me, don't have a German passport, I am worried".</p>

<p>"The war is over but the situation is uncertain, we have to see how it develops."</p>

<p>While he has "more friends in Berlin than in Syria", his parents and siblings still live in Syria, around half an hour's drive from Damascus.</p>

<p>He said he also worries about the air strikes Israel has carried out since Assad was overthrown, targeting the ousted regime's military assets.</p>

<p>"It could affect anyone," Modamani said, noting that "when I phoned my mother recently, she was hiding in the cellar".</p>

<p><strong>'Part of history'</strong></p>

<p>Modamani is safely settled but the fate of others hangs in the balance after German authorities this week decided to freeze issuing decisions on pending asylum applications from Syrian nationals.</p>

<p>Since his famous Merkel selfie, Modamani has become something of a celebrity in the Syrian community and says he want to use his platform of more than 50,000 followers on TikTok to be a "voice for people who come from Syria".</p>

<p>The selfie at the time became a symbol of Berlin's welcome of almost a million people escaping the war-torn country.</p>

<p>But it also attracted some negative attention as it was used in disinformation linking him to terror attacks.</p>

<p>In 2017 he took Facebook to court in an effort to make the social media giant remove such photos but he lost the case.</p>

<p>While Modamani and Merkel have not crossed paths again, the former chancellor still remembers the incident.</p>

<p>In her memoirs published last month, Merkel admitted she had been surprised by the stir the photo caused, when supporters and critics used it as a symbol of Germany's migrant policy.</p>

<p>"Even now, I cannot understand how anyone could assume that a friendly face on a photo could encourage people to flee their homeland in droves," she wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Or that, conversely, the grimmest possible expression would have stopped them from doing so."</p>

<p>Modamani thinks it's "great" that his photo found its way into Merkel's tome.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"My picture is going to be part of history forever."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media platform TikTok has helped US police solve a case and arrest a suspect who fatally shot a woman three years ago. According to <em>CNN</em>, the suspect, identified as Benjamin Williams, allegedly killed his estranged girlfriend Joana Peca three years ago in Florida. US Marshals arrested him in Mexico City after a TikTok user recognised him from a photo in a video. The clip was posted by Jasmeen Alexander, a TikTok influencer whose true-crime account has more than 2.8 million followers. The video showed a Florida news channel's coverage of the killing and search for the suspect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The police said Williams, 41, shot Joana Peca in the face in July 2021. He convinced her to meet him at a cemetery in St Petersburg. He told her that he wanted to meet his infant son, but while she was sitting in a van with the baby, Williams allegedly shot her multiple times in the face, killing her. Ms Peca's older son, 4, was also inside the vehicle at the time but both children were unharmed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the cops, Ms Peca was holding her 4-month-old son in her arms when it happened. On the other hand, her older son witnessed the entire incident from the backseat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, three years after the incident, Williams has been arrested and charged with first-degree murder and two counts of child abuse. He is being held without bond in the Pinellas County Jail, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/05/us/bambi-williams-joana-peca-florida-cec/index.html" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>CNN </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Peca's family is grateful he's been arrested. "I feel a Christmas present for me and my little boys came early this year, and I couldn't ask for more than that phone call I got from the police department," Eleni Peca, the victim's mother," said per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/tiktok-crime-police-murder-mother-b2662028.html" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>The Independent</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Three years and three months is too long. He was running, but he couldn't hide anymore. All eyes on him, and finally, he is behind bars where he belongs," she added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Separately, St Petersburg Police Chief Anthony Holloway told Ms Peca's family: "Nothing we do can replace the loss of your daughter, but at least, we have a dangerous person off the street."</p>

<p>"At least a loving mother ... and the family can know now that we have him in custody. He is behind bars where he belongs," the police chief added.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

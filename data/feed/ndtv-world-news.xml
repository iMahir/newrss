       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Palestinians said an Israeli strike killed at least 22 people in a school sheltering displaced people in southern Gaza City on Saturday, while the Israeli military said the attack targeted a command centre of Hamas.</p>

<p>The Gaza health ministry said most of those killed were women and children. The Hamas-run government media office said 13 children and six women were among the dead.</p>

<p>The military said it hit a Hamas command centre embedded in the compound that previously served as a school, repeating an accusation that the group uses civilian facilities for military purposes. Hamas denies that.</p>

<p>Reuters footage from the site showed blasted walls, wrecked and burnt furniture, and holes in the ceiling of one room as people tried to salvage what they could of belongings.</p>

<p>"The women and their children were sitting in the playground of the school, the kids were playing, and suddenly two rockets hit them," said one witness Said Al-Malahi.</p>

<p>Some of the dead were wrapped in blankets and carried away on donkey carts, as ambulances transferred other bodies.</p>

<p>"I couldn't take it, I did not see a single man that is injured, it was all women and children, let the Arab countries rejoice, let them rejoice and clap for (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu and the United States of America," said another eyewitness, Ahmed Azzam, bitter that regional neighbours were not taking a tougher line against Israel.</p>

<p><strong>MEDICS KILLED</strong></p>

<p>In Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, the Gaza health ministry said four health workers were killed by an Israeli strike that hit ministry warehouses. Ambulance crews could not reach the dead or treat the wounded, it added.</p>

<p>In a statement, the Israeli military said forces, operating in Rafah since May, have killed dozens of operatives in recent weeks and dismantled military infrastructure and tunnel shafts.</p>

<p>Israel's demand to keep control of the southern border line between Rafah and Egypt has been a major sticking point in international efforts to conclude a ceasefire deal.</p>

<p>Hamas says it is focused on an agreement to end the war and get Israeli forces out of Gaza, while Israel says the war can only end once Hamas is eradicated. Another sticking point has been the specifics of an exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.</p>

<p>This war in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on Oct. 7 when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent assault on the enclave has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry, and displaced nearly the entire 2.3 million-strong population.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A California couple's two-month heartbreak over their lost cat has ended in a joyous reunion. Benny and Susanne Anguiano were reunited with their beloved feline, Rayne Beau, last month after he was found 800 miles (1,287 km) away in Roseville, California.</p>

<p>They had been camping in Yellowstone National Park in June when Rayne Beau was frightened by something in the woods and ran into the trees. They looked for it fruitlessly for 60 days, leaving out treats and toys recognisable to their pet, with no result.</p>

<p>"We had to leave without him," Susanne Anguiano told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ksbw.com/article/salinas-cat-travels-1000-miles-home-california-lost-yellowstone/62251513"><em>KSBW Action News 8.</em></a> "That was the hardest day because I felt like I was abandoning him."</p>

<p>But just when things were the worst, things took a dramatic turn when an animal welfare group contacted them, saying that Rayne Beau has been found in Roseville, California, 800 miles from Yellowstone.</p>

<p>The reunion was huge for the couple, as they were extremely happy to meet their pet, for whom they had already lost all hope.</p>

<p>"He was really depleted," said Susanne. "He probably didn't have a lot of energy to even go further."</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ksbw.com/article/salinas-cat-travels-1000-miles-home-california-lost-yellowstone/62251513"><em>news portal</em></a>, still, the couple does not know how their cat, in two months, was able to get from Yellowstone to Roseville, which is over 800 miles away. Now, they hope someone will see their story and recognize Rayne Beau.</p>

<p>"Hey, I remember that cat, and like we saw it here, we saw it there or even they took it in," said Benny.</p>

<p>The couple also wants to encourage other pet owners to take precautions, such as microchips or a global tracker, to protect their animals.</p>

<p>"Definitely microchip your cat or your pet and register the microchip online," said Susanne. "We would have never gotten them back had that not happened."</p>

<p>With Rayne Beau back home, reunited with his siblings and safe, they hope to take their cats back on trips again, but only when everyone is ready for it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The White House today met with a group of Sikhs who are sympathisers for the Khalistan movement hours before Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to land in the United States for a three-day official visit. The White House assured them "protection from any transnational aggression on its soil".</p>

<p>The White House said it is committed to "protecting American Citizens" from harm while they are within the borders of the United States.</p>

<p>This development comes amid concerns that Canada and the US are giving shelter and asylum to Khalistani separatists.</p>

<p>Groups aligned to the Khalistan separatist movement are banned in India and several of these organisations have carried out terrorist activities in the last few decades.</p>

<p>While the US has not made any official comment on "giving shelter" to such elements, Canada had called it their "freedom of speech".</p>

<p>In response, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had said, "India respects and practices freedom of speech, but freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom to support separatism. It does not equate with freedom to threaten foreign diplomats or allow political space to elements advocating violence."</p>

</div>

<p>"In any rule-based society, you would imagine that you would check people's background, how they came, what passports they carried etc," he had said.</p>

<p>"If you have people whose presence there was itself on very dubious documents, what does it say about you? It actually says that your vote-bank actually is more powerful than your rule of law," Mr Jaishankar had said.</p>

<h2><strong>THE WHITE HOUSE MEETING</strong></h2>

<p>The meeting at White House took place hours before PM Modi was to land in the US to attend the Quad summit in Delaware and to address the 'Summit of the Future' event at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.</p>

<p>The meeting was held within the official White House complex and was attended by Pritpal Singh of the American Sikh Caucus Committee and representatives from the Sikh Coalition and Sikh American Legal Defence and Education Fund (SALDEF).</p>

<p>"Yesterday we had the chance to thank senior federal government officials for saving the lives of Sikh Americans and for vigilance in protecting our community. We asked them to do more, and we will hold them to their assurances that they will," Pritpal Singh, founder of the American Sikh Caucus Committee told Press Trust of India.</p>

</div>

<p>In a social media post on X, Pritpal Singh thanked the US officials for their vigilance in protecting Sikh Americans."</p>

<p>"We will hold them to their assurances to do more to safeguard our community. Freedom and justice must prevail," he said.</p>

<p>This is the first time that the US National Security Council has held a meeting with Sikh separatists. No other details of the meeting are available yet.</p>

<p>What comes as a surprise is that the meeting was initiated by the White House.</p>

<h3><strong>US BRINGS NEW BILL</strong></h3>

<p>Earlier this week, US Congressman Adam Schiff introduced the 'Transnational Repression Reporting Act 2024' which requires the Attorney General, in coordination with other relevant federal agencies, to report cases of transnational repression against people in the United States.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2018-01/us-capitol-afp_650x400_71516663503.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>"Through this bill, Congress sends a strong message to both allies and adversaries that violating the constitutional rights of Americans will not be tolerated," Sikh group SALDEF which has openly supported Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar and has blamed India for his killing.</p>

<h3><strong>LAWSUIT AGAINST INDIA AND NSA AJIT DOVAL</strong></h3>

<p>This week Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, who is taking shelter in the United States, had also filed a civil lawsuit against the Government of India and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval after which the US District Court for the Southern District of New York issued summons in the case.</p>

<p>The summons names Government of India, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, former R&amp;AW chief Samant Goel, R&amp;AW agent Vikram Yadav, and an Indian national Nikhil Gupta, who has been charged by federal prosecutors in an indictment unsealed in November 2023 for allegedly "working with an Indian government employee" in the foiled plot to kill terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-06/3tvhgnuk_narendra-modi-s-jaishankar-ajit-doval-twitter_625x300_28_June_19.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The summons sought a reply within 21 days.</p>

<p>Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri has called it a "completely unwarranted case", adding that "I invite your attention to the person who filed this." He further said that Pannun's "antecedent is well-known" and that he is from an unlawful organisation.</p>

<p>Pannun heads the radical Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) and is known to put out incendiary speeches and threats against Indian leaders and institutions. New Delhi designated him a terrorist in 2020.</p>

<p>US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti has told NDTV that this matter will not affect India-US ties.</p>

<h3><strong>WHO IS GURPATWANT SINGH PANNUN</strong></h3>

<p>Gurpatwant Singh Pannun is a designated Khalistani terrorist. He was born and raised in Khankot village on the outskirts of Amritsar.</p>

<p>Pannun has claimed responsibility for several terror incidents in India. In April 2023, in a video shared on social media, he openly threatened to harm Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to Assam.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-05/2sqgcm4c_khalistani-terrorist-gurpatwant-singh-pannun-sheltered-in-us_625x300_07_May_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>He founded the Khalistan separatist group SFJ in 2007. India banned the SFJ in 2019 under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act or UAPA for its anti-India activities. In 2020, Pannun was designated a terrorist.</p>

<p>Pannun holds a dual citizenship of the United States as well as Canada and is currently in the US. His banned separatist organisation operates out of New York.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been accused by Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov of "remotely disabling" his Cybertruck, which was outfitted with a machine gun and sent to the frontline of Russia's war in Ukraine.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been accused by Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov of “remotely disabling” his Cybertruck, which was outfitted with a machine gun and sent to the frontline of Russia's war in Ukraine.</p>

<p dir="ltr">On Thursday, Kadyrov claimed in a post on Telegram that the vehicle was “performing well in combat,” but later it shut down. This was followed by another post on Friday wherein he stated that two more Tesla Cybertrucks have been sent to the frontline.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Kadyrov, known for his active involvement in Russia's military operations in neighbouring Ukraine, claimed that the high-tech vehicle had to be towed from the battlefield as it was "remotely" switched off, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/20/business/chechnya-kadyrov-musk-tesla-cybertruck-disabled/index.html">CNN </a>reported.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"What Elon Musk did was not nice. He gives expensive gifts from the heart and then remotely switches them off," Kadyrov wrote in Russian.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Kadyrov, the head of the Chechen Republic, said that the Cybertruck was sent to the Northern Military District. While it “coped well” in the combat missions, later it was towed after getting turned off, as per a<a href="http://https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40968441/russian-presidents-ally-ramzan-kadyrov-says-elon-musk-remotely-turned-off-his-cybertruck-in-russia"> Benzinga </a>report.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In another post on Friday, he informed that two more Cybertrucks were sent to the "SVO (Ukraine war) zone”. This time, Kadyrov also shared a video of the two Cybertrucks in a forested area, with each of them armed with mounted machine guns. The video features men in military uniforms in the truckbeds.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Kadyrov further claimed that the "remote shutdown" did not affected the two other vehicles, which are "operating normally, without any failures."</p>

<p dir="ltr">"You couldn't ask for better advertising for the Cybertruck," he added.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This comes after the Chechen warlord shared a video of himself driving a Cybertruck in August this year and said that it was a “gift” from Elon Musk. In that video, he was seen driving the vehicle in Grozny, the capital of Chechnya. He even thanked Musk for the Cybertruck and asserted that it will soon be sent to the front.</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, the Tesla CEO denied sending the vehicle to Kadyrov and replied to an X user, "Are you seriously so retarded that you think I donated a Cybertruck to a Russian general? That's amazing."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Musk&nbsp; though did not clarify how Kadyrov gained access to the vehicle, which is reported limited to sales within the US so far.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Both Tesla as well as Musk are yet to respond to Ramzan Kadyrov's latest claims.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The fully electric Tesla Cybertruck was unveiled by Musk in Los Angeles in 2019, with its retail prices starting at around $90,000.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran unveiled a new ballistic missile and an upgraded one-way attack drone at a military parade on Saturday, state media said, amid soaring regional tensions and allegations of arming Russia. Iran stands accused by Western governments of supplying both drones and missiles to Russia for use in its war with Ukraine, a charge it has repeatedly denied.</p>

<p>The solid-fuel Jihad missile was designed and manufactured by the aerospace arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guards and has an operational range of 1,000 kilometres (more than 600 miles), state news agency IRNA said.</p>

<p>The Shahed-136B drone is an upgraded version of the Shahed-136, with new features and an operational range of more than 4,000 kilometres (2,500 miles), it added.</p>

<p>New President Masoud Pezeshkian attended the annual parade in Tehran, commemorating the 1980-88 war with Saddam Hussein's Iraq.</p>

<p>"Today, our defensive and deterrent capabilities have grown so much that no demon even thinks about any aggression towards our dear Iran," he said.</p>

<p>"With unity and cohesion among Islamic countries... we can put in its place the bloodthirsty, genocidal usurper Israel, which shows no mercy to anyone, women or children, old or young."</p>

<p>The Middle East has been in turmoil since Iran-backed Palestinian group Hamas attacked Israel on October 7 sparking war in Gaza and drawing in Iranian allies around the region.</p>

<p>The tensions have intensified in recent days as the focus of Israel's firepower has shifted north to the Lebanon border where its troops have been battling the Iran-backed group Hezbollah.</p>

<p>An Israeli air strike on Hezbollah's Beirut stronghold killed 16 members of its elite Radwan Force on Friday, a source close to the group said, hot on the heels of deadly sabotage attacks on the group's communications earlier this week.</p>

<p>Britain, France, Germany, and the United States slapped new sanctions on Iran earlier this month, alleging that it had been providing ballistic missiles for Russia's war effort in Ukraine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The bodies of Suzanne Armstrong, 27, and Susan Bartlett, 28, were discovered at their house in Easey Street, Melbourne, on January 13, 1977, with multiple stab wounds.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 65-year-old man has been arrested in Rome over the "horrific, frenzied" 1977 murder of two women in their home in Melbourne, Australian police said Saturday. The bodies of Suzanne Armstrong, 27, and Susan Bartlett, 28, were discovered at their house in Easey Street, Melbourne, on January 13, 1977, with multiple stab wounds.</p>

<p>Armstrong had been raped. Her then 16-month-old son was found unharmed in his cot.</p>

<p>The women had last been seen alive three days earlier.</p>

<p>"It was an absolutely gruesome, horrific, frenzied homicide -- multiple stabbings," Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton told a news conference.</p>

<p>He described the 47-year-old crime, known as the Easey Street murders, as the state's longest and most serious cold case.</p>

<p>The suspect, a dual Greek-Australian citizen, had been living in Greece where he was protected by the country's statute of limitations, Patton said.</p>

<p>Police waited for him to leave the country, the chief commissioner added, and he was finally arrested Thursday in the Italian capital's Fiumicino airport under an Interpol red notice.</p>

<p>Australia will launch extradition procedures, he said.</p>

<p>Police had been helped by "technological advances" over the years, Patton said.</p>

<p>In 2017, they offered an Aus$1 million (US$680,000) reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction, he said, after new information had come to light.</p>

<p>He declined to give more details of the investigation.</p>

<p>A report in Melbourne's The Age newspaper, which police did not confirm, said police had decided to check the DNA of all 131 people named in the original police file.</p>

<p>The suspect was on that list and had agreed to undergo a DNA test but instead fled to Greece in 2017, the paper reported.</p>

<p>He was linked to the crime by the DNA of a close relative, it said.</p>

<p>According to The Age, the suspect had been stopped and searched on the night of the murders by local police who found a large knife on him -- three days before the bodies were discovered.</p>

<p>It is "understood" that the man -- then a teenager -- was not interviewed about the killings at the time as police focused on other suspects, the paper said.</p>

<p>A detective senior sergeant running the investigation since 2015 broke the news of the suspect's arrest to the victims' families on Saturday morning, Patton said.</p>

<p>The families were "emotional, speechless, overwhelmed, but appreciative that they hadn't been forgotten", he said.</p>

<p>"There is simply no expiry date on crimes that are as brutal as this. I think that is borne out here today."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A polar bear that made a rare appearance outside a cottage in a remote Icelandic village was shot by police after being deemed a threat to local residents. The bear was killed on September 19 in northwest Iceland after consultation with the Environment Agency, which opted against relocating the animal</p>

<p>“It's not something we like to do,” Westfjords police chief Helgi Jensson was quoted as saying by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/polar-bear-shot-iceland-policy-greenland-ice-0d3badd4b7f5e320d992ce7f0dc600fd">AP,</a> adding that the bear was very close to a summer house. “There was an old woman in there.” The woman, who was alone at the time, locked herself upstairs in fear as the bear rummaged through her garbage. She contacted her daughter in Reykjavik for assistance via satellite link.</p>

<p>“She stayed there,” Jensson said, adding that other summer residents had already left the area. “She knew the danger.”</p>

<p>Polar bears are not native to Iceland but sometimes drift ashore from Greenland on ice floes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bear shot on September 19 was the first sighted in Iceland since 2016, with only 600 recorded sightings since the ninth century. The bear, estimated to weigh between 150 and 200 kilograms, will be taken to the Icelandic Institute of Natural History for further study, said the report. Scientists plan to examine the bear for parasites and infections, assess its organ health and body fat percentage, and potentially preserve its pelt and skull for the institute's collection.</p>

<p>Although polar bears are a protected species in the country, authorities may take lethal action if they pose a threat to humans or livestock, according to the AP report.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While attacks on humans by polar bears are extremely rare, a study published in the <a href="https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wsb.783">Wildlife Society Bulletin in 2017 </a>said that the loss of sea ice due to climate change has led to more hungry bears venturing onto land, raising the risk of human encounters. The study revealed that from 1870 to 2014, there were 73 documented attacks by wild polar bears across the five polar bear Range States — Canada, Greenland, Norway, Russia and the United States — leading to 20 fatalities and 63 injuries among humans.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">An Indian-origin H-1B visa holder, diagnosed with terminal blood cancer, has reached out on social media seeking advice to secure his family's future.&nbsp;The man resides in the US with his wife (on a dependent H-4 visa) and their US-born daughter. He has sought help on the Facebook group ‘SOS Global Indians USA Solutions &amp; Networking For Indians In US' as an anonymous user.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“I have been diagnosed with blood cancer and have 6 months left. I am here on H1B, living with my wife (dependent visa) and a daughter born in the US. Is there any chance that they could continue living here after I am gone and not have to move to India? Want to have a future for them here,” he wrote.</p>

<p dir="ltr">A primary concern for him&nbsp;is how his wife can continue to stay and work in the US after his death. Many users in the group responded with support.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In an interaction with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/indianorigin-cancer-patient-seeks-h-1b-guidance-have-6-months-left-expert-weighs-in-101726819333130.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">Hindustan Times</a>, Indian-American visa podcaster Rahul Menon offered potential ways for the wife to remain in the US.</p>

<p dir="ltr">One option is for her to switch to her own H-1B visa, although this is limited to a filing window in April and requires finding an employer willing to sponsor her, which can be difficult given the high number of applicants.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Another possibility is applying for a cap-exempt H-1B visa through nonprofit organisations, but this limits her job opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Mr Menon also suggested that the wife could start a degree programme and apply for an F-1 student visa. This option may place additional financial strain as F-1 visas do not permit supplemental income.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The meeting of the Quad - a grouping of India, the US, Australia and Japan- comes at an important time amid an escalation between Israel and Hezbollah and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>Prime Minister Narendra Modi will land in Philadelphia around 10 am local time (7.30 pm IST) and then head to US President Joe Biden's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, where the two leaders will hold bilateral discussions. Apart from the relationship between the two countries, PM Modi's visits to Russia and Ukraine and a possible peace process are also likely to be discussed.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>An announcement may be made about the India-US space collaboration, under which Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla will be travelling to the International Space Station as part of the Axiom-4 mission. A multi-billion dollar deal in which India plans to acquire 31 predator drones from the US will also be discussed, but it is not clear whether the announcement will happen during the PM's visit.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>After the bilateral, PM Modi will attend the Quad summit with Mr Biden, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. White House Spokesperson John Kirby has said China will be high on the agenda. "In fact, it would be irresponsible if they didn't talk about the challenges that still exist in the region caused by aggressive People's Republic of China military action... for instance, unfair trade practices, tensions over the Taiwan Strait... I have no doubt that that all those issues will come up," he has said.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>On Day 2 of his visit, Prime Minister Modi will address a gathering of the Indian community in New York and interact with CEOs of leading companies. Collaboration in cutting-edge areas of artificial intelligence, quantum computing biotechnology and semiconductors will be discussed.</li>
	<li>Day 3 will see the Prime Minister addressing the 'Summit of the Future' at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on September 23. The theme of the summit is 'Multilateral Solutions for a Better Tomorrow' and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called it a 'once in a generation UN Summit'.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>PM Modi is also likely to hold bilateral discussions with some other world leaders on the sidelines of the UN summit.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Former US president Donald Trump, locked in a close contest with Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the presidential polls in November, has said he will be meeting Prime Minister Modi, whom he called "a fantastic man". The foreign ministry has not, however, confirmed that the meeting will take place.</li>
	<li>In his departure statement, PM Modi said, "I look forward to joining my colleagues President Biden, Prime Minister Albanese and Prime Minister Kishida for the Quad Summit. The forum has emerged as a key group of like-minded countries to work for peace, progress and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region."&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The PM said his bilateral with President Biden will allow the two leaders to identify new pathways to further deepen the India-US partnership. Stressing the importance of the UN summit, he said, "The Summit of the Future is an opportunity for the global community to chart the road ahead for the betterment of humanity. I will share the views of one-sixth of humanity as their stakes in a peaceful and secure future are among the highest in the world."</li>
	<li>The PM also said he was looking forward to engaging with the Indian community in the US as well as important American business leaders, who are "key stakeholders and provide vibrancy to the unique partnership between the largest and the oldest democracies of the world."</li>

       <description><![CDATA[Olivia Nuzzi, a political reporter for the New York Magazine, recently admitted to her editors that she was engaged in a relationship with former US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Olivia Nuzzi, a political reporter for the New York Magazine, has been placed on leave as a “third-party review” is being conducted after the disclosure of her personal relationship with former US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Nuzzi, the Washington correspondent of the magazine, recently admitted to her editors that she was engaged in a relationship “with a former subject relevant to the 2024 campaign while she was reporting on the campaign,” according to a statement by the news outlet on Thursday.</p>

<p dir="ltr">It also said Nuzzi, who has written extensive long-form pieces about US politics, including RFK Jr, violated the magazine's standards around disclosing conflicts of interests</p>

<p dir="ltr">The magazine stated that after reviewing her work, it did not find any "inaccuracies nor evidence of bias,” adding that she is "currently on leave from the magazine, and the magazine is conducting a more thorough third-party review”.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In a note to the staff members, David Haskell, the editor of New York magazine, stated that Olivia Nuzzi opened up about her relationship a few days ago, stating that it started in December 2023 and came to an end in August.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In a statement to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/business/media/olivia-nuzzi-rfk-jr.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">The New York Times</a>, Olivia Nuzzi said that “some communication between myself and a former reporting subject turned personal”.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“The relationship was never physical but should have been disclosed to prevent the appearance of a conflict. I deeply regret not doing so immediately and apologize to those I've disappointed, especially my colleagues at New York," she said.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Who is Olivia Nuzzi?</strong></h3>

<p dir="ltr">Born on January 6, 1993, in New York City, Olivia Nuzzi grew up in Middletown Township, New Jersey.</p>

<p dir="ltr">After completing her graduation from Middletown High School South, she went on to attend Fordham University. However, she reportedly dropped out of it after getting a full-time offer from The Daily Beast in 2014.</p>

<p dir="ltr">At the age of 20, Nuzzi interned for Anthony Weiner's New York City mayoral campaign. During the same time, she was hired by NSFWcorp as a staff writer and wrote about her experiences in a blog post.</p>

<p dir="ltr">While working for The Daily Beast she covered the presidential campaigns of Chris Christie and Rand Paul, besides former US president Donald Trump's ascent into politics.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Politico had in 2016 named her as one of the "16 Breakout Media Stars", while Forbes mentioned her in its "30 Under 30" list in 2018.</p>

<p dir="ltr">She was hired as the Washington correspondent for New York magazine in February 2017. In November last year, she worked on a profile of Kennedy, besides writing other features.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Olivia Nuzzi got engaged to Politico's chief Washington correspondent Ryan Lizza in 2022.</p>

<p dir="ltr">After Nuzzi's alleged relationship with Kennedy, Lizza in a note to readers said, "Because of my connection to this story through my ex-fiancee, my editors and I have agreed that I won't be involved in any coverage of Kennedy in Playbook or elsewhere at POLITICO".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's arrival in the US for the Quad Summit, US President Joe Biden hosted Australian PM Anthony Albanese for a one-on-one meeting at his Delaware house on Friday.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">PM Modi will attend the weekend summit with the Quad group– Australia, US and Japan. He is on a three-day visit to the US, the first after securing a third consecutive term.</p>

<p dir="ltr">US President Biden has opted for his hometown of Wilmington–around 170 kilometres from Washington– to host the farewell summit for Quad leaders.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Post the one-on-one meeting with Albanese at his property on Friday night, Biden will now welcome the PM Modi as well as Japanese PM Fumio Kishida at his house on Saturday, AFP reported.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Thereafter, he will host an "intimate" dinner as well and a full four-way summit at his former high school in the city, the report added.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Quad summit will be the last major event of Biden's presidency as the 81-year-old opted out from the November 5 US presidential elections against former president Donald Trump, handing the Democratic campaign reins to US Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p dir="ltr">US Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said this will be the first time when Biden will host foreign leaders in his hometown as President, adding that it is "a reflection of his deep personal relationships with each of the Quad Leaders".</p>

<p dir="ltr">The White House noted that Kamala Harris is not expected to attend the meeting.</p>

<p dir="ltr">During their Friday meeting, Biden and Albanese discussed diplomacy with China, besides sharing concerns about the country's "coercive and destabilising activities," an official statement said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Over the years, the US President has heavily pushed the Quad grouping, which was formed in 2007 as part of the emphasis on international alliances, the report stated.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>What's on PM Modi's agenda?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">In the US, apart from the Quad summit, PM Modi will address the 'Summit of the Future' at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York, besides holding a roundtable with CEOs of major American firms that are working in the tech sector.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Taking about the Quad Summit, PM Modi in his departure statement on Saturday said, "The forum has emerged as a key group of like-minded countries to work for peace, progress and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region."</p>

<p dir="ltr">He noted that his meeting his Biden will allow them to review and identify new pathways for further deepening the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership for the benefit of the people and global good.</p>

<p dir="ltr">India will be hosting the next Quad Summit in 2025.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Native to West Africa, the pygmy hippo is threatened by human activities, such as logging, mining and poaching, and there are only 2,000 to 2,500 left in the world, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p>

<p>Hundreds of visitors queued at the zoo for five minutes in the enclosure.</p>

<p>One group said they woke up at 5:00 am to make the two-hour drive from Bangkok to see the celebrity.</p>

<p>A visitor said she hoped more Thais would come and "post about Moo Deng online so that more people will come to see her".</p>

<p>Moo Deng's caretaker and social media manager Atthapon Nundee, 31, said the rise of short-form videos has turbocharged the pygmi hippo's fame and hopes it will be a boon for biodiversity preservation.</p>

<p>"With more and more images of pygmy hippos online, more people fell in love with them. They are poached in the wild, so with more people caring about them, it might prevent their poaching," he told AFP.</p>

<p>A 2022 study published by the Royal Society of Canada's Academy of Science shows that social media can play both positive and negative roles in wildlife conservation.</p>

<p>Public attention may help raise awareness about endangered wildlife but can increase the risk of species exploitation as more people try to come in contact with them.</p>

<p>Zoo management says the extra earnings from skyrocketing visitor numbers -- almost double over the weekend -- will go towards improving the pygmy hippo enclosure and the zoo's public awareness campaigns.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Cristiana Barsony-Arcidiacono, a 49-year-old Hungarian-Italian businesswoman, has found herself at the centre of international headlines following the explosion of pagers that killed 12 people and wounded over 2,000.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She is the CEO of Hungary-based BAC Consulting, which&nbsp;was revealed to have licensed the design for the pagers from their original Taiwanese manufacturer Gold Apollo. Cristiana Barsony-Arcidiacono has denied direct involvement in the manufacture of the pagers. In a brief interview with <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/taiwan-firm-denies-making-pagers-used-lebanon-explosions-rcna171594">NBC News</a>, she said, “I am just the intermediate. I think you got it wrong.”</p>

<p>Here are a few details about Cristiana Barsony-Arcidiacono:&nbsp;</p>

<p>–&nbsp;Cristiana Barsony-Arcidiacono grew up near the port city of Catania in Itay's Sicily region. She attended school nearby was has been described as a reserved youngster by her then-schoolmates.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">– Cristiana Barsony-Arcidiacono holds a PhD in particle physics from University College London. Her dissertation was on the sub-atomic particle positron.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">– She has worked across various fields, from humanitarian work in Africa to claims of involvement in scientific and international organisations. However, many of her alleged senior roles, including as a project manager at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and board member of New York's Earth Child Institute, have been debunked. The IAEA confirmed she was merely an intern, and the Earth Child Institute stated she had no formal role there.</p>

<p dir="ltr">–&nbsp;Described as intelligent but erratic by former colleagues, Barsony-Arcidiacono's career spans multiple continents and industries. She is believed to speak as many as 7 languages. She has held numerous short-term jobs, including one in Tunisia, where her contract was terminated early after being described as a “bullying” manager.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">– In the aftermath of the pager explosions, Barsony-Arcidiacono's mother revealed that her daughter is under the protection of Hungarian secret services due to threats she has received. This has only deepened the mystery surrounding her.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">US space agency NASA has recorded an eerie audio clip that captures sound waves coming from near a supermassive black hole situated 250 million light years away. The acoustic waves, coming from near the black hole located at the heart of the Perseus cluster of galaxies, were transposed up 57 and 58 octaves to make them audible for human ears.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The audio was released in 2022 and it was the first time when the sound waves were extracted and made audible.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Sound vibrations (waves) do exist in space, even though we might not be able to hear them naturally.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In a surprising discovery in 2003, astronomers detected acoustic waves rippling out through the huge amounts of gas surrounding the supermassive black hole at the Perseus galaxy cluster, which is now popular for its eerie humming sound.</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ioR5np1fmEc?si=j_mmSoSCwg4vTqYA" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p dir="ltr">It is difficult to hear them at their current pitch as it includes the lowest note ever detected in the universe by humans – much below the limits of human hearing.</p>

<p dir="ltr">NASA's recent sonification has majorly amplified these sound waves, in order to get a sense of how they would sound like while ringing through the intergalactic space.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The lowest note, which was identified in 2003, is a B-flat and is located over 57 octaves below middle C, the report said, adding that its frequency is 10 million years at that pitch.</p>

<p dir="ltr">It is to be noted that the lowest note that can be detected by human ears has a frequency of one-twentieth of a second.</p>

<p dir="ltr">After being extracted radically from the supermassive black hole, these sound waves were played in an anti-clockwise direction from the center.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">This was done to make them audible in all directions from around the supermassive black hole at the enhanced pitches of 144 quadrillion and 288 quadrillion higher then their original frequency.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Like several other waves recorded from space, the result for this one was eerie too.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The tenuous gas and plasma, which drifts between the galaxies, in clusters known as the 'intracluster medium' is denser and much hotter than the intergalactic medium outside it. As the temperatures help to regulate&nbsp;star formation, hence sound waves could play a pivotal role in galaxy clusters' evolution over longer periods.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Rinson Jose, an Indian emigrant to Norway, has been linked to the Hezbollah pager blasts in Lebanon, which killed 12 people. Reports have suggested that Norta Global, a Bulgaria-based company owned by him, had a role in supplying the pagers.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>Born in Kerala's Wayanad, Jose went to Norway to pursue higher studies a few years ago. He briefly worked in London before going back to Oslo.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Relatives told news agency IANS that Jose is settled with his wife in Oslo and has a twin brother based in London. "We speak daily over the phone. However, for the last three days, we have had no contact with Jose. He is a straightforward person and we trust him fully. He will not be part of any wrongdoing. He may have been trapped in these blasts," Thankachen, a relative of the 37-year-old, said on Friday.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Jose founded Norta Global Ltd in April 22. The company is based in Bulgaria's Sofia and declared a revenue of $ 725,000 (approximately Rs 6 crore) for consulting activities outside the European Union last year.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>According to his LinkedIn page, he has also worked for almost five years in digital customer support for Norwegian press group DN Media, news agency AFP reported. DN Media told newspaper Verdens Gang that he has been on an overseas work trip since Tuesday and that they have not been able to contact him.</li>
	<li>Bulgarian state security agency DANS said on Friday that the pagers used in the blasts in Lebanon were not imported, exported or manufactured in Bulgaria. It added that the company and its owner had "not carried out any transactions linked to the sale or purchase of the merchandise" or that "fall under laws on terrorism financing".</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk-owned social media platform X has named a legal representative in Brazil, the firm's lawyers said on Friday, in a move that would address one of the demands imposed by Brazil's top court to allow the company to operate in the country.</p>

<p>Andre Zonaro and Sergio Rosenthal, who were recently appointed as X's lawyers in Brazil, told Reuters that colleague Rachel de Oliveira Conceicao was chosen as the firm's legal representative, and that they had submitted her name to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Brazilian law requires foreign companies to name a legal representative to operate in the country. The representative would assume the legal responsibilities for the firm locally.</p>

<p>X had a legal representative in Brazil until mid-August, when it decided to close its offices in the country.</p>

<p>In late August, Brazil's top court ordered mobile and internet service providers to block X in the nation, and users were cut off within hours after X did not name a new legal representative.</p>

<p>The move followed a months-long dispute between Musk and Brazilian Justice Alexandre de Moraes over the firm's non-compliance with court orders demanding the platform take action against the spread of hate speech.</p>

<p>Courts have previously blocked accounts implicated in probes of spreading misinformation and hate, which Musk has denounced as censorship.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the lawyers representing X in Brazil said the firm was starting to comply with orders on removing content, another demand from the top court.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Mark Robinson denied the allegations and called them "tabloid trash".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">North Carolina's Republican gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson allegedly referred to himself as a “Black Nazi,” insulted Martin Luther King Jr, used antisemitic and homophobic slurs, and praised slavery in comments on a pornographic website before entering politics, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/19/politics/kfile-mark-robinson-black-nazi-pro-slavery-porn-forum/index.html">according to a CNN report</a>. The CNN investigation connects Robinson to a user named ‘minisoldr' who made the inflammatory remarks.</p>

<p>Robinson, who is also North Carolina's lieutenant governor, denied the allegations and called them “tabloid trash". He told CNN, “This is not us. These are not our words. And this is not anything that is characteristic of me."</p>

<p>The comments, which date back to between 2008 and 2012, were posted on a pornographic website.</p>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Among the most aggressive remarks attributed to Mark Robinson, under the username ‘minisoldr,' were statements supporting the reinstatement of slavery and Nazi ideology.</p>

<p>“Slavery is not bad. Some people need to be slaves,” one post read, while another said, “I'm a black NAZI!”.</p>

<p>In another post, Robinson allegedly expressed a preference for Adolf Hitler over US leadership during the Obama administration.</p>

<p>Robinson also allegedly referred to Martin Luther King Jr as a “f***ing commie b***ard” and suggested that if he were in the Ku Klux Klan, he would have called King “Martin Lucifer Koon.”</p>

<p>Robinson denied these allegations in a video posted to his X (formerly Twitter) account, stating that those were not his words. He also claimed that his Democratic opponent, Attorney General Josh Stein, was behind the alleged leak to CNN.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Even during an interview with CNN, Robinson rejected any connection to these comments, saying, “I'm not going to get into the minutia of how somebody manufactured this, these salacious tabloid lies.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, CNN identified Robinson was ‘minisoldr' through his email address, biographical references, and unique phrases he had used elsewhere online. Robinson has also reportedly used the ‘minisoldr' username on other websites.</p>

<p>Despite the turmoil, Robinson remains defiant. “We are not getting out of this race. There are people who are counting on us to win this race,” he said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Robinson, who has been endorsed by Trump, is currently trailing his Democratic opponent Josh Stein in the polls. If elected, Robinson would become North Carolina's first Black governor.</p>

<p>Asked about the CNN report about Robinson, Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson, said "President Trump's campaign is focused on winning the White House and saving this country."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe is fighting an uphill battle for a fresh mandate to continue belt-tightening measures that stabilised the economy.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cash-strapped Sri Lanka was voting for its next president Saturday in an effective referendum on an unpopular International Monetary Fund austerity plan enacted after the island nation's unprecedented financial crisis. President Ranil Wickremesinghe is fighting an uphill battle for a fresh mandate to continue belt-tightening measures that stabilised the economy and ended months of food, fuel, and medicine shortages. His two years in office restored calm to the streets after civil unrest spurred by the downturn in 2022 saw thousands storm the compound of his predecessor, who promptly fled the country.</p>

<p>"We must continue with reforms to end bankruptcy," Wickremesinghe, 75, said at his final rally in the capital Colombo this week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Decide if you want to go back to the period of terror, or progress."</p>

<p>But Wickremesinghe's tax hikes and other measures, imposed per the terms of a $2.9-billion IMF bailout, have left millions struggling to make ends meet.</p>

<p>"The country needs new leadership," newspaper vendor Sunil, who did not give his surname, told AFP. "We need change."</p>

<p>Wickremesinghe is tipped to lose to one of two formidable challengers including Anura Kumara Dissanayaka, the leader of a once-marginal Marxist party tarnished by its violent past.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sri Lanka's crisis has proven an opportunity for the 55-year-old Dissanayaka, who has seen a surge of support based on his pledge to change the island's "corrupt" political culture.</p>

<p>Fellow opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, 57, the son of a former president assassinated in 1993 during the country's decades-long civil war, is also expected to make a strong showing.</p>

<p>"There is a significant number of voters trying to send a strong message... that they are very disappointed with the way this country has been governed," Murtaza Jafferjee of think tank Advocata told AFP.</p>

<p>A total of 39 people are contesting the vote, including one 79-year-old candidate who remains on the ballot despite dying of a heart attack last month.</p>

<h3><strong>'Wild elephants'</strong></h3>

<p>More than 17 million people are eligible to vote in the election, with more than 63,000 police deployed to guard polling booths and counting centres.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We also have anti-riot squads on standby in case of any trouble, but so far everything is peaceful," police spokesman Nihal Talduwa said.</p>

<p>"In some areas, we have had to deploy police to ensure polling booths are safe from wild animals, especially wild elephants."</p>

<p>Dozens of people were lining up outside polling stations in Colombo before voting began.</p>

<p>Polls close at 4:00 pm (1030 GMT) with counting to begin on Saturday evening.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A result is expected on Sunday, but an official outcome could be delayed if the contest is close.</p>

<p>Schools were closed on Friday to be converted to polling stations, which will be staffed by more than 200,000 public servants deployed to conduct the vote.</p>

<h3><strong>'Not out of the woods'</strong></h3>

<p>Economic issues dominated the eight-week campaign, with public anger widespread over the hardships endured since the peak of the crisis two years ago.</p>

<p>Official data showed that Sri Lanka's poverty rate doubled to 25 percent between 2021 and 2022, adding more than 2.5 million people to those already living on less than $3.65 a day.</p>

<p>Experts warn that Sri Lanka's economy is still vulnerable, with payments on the island's $46-billion foreign debt yet to resume since a 2022 government default.</p>

<p>The IMF said reforms enacted by Wickremesinghe's government were beginning to pay off, with growth slowly returning.</p>

<p>"A lot of progress has been made," the IMF's Julie Kozack told reporters in Washington last week.</p>

<p>"But the country is not out of the woods yet."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The name of an Indian emigrant to Norway has cropped up in the investigation into the pager blasts aimed at Hezbollah operatives, which killed 12 people in Lebanon and left thousands injured. Now a Norwegian citizen, Rinson Jose migrated to the country from Wayanad in Kerala and reports had initially suggested that a company owned by the 37-year-old in Bulgaria was involved in the supply of the pagers to the militant group.</p>

<p>Initial investigations had revealed that the pagers, which had reportedly been modified by Mossad to hide three grams of explosives in each device, were manufactured by a Taiwan-based company, Gold Apollo. In a statement, the company said, however, that the pager model used in the blast, AR-924, was actually manufactured and sold by BAC Consulting KFT, a company based in Hungary's Budapest, which had been authorised to use its trademark.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then, on Thursday, two days after the pagers exploded, Bulgarian state security agency DANS said it was coordinating with the country's interior ministry and probing the role of a company, whose name was later revealed to be Norta Global Ltd. The company, which was registered in Sofia in 2022, was found to be owned by a Norwegian, Rinson Jose.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A day later, on Friday, however, DANS said the pagers used in the blasts in Lebanon were not imported, exported or manufactured in Bulgaria.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Following verifications, it has been indisputably established that no communication equipment corresponding to those that exploded on September 17 was imported, exported or manufactured in Bulgaria," the agency was quoted as saying by news agency AFP.</p>

<p>It added that the company and its owner had "not carried out any transactions linked to the sale or purchase of the merchandise" or that "fall under laws on terrorism financing".</p>

<p>Police in Norway's Oslo said they have opened a "preliminary investigation into the information that has emerged".</p>

<p><strong>'Went To Norway To Study'</strong></p>

<p>According to a report by news agency IANS, Jose went to Norway to pursue higher studies a few years ago. He briefly worked in London before going back to Oslo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to his LinkedIn page, he has also worked for almost five years in digital customer support for Norwegian press group DN Media, AFP reported. DN Media told newspaper Verdens Gang that he has been on an overseas work trip since Tuesday and that they have not been able to reach him.</p>

<p>Relatives told IANS that Jose is settled with his wife in Oslo and has a twin brother based in London. "We speak daily over the phone. However, for the last three days, we have had no contact with Jose. He is a straightforward person and we trust him fully. He will not be part of any wrongdoing. He may have been trapped in these blasts," Thankachen, a relative of the 37-year-old, told the news agency on Friday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He added that they have not been able to contact Jose's wife either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Norta Global, founded by Jose, declared a revenue of $ 725,000 (approximately Rs 6 crore) for consulting activities outside the European Union last year.&nbsp;</p>

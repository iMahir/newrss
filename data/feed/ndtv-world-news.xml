       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Sunday called on all sides to exercise "caution" on the border between Israel and Lebanon, in his first telephone conversation since he was elected with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

<p>Starmer told his counterpart the "situation on the northern border of Israel was very concerning, and it was crucial all parties acted with caution", a spokesperson for his 10 Downing Street office said.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Hezbollah movement on Sunday fired another 20 rockets at northern Israel, leaving one person injured there, the latest cross-border attacks launched in solidarity with Gaza's Palestinian group Hamas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hezbollah has traded near daily fire with the Israeli army across Lebanon's southern border since its Palestinian ally Hamas attacked Israel last year, triggering the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Discussing the conflict, the prime minister reiterated his condolences for the mass loss of life during the October 7 attacks, the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>"He then set out the clear and urgent need for a ceasefire, the return of hostages and an immediate increase in the volume of humanitarian aid reaching civilians."</p>

<p>In his conversation with Netanyahu, Starmer added that it was also "important to ensure the long-term conditions for a two-state solution were in place, including ensuring the Palestinian Authority had the financial means to operate effectively".</p>

<p>Efforts towards a truce are continuing with US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators hoping to halt the worst-ever Gaza war, which has caused mass civilian casualties and devastated the coastal territory.</p>

<p>The spokesperson said the prime minister also spoke by phone to Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas.</p>

<p>Starmer told Abbas that his "longstanding policy on recognition to contribute to a peace process had not changed, and it was the undeniable right of Palestinians".</p>

<p>The October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hamas also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 42 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>In response, Israel's military offensive has killed at least 38,153 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden was back out on the campaign trail Sunday, desperate to salvage his reelection bid as senior Democrats meet to discuss growing calls that he quit the White House race.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old Democrat kicks off a grueling week with two campaign events in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, before hosting the NATO leaders' summit in Washington.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He will do so under an increasingly unforgiving spotlight, as pressure mounts for him to drop out after his disastrous debate against Donald Trump last month ignited panic over his age and fitness to serve another four years.</p>

<p>Biden has remained defiant, unequivocally declaring -- at a rally, to reporters and on social media -- that he is fit to serve, the only one who can defeat Trump, and staying in the race.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I beat Trump in 2020. I'm going to beat him again in 2024," his campaign social media account posted Saturday.</p>

<p>But a televised interview with ABC News on Friday has failed to quell concerns. His next major test in the public eye after Sunday's forays will be a press conference scheduled for Thursday, during the NATO summit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So far, five Democratic lawmakers have called on Biden to drop out, with the drumbeat of dissent slowly rising.</p>

<p>Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, a close Biden ally, stressed he believes Biden can still recover and win. But he said "the president needs to do more," including unscripted events like town hall gatherings, to reassure voters he has the mental acuity and physical fitness for a second term.</p>

<p>"I think this week is going to be absolutely critical," Murphy told CNN's Sunday talk show "State of the Union," adding he believes there are many voters who need to be convinced of Biden's capabilities.</p>

<p>"If he can't do that, then of course he's going to have to make a decision about what's best for the country."</p>

<p>Those comments came as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has scheduled a virtual meeting of senior Democratic representatives for Sunday to discuss the best way forward, and Democratic Senator Mark Warner is reportedly working to convene a similar forum in the upper chamber.</p>

<p>First Lady Jill Biden, who -- according to some US media reports -- is urging her husband to stay in the race, is scheduled to campaign for him Monday in Georgia, Florida and North Carolina.</p>

<p>But after Sunday's stops in Philadelphia and Harrisburg, the president will have to step away from the trail for the NATO summit beginning Tuesday.</p>

<p>Here, too, he will find himself having to reassure allies at a time when many European countries fear a Trump victory in November.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 78-year-old Republican has long criticized the transatlantic defense alliance as an unfair burden on the United States, voiced admiration for Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, and insisted he could bring about a quick end to the fighting in Ukraine, where Moscow's invasion is in its third year.</p>

<h3><strong>'Lord Almighty'</strong></h3>

<p>For now, Democratic heavyweights are largely keeping a lid on any simmering discontent with their leader -- at least in public.</p>

<p>But with election day just four months away, any move to replace Biden as the nominee would need to be made sooner rather than later, and the party will be scrutinized for any signs of more open rebellion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, for Biden and his team, the strategy seems to be to ride it out.</p>

<p>The campaign has unveiled an intense battle plan for July, including an avalanche of TV spots and trips to all the key states.</p>

<p>That includes a visit to the US Southwest during the Republican convention July 15-18, at which Trump is set to be anointed the party's official presidential nominee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In what had been billed as a make-or-break Friday interview with ABC News, Biden flatly dismissed his falling poll numbers and concerns over his fitness triggered by his dismal June 27 performance against Trump.</p>

<p>But some of his answers were tentative or meandering, even as he deflected questions about his mental acuity and dismissed the notion his party would consider replacing him.</p>

<p>"If the Lord Almighty came down and said, 'Joe, get out of the race,' I'd get out of the race," he said.</p>

<p>"But the Lord Almighty is not coming down."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Newly-elected Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Sunday began a whistlestop tour of UK nations, promising an "immediate reset" of relations with the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Newly-elected Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Sunday began a whistlestop tour of UK nations, promising an "immediate reset" of relations with the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Starmer was due to meet Scotland's First Minister and leader of the pro-separatist Scottish National Party (SNP) John Swinney in Edinburgh ahead of trips to Cardiff and Belfast expected on Monday.</p>

<p>The meeting comes as the SNP was almost wiped out at last week's election which put Starmer's Labour Party in power by a landslide.</p>

<p>Labour, which crushed Rishi Sunak's ruling Conservatives at the polls, also overturned more than a decade of SNP domination in Scotland by capturing the majority of its 57 seats.</p>

<p>Swinney lamented a "very, very difficult and damaging" election result for his party.</p>

<p>He had set the party's sights on winning 29 seats as a mandate for reopening negotiations with the British government for another independence referendum, but it returned only nine MPs.</p>

<h3><strong>'Seat at the table'</strong></h3>

<p>Under ex-premier Tony Blair, Labour was the architect of devolving power to the regions in the late 1990s with the setting up of parliaments or national assemblies in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast.</p>

<p>But under the Conservatives leaders in the three capitals complained that they were increasingly sidelined.</p>

<p>Starmer said disagreement could be turned into cooperation "and a genuine seat at the table" to deliver the UK-wide change he has promised.</p>

<p>"That begins today with an immediate reset of my government's approach to working with the first and deputy first ministers, because meaningful cooperation centred on respect will be key to delivering change across our United Kingdom."</p>

<p>The devolved administrations have the power to set policy in a range of areas such as education and housing.</p>

<p>Responsibility for policy on matters such as national defence, international relations and the monarchy, however, are the sole preserve of the UK-wide Westminster parliament in London.</p>

<h3><strong>SNP in turmoil</strong></h3>

<p>Swinney said he was looking forward to discussions on shared priorities.</p>

<p>Those included "eradicating child poverty, growing the economy, prioritising net zero, and ensuring effective public services", he said in a statement.</p>

<p>The SNP has dominated in Scotland in the last three UK elections, peaking with the 2015 vote when it won 56 out of 59 seats.</p>

<p>But the party has been in turmoil for months as voters tire of its 17 years in charge of the devolved Scottish parliament in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Critics accuse it of focusing on independence at the expense of key issues such as the cost-of-living crisis, education and health.</p>

<p>Support for the SNP has also slumped amid the party finances scandal that saw former SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon's husband, Peter Murrell, charged with embezzlement. Murrell is the party's former chief executive.</p>

<p>Sturgeon herself was arrested, but released without charge.</p>

<h3><strong>'Control immigration'</strong></h3>

<p>Starmer will make his debut on the international stage as leader when he flies to Washington next week for a NATO summit.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister David Lammy meanwhile travelled to Berlin to meet his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock, in his first in-post trip.</p>

<p>The ministers discussed issues from boosting NATO's support for Ukraine to the situation in the Middle East, the German foreign ministry wrote on X, formerly Twitter.</p>

<p>"The United Kingdom is an indispensable part of Europe," the ministry wrote, adding that Germany is "working with the new UK government to see how the UK an move closer to the EU".</p>

<p>Earlier Sunday, as Starmer began his second full day at the helm, former three-time Labour prime minister Blair made an early intervention, urging him to have a "plan to control immigration".</p>

<p>Blair warned Starmer that the anti-immigration Reform UK Party also posed a challenge to Labour, not just the Conservative Party.</p>

<p>"We need a plan to control immigration. If we don't have rules, we get prejudices," Blair wrote in the Sunday Times, advocating the introduction of digital ID.</p>

<p>Business Minister Jonathan Reynolds later ruled the idea out.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas is waiting for a response from Israel on its ceasefire proposal, two officials from the Palestinian group said on Sunday, five days after it accepted a key part of a U.S. plan aimed at ending the nine-month-old war in Gaza.</p>

<p>"We have left our response with the mediators and are waiting to hear the occupation's response," one of the two Hamas officials told Reuters, asking not to be identified.</p>

<p>The three-phase plan for the Palestinian enclave was put forward at the end of May by U.S. President Joe Biden and is being mediated by Qatar and Egypt. It aims to end the war and free around 120 Israeli hostages being held by Hamas.</p>

<p>Another Palestinian official, with knowledge of the ceasefire deliberations, said Israel was in talks with the Qataris.</p>

<p>"They have discussed with them Hamas' response and they promised to give them Israel's response within days," the official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters on Sunday.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that negotiations would continue this week but has not given any detailed timeline.</p>

<p>Later in the day, an Israeli air strike killed Ehab Al-Ghussein, the Hamas-appointed deputy minister of labour, and three other people at a church-run school in western Gaza City sheltering Christian and Muslim families, Hamas media and the Civil Emergency Service said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it was looking into the report. Ghussein's wife and children had already been killed in an Israeli strike in May.</p>

<p>Hamas, which controls Gaza, has dropped a key demand that Israel first commit to a permanent ceasefire before it would sign an agreement. Instead, it said it would allow negotiations to achieve that throughout the six-week first phase, a Hamas source told Reuters on Saturday on condition of anonymity because the talks are private.</p>

<p>A Palestinian official close to the peace efforts has said the proposal could lead to a framework agreement if embraced by Israel and would end the war.</p>

<p>U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns will travel to Qatar this week for negotiations, a source familiar with the matter said.</p>

<p>The conflict was triggered nine months ago on Oct. 7 when Hamas-led fighters attacked southern Israel from Gaza, killing 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostages in the worst assault in Israel's history, according to official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>More than 38,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military onslaught, according to Gaza health officials, and the coastal enclave has largely been reduced to rubble.</p>

<p>The U.N. agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, called the situation increasingly tragic, saying in a post on X, "families continue to face forced displacement, massive destruction and constant fear. Essential supplies are lacking, the heat is unbearable, diseases are spreading".</p>

<h3><strong>Protests In Israel</strong></h3>

<p>Protesters took to the streets across Israel on Sunday to pressure the government to reach an accord to bring back hostages still being held in Gaza.</p>

<p>They blocked rush hour traffic at major intersections across the country, picketed politicians houses and briefly set fire to tires on the main Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway before police cleared the way.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, fighting continued to rage across Gaza, and north Israel came under rocket attack from Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Air raid sirens sent residents of 24 Israeli towns running for shelter. One person was seriously wounded, police said. Hezbollah said it had fired rockets at an army base.</p>

<p>In Gaza, Palestinian health officials said at least 15 people were killed in separate Israeli military strikes on Sunday.</p>

<p>An Israeli air strike on a house in the town of Zawayda, in central Gaza, killed at least six people and wounded several others, while six others were killed in an air strike on a house in western Gaza, the health officials said.</p>

<p>Tanks deepened their raids in central and northern areas of Rafah on the southern border with Egypt. Health officials there said they had recovered three bodies of Palestinians killed by Israeli fire in the eastern part of the city.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said on Sunday its forces had killed 30 Palestinian gunmen in Rafah during close combat and air strikes in the past day.</p>

<p>In Shejaia, an eastern suburb of Gaza City, the military said its forces killed several Palestinian gunmen, and located weapons and explosives.</p>

<p>The armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, an allied fighter group, said fighters attacked Israeli forces in several locations across the Gaza Strip with anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The woman has alleged that the incident left her shocked, angry, and caused lasting depression along with other psychological and emotional distress.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman in New Jersey is suing the ride-hailing company Lyft and one of its drivers after she had a ''traumatic'' experience&nbsp;mid-ride. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/06/us-news/lyft-driver-peed-while-behind-the-wheel-rider-claims-in-lawsuit/">New York Post</a></em>, the unnamed woman was on her way to work when the driver allegedly exposed himself to her and began urinating in a plastic container. The incident happened in March this year, when the woman&nbsp;called the Lyft to get from her Fort Lee, NJ home to her job at Mount Sinai West in Midtown.</p>

<p>''The driver took his p***s out of his pants and began urinating in a plastic container … somewhere on a public road on the westside of Manhattan,” the woman claimed in her Manhattan Supreme Court filing against Lyft and driver.</p>

<p>The woman has alleged that the incident left her shocked, angry, and caused lasting depression along with other psychological and emotional distress. She argued in her complaint that the&nbsp;alleged "public lewdness and exposure of himself" amounts to sexual assault.</p>

<p>She also added that the driver identified as Luis ''had the apparent ability to cause imminent harmful or offensive bodily contact through the lewd act.''</p>

<p>In court documents, she described the behavior as "so outrageous, shocking, abhorrent, and despicable that it exceeded the bounds of decency."</p>

<p>She alleged that Lyft was negligent in hiring Luis and failed to protect passengers from "sexual predators." The lawsuit further accused the company of neglecting to recognize "signs that (Luis) was abusing his position to expose himself to passengers."</p>

<p>The woman said that she wishes to remain anonymous to avoid not only embarrassment but also ''the social stigmatization associated with having been sexually assaulted." According to court papers, she continues to feel "shame and anxiety'' and has asked the court to shield her name to protect her privacy and well-being.</p>

<p>In 2021, the San Francisco-based company released its <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/q8mvene1wzq4/4jxkFTH5YCQK8T96STULMd/4269e14dbcb8578ff64da45df08b8147/Community_Safety_Report.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Community Safety Report</a>&nbsp;detailing 4,158 reports of sexual assault during rides from 2017 through 2019, including 360 involving rape.</p>

<p>These incidents happened despite Lyft screening its drivers&nbsp;for criminal offences and driving infractions prior to being hired.&nbsp;The company also utilizes a third-party firm to conduct further background checks, including a nationwide sex offender registry search.</p>

<p></p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang on Sunday congratulated new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on his election, state media reported, the first senior leader in Beijing to do so publicly.</p>

<p>China is "willing to work with the new UK government to consolidate mutual political trust and expand mutually beneficial cooperation", Li told Starmer, according to state news agency Xinhua.</p>

<p>Their call came after days of silence from top officials in Beijing, with the Chinese foreign ministry saying only that it noted the results of the UK election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By comparison, Chinese leader Xi Jinping congratulated Iran's incoming president Masoud Pezeshkian just hours after his election on Saturday.</p>

<p>China was Britain's fifth-largest trading partner as of 2023, according to the UK Department for Business and Trade.</p>

<p>But diplomatic relations between the two countries have been icy in recent years, with Beijing and London sparring over tightening communist control in former British colony Hong Kong.</p>

<p>The two sides have also traded accusations of espionage, with Beijing saying last month that MI6 had recruited Chinese state employees to spy for the UK.</p>

<p>Xinhua on Sunday said Li told Starmer that the "strengthening of bilateral coordination and cooperation was in the interests of both sides".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India's Ambassador to Russia, Vinay Kumar, has called Prime Minister Narendra Modi's upcoming visit to Russia "very significant" and noted that it is taking place after a gap of three years.</p>

<p>Speaking to ANI, Vinay Kumar stated that the visit of PM Modi is "very important" for the two leaders to exchange views on developments in bilateral ties and discuss other regional and important issues of mutual interest.</p>

<p>He noted said the two nations have the tradition of annual exchange of summit-level meetings between the Russian President and Indian Prime Minister and added that the last one took place in 2021.</p>

<p>Notably, this will be the 22nd India-Russia Annual Bilateral Summit. The 21st bilateral Summit was held in December 2021 when Russian President Vladimir Putin visited New Delhi.</p>

<p>Asked about the importance of PM Modi's first overseas visit after being sworn in as PM of India for the third time, he responded, "The visit is very significant. It is taking place after a gap of three years. We have the tradition of the annual exchange of summit-level meetings between the President of the Russian Federation and the Prime Minister of India and the last one was in 2021. So, since then, a lot has changed around the world, but also our relations have expanded."</p>

<p>"Russia is now one of the very important sources of energy resources in India. Also, trade has expanded in other areas. So this visit becomes very important for the leaders to exchange views on all these developments in the bilateral relationship, but also other regional and international issues of mutual interest," he added.</p>

<p>Vinay Kumar said that PM Modi during his visit will have a private meeting with Russian President Putin, attend the lunch-on hosted by Putin and visit an exhibition centre. He said that PM Modi will address a gathering of Indian community members in Russia.</p>

<p>Elaborating on PM Modi's schedule during his visit to Russia, the Indian envoy said, "The program includes a private meeting with President Putin, delegation-level talks, restricted talks, lunch on hosted by President Putin for Prime Minister and his delegation, visit to an exhibition center in the Badenha complex, Rosatom Pavilion, and also exchange of documents which we are preparing to sign and exchange during the visit."</p>

<p>"Prime Minister will also address a gathering of Indian community members who are very eagerly looking forward to this visit to Moscow by Prime Minister after a gap of nine years. The last Prime Ministerial visit to Moscow was in 2015. So these are some of the important elements of the program," he added.</p>

<p>Notably, PM Modi will be in Moscow on July 8-9 at the invitation of the Russian President to hold the 22nd India-Russia Annual Summit.</p>

<p>Asked about the issues that will be discussed during the meeting between PM Modi and Russian President Putin, he said, "Well, the first thing that I want to say is that I'm in no position to prejudge what the two leaders will talk. But, I can certainly tell you that the visit is in the framework of our annual exchange of the Presidential and Prime ministerial visit that we have in world summits and so the context is bilateral. But, certainly global issues, including this war that you mentioned, will be discussed. And the leaders will exchange their views and their perspective on these developments."</p>

<p>Vinay Kumar stressed that the trade between India and Russia has expanded and crossed USD 65 billion. However, he noted that the trade is heavily in favour of the Russian side. He said that India is looking at new items, including agricultural products to export to Russia.</p>

<p>Speaking about trade between the two nations, he said, "Trade, as I was mentioning, in the last three years, trade has expanded, crossed USD 65 billion. We have two challenges. One, to balance the trade, because trade is very heavily in favour of the Russian side. So expanding India's trade basket, export items, and also increase in the quantity to better balance the trade, while at the same time finding ways and means to sustain this growth in bilateral trade."</p>

<p>"We are looking at new items, including agricultural products to export to Russia, ceramic tiles, auto components and engineering goods, chemical products, of course, pharmaceuticals has been one of the traditional areas, products that we have exported to Russia. We want to increase their volume and also add new items to the trade basket," he added.</p>

<p>Calling defence an important pillar of India-Russia ties, he said that India has bought several platforms and their spare parts from Russia. Vinay Kumar said that India will discuss and look at further increasing this trend of co-production of defence items in India.</p>

<p>"Defence is a very important pillar of the relationship. There are a number of platforms which India has bought from Russia and their spare parts and also manufacturing of many of the components and spare parts in India. A lot is being done now already. We will discuss and look at further increasing this trend of co-production as we say of defence items in India," he said.</p>

<p>Stressing that connectivity is important for trade and people-to-people exchange, he stated, "Connectivity, similarly, is very important for trade and also people-to-people exchanges. International North-South Transport Corridor is very much on the agenda, and there have been some cargo movement along that. New routes are also coming up, Arctic route or Northern Sea route, as it is called, and we are looking for institutionalizing and expanding cooperation in that sector also."</p>

<p>During his visit to Moscow, PM Modi and Putin will review the entire range of multifaceted relations between the two countries and exchange views on contemporary regional and global issues of mutual interest, according to Ministry of External Affairs earlier press release.</p>

<p>Notably, PM Modi and Putin have met 16 times over the past 10 year. The last in-person meeting between the two leaders took place on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Summit in Uzbekistan's Samarkand in 2021.</p>

<p>PM Modi has been conferred the highest Russian state honor 'Order of the Holy Apostle Andrew the First' in 2019. After concluding his visit to Russia, PM Modi will travel to Austria.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel carried out deadly air strikes in the Gaza Strip on Sunday as the war entered its 10th month, with fighting raging across the Palestinian territory and fresh diplomatic efforts underway to halt the violence.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Hezbollah movement fired another 20 rockets at northern Israel, leaving one person injured there, the latest cross-border attacks launched in solidarity with Gaza's Palestinian group Hamas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Efforts towards a truce continued with US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators hoping to halt the worst-ever Gaza war, which has caused mass civilian casualties and devastated the coastal territory since Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.</p>

<p>Egypt's Al-Qahera News reported that Cairo was "hosting Israeli and American delegations to discuss the outstanding points" for a ceasefire and hostage release deal, citing an unnamed high-level official source.</p>

<p>Mediators were in contact with Hamas amid "intensive Egyptian meetings this week with all parties to push efforts" for a truce, said the news report late Saturday, without giving further details or dates.</p>

<p>Israel has also said it would send a delegation in the coming days to continue talks with Qatari mediators, even though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman said Friday that "gaps" remained with Hamas.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden announced a plan in late May that included an initial six-week truce and the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<p>Talks subsequently stalled, but a US official said Thursday that a new proposal from Hamas "moves the process forward and may provide the basis for closing the deal".</p>

<p>Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told AFP that the group's new ideas had been "conveyed by the mediators to the American side, which welcomed them and passed them on to the Israeli side", adding that "now the ball is in the Israeli court".</p>

<h3><strong>Heavy clashes</strong></h3>

<p>The fighting and bombardment in besieged Gaza raged on unabated on Sunday, with medics and emergency services in the Hamas-run territory reporting yet more deaths in several strikes.</p>

<p>The Palestinian Red Crescent said the bodies of six people including two children were taken to Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in the central city of Deir al-Balah.</p>

<p>And paramedics said six people were killed in one strike on a house in Gaza City and three in another elsewhere in Gaza's largest urban area.</p>

<p>An AFP correspondent said Israeli drones were firing in Gaza City's Shujaiya district, which has been largely evacuated and rocked by intense battles for two weeks.</p>

<p>The Israeli army said that in Shujaiya, its "troops eliminated several terrorists, dismantled terror infrastructure sites and located numerous weapons, including explosive devices, AK-47 rifles, machine guns and pistols".</p>

<p>It also said 30 "terrorists" had been killed in far-southern Rafah over the past day and that Israeli forces had carried out an operation in nearby Khan Yunis where Hamas had taken up position in a municipality building.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the Gaza health ministry said 16 people were killed in a strike on a school run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA that was sheltering displaced people in Nuseirat, in central Gaza.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted "terrorists" operating around the Al-Jawni school.</p>

<h3><strong>'Catastrophic hunger'</strong></h3>

<p>The war began with Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Hamas also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 42 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>In response, Israel has carried out a military offensive that has killed at least 38,098 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.</p>

<p>The war has uprooted 90 percent of Gaza's population, left almost 500,000 people enduring "catastrophic" hunger and shuttered most hospitals, UN agencies say.</p>

<p>"The situation is very difficult," said Dr Muhammad Salha, acting director of Al-Awda Hospital in Jabalia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There is no fuel in the hospital to work. We only operate the small generator for two hours a day and we have postponed many scheduled operations due to the lack of fuel."</p>

<h3><strong>Hezbollah rockets</strong></h3>

<p>Amid the Gaza war, Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah have exchanged almost daily cross-border fire and the attacks and rhetoric have escalated over the past month, sparking fears of a full-scale war.</p>

<p>While the exchanges have been largely restricted to the border areas, Israel has repeatedly struck deep inside eastern Lebanon, including on Saturday in a strike that killed a Hezbollah operative.</p>

<p>Early on Sunday, air raid sirens again sounded across northern Israel and the army then reported that 20 rockets were fired, some of which were intercepted by air defence systems.</p>

<p>One person was wounded by shrapnel in Kfar Zeitim near Tiberias, around 30 kilometres (over 18 miles) inside Israel, local police said, adding they were in stable condition.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said that "in response to the attack and assassination that the Israeli enemy carried out", it had targeted "one of the main bases" in northern Israel, west of Tiberias, with "dozens of Katyusha rockets".</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An overnight Ukrainian drone attack set a Russian munitions depot ablaze the Voronezh region, near the two countries' shared border, Russian and Ukrainian officials said Sunday.</p>

<p>"Several drones were detected and destroyed overnight by air defence systems above the Voronezh region," regional governor Alexander Gusev wrote on Telegram.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Their falling debris set off a fire in a depot" in the Podgorensky district, about 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the Ukrainian borderm.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Explosives began to detonate", Gusev said, adding that there were no indications anybody had been hurt.</p>

<p>Rescue teams were at the scene and Gusev said local people living near the depot were being evacuated.</p>

<p>A Ukrainian defence source told AFP that its drones hit the munitions factory in an overnight attack.</p>

<p>"The enemy stored surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles, shells for tanks and artillery and boxes of ammunition" at the site, which was hit by drones resulting in a "powerful" explosion, the source said.</p>

<p>Russia and Ukraine have used drones, including large explosive devices with a range of hundreds of kilometres (miles), extensively since Russia launched its military offensive in February 2022.</p>

<p>Ukraine has stepped up its attacks on Russian territory this year, targeting both energy sites it says supply the Russian army and towns and villages just across the border.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Labour prime minister Tony Blair made an early intervention in British politics on Sunday after Keir Starmer's landslide election victory, urging him to have a "plan to control immigration".</p>

<p>Blair warned Starmer, who is beginning his second full day as prime minister with a visit to Scotland, that the anti-immigration Reform UK Party also posed a challenge to Labour, not just the Conservative Party.</p>

<p>The Reform UK party, led by Brexit firebrand Nigel Farage, maximised the damage to the Conservatives at the election by splitting the right-wing vote.</p>

<p>It won five seats in the Westminster parliament and 14 percent of the vote, prompting Farage to warn that it will target Labour voters next.</p>

<p>In a piece headlined "My advice to Keir Starmer", Blair wrote in the Sunday Times that "all over the western world, traditional political parties are suffering disruption".</p>

<p>"Where the system allows new entrants to emerge, they are running riot everywhere. Look at France or Italy.</p>

<p>"We need a plan to control immigration. If we don't have rules, we get prejudices," he added.</p>

<p>Blair, the only Labour leader to lead his party to three consecutive election victories starting with his own landslide win in 1997, couched his "advice" in an article about harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI).</p>

<p>He said he believed digital ID technology offered the best solution to controlling irregular immigration, a key issue on the doorstep during the election campaign.</p>

<p>"We should move as the world is moving to digital ID. If not, new border controls will have to be highly effective," he wrote.</p>

<p>Other suggestions included "a tough new approach to law and order" due to the fact that "at present criminal elements are modernising faster than law enforcement".</p>

<p>And he said the government should "avoid any vulnerability on 'wokeism'", warning against policies that many regard as overly politically correct.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[She worries Republican donors, has name recognition, and Democratic Party heavyweights are beginning to line up behind her.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She worries Republican donors, has name recognition, and Democratic Party heavyweights are beginning to line up behind her.</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris would be President Joe Biden's natural successor if he bowed to growing pressure and stepped aside as the Democratic candidate in the 2024 election, top Democrats say.</p>

<p>Now party donors, activists and officials are asking: Does she have a better chance than Biden of beating Donald Trump? Biden is staying in the race, he has said repeatedly.</p>

<p>Harris, 59, a former U.S. senator and California attorney general, would be the first woman to become president of the United States if she were the party's nominee and prevailed in the Nov. 5 election. She is the first African American and Asian person to serve as vice president.</p>

<p>Her three-and-a-half-year White House tenure has been characterized by a lackluster start, staff turnover, and early policy portfolios including migration from Central America that did not produce major successes.</p>

<p>As recently as last year, many inside the White House and the Biden campaign team privately worried Harris was a liability for the campaign. The situation has changed significantly since then, Democratic officials have said, as she stepped forward on abortion rights and courted young voters.</p>

<h3><strong>Some Polls Favour Harris</strong></h3>

<p>Recent polls suggest Harris could do better than Biden against Trump, the Republican candidate, although she would face a tight contest.</p>

<p>A CNN poll released on July 2 found voters favor Trump over Biden by six percentage points, 49% to 43%. Harris also trailed Trump, 47% to 45%, within the margin of error.</p>

<p>It also found independents back Harris 43%-40% over Trump, and moderate voters of both parties prefer her 51-39%.</p>

<p>A Reuters/Ipsos poll after last week's televised debate between Trump and a faltering Biden found Harris and Trump were nearly tied, with 42% supporting her and 43% backing him.</p>

<p>Only former first lady Michelle Obama, who has never expressed any interest in getting into the race, polled higher among possible alternatives to Biden.</p>

<p>Internal polling shared by the Biden campaign after the debate shows Harris with the same odds as Biden of beating Trump, with 45% of voters saying they would vote for her versus 48% for Trump.</p>

<p>Influential Democrats including U.S. Representative Jim Clyburn, the man who was key to Biden's 2020 win; Rep. Gregory Meeks, a New York congressman and senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus and Summer Lee, a House Democrat from Pennsylvania have signaled Harris would be the best option to lead the ticket if Biden chooses to step aside.</p>

<p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has also privately signaled the same to lawmakers, a Congressional aide said.</p>

<p>Harris is taken so seriously, two Republican donors told Reuters they would prefer for Trump to face Biden than her.</p>

<p>"I would prefer Biden to stay in place" rather than be replaced by Harris, said Pauline Lee, a fundraiser for Trump in Nevada after the June 27 debate, who said she thought Biden had proved himself to be "incompetent."</p>

<p>And some on Wall Street, an important Democratic fundraising center, are starting to indicate a preference.</p>

<p>"Biden is already behind Trump, and is unlikely to be able to overcome that gap given where his campaign is currently. Having VP Harris likely improves Democrats' odds of taking the White House," said Sonu Varghese, global macro strategist at Carson Group, a financial services company, after the debate. "There's potentially more upside for her chances than Biden's at this point."</p>

<p>A majority of Americans see Harris in a negative light, as they do both men running for president.</p>

<p>Polling outlet Five Thirty Eight said 37.1% of voters approve of Harris and 49.6% disapprove. Those numbers compare to 36.9% and 57.1% for Biden, and 38.6% and 53.6% for Trump.</p>

<h3><strong>Women, Black Voters, Gaza</strong></h3>

<p>Since the Supreme Court repealed women's constitutional right to abortion in 2022, Harris has become the Biden administration's foremost voice on reproductive rights, an issue Democrats are betting on to help them win the 2024 election.</p>

<p>Some Democrats believe Harris could energize Democratic-leaning groups whose enthusiasm for Biden has faded, including Black voters, young voters and those who do not approve of Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

<p>"She would energize the Black, brown, and Asian Pacific members of our coalition...she would immediately pull the dispirited youth of our country back into the fold," said Tim Ryan, a former Democratic Congressman from Ohio, in a recent op-ed.</p>

<p>Democratic and Republican suburban women may also be more comfortable with her then Trump or Biden, he said.</p>

<p>As vice president, Harris's public Israel strategy is identical to Biden's, although she was the first senior leader of the U.S. government to call for a ceasefire in March.</p>

<p>"Simply swapping out the candidate does not address the central concern" of the movement, said Abbas Alawieh, a member of the national "Uncommitted" movement that withheld votes for Biden in the primary based on his support of Israel.</p>

<p>If Biden were to step aside, there could be a competition between other Democrats to become the nominee.</p>

<p>If the party were then to choose another candidate over Harris, some Democrats say it could lose the support of many Black voters who were critical to Biden's election win in 2020.</p>

<p>"There is no alternative besides Kamala Harris," said Adrianne Shropshire, executive director of Black voter outreach group BlackPAC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"If the Democratic Party thinks that they have problems now with their base being confused... Jump over the Black woman, the vice president, and I don't think the Democratic Party actually recovers."</p>

<h3><strong>Too Lefty?</strong></h3>

<p>However, Harris may struggle to reel in moderate Democrats and the independent voters who like Biden's centrist policies, some Democratic donors said. Both parties seek independents to help pull them over the finishing line in presidential elections.</p>

<p>"Her greatest weakness is that her public brand has been associated with the far left wing of the Democratic Party ... and the left wing of the Democratic party cannot win a national election," said Dmitri Mehlhorn, a fundraiser and adviser to LinkedIn co-founder and Democratic megadonor Reid Hoffman. "That is the challenge that she will have to overcome if she is the nominee."</p>

<p>Harris would take over money raised by the Biden campaign and inherit campaign infrastructure, a critical advantage with just four months before election day on Nov. 5.</p>

<p>But any Democratic campaign still needs to raise hundreds of millions of dollars more before November to be successful, strategists say. And there, Harris could be a liability.</p>

<p>"I can tell you we have a really tough time raising money for her" said a source at the Democratic National Committee.</p>

<p>As a presidential candidate ahead of the 2020 election, Harris lagged Biden in raising money. She dropped out of the race in December 2019, the same month her campaign reported $39.3 million in total contributions. Biden's campaign reported $60.9 million in the same period.</p>

<p>However, Biden's campaign raised a record $48 million in the 24 hours after he named Harris as his running mate in 2020.</p>

<p>Harris's prosecutorial background could shine in a head-to-head debate against Trump, some Democrats said.</p>

<p>"She is incredibly focused and forceful and smart, and if she prosecutes the case against the criminality of Donald Trump, she will rip him apart," said Mehlhorn.</p>

<p>Republican attacks on Harris are ramping up as she has been floated as a possible Biden replacement. Conservative talking heads are re-circulating criticism leveled at her during the 2020 race, including from some Democrats, that Harris laughs too much, that she is untested, and unqualified.</p>

<p>Kelly Dittmar, a political science professor at Rutgers University, said the attacks are part of a long history of objectifying and denigrating women of color in politics.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately the reliance on both racist and sexist attacks and tropes against women running for office is historically common and persists to this day," said Dittmar.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As per a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.themirror.com/news/royals/prince-harry-meghan-markle-rift-574899">The Mirror</a>, there seems to be a "growing rift" between the two.</p>

<p>The report added that the Duchess of Sussex is increasingly worried that her life is "not going in the direction she had planned".</p>

<p>Royal author and expert Tom Quinn told the news portal, "There is a growing rift between Harry and Meghan [Markle] caused by Meghan's increasing concern that her life is not going in the direction she had planned."</p>

<p>He added, "Meghan [Markle] loves media attention and hates the fact that surveys suggest she and Harry are no longer of much interest to the American public."</p>

<p>This comes after recent reports have suggested that the Duke and Duchess, who moved to Montecito, California in 2020, were initially welcomed and made many friends in Hollywood. However, surveys show their popularity has seen a downward trajectory.</p>

<p>Talking about Meghna Markle's brand&nbsp;&nbsp;America Riviera Orchard, Mr Quinn said, "The one fly in the ointment is Meghan's new internet brand, America Riviera Orchard. Meghan was in tears when the brand launched and her new jam was widely mocked for being expensive and nothing special."</p>

<p>American Riviera Orchard was launched in March by Meghna Markle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a60215028/all-details-meghan-markle-brand-american-riviera-orchard/">Harper's Bazaar</a>, the brand would focus on home decor and kitchen items. The site will also offer plenty of healthy edible options: "jellies, jams, marmalades, fruit preserves, edible oils and fats, and preserves, vegetable-based spreads, legume-based spreads, nut-based spreads, garlic-based spreads, sesame-based spreads, dairy-based spreads, nut butters, fruit butters," the report added.</p>

<p>Tom Quinn also added that Meghan Markle is "particularly sensitive" to any criticism of her luxurious lifestyle in the US, as she believes it should be admired, not criticised.</p>

<p>For Prince Harry, Mr Quinn claimed that he has become "increasingly bored" and is looking back to the UK, where most of his army and school friends still live. "He never sees [them] because they won't visit him in the States because they find Meghan difficult," the expert added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Hindu religious festival in Sri Lanka ended in chaos after an elephant in the procession panicked, with 13 people in the crowd injured as they fled, police said Sunday.</p>

<p>Video footage shared on social media showed one of the elephant's keepers trying to pull the agitated animal by its tail in a desperate attempt to control it, while screaming devotees lining the street rushed to escape.</p>

<p>The images show a parade of elephants covered in red, blue and gold robes from trunk to tail, in front of a large crowd while cymbals clanged.</p>

<p>Thirteen people were taken to hospital and treated for minor injuries in Kataragama, 280 kilometres (175 miles) south of the capital Colombo, a police spokesman said.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the state-run Kataragama hospital said on Sunday, the day after the incident, that all the injured had been discharged.</p>

<p>Elephants are considered sacred in Sri Lanka, but animal cruelty laws are rarely enforced.</p>

<p>Animal rights groups have criticised the widespread use of elephants at temple ceremonies in Sri Lanka.</p>

<p>There have been instances when the animals have gone berserk at parades involving loud music and fireworks.</p>

<p>In August 2023, dozens of pilgrims jumped into a lake in the central city of Kandy to escape five agitated young elephants. Several people were hurt and one woman was hospitalised.</p>

<p>In 2019, at least 17 people were injured when elephants ran amok at a temple festival in Colombo.</p>

<p>Official records show there are about 200 domesticated elephants in the island nation, along with a wild population of around 7,500.</p>

<p>The government has banned the capture of wild elephants but dozens of calves have been stolen in recent years, often after their mothers were killed by their captors.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The mood in the country is tense, with 30,000 police deployed to head off trouble and voters anxious about a potential electoral earthquake shifting the French political landscape.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France went to the polls on Sunday for the second round of a historic election that is expected to leave the far right as the biggest force in a deeply divided parliament.</p>

<p>The mood in the country is tense, with 30,000 police deployed to head off trouble and voters anxious about a potential electoral earthquake shifting the French political landscape.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the village of Rosheim, outside the eastern city of Strasbourg, an "anguished" 72-year-old Antoine Schrameck said he feared France would see "a turning point in the history of the republic".</p>

<p>Adella Fournier, a 41-year-old civil servant, agreed: "I wish the public mood would calm, but we're a long way from that."&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Emmanuel Macron called the snap elections three years ahead of time after his forces were trounced in June's European parliament vote, a gamble which seems to have backfired.</p>

<p>Far right leader Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN) came top in the June 30 first round, and is on course to repeat the feat in Sunday's run off races.</p>

<p>But she may not win the outright majority that would force Macron to appoint Le Pen's lieutenant, the RN party leader Jordan Bardella, 28, as prime minister just weeks before Paris hosts the Olympics.</p>

<p>A hung parliament with a large eurosceptic, anti-immigration contingent could weaken France's international standing and threaten Western unity in the face of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>European Union officials, already learning to deal with far right &nbsp;parties in power in Italy and the Netherlands, are watching France closely.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And in Rome, Pope Francis chose the day of the French vote to warn against "ideological temptations and populists", adding: "Democracy is not in good health in the world today."&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the country on tenterhooks, last week saw more than 200 tactical-voting pacts between centre and left wing candidates in seats to attempt to prevent the RN winning an absolute majority.</p>

<p>This has been hailed as a return of the anti-far right "Republican Front" first summoned when Le Pen's father Jean-Marie faced Jacques Chirac in the run-off of 2002 presidential elections.</p>

<p>Opinion polls now forecast that the RN will fall well short of the 289 seats needed for an outright majority in the 577-seat National Assembly, while still becoming the largest party.</p>

<h3><strong>'Catastrophic'</strong></h3>

<p>Such an outcome could allow Macron to possibly build a broad coalition against the RN and keep Gabriel Attal as prime minister on a caretaker basis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But it could also herald a long period of paralysed politics in France, as it prepares to host the Olympics from July 26.</p>

<p>"Today the danger is a majority dominated by the extreme right and that would be catastrophic," Attal said in a final pre-election interview with French television on Friday.</p>

<p>Many in France remain baffled over why Macron called an election that could end with the RN doubling its presence in parliament and his contingent of centrist MPs halving in number.</p>

<p>But the president, known for his theatrical gestures, appears intent on executing what he calls a "clarification" of French politics, which he hopes will eventually leave three clear camps of far right, centre and hard left.</p>

<p>The final opinion polls published by two organisations on Friday projected the RN would win between 170 to 210 seats, followed by the New Popular Front (NFP) broad left-wing coalition on 145 to 185 and Macron's centrists on 118 to 150.</p>

<p>While Macron's Ensemble alliance is forecast to come third, the more successful NFP is a fragile mix of several warring factions ranging from traditional Socialists to the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) of firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon.</p>

<h3><strong>'Weaken France's voice'</strong></h3>

<p>"France is on the cusp of a seismic political shift," said analysts at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), warning that even if Macron controlled the government after the election he would face "legislative gridlocks".</p>

<p>This would weaken "France's voice on the European and international stage".</p>

<p>Macron, who disappeared from public view over recent days in order not to provoke the electorate further, has vowed to serve out his term until 2027, when he must step down.</p>

<p>That is when Le Pen scents her best chance to win the Elysee presidential palace at the fourth attempt.</p>

<p>After voting began on Saturday in France's overseas territories, polls opened in mainland France at 0600 GMT and were due to close by 1800 GMT.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Projections -- which usually give a very close idea of the final outcome -- are published shortly afterwards, with the political leaders then reacting rapidly to any frenzy that grips the nation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pope Francis decried the state of democracy and warned against "populists" during a short visit to Trieste in Italy's northeast on Sunday ahead of a 12-day trip to Asia -- the longest of his papacy.</p>

<p>"Democracy is not in good health in the world today," Francis said during a speech at the city's convention centre to close a national Catholic event.</p>

<p>Without naming any countries, the pope warned against "ideological temptations and populists" on the day that France holds the second round of a snap parliamentary vote that looks set to see the far-right National Rally (RN) party take the largest share of the vote.</p>

<p>"Ideologies are seductive. Some people compare them to the Pied Piper of Hamelin: they seduce but lead you to deny yourself," he said in reference to the German fairytale.</p>

<p>"The culture of rejection creates a city where there is no place for the poor, the unborn, the fragile, the sick, children, women, the young," he regretted, urging facilitation of social participation from childhood.</p>

<p>Ahead of last month's European parliament elections, bishops in several countries also warned about the rise of populism and nationalism, with far-right parties already holding the reins to power in Italy, Hungary and the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Francis also urged people to "move away from polarisations that impoverish" and hit out at "self-referential power".</p>

<p>After Venice in April and Verona in May, the half-day trip to Trieste, a city of 200,000 inhabitants on the Adriatic Sea that borders Slovenia, marked the third one within Italy this year for the 87-year-old pontiff, who has suffered increasing health problems in recent years.</p>

<p>Since travelling to the French city of Marseille in September 2023, the Argentine Jesuit has limited himself to domestic travel.</p>

<p>But he plans to spend nearly two weeks in Asia in September visiting Indonesia, Singapore and the islands of Papua New Guinea and East Timor.</p>

<p>He arrived in Trieste shortly before 9:00 am (0600 GMT) and embarked on meetings with various groups from the religious and academic spheres, along with migrants and the disabled.</p>

<p>Pope Francis concluded his visit with a mass in front of some 8,500 worshippers in the city's main public square before heading back to the Vatican in the early afternoon.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sojan Joseph, a mental health nurse in the National Health Service (NHS) who migrated from Kerala 22 years ago, is among the new crop of Labour members of Parliament elected to the House of Commons in the UK general election this week.</p>

<p>Mr Joseph, 49, connected with the voters at the doorstep with his pledge to ensure more mental health services in his constituency and succeeded in making a dent in the Conservative stronghold of Ashford in Kent, south-eastern England.</p>

<p>In defeating Tory stalwart and former minister Damian Green, Mr Joseph also dealt a blow to the anti-immigration rhetoric of the right-wing candidates in a seat where the far-right Reform UK came in third place after the Tories.</p>

<p>“I am humbled with the trust you all placed in me and fully aware of the responsibilities that come with it. I will work hard for everyone in Ashford, Hawkinge and villages,” said Mr Joseph in his acceptance speech on Friday.</p>

<p>Being a local councillor and a BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) Officer would have prepared the medical professional for this new parliamentary challenge. But it is his over two decades' long NHS career as a mental health nurse that he feels gives him the empathy required for his new job in Parliament.</p>

<p>Also, his connect with the local communities of Ashford, where he has been living with his wife and three children for over 15 years, is his additional motivation.</p>

<p>“I take great pride in calling Ashford, and Willesborough, my home. I have taken part in a number of fundraising activities over the years, including running marathons for various charities and a dragon boat race for the local hospital charity,” said Mr Joseph, who has undertaken several international marathons for charity.</p>

<p>“I firmly believe in an inclusive society that works towards achieving the full potential for every individual in the community,” he adds.</p>

<p>Mr Joseph, who went to school in Kottayam, completed his nursing studies at B R Ambedkar Medical College in Bengaluru. In the UK, he studied for a Master's degree in healthcare leadership, focusing on diversity and inclusion in public healthcare. Many voters described him as extremely passionate about improving access to mental and physical healthcare services for everyone on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>When he takes his seat in the Commons next week, he will be joined by a number of other first-time Labour MPs of Indian heritage who are reflective of the nationwide swing towards the party after the Keir Starmer-led party won a landslide mandate to form a new government.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lashing rains in Nepal causing flash floods and landslides have killed at least 14 people across the country, with disaster teams searching for nine missing, police said Sunday.</p>

<p>Flooding in neighbouring India, as well as in downstream Bangladesh, has also caused widespread damage and impacted millions.</p>

<p>"Police are working with other agencies and locals to find the missing people," Nepalese police spokesman Dan Bahadur Karki told AFP.</p>

<p>Those killed and missing are in multiple locations.</p>

<p>Monsoon rains from June to September bring widespread death and destruction every year across South Asia, but the numbers of fatal floods and landslides have increased in recent years.</p>

<p>Experts say climate change and increased road construction are exacerbating the problem.</p>

<p>Parts of Nepal have been receiving heavy rainfall since Thursday, prompting disaster authorities in the Himalayan nation to warn of flash floods in multiple rivers.</p>

<p>There have been reports of inundation in several districts of lowland areas bordering India.</p>

<p>Last month 14 people were killed in Nepal in ferocious storms that brought landslides, lightning and flooding.</p>

<p>In India, floods have swamped the northeastern state of Assam, with six people killed in the last 24 hours, Assam's Disaster Management Authority said Sunday.</p>

<p>That takes the death toll from the downpours since mid-May to 58.</p>

<p>In low-lying Bangladesh, downstream from India, the disaster management agency said floods had impacted more than two million people.</p>

<p>Much of the country is made up of deltas where the Himalayan rivers the Ganges and the Brahmaputra wind towards the sea after coursing through India.</p>

<p>The summer monsoon brings South Asia 70-80 percent of its annual rainfall.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a bid to restrict the access to online pornography by minors, Spain has come up with a new mobile application that will not only require users to verify their age, but also limits the number of credits for viewing adult content.</p>

<p>This comes after Dale Una Vuelta, an anti-pornography group that campaigns for tighter regulations on access to adult content online, earlier released statistics that raised concerns over the alarming spread of adult content among minors.</p>

<p>Calling the data "devastating," Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told El Pais newspaper, "Almost half of young people under 15 years of age consume it".</p>

<h2>How will the app work?</h2>

<p>The mobile application, officially called the Digital Wallet Beta (Cartera Digital Beta), and locally known as the "pajaporte", will allow platforms to check whether the user is above the age of 18 years or not. To verify their age, the viewers will be asked to use the mobile app.</p>

<p>The application will work as a mobile phone wallet and will verify users' age through one of the five government-issued IDs.</p>

<p>Once verified, the users will then receive 30 "porn credits" with one-month validity. These credits will grant them access to adult content. Further, users will be able to put a request for extra credits.</p>

<h2>Launch date</h2>

<p>The mobile application will be available by the end of the summer, reports said.</p>

<p>Though it is being criticised by a section of activists and experts for its complexity, the Spanish government has defended the move. According to the government, the credit-based model is more privacy-friendly and ensures that the online activities are not easily traceable.</p>

<p>It will be voluntary, as online platforms can rely on other age-verification methods available to keep a check on inappropriate viewers.</p>

<p>The upcoming app is part of the broader effort to align with the European Union law that comes into effect in October 2027. Eventually, the porn passport in Spain will likely get replaced by the EU's own digital identity system (eIDAS2).</p>]]></content:encoded>

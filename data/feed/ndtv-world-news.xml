       <description><![CDATA[The report containing the guidelines said it was critical to enable human control as required across an AI system's lifecycle.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Australia's centre-left government said on Thursday it planned to introduce targeted artificial intelligence rules including human intervention and transparency amid a rapid rollout of AI tools by businesses and in everyday life.</p>

<p>Industry and Science Minister Ed Husic unveiled 10 new voluntary guidelines on AI systems and said the government has opened a month-long consultation over whether to make them mandatory in the future in high-risk settings.</p>

<p>"Australians know AI can do great things but people want to know there are protections in place if things go off the rails," Husic said in a statement. "Australians want stronger protections on AI, we've heard that, we've listened."</p>

<p>The report containing the guidelines said it was critical to enable human control as required across an AI system's lifecycle.</p>

<p>"Meaningful human oversight will let you intervene if you need to and reduce the potential for unintended consequences and harms," the report said. Companies must be transparent to disclose AI's role when generating content, it added.</p>

<p>Regulators around the world have raised concerns about misinformation and fake news contributed by AI tools amid the rising popularity of generative AI systems such as Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.</p>

<p>As a result, the European Union in May passed landmark AI laws, imposing strict transparency obligations on high-risk AI systems that are more comprehensive than a light-touch voluntary compliance approach in several countries.</p>

<p>"We don't think that there is a right to self-regulation any more. I think we've passed that threshold," Husic told ABC News.</p>

<p>Australia has no specific laws to regulate AI, though in 2019 it introduced eight voluntary principles for its responsible use. A government report published this year said the current settings were not adequate enough to tackle high-risk scenarios.</p>

<p>Husic said only one-third of businesses using AI were implementing it responsibly on metrics such as safety, fairness, accountability and transparency.</p>

<p>"Artificial intelligence is expected to create up to 200,000 jobs in Australia by 2030 ... so it's crucial that Australian businesses are equipped to properly develop and use the technology," he said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Nga Wai Hono i te po Paki was anointed as the new Maori Queen, succeeding her father, King Tuheitia Pootatau Te Wherowhero VII, who died last week. Thousands gathered at New Zealand's Tuurangawaewae, the meeting place of the King movement, to bid farewell to the late king and witness the anointment of his daughter.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The ceremony, known as Te Whakawahinga, involved the placement of a sacred bible on the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/new-zealands-maori-crowned-new-queen-after-fathers-death-6494926">queen's head</a> and the use of sacred oils to bestow prestige, power and spiritual essence upon her, as per AFP.&nbsp;During her coronation, she wore traditional Maori attire including a headdress of fern leaves, a light brown cloak and a carved whalebone necklace.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Here are some facts on the new Maori queen:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Nga Wai Hono i te po Paki is the youngest child and only daughter of King Tuheitia and Queen Te Atawhai Makau Ariki. She is 27.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">She holds a Master of Arts in Tikanga (Maori societal lore) and has served on the board of the Te Kohanga Reo National Trust, which focuses on strenghtening the Maori language, as per AFP.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">She was chosen as successor at the Te Whakawahinga ceremony where a group of 12 elders from various Maori tribes, known as the Kiingitanga advisory council, chose her to become the Maori queen. Despite having two older brothers, NNga Wai Hono i te po Paki was selected to lead, which the Maori people called a “new dawn”. The late Maori King'sfuneral took place shortly before her ascension.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">She is the eighth Maori monarch and the second queen. Her grandmother, Queen Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu, was the first queen and served for four decades until 2006.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">She has a traditional chin tattoo (“moko kauae”), received at age 19, which honours her father and the time he dedicated to his role as king.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S., Britain and the EU are expected to sign the first international treaty on the use of AI that is legally binding, the Financial Times reported on Thursday.</p>

<p>The three would sign the Council of Europe's convention on AI on Thursday, the newspaper said, adding that the convention was drafted for over two years by more than 50 countries including Canada, Israel, Japan and Australia.</p>

<p>The U.S. was "committed to ensuring that AI technologies support respect for human rights and democratic values" and saw "the key value-add of the Council of Europe in this space," a senior Biden administration official told the newspaper.</p>

<p>"It's the first [agreement] with real teeth globally, and it's bringing together a very disparate set of nations as well," Britain's technology minister Peter Kyle said, according to the report.</p>

<p>The Council of Europe's framework convention on AI, which addresses human rights, democracy, and the rule of law, was drafted by the Committee on Artificial Intelligence (CAI).</p>

<p>The CAI finalised the draft of the convention in March. Following this, the convention was adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on May 17 and will be opened for signature in Vilnius on September 5.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twenty-seven-year-old Nga Wai hono i te po was Thursday anointed as the new monarch by Maori chiefs in New Zealand. The decision came after the death of <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/new-zealands-maori-king-dies-after-18-year-reign-world-leaders-mourn-6451320">King Kiingi Tuheitia Pōtatau Te Wherowhero VII</a>. Nga Wai was chosen as Kuini in a formal ceremony held on the North Island by a council of the Indigenous Māori chiefs, reported AFP.<br />
<br />
With this, Nga Wai became the second-ever <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/new-zealands-maori-king-wants-whales-to-be-granted-personhood-heres-why-5329988">Maori</a> queen in the eight-dynasty reign of the Kingitanga movement to ascend the throne. Her father died last week at the age of 69, following heart surgery.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
“The new monarch was raised in a ceremony known as Te Whakawahinga, in front of thousands of people gathered for the tangihanga (funeral and burial) of Kiingi Tuheitia,” a spokesperson for the Kiingitanga or royal family said.<br />
<br />
Instead of crowning the queen, Archbishop Don Tamihere placed a bible, that has been in use since 1858, on her head and used holy oils to bestow dignity, sacredness, strength, and spiritual essence upon her.<br />
<br />
Thousands flocked to Turangawaewae, the King movement's meeting spot, to bid farewell to him in a traditional funeral ceremony. After his daughter's anointment, the King's coffin was transported by hearse to the Waikato River. From there, it was floated in a flotilla of traditional Maori waka, or canoes, to Taupiri Mountain, where he was to be buried with other royals and high-profile Maori.<br />
<br />
The Maori <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/all-you-need-to-know-about-sultan-hassanal-bolkiah-and-bruneis-royal-family-6480250">monarchy </a>was established back in 1858 to fight colonisation and protect Māori culture and land from intruders. Although the monarch is primarily ceremonial and has little official authority, it is nevertheless regarded by many tribes as the supreme chief.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
With a master's degree in Māori cultural studies from Waikato University, Nga Wai has served on several boards, including the Te Kohanga Reo National Trust, an organisation charged with revitalising the Maori language, according to 1News.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Her anointment comes amid strained racial relations in New Zealand. Since assuming power last year, the centre-right coalition in New Zealand has begun to roll back the policies of the previous administration, especially those that supported the official use of the Maori language, improved living conditions and rights for Indigenous people, and attempts to right some of the wrongs committed during colonisation.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump said he plans to allow his opponent, Kamala Harris, to speak without interruption during their presidential debate next week, a shift for the reality-television-star-turned-politician who built a career on combative exchanges. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I'm going to let her talk," Trump said Wednesday at a taping of a town hall in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, with Fox News' Sean Hannity. "Debates are interesting, you can go in with all the strategy you want, but you have to sort of feel it out."</p>

<p>The Sept. 10 debate hosted by ABC News is the next big test for the two candidates. That forum has already been the centre of a row over the rules for microphones, and with Trump claiming the network is biased in favour of Harris.</p>

<p>ABC News released the rules of the debate on Wednesday and said they had been accepted by both campaigns.</p>

<p>Trump left a little room to change his plan for the event, adding Wednesday: "Mike Tyson made the statement, 'Everyone has a plan until you're punched in the face.'"</p>

<p>Trump in the past has resisted the traditional debate planning employed by presidential campaigns, involving detailed policy briefings and mock exchanges. Instead, he preferred to have less formal preparation from his team and rely more on his own intuition. He refused to debate his Republican rivals during the 2024 primary battle.</p>

<p>The high-stakes confrontation is the first - and potentially only - opportunity for the two candidates to spar in person in a very close contest. With only two months until Election Day, they have few opportunities to sway the small sliver of persuadable voters.</p>

<p>The debate presents risks for both Harris and Trump. The former president has been chastised by both allies and critics for attacks on Harris that criticize her intelligence, gender and racial identity that could alienate key voters. The vice president has largely been untested as a presidential candidate in unscripted settings, only doing one television interview since she became the Democratic nominee.</p>

<h3><strong>Debate About Debates</strong></h3>

<p>Trump had originally agreed to the ABC News debate with President Joe Biden, then the Democratic candidate. For weeks, he suggested he might not show up for the debate with Harris, before saying he would participate after all. Trump and Biden held one debate, a calamitous performance for the sitting president that led members of his own party to push him out of the race.</p>

<p>For weeks, the campaigns have clashed over the rules for the microphones. Harris' camp has sought to keep both candidates' microphones live throughout the broadcast, while Trump's team has pushed for them to be muted when they were not answering questions, as they were during the June Biden-Trump debate on CNN.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the rules released on Wednesday, ABC said the microphones would be "live only for the candidate whose turn it is to speak and muted when the time belongs to another candidate." Candidates have two minutes to answer questions, two minutes to rebut and one minute for follow-ups or clarifications, according to the network.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign in a letter to ABC said that the muted microphones would disadvantage Harris and shield Trump from having to directly engage with the vice president, according to a campaign official. Harris' team was concerned that Trump would skip the debate if they didn't agree to having the mics silenced, and said that if there is significant cross-talk, the network might unmute the candidates, so that the audience can understand what's happening, the official said.</p>

<p>Trump has floated other debates, including with Fox News. The Harris campaign has ruled out participating in a forum on that network but has proposed a second debate, with the details to be resolved if Trump takes part in the ABC event.</p>

<h3><strong>Swing States</strong></h3>

<p>The debate will take place in Philadelphia, the largest city in Pennsylvania, one of the most critical swing states. Trump's town hall appearance Wednesday marks his second visit there in as many weeks. The two nominees are in a pitched fight for the state's working-class voters, some of them uneasy with Biden's economic agenda and drawn to Trump's populist appeals.</p>

<p>Harris campaigned in the western part of the state on Labor Day with Biden and is returning on Thursday for the 10th time this year, according to her campaign. The state is the most populous of the seven core battlegrounds, offering 19 Electoral College votes.</p>

<p>Trump's team has acknowledged polls showing the race has grown more competitive. A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll released late August found Harris overtaking Trump in Pennsylvania by 51% to 47%. Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump, on Bloomberg Television's Balance of Power last week, said the party would consider putting more money and attention into "must-win" battlegrounds such as Pennsylvania.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A group of scientists, including people from the Royal Society of Chemistry, recently proposed that experiences such as licking an ice lolly should be part of the science curriculum.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">A <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/articles/c984wz29xexo">group of scientists</a>, including people from the Royal Society of Chemistry, recently proposed that experiences such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/article/2024/aug/20/add-ice-lolly-licking-to-england-primary-school-curriculum-urge-scientists">licking an ice lolly</a> should be part of the science curriculum. By licking a lolly and seeing how it melts – the idea goes – children would better learn about melting, and therefore about chemistry and physics.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>But does licking a lolly, or experiences such as kneading dough, playing with shadows or digging in soil, actually help pupils learn science? Deploying examples and demonstrations in the classroom can be a helpful gateway towards deeper understanding, but it's not a shortcut to knowledge.</p>

<p>The idea of learning through experiences has a long history. It's perhaps most closely associated with the work of educator <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/ENTRIES/dewey/">John Dewey</a> in the early 20th century. Dewey and other educators of the time were concerned that an emphasis on rote learning would lead to “inert knowledge”: facts that students wouldn't be able to apply <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780203056646-5/cognitive-coping-strategies-problem-inert-knowledge-carl-bereiter-marlene-scardamalia">to the real world</a>.</p>

<p>An experience like licking a lolly may at least be memorable – especially if you've never done it before. Licking a lolly or seeing it melt in class would lead to what psychologists call an episodic memory: a memory of an event in your life.</p>

<h3><strong>Experience and understanding</strong></h3>

<p>However, there <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-08951-001">is a difference</a> between having memories for events and having knowledge. There is a difference, for example, between having personally lived through the French Revolution and knowing what happened.</p>

<p>The latter involves a different type of memories – semantic memories. These are based on understanding how things work and what they mean. It is the type of memory that is at play when you use a word such as “heavy”, unconnected to a specific heavy object. Such understandings are essential to both scientific learning and our use of language.</p>

<p>If you stop to think about it, most of your knowledge can't be clearly tied to one particular experience. Learning is usually not a one-shot process – think of how much experience a gardener needs before they “know” how plants grow and thrive, for example.</p>

<p>These semantic memories derive from an amalgam of lots of experiences, and sometimes, from comparing and contrasting different things: the difference between two types of plants, or between an ice lolly and an ice cream.</p>

<p>Learning about melting is similar. We don't just demonstrate melting one time, and boom (or squelch), the students have learned it.</p>

<h3><strong>Importance of context</strong></h3>

<p>Understanding science or anything else is also not just about remembering experiences. Learners need to <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781410603784-7/teaching-learning-understanding-david-perkins-chris-unger">understand the encounter</a>, to have their attention directed towards similar and different processes, and to experience <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00505/full">multiple examples</a>.</p>

<p>To profit most from this, learners need sufficient prior knowledge to understand what is happening when they observe something in class. This is one reason that leaving students to discover things entirely by themselves is a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.14">flawed strategy</a>.</p>

<p>It's also another reason why relying on one-off experiences doesn't work. Students need to revisit ideas periodically, each time bringing more knowledge and understanding to the table.</p>

<p>Without a basic understanding of science, there is a risk that a learner will fail to connect a classroom observation to its wider context. Knowing about melting, for example, is a lot more than knowing that a lolly melts – it involves knowing why, and under what circumstances. It involves knowing that other everyday substances would melt in higher temperatures.</p>

<p>This foundational understanding is also important to stop students from coming up with scientific misconceptions. In the lolly example, students might <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00461520.2012.695709">overgeneralise surface features</a> such as how quickly the lolly melts or how sticky it is, seeing these as characteristics of melting in general.</p>

<p>In short, understanding science or anything else is not just about remembering things. It's about understanding what an experience connects to, what category it is an example of, and how it differs from other concepts.</p>

<h3><strong>Personal learning</strong></h3>

<p>Another notable claim in the ice lolly story was the suggestion that it is valuable to promote learning <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/articles/c984wz29xexo">“on a personal level”</a>. There is research on this, too.</p>

<p>Imagine you were asked to remember a list of random words such as “music, broccoli, dancing, plastic bottles, baby sharks”. <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1970-03138-001">A study</a> looking at memory found that people better recalled words from lists like this if they were asked “do you like this?” compared to a blander, information-processing question, such as “does the word contain a letter ‘e'?”. We also <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17470211003770938">remember our own possessions</a> better than generic objects.</p>

<p>So, yes – there is some evidence that we might retain experiences better if we are personally invested in them. However, it's worth noting that such experiments are rather short-term. In everyday life, we can really enjoy and engage with something on a personal level (such as a book or a conversation) yet forget the details within a few weeks or months.</p>

<p>This is partly why people write diaries. Memories of our lives are ephemeral, easily lost over time. Sometimes such memories are distorted, or even <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0079-7421(08)60124-3">entirely imagined</a> – false memories. It's risky to base science learning upon this type of memory.</p>

<p>If we want students to build up their knowledge of science and be able to use it in future, it's vital that the focus is on strategies that build deep understanding of concepts and how they are structured, rather than relying on gimmicks or one-off experiences.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a major setback to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, key ally Jagmeet Singh's New Democratic Party has pulled out support for his minority Liberal government ahead of the general election next year.</p>

<p>In a video message shared on social media, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-weakened-after-key-sikh-ally-withdraws-support-6492183">Jagmeet Singh </a>said Mr Trudeau will not be able to take on the opposition Conservatives amid recent polls showing them securing an easy win in elections.</p>

<p>"<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/canada-to-reduce-number-of-temporary-foreign-workers-6424021">Justin Trudeau</a> has proven again and again he will always cave to corporate greed. The Liberals have let people down. They don't deserve another chance from Canadians," Mr Singh said in the video.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The deal is done.<br />
<br />
The Liberals are too weak, too selfish and too beholden to corporate interests to stop the Conservatives and their plans to cut. But the NDP can.<br />
<br />
Big corporations and CEOs have had their governments. It's the people's time. <a href="https://t.co/BsE9zT0CwF">pic.twitter.com/BsE9zT0CwF</a></p>
— Jagmeet Singh (@theJagmeetSingh) <a href="https://twitter.com/theJagmeetSingh/status/1831375557507850740?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 4, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p></p>

<p>The leader said that the "big battle" now is defeating the Conservatives to stop them from choosing big corporations over the young people and Canadian families.</p>

<p>"There is another, even bigger battle ahead. The threat of Pierre Poilievre and Conservative cuts. From workers, from retirees, from young people, from patients, from families -- he will cut in order to give more to big corporations and wealthy CEOs," he said.</p>

<p>The two leaders had struck in 2022 to come together to boost the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/setback-for-canadas-trudeau-liberals-lose-stronghold-in-key-polls-5969262">Liberal </a>party's minority government. The deal was supposed to go on till October next year but an NDP spokesperson said the plan to end the agreement was in the works for the past two weeks.</p>

<p>Reports suggest the sudden social media post was a surprise for the Canadian PM's party as within minutes of informing them of their decision to withdraw Mr Singh posted the video on social media.</p>

<p>Mr Singh said "the NDP is ready for an election, and voting non-confidence will be on the table with each and every confidence measure."</p>

<p>Reacting to Mr Singh's announcement, Mr Trudeau said his government will continue to focuse on tackling the affordability crisis in the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"These are the things that we're focused on. I'll let others focus on politics.I really hope the NDP stays focused on how we can deliver for Canadians, as we have over the past years, rather than focusing on politics," he said.</p>

<p>The Canadian prime minister also said he remained hopeful that the next election will not happen "until next fall" so that his government can also work on pharmacare, dental care, and school food programmes.</p>

<p>Mr Singh's NDP kept the Mr Trudeau's Liberal government in power through a confidence-and-supply agreement. In exchange for its support, the government agreed to address key priorities, including introducing dental care benefits, providing one-time rental supplements for low-income tenants, and temporarily doubling the GST rebate.</p>

<p>But some of the promises made to Mr Singh's party are yet to be fulfilled.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 14-year-old student who killed four of his schoolmates in US's Georgia was questioned last year by police about online threats, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said.</p>

<p>In May 2023, Colt Gray was questioned by police who believed he was behind internet posts that contained images of guns, warning of a school shooting.</p>

<p>The FBI said its National Threat Operations Center had alerted local law enforcement after receiving tips about "online threats to commit a school shooting at an unidentified location and time".</p>

<p>After the location of the threats were determined, the police interviewed the teen and his father.</p>

<p>While the teen denied sending the threats, his father told police that he had hunting guns in the house but the then 13-year-old "did not have unsupervised access to them".</p>

<p>"At the time, there was no probable cause for an arrest or to take any additional law enforcement action on the local, state or federal levels," the FBI said in a statement.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the boy used an assault rifle to open fire in Apalachee High School, killing two teachers and two student, investigators say.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eight other students and one teacher were injured in the attack. Gray was arrested from the school premises and will be tried as an adult.</p>

<p>The school sent out a message to parents saying it was "currently in a hard lockdown after reports of gunfire."</p>

<p>Survivors recounted the moment when Gray began attacking the students. One student told BBC that she saw him leave a class after a maths lesson and when he returned he had a gun in his hand. One of her classmates saw the gun and refused to open the door for Gray even as he continued to pound on it.</p>

<p>Gray then moved to the next classroom and opened fire.</p>

<p>According to the BBC, this was the 23rd US school shooting of 2024. So far 11 people have died and 38 have been injured in such attacks this year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Boeing Starliner on which Indian-origin NASA astronaut Sunita Williams flew to the International Space Station (ISS) on June 5 was touted as a space capsule made by astronauts for astronauts but, much to the embarrassment of Boeing, is now set to return without any human spacefarers. The return journey, in autonomous mode, is slated for September 6 and the Starliner is expected to land about six hours after it undocks.</p>

<p>The Starliner, whose development was plagued by delays, was on its first crewed test flight, carrying Sunita Williams and Barry "Butch" Wilmore for what was meant to be an eight-day mission. The two astronauts have been at the International Space Station since June 6 and their stay kept getting extended because of propulsion issues on the Starliner. NASA announced on August 24 that the astronauts would return to Earth in February 2025 and the Boeing spacecraft would come back without its crew. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The uncrewed return allows NASA and Boeing to continue gathering testing data on the Starliner during its flight home while also allowing it not to accept more risk than is necessary for its crew. NASA officials said the decision was "unanimous" on its part, while Boeing asserted it could return the Starliner both with or without crew.</p>

<p><strong>'Tense Meeting'</strong></p>

<p>The space agency has confirmed that the decision to get the spacecraft to return without crew was taken at a "tense" meeting between NASA and Boeing officials.</p>

<p>Explaining the decision, NASA chief Senator Bill Nelson, who is also a former astronaut, said, "Spaceflight is risky, even at its safest and most routine. A test flight, by nature, is neither safe nor routine.</p>

<p>The decision to keep Butch and Suni (Sunita Williams) aboard the International Space Station and bring Boeing's Starliner home without crew is the result of our commitment to safety - our core value and our North Star."</p>

<p>Boeing, on its part, said it remains confident in the Starliner spacecraft and its ability to return safely with crew. "We continue to support NASA's requests for additional testing, data, analysis and reviews to affirm the spacecraft's safe undocking and landing capabilities. Our confidence is based on this abundance of valuable testing from Boeing and NASA. The testing has confirmed that 27 of 28 RCS (reaction control system) thrusters are healthy and back to full operational capability," the company said in a statement.<br />
"Starliner's propulsion system also maintains redundancy and the helium levels remain stable. The data also supports root cause assessments for the helium and thruster issues and flight rationale for Starliner and its crew's return to Earth," it added. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Requirements Unmet</strong></p>

<p>But NASA, having burnt its fingers after the twin accidents of the Challenger and Columbia space shuttles, did not want to take any risks.</p>

<p>In a statement, NASA said the "uncertainty and lack of expert concurrence does not meet the agency's safety and performance requirements for human spaceflight".</p>

<p>Experts said the space capsule which Indian origin astronaut Sunita Williams had piloted to the International Space Station (ISS) is the most modern crew module and has been designed to ensure that astronauts who fly in it are safe and comfortable. Ms Williams herself has her imprint on almost all aspects of the spacecraft as she has been involved in its making for a long time.</p>

<p><strong>Calypso</strong></p>

<p>According to data released by Boeing, the Starliner has a height of 5 metres with both the crew module and service module, a diameter of 4.6 metres, and weighs 13,000 kg at lift-off. The Starliner is designed to accommodate a maximum crew of seven, but NASA missions will carry a crew of four to five. Each crew module is designed to fly up to 10 missions, so it is partially reusable. The service modules, however, are made for each mission as they get jettisoned in space.</p>

<p>The Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 Starliner spacecraft was designed for a mix of crew and cargo for missions to low-Earth orbit.</p>

<p>Ms Williams, who had also called the Starliner a 'fantastic spacecraft', was given the opportunity to name the spacecraft she would fly in and decided to call it 'Calypso' - after the famous ship on which the French oceanographer and legendary filmmaker Jacques-Yves Cousteau explored the oceans when she was still a student.</p>

<p>The making of the Starliner was much delayed and went way over the budget, and some say the same problems which have beset the Boeing Company in its aviation business may be plaguing the space side as well.</p>

<p>In 2014, NASA had awarded a $ 4.2 billion contract to Boeing for making the Starliner from scratch and it managed to go on its first human spaceflight only this June - ten years later. In comparison, Space X, which was given a similar contract for the development of Crew Dragon,&nbsp; delivered it at an estimated cost of $ 2.6 billion and has been ferrying astronauts since 2020. Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore will also be returning to Earth aboard the Crew Dragon.</p>

<p><strong>Development To Continue</strong></p>

<p>On August 24, the NASA chief said he had 100% confidence that the Boeing Starliner would continue to be developed but asserted that the agency had awarded a fixed-price contract to Boeing, meaning that the company will have to bear the extra costs for its full certification as a human space flight-worthy vehicle at its own expense.</p>

<p>The Starliner had also been making headlines recently for "strange noises" emanating from it, which have now been identified as feedback from a speaker.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA admitted on Wednesday there was "tension" during meetings with Boeing executives about how to bring home two astronauts stranded on the International Space Station, but denied reports of shouting matches.</p>

<p>The US space agency is enlisting SpaceX to rescue the astronauts because of safety concerns with Boeing's Starliner capsule, which encountered thruster malfunctions and helium leaks on its way to the orbital outpost.</p>

<p>Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams launched in June for what was meant to be around a weeklong stay, but they now aren't expected back until February 2025 when the SpaceX Crew-9 mission returns.</p>

<p>Boeing had publicly insisted it was confident in its spaceship, but the absence of its executives from recent NASA press briefings had fueled speculation of a rift.</p>

<p>According to sources cited by the New York Post, meetings between the two sides often descended into yelling and arguments.</p>

<p>Asked to address the claims, Steve Stich, program manager for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, said "anytime you're in a meeting of this magnitude where there's this kind of decision, there is some tension in the room."</p>

<p>"Boeing believed in the model that they had created that tried to predict the thruster degradation for the rest of the flight," he added, but "the NASA team, due to the uncertainty in the modeling, could not get comfortable with that."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't say it was a yelling, screaming kind of meeting," Stich told reporters. "It was a tense technical discussion where we had both sides listening intently to all the data."</p>

<h2>Fresh clothes</h2>

<p>Despite their extended stay, Wilmore and Williams remain in good spirits and are in touch with their families.</p>

<p>They are no longer dependent on borrowed clothes having been sent better fitting suits during a recent resupply mission, the NASA officials reported.</p>

<p>Starliner is set to depart the ISS on Friday evening US Eastern Time before making a parachute and airbag assisted landing in the western United States early on Saturday morning.</p>

<p>Shortly after undocking, the spaceship will execute a "breakout burn" with its thrusters to ensure it shoots clear of the research station before it continues its onward journey to Earth.</p>

<p>Had the flight been crewed, the ship would have flown closer to the station to capture exterior views, but NASA deemed the risk of collision too great without astronauts on board to manually pilot Starliner if required.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Expressing condolences for the victims of a shooting incident at a school in Georgia, President Joe Biden has called on Republicans to work with Democrats in the US Congress to pass gun safety legislation to help prevent future gun violence in the United States.</p>

<p>At least four people, including two students, have been killed and nine others were injured when a fellow student opened fire in a high school in the US state of Georgia on Wednesday, CNN reported.</p>

<p>Biden described the shooting incident as "another horrific reminder of how gun violence continues to tear our communities apart."</p>

<p>"Jill (Biden) and I are mourning the deaths of those whose lives were cut short due to more senseless gun violence and thinking of all of the survivors whose lives are forever changed. What should have been a joyous back-to-school season in Winder, Georgia, has now turned into another horrific reminder of how gun violence continues to tear our communities apart," Biden said in a statement released by the White House.</p>

<p>The US president lamented that students across the country are "learning how to duck and cover instead of how to read and write."</p>

<p>"We cannot continue to accept this as normal. We are closely coordinating with officials at the federal, state and local levels and are grateful for the first responders who brought the suspect into custody and prevented further loss of life," Biden said.</p>

<p>Further, Biden reaffirmed his commitment to tackling the gun violence epidemic in the US and highlighted his efforts to address the issue, including the signing of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.</p>

<p>"Ending this gun violence epidemic is personal to me. It's why I signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act--the most meaningful gun safety bill in decades--and have announced dozens of gun safety executive actions. I also established the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, overseen by Vice President Harris. We've made significant progress, but this crisis requires even more," the US president said.</p>

<p>Biden called on Republicans to work with Democrats in Congress to pass gun safety legislation to help prevent future gun violence and stated that 'enough is enough.'</p>

<p>"After decades of inaction, Republicans in Congress must finally say 'enough is enough' and work with Democrats to pass common-sense gun safety legislation. We must ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines once again, require safe storage of firearms, enact universal background checks, and end immunity for gun manufacturers. These measures will not bring those who were tragically killed today back, but they will help prevent more tragic gun violence from ripping more families apart," Biden said.</p>

<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris also took to X and expressed condolences for the people who are impacted by this shooting and described it as a "senseless tragedy."</p>

<p>"Today, Doug and I are mourning the deaths of those whose lives were cut short by gun violence at Apalachee High School in Georgia. Our hearts are with the students, teachers, and families impacted by this shooting, and we are grateful to the first responders and law enforcement on the scene. This is a senseless tragedy -- and it does not have to be this way. We must end the epidemic of gun violence in our country once and for," said Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Georgia Governor Brian P Kemp also posted on X and stated "I have directed all available state resources to respond to the incident at Apalachee High School and urge all Georgians to join my family in praying for the safety of those in our classrooms, both in Barrow County and across the state."</p>

<p>"We will continue to work with local, state, and federal partners as we gather information and further respond to this situation," he added.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the suspected gunman is in custody and was identified as 14-year-old Colt Cray, a student of Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia, about an hour outside of Atlanta. Two of those killed were students and two were teachers. Law enforcement agencies are still investigating the shooting and the motive behind it.</p>

<p>The high school had received an earlier phone threat, multiple law enforcement officials told CNN.</p>

<p>The phone call Wednesday morning warned there would be shootings at five schools, and that Apalachee would be the first. It is not known who placed the call. Officials tell CNN they are investigating the call and where it originated.</p>

<p>The US has suffered at least 385 mass shootings so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which, like CNN, defines mass shootings as those in which four or more victims are shot. That's an average of more than 1.5 mass shootings every day.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A British hiker has been found dead and another is missing on the Spanish island of Mallorca after heavy rains swept over the popular tourist destination, emergency services said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Emergency services had been looking for the two hikers since Monday night in an area of mountains in Mallorca where the Torrent de Pareis canyon descends to the Mediterranean, a police spokeswoman told AFP.</p>

<p>The search was called off on Wednesday at around 1900 GMT as dusk fell, with emergency services saying it would resume on Thursday.</p>

<p>"The body found is that of a woman and the missing person is a man," police said in a statement, adding that the search for the man had been suspended because of poor weather but would resume when conditions improved.</p>

<p>Juan Carlos Rodriguez, the head of the Mountain Rescue Group brigade in the Balearic islands, told reporters they had rescued 10 people who were hiking in the canyon and "were surprised by the storm".</p>

<p>"They were the ones who told us that they had seen two people who had been swept away by the water," he said.</p>

<p>"When you don't look at the weather before, and you are in a foreign country doing sport tourism, or sun and beach tourism, that leads to people having accidents," he added.</p>

<p>Local authorities had called for people to be careful due to the "very intense storms" that were expected.</p>

<p>"Avoid outdoor activities (going to the beach, hiking, water sports)," the archipelago's emergency services warned on X.</p>

<p>Mallorca remained on alert on Wednesday for heavy rains and strong winds, with the national weather office Aemet warning that gusts of over 120 kilometres (75 miles) per hour were possible.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first phase of a large-scale polio vaccination campaign in Gaza has concluded successfully, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday, providing nearly 200,000 children in the centre of the Palestinian territory with their initial dose.</p>

<p>With Gaza lying in ruins and the majority of its 2.4 million residents forced to flee their homes due to Israel's military assault -- often taking refuge in cramped and unsanitary conditions -- disease has spread.</p>

<p>After the first confirmed polio case in 25 years, a massive vaccination effort began on Sunday, aided by localised "humanitarian pauses" in fighting.</p>

<p>The campaign aims to fully vaccinate more than 640,000 children in the besieged territory, devastated by almost 11 months of war.</p>

<p>During the first phase of the campaign, conducted between September 1 and 3 in central Gaza, more than 187,000 children under the age of 10 were reached, the WHO said in a statement.</p>

<p>"We are grateful for the dedication of all the families, health workers and vaccinators who made this part of the campaign a success despite the dire conditions in the Gaza Strip," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X, formerly Twitter.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"We ask for the humanitarian pauses to continue to be respected. We continue to call for a ceasefire."</p>

<p>The WHO had estimated that vaccines would be needed for nearly 157,000 children below the age of 10 in central Gaza but acknowledged that that was an underestimate.</p>

<p>This it said was "due to population movement towards central Gaza, and expanded coverage in areas outside the humanitarian pause zone". &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>No child left behind&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>More than 500 teams, consisting of nearly 2,200 health and community outreach workers, took part in the campaign in central Gaza, with vaccinations provided at 143 fixed sites across the area.</p>

<p>In addition, mobile teams visited tents and hard-to-reach areas, including those outside the agreed humanitarian pause zone.</p>

<p>While the large-scale campaign in central Gaza is over, the WHO said that vaccinations would continue at four large health facilities there over the next few days "to ensure no child is missed in the area".</p>

<p>The main focus is meanwhile set to move to southern Gaza, where an estimated 340,000 children over the next four days will receive their first dose.</p>

<p>And finally, the campaign will be concentrated in northern Gaza between September 9 and 11, targeting around 150,000 children, the WHO said.</p>

<p>A fresh campaign to provide a needed second dose is due to begin in about four weeks time.</p>

<p>The WHO has stressed that it is vital to reach at least 90 per cent coverage to avoid the spread of the disease both within Gaza's borders and beyond.</p>

<p>"We want to ensure... there will be no other Gaza children who actually will suffer from polio," Rik Peeperkorn, the WHO's representative for the Palestinian territories, told reporters on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"But we also want to make sure that we prevent the spread of polio to neighbouring countries."</p>

<p>The October 7 Hamas attack that sparked the war resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians and including hostages killed in captivity, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's campaign against Hamas since October 7 has killed at least 40,861 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry. The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Japan, companies are cashing in on employees' hesitancy to call it quits and helping people leave their unsatisfying workplaces. According to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, a company named Exit is in the job of helping people resign from their jobs and is even offering half-off for returning clients. The firm, launched in 2017, overseas the resignations of around 10,000 people per year. For 20,000 yen (approximately Rs 11,600), the business makes a call to the client's company and informs them that they are quitting while spelling out other details. They also tell them about when their last day would be at the office and gather other information about how to return company-issued tech or uniforms and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ever since Exit's launch, similar services have cropped up across the country, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/workplace-dissatisfied-quitting-agencies-japan-5c5586d5?mod=lifestyle_lead_story" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>WSJ</em></a>. Its competitor Albatross calls clients' places of employment and declares they are quitting and specifies details, such as last day. Another firm called Momuri - which translates to "I can't do this anymore" - is also gaining popularity in Japan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To answer why workers are reaching out to such firms is quite simple. People in Japan find it difficult to quit jobs because they face immense opposition and stress while doing so. In most extreme cases, grumpy bosses rip up resignation letters and harass employees to force them to stay. "Japanese are not educated to debate and express opinions," Exit co-founder Toshiyuki Niino, 34, told the Wall Street Journal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Separately, Ayumi Sekine, who works at Albatross, said he also faced a similar situation with his previous job. He said that when he tried to resign from his job at a gas company, his former boss refused to acknowledge it and he had to beg him to go. Only after an immense crying was he allowed to leave the job.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yuta Sakamoto, another disgruntled employee, paid over $200 to a quitting agency to help him leave his job where his former boss warned him that he'd be ruining his career if he ever left. Then there are some who can't afford these services and pretend to be from a quitting agency when tendering a resignation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Albatross CEO Shinji Tanimoto says that most of the bosses are fine with a third party informing them about an employee going on notice. However, a few of them demand legal negotiations with a lawyer present.</p>

<p>The reason behind quitting is mostly because of difficult bosses, unpaid overtime, and a culture of not being able to use your paid time off.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, according to <em>WSJ</em>, many companies in Japan are also reaching out to quitting agencies for referrals for the newly unemployed.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China insisted Thursday it did not pose a threat to New Zealand's national security after the country's spy service singled out Beijing-backed groups as a "complex intelligence concern".</p>

<p>New Zealand's Security Intelligence Service levelled unusually candid criticisms at China in its annual threat report, released this week, saying ongoing foreign interference efforts were "complex and deceptive".</p>

<p>China's embassy in New Zealand hit back on Thursday, branding such claims "entirely baseless" and "a figment of imagination or sheer fabrication".</p>

<p>"There is no competition to speak of between the two countries, and China is not a threat to New Zealand," an embassy spokesperson said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beijing was accused of infiltrating local groups, replacing authentic community views with those approved by the ruling party.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In one example, a Chinese-language community news outlet was accused of regurgitating government talking points.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The report's blatant attempts to discredit the Chinese diaspora and students are nothing but an effort to sow discord, create fear, and foster division," replied China's embassy spokesperson.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is highly irresponsible, reckless, and deeply unfair to the Chinese community."&nbsp;</p>

<p>China's embassy suggested external forces -- likely a veiled reference to the United States -- had been meddling to undermine relations between the trading partners.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New Zealand's centre-right government has shifted the country's foreign policy closer to traditional Western allies such as the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This has come with an increased willingness to speak out against China.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In March, Wellington said a Chinese state-sponsored group was behind a 2021 malicious cyber attack that infiltrated sensitive government computer systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China remains New Zealand's biggest trading partner -- exporting dairy, meat and wood products that exceeded NZ$21.39 billion (US$13.2 billion), according to the most recent official data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New Zealand Prime Minister Christoper Luxon has warned that although China was "a country of undoubted influence", different values mean "there are issues on which we cannot and will not agree".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week, US President Joe Biden expressed his concerns about the safety of people in Bangladesh and the future of democratic institutions there, the White House has said.</p>

<p>During the call, President Biden and PM Modi “shared concerns” on the recent developments in Bangladesh, White House national security communications adviser John Kirby told a press conference on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"I mean, the president made clear his continued concerns about the safety and security of the people in Bangladesh and the future of their democratic institutions," he said in response to a question.</p>

<p>The statement issued by the White House after the August 26 call did not mention Bangladesh. However, a post on X by PM Modi and a statement issued by his office mentioned that Bangladesh was discussed during the telephonic conversation.</p>

<p>"The two leaders expressed their shared concern over the situation in Bangladesh. They emphasized restoration of law and order and ensuring safety and security of the minorities, particularly Hindus, in Bangladesh," the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) had said.</p>

<p>In his post on X, PM Modi had said,“We also discussed the situation in Bangladesh and stressed on the need for early restoration of normalcy, and ensuring the safety and security of minorities, especially Hindus, in Bangladesh."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In yet another endorsement of Republican candidate Donald Trump, tech billionaire Elon Musk said the former US president must win if the American people want to "preserve freedom and meritocracy".</p>

<p>"I have never been materially active in politics before, but this time I think civilization as we know it is on the line. If we want to preserve freedom and a meritocracy in America, then Trump must win," he wrote in a post on X.</p>

<p>Musk was responding to a post that praised him as the "one of the best in the world at synthesizing complex information". The post was responding to a X user accusing Musk of spreading misinformation and joining the "MAGA cult", a reference to Trump's campaign slogan Make America Great Again.</p>

<p>The Tesla CEO had first openly endorsed Trump after he was shot at during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery. Last time America had a candidate this tough was Theodore Roosevelt," he wrote on X while sharing a video of Trump raising his fist in the air after a bullet grazed the top of his ear during an assassination attempt.</p>

<p>Since then, Musk has not shied away from throwing his weight behind the former president's re-election bid. From wanting to work on Trump's cabinet to holding an exclusive interview with the Republican candidate on X, years after the platform banned him for "incitement of violence" after the January 6 violence.</p>

<p>Musk has also hit out at Trump's rival and US Vice President Kamala Harris. On Wednesday, he shared a shared an AI-generated image of Harris and said she "vows to be a communist dictator on day one".&nbsp;</p>

<p>This came after Harris attacked Trump for "vowing to be a dictator on day one" of his job if he is elected President of USA again.</p>

<p>In the past, Musk had backed Joe Biden in the 2020 US Presidential Election. He has said he worked closely with the Obama administration and he voted for Hilary Clinton in 2016 against Trump.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US welcomes any nation that is willing to try to help end the conflict in Ukraine, White House national security communications adviser John Kirby has said.</p>

<p>His remarks came after he was asked at a press conference on Wednesday about President Joe Biden's call to Prime Minister Narendra Modi after the latter's trip to Ukraine that was preceded by his visit to Moscow, and if he thought India could play a role in ending the war.</p>

<p>Kirby said, "Any nation that is willing to try to help end this war and do so in keeping with President Zelenskyy's prerogatives, the Ukrainian people's prerogatives, his plan for a just peace, we would certainly welcome a role like that." On whether he thought India could play a role in bringing peace, the White House official said, "Well, we certainly hope so."</p>

<p>In his call, President Biden commended PM Modi for his historic visits to Poland and Ukraine, the first by an Indian Prime Minister in decades, and for his message of peace and ongoing humanitarian support for Ukraine, including its energy sector.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that Israel will only agree to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza that guarantees the border area between southern Gaza and Egypt could never be used as a lifeline for the Islamist movement Hamas.</p>

<p>"Until that happens, we're there," he told a news conference in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Netanyahu repeated his outright rejection of a withdrawal from the so-called Philadelphi corridor in the first phase of a deal, expected to last 42 days, saying international pressure would make it effectively impossible to return.</p>

<p>For a permanent ceasefire to be agreed upon after that, Israel would need guarantees that whoever ran postwar Gaza would be able to prevent the corridor from being used as a route for smuggling weapons and supplies for Hamas.</p>

<p>"Somebody has to be there," he said. "Bring me anyone who will actually show - not on paper, not in words, not on a slide - but day after day, week after week, month after month, that they can actually prevent a recurrence of what happened there before," he said, referring to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel.</p>

<p>"We're open to consider it, but I don't see that happening right now."</p>

<p>The Philadelphi corridor, along the southern edge of the Gaza Strip bordering Egypt, has been one of the main obstacles to a deal to halt the fighting in Gaza and bring Israeli hostages home in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<p>Netanyahu has insisted on retaining control of the corridor, where Israeli troops have uncovered dozens of tunnels that officials say have been used to supply Hamas with weapons and ammunition.</p>

<p>The prime minister has faced heavy criticism from many in Israel for holding out on the issue, including from many in his own security establishment who believe Israeli troops can make targeted interventions if needed to prevent any smuggling.</p>

<p>The families of many hostages, including some of the six whose bodies were recovered from a tunnel in southern Gaza on Sunday, have accused him of sacrificing their loved ones by insisting on keeping troops in the corridor.</p>

<p>But he said maintaining pressure on Hamas was the best way to return the 101 hostages still remaining in Gaza.</p>

<p>"You need to squeeze them, to put pressure on them to release the remaining hostages. So if you want to release the hostages, you've got to control the Philadelphi corridor," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas said on Thursday there was no need for new ceasefire proposals for Gaza and pressure should be put on Israel to agree to a U.S. plan that the Islamist group had already accepted.</p>

<p>The United States was expected to present a new truce proposal aimed at breaking an impasse between Hamas and Israel.</p>

<p>In a statement, Hamas said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sought to thwart an agreement by insisting that Israel will not withdraw from the Philadelphi corridor in southern Gaza.</p>

<p>"We warn against falling into Netanyahu's trap and tricks, as he uses negotiations to prolong the aggression against our people," the statement said.</p>

<p>Hamas said it accepted a July 2 proposal put forward by the U.S.</p>

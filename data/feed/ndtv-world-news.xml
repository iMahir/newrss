       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When either Rishi Sunak or Keir Starmer take to the stage to hail victory in the British election on Friday, they will be joined at their moment of triumph by either a man with a trash can on his head or someone dressed as "Elmo" from the Muppets.</p>

<p>Among the more than 4,500 candidates standing for election to parliament's 650 seats are those from fringe parties, single-issue campaigners, and, in a peculiarly British tradition, those who are simply making fun of the whole thing.</p>

<p>The best-known figure in the latter category is Count Binface, "an intergalactic space warrior, leader of the Recyclons from planet sigma IX", who will be challenging Prime Minister Sunak in his constituency in northern England.</p>

<p>Dressed in a silver outfit with a matching cape and wearing a silver trash can as a helmet, Binface says he wants to make the July 4 election "Bindependence Day" and that he is the "sane" choice for the electorate.</p>

<p>"That's right, under the British system I get to stand against Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, it's brilliant," Binface, aka comedian Jonathan Harvey, told Reuters outside parliament where he was mobbed by passers-by asking to have their photograph taken with him.</p>

<p>Binface is now a familiar face - or helmet - at British elections, having stood against two ex-prime ministers, Theresa May in 2017 - albeit then in his former guise as Lord Buckethead - and Boris Johnson in 2019. He also contested the London mayor elections in 2021 and in May this year when he won 24,000 votes.</p>

<p>Among his eye-catching policies are pledges to price-cap croissants at 1.10 pounds ($1.39), national service for all former prime ministers and that he should represent the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest.</p>

<p>"It might be true that on Thursday night or Friday morning, I haven't beaten Rishi Sunak numerically," said Binface, who has been endorsed by one national newspaper, the irreverent Daily Star tabloid. "But I would argue the moral victory will be mine."</p>

<h3><strong>LOONIES</strong></h3>

<p>The veterans of the UK comedy candidate genre belong to the Official Monster Raving Loony Party which was formed in 1982 and has regularly contested elections ever since.</p>

<p>This year it is fielding 22 candidates, including Howling 'Laud' Hope, the party leader, Baron Von Thunderclap, and Earl Elvis of East Anglia.</p>

<p>Elsewhere "AI Steve" is hoping to become the world's first artificial intelligence lawmaker, while the Psychedelic Movement Party candidate in Southend is standing on pledges to ignore the law and open 24-hour cannabis cafes.</p>

<p>Some candidates make no secret of using the election for publicity such as Chris French who is standing having entered his pub "The Mitre" in Richmond, west London, as a political party.</p>

<p>Polls say Labour leader Starmer will be Britain's next leader. "Elmo" from the Muppets will be competing for his seat.</p>

<p>Like Count Binface, Elmo has stood in numerous elections although Bobby Smith, the man in the furry red outfit, is seeking to make an earnest political point and wants to change the law on fathers' rights.</p>

<p>Binface himself had a serious message behind the jokes, saying it was important to protect democracy in a year when "over half the eligible humans on your planet" would go to the polls.</p>

<p>"I'm here to cherish it, to defend it, to celebrate the fact that anyone in the UK can not just vote but you all stand for election whatever your platform or however idiotic you look," he said. "I urge everyone ... do go out to vote, and most importantly, make your vote, count."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Voting for the first time in a British election, Prathesh Paulraj and other immigrant voters are excited to take part in the July 4 ballot, hoping they can influence change in the country that they have chosen to call home.</p>

<p>The opposition Labour Party is widely expected to win by a landslide, replacing Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservative Party which has been in power for 14 years.</p>

<p>Refugees and immigrants from Commonwealth countries, mainly former territories of the British Empire such as Nigeria, India, and Malaysia, are eligible to vote in British elections.</p>

<p>Paulraj, 27, who came to Britain in February last year, said he was excited to cast his vote after missing the election in his native India.</p>

<p>"In my country, they don't allow people from other countries to vote ... I came here on a student visa, but they are giving us an opportunity, like British citizens," said Panjak who works part-time as an ambassador at his university in Manchester, northwest England.</p>

<p>Teh Wen Sun, a 33-year-old Malaysian student from Salford, not far from Manchester, said she did not see much difference between the two main parties, but she was keen to vote for a party that is more receptive to immigrants.</p>

<p>Immigration is an electoral battleground in Britain, with Sunak promising to cut net migration levels if the Conservatives win, amid concern from many British voters that it was too high and put excessive pressure on the state-run National Health Service, housing and education.</p>

<p>Sunak has since tightened visa rules and made international headlines for a policy to send asylum seekers to Rwanda.</p>

<p>Oyinkansola Dirisu, 31, a support worker from Manchester who came to Britain in 2022, said she was looking forward to voting for Labour, and said she wanted whoever won power to make it easier for people like her to move to Britain.</p>

<p>Others, like Esther Offem, 26, who came from Nigeria last September, are still undecided: "None (of the parties) have done much in the areas that I'm most interested in. But at the moment, I would probably go for the Conservatives ... I'm not sure yet."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trapped in a Catholic mission sheltering dozens of women and children from the war raging on the streets of Khartoum, Father Jacob Thelekkadan punched new holes in his belt as the supplies of food dwindled and he grew thinner.</p>

<p>Around 80 people are taking refuge inside the Dar Mariam mission, a Catholic church and school compound in Khartoum's al-Shajara district, caught in the crossfire between Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), according to accounts by the priest and seven other people at the mission.</p>

<p>The roof of the main building has been damaged by shells, and parts of the nuns' quarters have been set ablaze. Holes caused by stray bullets mark the mission's walls.</p>

<p>As food has grown scarce, the nuns have boiled tree leaves for the children to eat and many of the adults have skipped meals.</p>

<p>A Red Cross effort to rescue them in December ended with two dead and seven others wounded, including three of the charity's staff, after gunmen opened fire on the convoy, forcing it to turn back before it could reach the mission. The warring sides traded blame for the attack.</p>

<p>Thelekkadan said he and the nuns had refused offers from the army to ferry them out across the river permanently, leaving the families behind.</p>

<p>"When the road is safe, we will be the first to leave, but with the people," said Thelekkadan, a 69-year-old Indian national.</p>

<p>Many of the inhabitants of Sudan's capital fled after the conflict erupted in April last year, enveloping Khartoum and its sister cities of Bahri and Omdurman along the Nile, and quickly spreading to other parts of the country.</p>

<p>At the start of the war, the RSF occupied strategic sites and residential neighbourhoods in Khartoum, positioning snipers on high-rise buildings. The army, lacking effective ground forces, responded with heavy artillery and air strikes.</p>

<p>The Dar Mariam mission became a safe haven for those lacking the money to flee or without anywhere to go.</p>

<p>Photos shared with Reuters by Thelekkadan show parts of the mission's buildings littered with debris, walls heavily damaged by bullets or shelling, and rooms and corridors blackened by smoke.</p>

<p>"Our food situation became very bad," said Thelekkadan. "We're all very weak."</p>

<p>Extreme hunger has spread across Sudan in areas worst affected by the conflict, prompting famine warnings for areas including Khartoum.</p>

<h3><strong>10 MILLION DISPLACED</strong></h3>

<p>Some families took shelter at the mission in June last year, hoping for protection from its concrete roof. But the area soon became cut off as the RSF pressed to capture the strategic Armoured Corps camp about 2 km away, one of several military bases it was targeting, Thelekkadan said.</p>

<p>Al-Shajara district has come under heavy attack by the RSF. Those living nearby with the money to do so have registered with the military to be taken across the Nile; some have been waiting for months.</p>

<p>But a nighttime evacuation by boat across the White Nile is considered too risky for the children at the mission, Thelekkadan said.</p>

<p>Sudan's war has created the world's biggest internal displacement crisis and has driven nearly 10 million people to seek shelter inside or outside the country, according to the International Organization for Migration.</p>

<p>Reuters has documented how the fighting has triggered ethnically-charged killings in the western region of Darfur and led to the spread of deadly hunger.</p>

<p>The war has also caused unprecedented destruction in the capital, which was sheltered from modern Sudan's previous conflicts. Both warring factions have impeded the delivery of humanitarian relief, aid workers say, leaving civilians dependent on charity provided by groups of neighbourhood volunteers, among others.</p>

<p>An RSF media official said the paramilitary had tried to allow for the evacuation of the families by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), but the army had thwarted the effort and was using them as human shields.</p>

<p>An army spokesman said the families had been trapped by the war, and that troops from the Armoured Corps had done their duty by protecting and helping them, in line with army practice in other conflict-hit areas.</p>

<p>Numbers have fluctuated, but since March about 30 women along with 50 children aged 2-15 have stayed at the mission, according to Thelekkadan. His account was confirmed by two of the nuns, an administrator and four women sheltering at the mission, two other priests who have kept in touch with Dar Mariam, and an army intelligence officer responsible for churches in Khartoum.</p>

<p>Those staying at the mission are mostly Christian refugees from South Sudan and Ethiopia, who set up tents made from plastic sheeting around the compound's buildings, which include a church, a school and a residence.</p>

<p>When fighting starts nearby, they take cover inside the residence. Some poor Sudanese Muslim families have also sought temporary shelter at the mission.</p>

<h3><strong>WAITING FOR EVACUATION</strong></h3>

<p>The bombardments in November shredded an image of the Virgin Mary at the compound's entrance, ripped through the second floor of the main building, and set the roof on fire. Several people were lightly injured.</p>

<p>RSF snipers had the entrance to Dar Mariam in their sights. A boy from the neighbourhood was killed when mortar shrapnel sliced into his head after he had helped carve out an exit at the back of the compound to avoid sniper fire, Thelekkadan said.</p>

<p>The mission's residents had been trying to survive "a lot of shooting and bombing," sister Miriam, one of the nuns, told Reuters in a video call.</p>

<p>"We got used to it and we are not afraid. God is protecting us, but we are waiting for evacuation," she said.</p>

<p>Thelekkadan and the nuns turned their most secure room into a shelter to try to protect the children from the crossfire. They attempted to distract the children from the violence raging around them, creating a space to use bicycles in the yard and encouraging them to play video games.</p>

<p>"We tried not to make them feel like they are in a prison," Thelekkadan said.</p>

<p>In early January, the mission was caught in the crossfire again and rooms in the nuns' residence were set ablaze.</p>

<p>Food has been a challenge. By September, cash was running low, and collecting supplies from local markets became nearly impossible due to clashes.</p>

<p>The children have often received meagre servings of porridge, lentils and beans. But stocks dwindled.</p>

<p>Since February, troops stationed at the Armoured Corps camp have delivered some airdropped provisions to Dar Mariam, including sugar and fuel for generators used to draw water from wells, Thelekkadan said.</p>

<p>The army also provided a Starlink connection, allowing those at the mission to use their phones again. They flew the priest and an administrator twice to Port Sudan, a Red Sea city to which army and government offices have relocated, to meet church officials and collect some cash and supplies.</p>

<p>Sister Celestine, another of the nuns, said she is still gripped by fear each time bombardments shake the area.</p>

<p>"I would like to be out of here," she said. "I want to get out and write a book about everything that happened."</p>

<p>The fighting has shown little sign of abating.</p>

<p>"These past four days have become very trying for all of us in Dar Mariam and people around as explosions, bombings, gunfire etc have become more intense and frequent!" Thelekkadan said in a message on June 19. "Please do continue to pray for us."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Predictions of the world's end have been made for centuries, from floods to fires to comets. But none have come true.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember the hysteria surrounding December 21, 2012? The world was supposedly ending, and many believed it. This belief was based on a misinterpretation of the Mayan calendar, which some thought hinted at an impending global catastrophe on the said date. However, December 21, 2012, arrived, and nothing happened. The world continued to spin and life went on as usual.</p>

<p>Predictions of the world's end have been made for centuries, from floods to fires to comets. But none have come true.</p>

<p>Here is a list of some of the major failed doomsday predictions:</p>

<h3><strong>Maya Apocalypse</strong></h3>

<p>On December 21, 2012, the Maya Long Count calendar completed its first cycle. Despite the calendar's continuous time tracking, many misinterpreted this event as a harbinger of doom. Fanciful predictions emerged, including a collision with a fictional planet, solar flares, and axis realignment. Some even built arks and sold survival kits. But the predicted apocalypse never came.</p>

<h3><strong>Harold Camping</strong></h3>

<p>Harold Camping has made a dozen apocalyptic predictions based on his biblical numerology interpretations. In 1992, he wrote "1994?", forecasting the world's end around that year. His most significant prediction was May 21, 2011, calculated as 7,000 years after the Biblical flood. When nothing happened, he recalculated and pushed the doomsday date to October 21, 2011, when, again, nothing happened.</p>

<h3><strong>True Way</strong></h3>

<p>Leader of the True Way movement, Hon-Ming Chen predicted God would appear on TV in 1988, followed by his physical manifestation. In 1989, he foretold massive flooding, devil spirits and even human extinction and said his followers could escape by buying spots on "cloud" spaceships. His bizarre prophecies ultimately proved false.</p>

<h3><strong>Halley's Comet</strong></h3>

<p>In 1910, as Halley's Comet approached Earth, fears of destruction and poisonous gases spread globally. Media headlines like "Comet May Kill All Earth Life, Says Scientist" fueled the panic. Some believed the comet's tail would wipe out all humanity. A group in Oklahoma attempted to sacrifice a virgin to appease the comet, while others stockpiled bottled air. Ultimately, the Earth passed through the comet's tail with no apparent effects.</p>

<h3><strong>Millerism</strong></h3>

<p>William Miller's apocalyptic preaching attracted many followers who believed Jesus would come for the second time in 1843. When the prediction failed, William Miller recalculated, setting a new date for 1844. His devoted followers anxiously waited, only to face crushing disappointment.</p>

<h3><strong>Joanna Southcott</strong></h3>

<p>Joanna Southcott began hearing voices at 42, predicting future events like crop failures and famines. In 1813, she proclaimed she would give birth to the second messiah at 65, despite being a virgin. Her followers eagerly awaited the arrival, however, Joanna Southcott died before the predicted birth could happen.</p>

<h3><strong>Prophet Hen</strong></h3>

<p>In 1806, a hen in Leeds, England, seemed to lay eggs with "Christ is coming" written on them. People flocked to see the hen, fearing Judgment Day. But it was a trick - the owner had been writing on the eggs with ink and reinserting them into the hen's body.</p>

<h3><strong>Great Fire Of London</strong></h3>

<p>In 1666, many Europeans feared the end of the world, linking the year to the "number of the Beast" (666). The Great Fire of London, which razed much of the city, seemed to confirm these fears. The blaze destroyed 87 churches and 13,000 houses, but surprisingly, only 10 people died.</p>

<h3><strong>Global Flood</strong></h3>

<p>In 1524, German mathematician and astrologer Johannes Stoffler predicted a global flood on February 25, saying the planets had aligned under Pisces. But despite light rain, the flood never came.</p>

<h3><strong>Montanism</strong></h3>

<p>In the 2nd century, Montanus' visions led to a Christian split. He predicted Jesus would return and convinced many to leave their homes and wait for Jesus in Phrygia (modern Turkey). They expected the heavenly Jerusalem to descend, but the deity failed to materialise. The movement caused disruption, with many Christian communities left almost deserted.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Activists have continued to agitate online against President William Ruto, despite his decision last week to withdraw a controversial bill that triggered what he has branded "treasonous" protests by Gen-Z Kenyans.</p>

<p>The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) on Monday said that 39 people had been killed and 361 injured during two weeks of protests -- with the worst violence occurring in Nairobi last Tuesday -- and condemned the use of force against demonstrators as "excessive and disproportionate".</p>

<p>It is the most serious crisis to confront Ruto since he took office in September 2022 in a nation often considered a beacon of stability in a turbulent region.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After last week's bloody chaos, young Kenyans, whose protest movement has no official leaders, called for a new day of peaceful action on Tuesday, with leaflets posted online using the hashtag "RutoMustGo".</p>

<p>But Nairobi's central business district -- the focus of previous rallies -- saw sporadic confrontations on Tuesday afternoon. Police fired tear gas and used water cannon against groups of stone-throwing men, some of whom lit bonfires on deserted roads.</p>

<p>"Goons have infiltrated," prominent Gen-Z protester Hanifa Adan posted on X.</p>

<p>AFP journalists reported seeing a number of arrests and injuries, although there are no official figures.</p>

<p>Several coffins, some covered with the national flag, were placed on roads by protesters, images on Kenyan television showed, before they were removed by officers.</p>

<p>Local politician John Kwenya told AFP that business owners shuttering their shops were "scared" of the "goons".</p>

<p>"This is economic sabotage," said Kwenya, a member of the Nairobi city county assembly.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the country, local television broadcast images of larger marches in the coastal opposition stronghold of Mombasa, where a number of cars were torched, and Kenyan media shared video of at least one shop being vandalised.</p>

<p>Interior Minister Kithure Kindiki denounced what he described as an "orgy of violence", warning that the government would take action against anyone engaging in "anarchic chaos and cruel plunder".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This reign of terror against the people of Kenya and the impunity of dangerous criminal gangs must end at whatever cost," he said.</p>

<p>On Tuesday last week, largely peaceful anti-tax rallies descended into deadly chaos when lawmakers passed the finance bill -- a deeply unpopular move among Kenyans already suffering from a cost of living crisis.</p>

<p>After the announcement of the vote, crowds ransacked the partly ablaze parliament complex in central Nairobi as police fired live bullets at protesters.</p>

<p>Although Ruto scrapped the legislation and appealed for dialogue with young Kenyans, his actions appear not to have appeased his critics.</p>

<p>In a television interview on Sunday he defended his decision to call in the military to tackle unrest and insisted he did not have "blood on my hands".&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Rift Valley town of Nakuru on Tuesday, protesters marched peacefully, with some carrying pictures of three people killed in last week's demonstrations.</p>

<p>"We want justice for innocent Kenyans killed by police during the protests that were peaceful," Mary Lynn Wangui told AFP.</p>

<p>"Ruto has not offered an apology," said the 24-year-old, as she waved a placard declaring: "RutoMustGo".</p>

<p>At a peaceful march in the lakeside city of Kisumu in western Kenya, demonstrator Allan Odhiambo, 26, told AFP he had lost hope in Ruto.</p>

<p>"We promised a peaceful protest and that is what we have done, but Ruto must go," he said.</p>

<p>The state-funded KNCHR on Monday said that in the previous protests there had been 32 cases of "enforced or involuntary disappearances" and 627 arrests of protesters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kenya's cash-strapped government said previously that the tax increases were necessary to fill its coffers and service a huge public debt of some 10 trillion shillings ($78 billion), or about 70 percent of GDP.</p>

<p>In Sunday's interview, Ruto warned that the government would have to borrow another $7.7 billion because of the decision to drop the finance bill.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden's support for Israel during its nearly nine-month war in Gaza has spurred at least nine U.S. administration officials to quit, with some accusing the US president of turning a blind eye to Israeli atrocities in the Palestinian enclave.</p>

<p>The Biden administration denies this, pointing to its criticism of civilian casualties in Gaza and its efforts to boost humanitarian aid to the enclave, where health officials say nearly 38,000 have been killed in Israel's assault.</p>

<p>Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages, according to Israeli figures.</p>

<h3><strong>Here are the US officials who have resigned:</strong></h3>

<p>Maryam Hassanein, who was a special assistant at the Department of Interior, quit her job on Tuesday. She slammed Biden's foreign policy, describing it as "genocide-enabling" and dehumanizing Arabs and Muslims.</p>

<p>Stacy Gilbert, who served in the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, left in late May. She said she resigned over an administration report to Congress that she said falsely stated Israel was not blocking humanitarian aid to Gaza.</p>

<p>Alexander Smith, a contractor for USAID, quit in late May, alleging censorship after the U.S. foreign aid agency canceled publication of his presentation on maternal and child mortality among Palestinians. The agency said it had not gone through proper review and approval.</p>

<p>In May, Lily Greenberg Call became the first Jewish political appointee to resign, having served as a special assistant to the chief of staff in the Interior Department. &nbsp;"As a Jew, I cannot endorse the Gaza catastrophe," she wrote in the Guardian.</p>

<p>Hala Rharrit, an Arabic language spokesperson for the State Department, departed her post in April in opposition to the United States' Gaza policy, she wrote on her LinkedIn page.</p>

<p>Annelle Sheline resigned from the State Department's human rights bureau in late March, writing in a CNN article that she was unable to serve a government that "enables such atrocities."</p>

<p>Tariq Habash, a Palestinian American, quit as special assistant in the Education Department's office of planning in January. He said the Biden administration was turning a "blind eye" to atrocities in Gaza.</p>

<p>Harrison Mann, a U.S. Army major and Defense Intelligence Agency official, resigned in November over Gaza policy and went public with his reasons in May.</p>

<p>Josh Paul, director of the State Department's bureau of political military affairs, left in October in the first publicly known resignation, citing what he described as Washington's "blind support" for Israel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Britain's election campaign enters its final stretch, the work of opinion pollsters is back in the spotlight with several recent projections of a record victory for the opposition Labour Party grabbing the headlines.</p>

<p>Labour's ample 20-point opinion poll lead has hardly budged since Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced the July 4 election last month, shifting the focus to the question of how big Keir Starmer's win will be rather than whether it will happen.</p>

<p>But Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system means the number of seats each party wins does not closely reflect the national share of votes they receive, so pollsters use so-called MRP modelling in a bid to more accurately estimate the result.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT IS MRP?</strong></h3>

<p>MRP stands for Multilevel Regression and Post-stratification and it is used by pollsters to estimate public opinion at a local level from large national samples. Pollsters describe it as a model that uses polling data, rather than a poll itself.</p>

<h3><strong>HOW DOES IT WORK?</strong></h3>

<p>Pollsters construct a statistical model which summarises how voting intention differs depending on the characteristics of survey respondents and where they live. This will take into account factors such as age, income, educational background and past voting behaviour.</p>

<p>This model is then used to produce estimates of the voting intentions among different types of people living in different areas of the country.</p>

<p>Pollsters combine that with official data on the numbers of people of each type living in each area to generate an estimate of overall voting intention for the constituency.</p>

<p>The exact model used to predict voter behaviour varies from pollster to pollster.</p>

<h3><strong>HOW DOES IT DIFFER FROM OTHER POLLING METHODS?</strong></h3>

<p>Conventional polling methods often apply a uniform national swing to predict how many seats a party will win.</p>

<p>This assumes there will be the same change in vote share for each party throughout the country, which is rarely the case, meaning it can overestimate the performance of a party in some areas and underestimate it in others.</p>

<p>MRP sample size is also much higher. Typical political polls rely on between 1,000 and 2,000 responses, while MRP modelling uses data from tens of thousands of voters.</p>

<h3><strong>HAVE THEY BEEN RIGHT IN THE PAST?</strong></h3>

<p>MRP is a relatively new technique.</p>

<p>After polling companies miscalled an election in 2015 and underestimated support for Brexit in the 2016 referendum, many looked to use more sophisticated data analysis to come up with seat-by-seat results.</p>

<p>MRP was used by YouGov in 2017 to accurately predict Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May would fall short of an overall majority. YouGov said its model called 93% of seats correctly that year.</p>

<p>The method had some success in 2019, with YouGov's MRP predicting a clear majority for the Conservatives although underestimating the scale of it.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT ARE THE LIMITATIONS?</strong></h3>

<p>British voters have become more unpredictable, with Brexit scrambling traditional political allegiances.</p>

<p>More voters switched between the two main parties in a 2017 election than in any ballot dating back to 1966, according to research by the British Election Study. The more people change their minds, the harder it is to draw a representative sample.</p>

<p>"MRP only works when there is a strong link between, on the one hand, the characteristics of individuals and areas and, on the other, the opinion being modelled," the British Polling Council says on their website.</p>

<p>Pollsters describe MRP as an estimate of the range of possible results.</p>

<p>Savanta's MRP published on June 19 projected Labour could win a whopping 516 seats in the 650-strong House of Commons, with the Conservatives on 53. But it also noted nearly 200 seats had less than 7.5 percentage points between the parties in first and second place, deeming them as 'too close to call' and meaning the end result could be very different.</p>

<p>YouGov's MRP published on the same day gave Labour 425 seats and the Conservatives 108, but classified 109 constituencies as "tossups" with fewer than five points between the parties in first and second place.</p>

<p>There may also be specific issues at play in individual seats which MRP modelling is unable to capture.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wafaa Elwan's five-year-old son cannot sleep in the Gaza tent city where she and her seven children shelter, but it is not the guns of war that cause his daily nightmare.</p>

<p>"My son can't sleep through the night because he can't stop scratching his body," the anxious mother said.</p>

<p>The boy has white and red blotches over his feet and legs, and more under his T-shirt. He is one of many Gazans suffering from skin infections ranging from scabies to chicken pox, lice, impetigo and other debilitating rashes.</p>

<p>More than 150,000 people in the Palestinian territory have contracted skin diseases in the squalid conditions into which displaced Gazans have been forced since the Israel-Hamas war erupted on October 7, according to the World Health Organization.</p>

<p>"We sleep on the ground, on sand where worms come out underneath us," said Elwan. Her family is one of thousands living on a sandy patch near the sea close to the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah.</p>

<p>Elwan believes infections are inevitable. "We cannot bathe our children as before. There are no hygiene and sanitary products for us to wash and clean the place. There's nothing."</p>

<p>Parents used to tell their children to wash in the Mediterranean. But pollution that has built up as war has devastated basic facilities has accentuated the risk of disease.</p>

<p>"The sea is all sewage. They even throw garbage and baby napkins into the sea," she said.</p>

<p>The WHO has reported 96,417 cases of scabies and lice since the start of the war in Gaza, 9,274 cases of chickenpox, 60,130 cases of skin rashes and 10,038 impetigo cases.</p>

<p>Scabies and chickenpox are particularly widespread in the coastal Palestinian territory, according to Sami Hamid, a pharmacist who runs a makeshift clinic in the Deir al-Balah camp.</p>

<h3><strong>Blisters and scabs&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Two boys in the clinic showed dozens of the distinctive chickenpox-induced blisters and scabs spread over their hands, feet, backs and stomachs.</p>

<p>Lacking medicines, Hamid, 43, himself displaced, rubbed a calamine lotion on the boys' skin to soothe the itching.</p>

<p>Children's skin suffers from "the hot weather and the lack of clean water", he said.</p>

<p>Mohammed Abu Mughaiseeb, the medical coordinator in Gaza for Doctors Without Borders (MSF), told AFP that children are vulnerable because "they are children -- they play outside, they'll touch anything, eat anything without washing it".</p>

<p>Abu Mughaiseeb said hot weather increases the sweat and accumulation of dirt that causes rashes and allergies, which if scratched lead to infections.</p>

<p>"People are not living in houses anymore, there is no proper hygiene," he said.</p>

<p>MSF doctors fear the appearance of other skin conditions such as leishmaniasis, which can be fatal in its most virulent form.</p>

<p>Gaza's children are already highly vulnerable to disease, he said, because their immune systems are compromised by malnutrition.</p>

<p>Hamid, the pharmacist, said his team visited a makeshift school recently, where 24 out of 150 students had scabies.</p>

<p>"Some of them have developed skin infections, and unfortunately these infections are spreading among them," Ola al-Qula, a teacher at one makeshift tent school, told AFP.</p>

<p>Other diseases have also rampaged through camps for the displaced, feeding on poor hygiene, the WHO warned.</p>

<p>"The toilets here are primitive, draining into channels among tents, which ultimately contributes to the spread of epidemics," said Hamid.</p>

<p>WHO said 485,000 cases of diarrhoea have been reported.</p>

<p>The United Nations said Tuesday there are now 1.9 million people displaced in Gaza out of a population of some 2.4 million.</p>

<p>The war began with Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,925 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Air Europa flight from Madrid to Montevideo made an emergency landing in Brazil after it was hit by severe turbulence that left passengers stuck inside overhead bins and dozens of others with head, neck and chest and chest injuries. The plane, a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner with 325 people on board, was diverted in the early morning hours to the airport of Natal in northeast Brazil, where more than a dozen ambulances waited.</p>

<p>Videos from inside the plane have surfaced on social media which shows passengers helping a fellow flyer out of an overhead bin storage area. It remains unclear how the man came to be lodged in the space. Several passengers said that those not wearing seatbelts were thrown from their seats by the strong turbulence, hitting the ceiling.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hurricane Beryl barreled toward Jamaica as a powerful Category 4 storm on Tuesday, threatening to dump rain on parts of Hispaniola after leaving at least three people dead on smaller islands in the eastern Caribbean.</p>

<p>Tropical storm conditions were expected on parts of the southern coasts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic on Tuesday evening, according to an advisory from the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC).</p>

<p>"Beryl is expected to bring life-threatening winds and storm surge to Jamaica on Wednesday and the Cayman Islands Wednesday night and Thursday," the NHC said. A hurricane warning is in effect for both places.</p>

<p>In Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince, which is in the grips of entrenched gang violence and an ongoing humanitarian crisis, strong winds took residents by surprise on Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>The country's southwestern peninsula could get 4-8 inches (10-20 cm) of rain, with as much as 12 inches in some places, the NHC said. New Haitian Prime Minister Garry Conille warned residents to take precautions and stay alert.</p>

<p>The unusually early hurricane, whose rapid strengthening scientists said was likely fueled by human-caused climate change, is expected to still be a hurricane when it passes near Jamaica and the Cayman Islands later this week.</p>

<p>Beryl, the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane and the earliest storm on record to reach the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson Scale, felled power lines and unleashed flash floods across smaller islands.</p>

<p>The storm hit St. Vincent and the Grenadines especially hard, according to Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves.</p>

<p>"The hurricane has come and gone, and it has left in its wake immense destruction," he said. On one island in the Grenadines archipelago, Union Island, 90% of homes had been "severely damaged or destroyed," he added.</p>

<p>The prime minister confirmed one death and said more fatalities could be confirmed in the coming days.</p>

<p>In a video briefing on Tuesday, Grenada's prime minister, Dickon Mitchell, stressed that Carriacou and Petite Martinique, two of the three islands that make up the country, bore the brunt of the natural disaster.</p>

<p>"The situation is grim. There is no power. There is almost complete destruction of homes and buildings," he said, citing impassable roads due to downed power lines and destroyed fuel stations crimping supplies.</p>

<p>Mitchell said at least two deaths were attributed to the impact of Beryl so far.</p>

<p>The hurricane, packing maximum sustained winds of 150 miles per hour (241 kph), is currently located about 360 miles (579 km) east-southeast of the Jamaican capital of Kingston, according to the NHC.</p>

<p>The Miami-based hurricane centre estimates that the massive weather system is moving toward the west-northwest at a speed of 22 mph (35 kph).</p>

<p>In Jamaica, men hauled fishing boats out of the water and tied them down in preparation for the hurricane's arrival, while others noted there was still time to prepare on Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>"We Jamaicans don't take things serious," said Standford Pusey, as he showed off items secured with plastic tarps.</p>

<p>In Fort-de-France on the French Caribbean island of Martinique, north of St. Vincent, a video shared on social media showed heavy flooding in the streets as locals attempted to clear away debris.</p>

<p>In addition to Haiti's southern coast, the NHC also posted a hurricane watch for Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, dotted with beach resorts popular with tourists.</p>

<p>Ahead of the storm's approach expected Thursday night, Mexico's defense ministry said the army, air force, and national guard had activated emergency response protocols in the three Yucatan states, with 120 shelters opened and nearly 4,900 troops on guard on the peninsula.</p>

<p>The unusually early timing and rapid intensification of the storm is partly due to warmer ocean temperatures, scientists say.</p>

<p>Climate change likely contributed to Beryl's early formation, while also driving how quickly it intensified, according to scientists surveyed by Reuters, which could provide an unsettling preview of future storms.</p>

<p>Global warming has helped push temperatures in the North Atlantic to record highs, said Christopher Rozoff, an atmospheric scientist at the U.S.-based National Center for Atmospheric Research. The warmer waters lead to more evaporation, which fuels more intense hurricanes featuring higher wind speeds, he said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By invoking the Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity, former US President Donald Trump has won a timely reprieve by getting the court to agree to delay his sentencing till after the Republican Party Convention where he is set to be crowned the party's presidential candidate.</p>

<p>Without an objection from the prosecutors, Judge Juan Merchan agreed on Tuesday to postpone the sentencing to consider claims by Trump's lawyers that the top judiciary's ruling applied his conviction last month on 34 charges of falsifying his business records to cover up payments to a porn star.</p>

<p>The sentencing now postponed to September 18 was set for July 11 -- four days before the Republican Party Convention scheduled to be held from July 15 to 18.</p>

<p>Trump faced a maximum sentence of four years for each offence and if he were sentenced as scheduled on July 11, he would have faced in the worst-case scenario the prospect of being in prison during the party convention in Milwaukee in Wisconsin state.</p>

<p>The date now set by the court would also be after the next presidential debate between Trump and President Joe Biden on September 10.</p>

<p>Trump welcomed the delay, posting on the media site 'Truth Social', "The impact of the immunity ruling is a loud and clear signal for justice in the US."</p>

<p>The Supreme Court ruling on Monday that could also affect his other cases came while Biden is facing a crisis because of his bewildering performance last week during a televised debate with Trump when he seemed at times to mumble incoherently and sport a vacant stare.</p>

<p>This has led to questions about his capabilities and calls by even his party members -- and media that is supportive of him -- to withdraw as the Democratic Party candidate and allow someone else more able to take on Trump in the November election.</p>

<p>Trump's lawyers cited the Supreme Court ruling that a President cannot be prosecuted for official actions to demand that his conviction to be tossed out.</p>

<p>The arguments are on flimsy ground, though, because the Supreme Court said that a President can be prosecuted for personal actions as distinct from official actions, and the hush money case involves Trump's personal actions before he became President.</p>

<p>However, their filing against the conviction would still have to get a response from the prosecution and be considered by the judge, buying Trump time.</p>

<p>The local prosecutor who brought the case, Alvin Bragg, wrote to the judge that "although we believe defendant's arguments to be without merit, we do not oppose his request for leave to file and his putative request to adjourn sentencing pending determination of his motion".</p>

<p>Trump's lawyer's arguments hinge on some evidence produced by the prosecutors like cheques he signed and social media posts he made while President that they claim came under the ambit of official actions.</p>

<p>Merchan had already dismissed the claim about social media posts because they were out there for millions of people to see.</p>

<p>Paying hush money to buy the silence of someone to avoid a scandal is not a crime, but falsifying business records is and the prosecution said that he had falsely shown the hush money as payments for legal services leading to his conviction.</p>

<p>Porn star Stormy Daniels had alleged that Trump had a sexual tryst with her in 2006 when his wife was pregnant.</p>

<p>As the 2016 election campaign got underway, Trump paid for her silence $130,000 through his then-lawyer Michael Cohen, who turned against Trump after his conviction in a different case and became a prosecution witness.</p>

<p>The cheques made in installments to Cohen and shown on the account books as lawyer's fees continued while Trump was in the White House.</p>

<p>Merchan has the option to give Trump probation -- virtually a warning that could lead to a prison term if he violates the conditions set by the judge -- and/or a fine but sparing him prison time as Trump would be considered a first-time offender.</p>

<p>Unlike the New York case, the Supreme Court ruling could have a more direct bearing on the secret documents case in a Florida federal court and election interference cases in a Georgia state court and a Washington federal court as they pertain to actions he took while President.</p>

<p>These cases could now be delayed till after the November elections while lawyers thrash out the implications of the Supreme Court ruling.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court's judgment reflected the nation's political divide with six Conservative -- three appointed by Trump -- coming out for the President's immunity and a minority of three liberal judges appointed by Democratic Presidents -- one by Biden -- opposing it.</p>

<p>In Florida, he is accused of illegally keeping classified documents with him after leaving office.</p>

<p>The Washington and Georgia cases revolve around his attempts to stay in power after losing the 2020 election to Biden.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court ruled on Trump's appeal against the Washington case, but it has broader implications for Trump's other cases as well as any to be brought against other Presidents.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden today blamed jet lag from his recent travels overseas for his disastrous debate performance against Republican rival Donald Trump.</p>

<p>"It's not an excuse, but an explanation," he said while addressing a fundraiser.</p>

<p>Biden said he "wasn't very smart" for "traveling around the world a couple times... shortly before the debate."</p>

<p>"I didn't listen to my staff," he said. "And then I almost fell asleep on stage."</p>

<p>Biden had flown to France, back to the United States, to Italy, among other travels, over a 14-day period before taking just a few days to rest at his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.&nbsp;He was dragging, according to several people who observed him during this period.</p>

<p>Joe Biden, who has always been gaffe-prone, appeared to struggle while responding to former US President Donald Trump's charges during the debate.</p>

<p>A bombastic Trump lashed out at his successor, calling him a failure on the economy and the world stage. Biden looked to hit back, but his delivery was hesitant as he spoke rapidly in a soft, trailing-off voice and stumbled on his words several times.</p>

<p>It was the first debate ever between a president and former president -- and each accused each other of being history's worst.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old's fumbling, halting performance has sparked calls from Democrats for him to end his quest for a second term and for "soul-searching".</p>

<p>Biden's remarks could invite even more scrutiny over whether the 81-year-old is fit for rigorous traveling, packed schedule.</p>

<p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre today admitted the debate was "a bad night" but added that Biden "knows how to come back" from adversity.</p>

<p>Responding to the criticism, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said people around the world were looking at what Biden has done since coming into office, not just one night, and that they appreciate his policies.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK Labour Party is 99 per cent "certain" to secure more seats in Thursday's general election than when it won a landslide victory in 1997, a major new poll said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The centre-left opposition party -- out of power since 2010 -- is predicted to claim 484 out of a total of 650 seats in what would be an unprecedented victory in modern British history, pollster Survation said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the right-wing ruling Conservatives and the centrist Liberal Democrats (Lib Dems) are in a close race to come a distant second and form the country's official opposition, it added.</p>

<p>The prediction is the latest in a series of so-called MRP polls -- which use large national samples to forecast results for every UK constituency -- that estimate Labour will win emphatically on July 4.</p>

<p>Such a scenario would see its leader Keir Starmer replace the Conservatives' Rishi Sunak as prime minister.</p>

<p>Labour has led the Tories in the polls by double-digit margins for nearly two years, and the gap has failed to narrow during a six-week election campaign widely seen as having gone badly for Sunak.</p>

<p>Survation said its data indicated that Labour would win around 42 per cent of the overall vote, ahead of the Conservatives on 23 per cent.</p>

<p>However, due to the UK's winner-takes-all electoral system in each of its 650 constituencies, that would see the Conservatives capture just 64 seats, with the Lib Dems predicted to claim 61.</p>

<p>Labour's estimated 484 seats would exceed the 418 won by ex-prime minister Tony Blair in 1997, and even top the Tories' landslide haul of 470 in 1931.</p>

<p>The pollster also predicted that Labour would again become the largest party in Scotland, winning 38 of its 57 seats and supplanting the Scottish National Party (SNP), which it estimated would secure just 10 seats.</p>

<p>The pro-independence SNP won 48 Scottish constituencies at the last election in 2019.</p>

<p>The Conservatives are "virtually certain" to win a lower share of the vote than at any past general election, according to Survation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it forecasted that Reform UK, the anti-immigration party founded by Brexit figurehead Nigel Farage, would only win a handful of seats despite taking the third-largest overall share of the vote, again due to the electoral system.</p>

<p>The Survation prediction, based on nearly 35,000 electorate interviews, is likely to intensify warnings by Sunak in the final hours of the campaign that voters should be weary of voting Labour and handing it a so-called "super-majority".</p>

<p>Starmer has accused his Conservative rivals of running "an increasingly desperate, negative campaign".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google, despite its goal of achieving net-zero emissions, is pumping out more greenhouse gas than before as it powers data centers needed to support artificial intelligence, the company said.</p>

<p>Google's climate-changing emissions have increased 48 per cent in the past five years, at odds with a touted goal of becoming carbon neutral for the sake of the planet, according to an annual environmental report released on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Total greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 were 13 per cent higher than they were the prior year, primarily driven by increased data center energy consumption and its supply chain, the report stated.</p>

<p>The increase came even though Google has been ramping up the use of solar and wind-generated clean energy.</p>

<p>"In spite of the progress we're making, we face significant challenges that we're actively working through," chief sustainability officer Kate Brandt and senior vice president Benedict Gomes said in the report.</p>

<p>"As we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment."</p>

<p>Google is not alone in facing the challenge of feeding power-hungry AI data centers, while trying to curb the creation of climate-changing greenhouse gas.</p>

<p>Microsoft said in its recent sustainability report that its greenhouse gas emissions last year were up 29 per cent from 2020 as it continues "to invest in the infrastructure needed to advance new technologies."</p>

<p>Microsoft and Google have been front runners in an AI race since OpenAI released ChatGPT in late 2022.</p>

<p>AI has been a theme for the rivals in blockbuster earnings performances quarter after quarter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Google and Microsoft have each pledged to be carbon neutral by the end of this decade.</p>

<p>Microsoft has an added goal of being carbon-negative, taking climate-harming gas out of the air, by 2050.</p>

<p>Amazon, also an AI contender with its AWS cloud computing division, has said it is aiming to be carbon neutral by 2040.</p>

<p>"A sustainable future requires systems-level change, strong government policies, and new technologies," Google said in its report.</p>

<p>"We're committed to collaboration and playing our part, every step of the way."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to hear a challenge to a law in Republican-led Texas that requires pornographic websites to verify the age of visitors in order to limit minors' access to online sexual content.</p>

<p>Passed last summer, the law mandating adult websites to require state-issued identification from users was challenged in court by a trade association representing the adult entertainment industry that argued it violates First Amendment free speech rights.</p>

<p>A federal court sided with the trade association, called the Free Speech Coalition, and blocked the law, saying it was too restrictive.</p>

<p>But in March a conservative appeals court agreed with Texas authorities and upheld the age verification requirement, prompting the trade group to appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>In its legal brief to the high court, the group cited the risk of "disclosures, leaks and hacks" and argued that "by verifying information through government identification, the law will allow the government to peer into the most intimate and personal aspects of people's lives."</p>

<p>In his brief to the Supreme Court, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton argued "there is nothing unconstitutional" about the law.</p>

<p>"This statute does not prohibit the performance, production, or even sale of pornography but, more modestly, simply requires the pornography industry... to take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that those who access the material are adults," Paxton wrote.</p>

<p>Texas authorities have been raising alarm over minors' access to adult content, calling it a public health crisis.</p>

<p>Similar age verification laws have been passed in other states including Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas and others.</p>

<p>Oral arguments in the case will take place during the Supreme Court term which begins on October 7.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Laughing and joking, Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un cruised around Pyongyang last week in a Russian-made Aurus limousine to showcase their strengthened anti-Western alliance.</p>

<p>The luxury sedan was intended to epitomize Russia's domestic prowess and reduced dependence on imported technology and goods when unveiled in 2018.</p>

<p>But customs records show that the company that builds it uses millions of dollars in imported parts, many arriving in Russia from what Kim has described as his country's "primary foe", South Korea.</p>

<p>The imports point to Russia's ongoing reliance on Western technology as it seeks to navigate Western attempts to cut it off from global supply chains as punishment for its invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>The two leaders took turns driving the armoured limousine during Putin's pomp-filled visit, his first in nearly a quarter of a century to North Korea, in a demonstration of the two nuclear powers' increasingly close ties.</p>

<p>Russia imported equipment and components worth at least $34 million between 2018 and 2023 for assembling Aurus cars and motorcycles, customs records seen by Reuters showed. Reuters does not have access to more recent data.</p>

<p>The imports included car body parts, sensors, programmable controllers, switches, welding equipment and other components worth almost $15.5 million imported from South Korea. Parts were also imported from China, India, Turkey, Italy and other EU countries.</p>

<p>Foreign supplies for Aurus kept coming after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with goods worth almost $16 million, including $5 million produced in South Korea, imported since February 2022, the records showed.</p>

<p>Reuters could not determine specifically which imported foreign parts ended up in the car gifted to Kim, and the imports were not in breach of sanctions - Aurus LLC was sanctioned by the United States in February, 2024.</p>

<p>The Aurus sedan was developed by Russian state-owned research institute NAMI in partnership with Russian carmaker Sollers, which has since sold its stake.</p>

<p>Aurus Motors and its CEO Andrey Pankov did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment on the use of foreign parts, including from South Korea, in its vehicles.</p>

<p><strong>GROWING PRODUCTION</strong></p>

<p>The company launched official production in Russia's Tatarstan region, around 1,000 km (620 miles) from Moscow, in 2021 - before then it was made on a small, experimental scale at NAMI. It will start additional production in St Petersburg later this year at Toyota's former factory.</p>

<p>Toyota is one of many foreign carmakers to exit the Russian market since the invasion, which Russia calls a "special military operation".</p>

<p>The exodus has left a gap that Chinese producers have been quick to fill, rapidly seizing more than half the market share and exposing Russia's limited domestic production capacity.</p>

<p>South Korean firms were among the largest suppliers to Aurus, including industrial equipment producer Kyungki Industrial Co, car body parts manufacturer BYT CO LTD and batteries supplier Enertech International Inc.</p>

<p>Italian plastic parts producer Industrie Ilpea Spa and Hong Kong company Rain Electronics also supplied goods.</p>

<p>Kyungki Industrial Co said in a statement to Reuters on Monday that it had not signed any contract with Aurus or Russian suppliers since 2021 or participated in any further projects in Russia since 2022. It also said that it would be concerned about any potential sanctions.</p>

<p>A company representative had earlier told Reuters the company continued to supply Aurus and was not concerned about potential sanctions. The representative later referred Reuters to Monday's statement.</p>

<p>Rain Electronics could not be reached for comment. When a Reuters correspondent visited the address listed on the internet as the company's office in Hong Kong, there was no trace of Rain Electronics on the floor listed online or in the office building.</p>

<p>BYT CO LTD, Enertech International and Industrie Ilpea Spa did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.</p>

<p>The Aurus Senat, retro-styled after the Soviet-era ZIL limousine, is Russia's official presidential car and was used by Putin at his presidential inaugurations in 2018 and 2024.</p>

<p>Putin has now given Kim, believed to be a keen automobile fan, two Aurus cars, first during Kim's visit to Russia in February, and a slightly different model in North Korea in June.</p>

<p>Prices for Aurus cars - there are four models including an SUV and armoured version - start from 46.625 million roubles ($528,356). Customers include Turkmenistan President Serdar Berdymukhamedov.</p>

<p>Aurus sold 107 cars in Russia in 2023, according to data from Russian analytical agency Autostat. Aurus does not disclose production numbers.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Chinese officials boarded and then seized a Taiwanese fishing boat operating near China's coast close to a Taiwan-controlled island and took it to a Chinese port, the Taiwan coast guard said late on Tuesday in a further escalation of tensions.</p>

<p>China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and has ramped up pressure on Taipei since President Lai Ching-te took office in May, a man Beijing accuses of being a "separatist".</p>

<p>The fishing boat was operating near the Taiwan-administered Kinmen islands, which sit next to the Chinese cities of Xiamen and Quanzhou, on Tuesday night when it was boarded and seized by two Chinese maritime administration boats, Taiwan's coast guard said.</p>

<p>Taiwan sent it own coast guard ships to assist and broadcast warnings asking China to release the fishing boat, but China's ships broadcast back saying not to interfere, Taiwan's coast guard said in a statement.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel has killed about 900 militants in Rafah since the beginning of Israel's ground assault on the southernmost city in Gaza in early May, Israel's military Chief Herzi Halevi said.</p>

<p>The casualties include "at least one battalion commander, many company commanders, and many operatives," Halevi said on Tuesday when inspecting a military logistic post in the southern Gaza Strip, according to a statement released by the Israel Defense Forces.</p>

<p>He added that the offensive in Rafah is expected to be completed within weeks, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>"Now the effort focuses on the destruction of the infrastructure and the destruction of the underground infrastructure, and it takes time," he said, noting, "This campaign is long because we don't want to leave Rafah with the infrastructure intact."</p>

<p>Before the launch of the ground offensive, Rafah was one of the few locations where civilians sought refuge from the massive Israeli bombardments across the Palestinian enclave.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden on Tuesday blamed his recent foreign travels for his debate debacle.</p>

<p>"I wasn't very smart. I decided to travel around the world a couple of times … shortly before the debate," Biden said while talking to donors at a fundraiser in a Virginia suburb of Washington DC. "I didn't listen to my staff … and then I almost fell asleep on stage."</p>

<p>In his remarks, Biden admitted that he did not have a good debate, and said he "wasn't very smart" for "travelling around the world a couple times" before the debate.</p>

<p>Biden also apologised by saying he was sorry for the performance. "It's not an excuse but an explanation." The president's remarks at the fund raiser was just for six minutes, which is far shorter than what he speaks on such occasions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the White House said Biden will travel to Wisconsin on Friday. He will conduct a sit-down interview with George Stephanopoulos from ABC News, while on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>He will travel to Philadelphia on Sunday. And next week, he will host a NATO press conference, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at her daily news conference.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrats shocked by Joe Biden's dismal debate performance urged the US president Tuesday to be transparent about his mental fitness as he faced the first call from his own side to drop out of the election.</p>

<p>Some supporters have expressed growing doubts about the 81-year-old after last week's televised showdown with Donald Trump when Biden stumbled over his words and lost his train of thought -- exacerbating fears about his age.</p>

<p>Congressman Lloyd Doggett became the first Democratic lawmaker to publicly call on Biden to make way for another candidate, saying he was hopeful the president would "make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw."</p>

<p>Nancy Pelosi, a former House speaker and a grandee of the Democratic Party, said in her own statement it was "legitimate" to ask whether Biden's debate disaster was indicative of a deeper problem rather than a one-off.</p>

<p>Biden has not given a live interview or held a press conference since the debacle, meaning he has not had to give unscripted comments under pressure again.</p>

<p>ABC News announced that he would be interviewed by the network on Friday, with the first clips released that day.</p>

<p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Tuesday admitted the debate was "a bad night" for the president but added that Biden "knows how to come back" from adversity.</p>

<p>"We understand. We're not taking away from what you all saw," she told reporters. "I think the president's work record certainly speaks for itself."</p>

<p>She dismissed questions about Biden needing a cognitive test, and said the president would speak to high-ranking Democrats, before holding a press conference during a NATO summit in Washington next week.</p>

<p>- 'Horrified' -</p>

<p>The polling margins between the president and his Republican predecessor have been razor-thin and almost static for months, with Trump showing a slight advantage in the all-important swing states.</p>

<p>Biden pushed for an unusually early first debate in hopes that he could jolt the race while there was still time to build on any momentum gained -- but the plan backfired.</p>

<p>Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse told WPRI-TV he was "pretty horrified" by the president's performance during the 90-minute CNN match-up, watched by more than 50 million Americans.</p>

<p>Jared Golden, a vulnerable Democrat in conservative-leaning House district, raised eyebrows with an op-ed in his local paper in Maine in which he said Biden's poor showing "was not a surprise."</p>

<p>"It also didn't rattle me as it has others, because the outcome of this election has been clear to me for months: While I don't plan to vote for him, Donald Trump is going to win. And I'm OK with that," he said, explaining he believed US democracy would endure.</p>

<p>The White House has always shrugged off concern about Biden's mental acuity, sometimes with marked irritation.</p>

<p>His campaign -- under pressure over its tactics -- hit out at "self-important podcasters" in a memo widely seen as a swipe at a group of former Barack Obama staffers and slammed demands from "the bedwetting brigade" for Biden drop out.</p>

<p>But Vermont Senator Peter Welch, a Democrat, told news website Semafor on Tuesday that Biden's team had "a dismissive attitude towards people who are raising questions for discussion."</p>

<p><strong>- Slowed down -</strong></p>

<p>Biden has visibly slowed over the last year.</p>

<p>It has been several months since the president, who has fallen in public on several occasions, stopped using his plane's high gangway, preferring a shorter, more stable staircase.</p>

<p>He has also surrounded himself with aides for the short walk from the White House to his helicopter on the lawn, preventing cameras from focusing on his stiff gait.</p>

<p>Biden, who has always been gaffe-prone, has not given a long press conference since January 2022 and spends almost every weekend in one of his Delaware homes, with no official schedule.</p>

<p>When he recently visited France to commemorate the 1944 Allied landings, he went straight from the airport to his hotel, where he remained for an entire day, with no public appearances.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

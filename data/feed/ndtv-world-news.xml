       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Las Vegas woman has reunited with her pet chihuahua, Gizmo, who went missing nine years ago. The surprise came in the form of an email, sending Judith Monarrez to her knees in tears.</p>

<p>In 2015, a faulty gate in the backyard of her family's Las Vegas home allowed Gizmo, then just 2 years old, to slip away.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Monarrez launched a desperate search, posting fliers and reaching out to Facebook groups, but her efforts went in vain. For nine long years, Ms Monarrez held onto hope, never giving up on the chance of being reunited with Gizmo.</p>

<p>Now 37, Ms Monarrez has moved into her own home, earned a master's degree, and started a teaching career. Yet, the memory of Gizmo remained close to her heart. Her persistence paid off when a woman found Gizmo and brought him to an animal hospital, where his microchip was scanned, triggering the notification that changed everything.</p>

<p>Despite his changed appearance and behaviour, Ms Monarrez knew instantly it was Gizmo when they reunited at the vet's office. "I can't forget those yellow-amber eyes. I can't forget them, ever - they're Gizmo," Ms Monarrez told <a href="https://www.ktnv.com/news/i-knew-immediately-it-was-him-las-vegas-family-finally-reunites-with-dog-they-lost-9-years-ago">KTNV</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Judith Monarrez called the emotional reunion "a miracle". She credited Gizmo's microchip for their reunion, saying, "Hindsight is 2020. I'm so glad I registered his microchip."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gizmo's return has brought mixed emotions, as he has developed fears and health issues during their time apart.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was in an alarming condition, with severe matting, loss of teeth, dental diseases and a debilitating eye infection. "He was severely matted. They had to shave him down," Ms Monarrez told the outlet. "He's missing a lot of teeth. They told us that he had teeth falling out of his mouth when they dropped him off."</p>

<p>Now, Monarrez and her family are focused on addressing Gizmo's health issues and are dedicated to "showering him with all the love that we were holding onto for all those years."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The family has set up a <a href="http://https://www.gofundme.com/f/4knns-help-gizmo-back-to-health?member=35856327&amp;sharetype=teams&amp;utm_campaign=natman_sharesheet_dash&amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;utm_source=copy_link">GoFundMe</a> page to help cover the substantial medical bills, estimated to exceed $4,000 for initial visits alone.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Vanessa Sagnay de la Bastida, daughter of an Ecuadorian politician, was tragically killed by a speeding Mercedes while crossing a road near Wandsworth Bridge in west London.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A court has heard that Vanessa Sagnay de la Bastida, the daughter of an Ecuadorian politician, was cruelly killed in front of her fiance, Michael Williams, by a speeding Mercedes. The 28-year-old was crossing a road close to Wandsworth Bridge in west London when the event happened, according to <em>The Metro.</em></p>

<p>This incident happened while Vanessa was crossing the road near Wandsworth Bridge in west London.</p>

<p>The news reports mentioned that the driver of the speeding Mercedes, 39-year-old Octavian Cadar, was speeding at more than twice the legal limit at the time of the collision.</p>

<p>The impact caused Ms. Sagnay, also known as Charlotte, to somersault through the air before landing on a railing. Despite efforts by an off-duty doctor, she died 13 minutes later at the scene from a severe head injury, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/07/29/ecuadarian-politicians-daughter-killed-speeding-driver-london-21320904/"><em>The Metro.</em></a></p>

<p>Cadar, of Bexley, south-east London, has already admitted causing death by careless driving but denied the more serious charge of causing death by dangerous driving. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/07/29/ecuadarian-politicians-daughter-killed-speeding-driver-london-21320904/"><em>The Metro</em>,</a> Cadar had just finished at a nearby McDonald's drive-through and was on his way to see his girlfriend in Fulham when the crash took place. The accident happened at around 10:06 pm on March 16, 2022.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Amanda Hilton said: "As they came to traffic lights, Mr Williams pressed the button and looked to the right and the road was clear. They started crossing towards the central reservation."</p>

<p>"As they were crossing, Octavian Cadar drove his Mercedes after the roundabout at speed. They heard the car coming. Mr Williams ran on the journey they were taking. Charlotte ran back to the pavement they had just left and the Mercedes struck her."</p>

<p>"Mr Williams, who witnessed the collision, told police Charlotte was hit on the lefthand side by the bonnet of the car and he watched as Charlotte was thrown forward on to a railing. He heard her scream and then he saw her land on the ground."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Grilled eel, or unagi, a popular summer delicacy in Japan, is behind a department store food poisoning incident that has left more than 140 people sick and one dead, the store's president said.</p>

<p>Shinji Kaneko of Keikyu Department Store in Yokohama - about an hour from Tokyo - apologised after the customers, who last week bought lunch boxes containing eel, suffered vomiting and diarrhoea. One of the customers - reportedly a woman in her 90s - died, Shinji Kaneko told reporters on Monday (Jul 29), bowing deeply and offering "our most sincere condolences".</p>

<p>The products included eel cooked in the traditional "kabayaki" style: Skewered, grilled and basted in a sweet, sticky mixture of soy sauce and mirin rice wine.</p>

<p>Consumed worldwide, eel is particularly popular in Asia, and remains found in Japanese tombs show it has been eaten on the archipelago for thousands of years.</p>

<p>A probe by health officials detected a type of bacteria called staphylococcus aureus in the products, Keikyu Department Store said.</p>

<p>"We take what happened very seriously and feel deeply sorry about it. We will fully cooperate with investigations by public health authorities," Kaneko said.</p>

<p>Tokyo-based restaurant Isesada, which operates a stand inside the Keikyu department store, was responsible for cooking and directly selling the eel products.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan appearing to slap a child on stage during a ceremony in Rize province has sparked a debate on social media.</p>

<p>The incident occurred on July 27 at the opening of the Aider Plateau Protection and Renewal Project, a province-wide urban transformation and disaster housing initiative.</p>

<p>The footage, now viral on X, shows Mr Erdogan extending his hand for a traditional kiss of respect from two boys brought on stage. However, one of the boys hesitated, which led to Mr Erdogan 'slapping' the child's face.</p>

<p>The boy then kissed Mr Erdogan's hand, and the president handed both children some money as a gift.</p>

<p>The two kids then hugged the Turkish President.</p>

<p>Although the gesture was not violent and many interpreted it as playful, the video sparked discussion on the internet.</p>

<p>Some users criticised him, with one saying, "I wonder how he treats people behind closed doors if he can do that in front of the camera."&nbsp;</p>

<p>This wasn't the first instance the Turkish president was seen misbehaving with children. Previously, during a visit to his family's neighbours in Rize, Mr Erdogan slapped a child who requested an autograph on a Turkish national team T-shirt.</p>

<p>In 2021, at the opening of the Salarkha Tunnel in Rize, Mr Erdogan was seen knocking on a boy's head.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Again, last year, the president publicly slapped his grandson, but later claimed he was merely "stroking" him, according to reports.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Meta's director of public affairs, Dani Lever, clarified the mistake and apologized, stating that fact-checkers had confirmed the original image's accuracy.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook has acknowledged that it mistakenly identified a widely shared image of Donald Trump as "altered." Facebook's algorithms detected the image, which depicts Trump raising his fist in the air following an assassination attempt, and labelled it as possibly deceptive. Platform X users claimed that the photo had been marked as altered on their accounts. Facebook responded by saying that unbiased fact-checkers had examined an identical image and discovered it to be false.</p>

<p>Dani Lever, the director of public affairs at Meta, explained on X that the labelling was incorrect. The Facebook's internal technical system was intended to detect a different version of the image, not the iconic photo of Trump. Facebook expressed regret for the mistake and any misunderstanding it may have created.</p>

<p>"This was an error. This fact check was initially applied to a doctored photo showing the secret service agents smiling, and in some cases our systems incorrectly applied that fact check to the real photo. This has been fixed, and we apologize for the mistake," Lever wrote.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The altered image Lever referenced featured the Secret Service members surrounding Trump smiling. Many media outlets previously fact-checked the images as "altered," though it confirmed the accuracy of the original image.</p>

<p>None of the agents in the original image are smiling as they surround Trump, who has blood on his face and his right arm in the air. The image - which was captured by <em>Associated Press </em>photographer Evan Vucci and distributed by the <em>AP </em>- appeared with coverage of the shooting by many legitimate news outlets.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday vowed a "severe" response to a deadly strike that killed 12 youths in the annexed Golan Heights, as diplomats raced to contain escalation between Israel and Hezbollah.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/netanyahu-visits-golan-rocket-fire-site-vows-severe-response-6217462" target="_blank">vowed a "severe" response</a> to a deadly strike that killed 12 youths in the annexed Golan Heights, as diplomats raced to contain escalation between Israel and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>On a visit to the site of the deadly rocket strike in the town of Majdal Shams, Netanyahu said: "The State of Israel will not, and cannot, let this pass. Our response will come and it will be severe."</p>

<p>He was greeted by protests during the visit, which came after mourners gathered in the Druze Arab town to bury the last victim, 11-year-old Guevara Ibrahim.</p>

<p>Israel and the United States have blamed the strike on Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement, which has traded near-daily fire with Israeli forces since the war in Gaza between Hamas operatives and Israel began in early October.</p>

<p>Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib said a flurry of diplomatic activity has sought to contain the anticipated Israeli response.</p>

<p>"Israel will escalate in a limited way and Hezbollah will respond in a limited way... These are the assurances we've received," Bou Habib said in an interview with local broadcaster Al-Jadeed.</p>

<p>Several analysts told AFP that this was likely to be the case, with Israel wary of having to fight wars on two fronts.</p>

<p>The United States, France and others were trying to contain the escalation, Habib added, while Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said that "talks are ongoing with international, European and Arab sides to protect Lebanon and ward off dangers".</p>

<p>On Monday, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said he was "confident" a broader war could be avoided.</p>

<p>New Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, whose country supports Hezbollah and Hamas, warned Israel against attacking Lebanon, which he said would be "a great mistake with heavy consequences".</p>

<p>Pezeshkian spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday, with the Elysee Palace saying Macron told his counterpart "all must be done to avoid a military escalation" and urged Tehran to "cease its support for destabilising actors".</p>

<p>Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the Majdal Shams rocket attack, though the group claimed multiple strikes on Israeli military positions that day.</p>

<p>Israel said Hezbollah fired a Falaq-1 Iranian rocket. This type of projectile is unguided and an analyst called them inaccurate weapons.</p>

<h3><strong>Travel warning</strong></h3>

<p>Hezbollah has evacuated some positions in south and east Lebanon, a source close to the group told AFP.</p>

<p>Some airlines, including Air France and Lufthansa, have suspended flights to and from Lebanon, with one Syrian-German traveller at Beirut airport telling AFP she was trying to find a new flight, "but they're all either packed or cancelled".</p>

<p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, meanwhile, said on social media platform X that his government was "advising British nationals to leave Lebanon and not to travel to the country. This is a fast-moving situation."</p>

<p>On Monday, Hezbollah said it had launched "dozens of Katyusha rockets" at an Israeli military site following the killing of two of its fighters.</p>

<p>The group later claimed additional strikes against military positions in Israel's north. Official Lebanese media said a Syrian national died from wounds after an Israeli drone strike in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>The cross-border violence has already killed more than 500 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters, and dozens of civilians and soldiers on the Israeli side.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has said its attacks are in support of Hamas, and that they would stop if a ceasefire was reached in Gaza, where war broke out on October 7 when the Palestinian operatives attacked southern Israel.</p>

<p>Months of effort have failed to secure a ceasefire and hostage release deal, though mediators and Israeli negotiators met on Sunday in Rome to discuss the latest proposal.</p>

<p>"The negotiations on the main issues will continue in the coming days," an Israeli statement said.</p>

<p>Hamas, however, again accused Netanyahu of hindering a deal, saying in a statement that he had set new conditions in "a retreat" from an earlier draft.</p>

<p>The Hamas attack on southern Israel that started the war resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Operatives also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,363 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, which does not provide details on civilian and operatives deaths.</p>

<p>Hundreds of Gazans were fleeing the vicinity of the Al-Bureij refugee camp on Monday, witnesses said, after Israeli forces announced they would "operate forcefully" against fighters in the area.</p>

<h3><strong>Soldiers detained&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Since the war began, rights activists, UN agencies and others have alleged abuses of Palestinians during Israeli detention.</p>

<p>On Monday, Israel's military said nine soldiers were being held for questioning in a case of suspected abuse of a detainee at a facility known to be holding Palestinians arrested from Gaza.</p>

<p>After the soldiers' detention, Israeli civilians protested outside a military base where the nine were being held, while several others -- also in an attempt to show support -- broke into the facility where the alleged abuse occurred.</p>

<p>"Take your hands off the reservists," Itamar Ben Gvir, Israel's far-right National Security Minister, wrote on X.</p>

<p>Other top Israeli officials, however, including Netanyahu and army chief Lieutenant-General Herzi Halevi, condemned the mob action.</p>

<p>"We are in the midst of a war, and actions of this type endanger the security of the state," Halevi said of the unrest.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple relied on chips designed by Google rather than industry leader Nvidia to build two key components of its artificial intelligence software infrastructure for its forthcoming suite of AI tools and features, an Apple research paper published on Monday showed.<br />
Apple's decision to rely on Google's cloud infrastructure is notable because Nvidia produces the most sought-after AI processors.</p>

<p>Including the chips made by Google, Amazon.com and other cloud computing companies, Nvidia commands roughly 80% of the market.</p>

<p>In the research paper, Apple did not explicitly say that it used no Nvidia chips, but its description of the hardware and software infrastructure of its AI tools and features lacked any mention of Nvidia hardware.</p>

<p>Apple did not comment on Monday.</p>

<p>The iPhone maker said that to train its AI models, it used two flavors of Google's tensor processing unit (TPU) that are organized in large clusters of chips.</p>

<p>To build the AI model that will operate on iPhones and other devices, Apple used 2,048 of the TPUv5p chips. For its server AI model, Apple deployed 8,192 TPUv4 processors.</p>

<p>Nvidia does not design TPUs but rather focuses its efforts on so-called graphics processing units (GPUs) that are widely used for AI efforts.</p>

<p>Unlike Nvidia, which sells its chips and systems as standalone products, Google sells access to TPUs through its Google Cloud Platform. Customers interested in buying access must build software through Google's cloud platform in order to use the chips.</p>

<p>Apple is rolling out portions Apple Intelligence to its beta users this week.</p>

<p>Reuters reported the use of the TPU chips in June, but Apple did not disclose the full extent of its reliance on Google hardware until Monday's research paper.</p>

<p>Google did not return a request for comment, while Nvidia declined to comment.</p>

<p>Apple's engineers said in the paper it would be possible to make even larger, more sophisticated models with Google's chips, than the two models it discussed in the paper.</p>

<p>Apple unveiled a slew of new AI features at its June developer conference, including integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT technology into its software.</p>

<p>The Cupertino, California-based company's stock ticked down 0.1% to $218.24 in regular trading on Monday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least one person died Monday in Venezuela as security forces tried to break up protests triggered by a hotly disputed election result that gave Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro a third term in power, an NGO said.</p>

<p>Venezuelan security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets Monday at irate protesters challenging the reelection victory claimed by Maduro but disputed by the opposition and questioned by many other countries.</p>

<p>Thousands of people flooded the streets of several neighbourhoods of the capital, chanting "Freedom, freedom!" and "This government is going to fall!"</p>

<p>Some ripped Maduro campaign posters from street posts and burned them.</p>

<p>Around the country, at least two statues of Hugo Chavez, the late socialist icon who led the country for more than a decade and handpicked Maduro as his successor, were knocked down by protesters.</p>

<p>At least one person died in northwest Yaracuy state and 46 more were arrested in post-election demonstrations, Alfredo Romero, head of a rights group called Foro Penal, which specializes in political prisoner issues, said on the platform X.</p>

<p>In Caracas, AFP observed members of the National Guard firing tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters, some wearing motorbike helmets and bandannas tied over their faces for protection. Some responded by throwing rocks back.</p>

<p>Protests were reported even in very poor areas of Caracas that had been bastions of support for Maduro and his socialist government. Shots were heard in some areas. Protests broke out elsewhere in Venezuela, too.</p>

<p>"We want freedom. We want Maduro to go. Maduro, leave!," Marina Sugey, a 42-year-old resident of a poor area of Caracas called Petare, told AFP.</p>

<p>Maduro, 61, attended a meeting Monday at which the National Electoral Council (CNE) certified his reelection to a third six-year term until 2031.</p>

<p>He dismissed international criticism and doubts about the result of Sunday's voting, claiming Venezuela was the target of an attempted "coup d'etat" of a "fascist and counter-revolutionary" nature.</p>

<p>But opposition leader Maria Corina Machado later told reporters that a review of voting records available so far clearly showed that the next president "will be Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia," who took her place on the ballot after she was barred by Maduro-aligned courts.</p>

<p>The records showed a "mathematically irreversible" lead for Gonzalez Urrutia, she said, with 6.27 million votes to only 2.75 million for Maduro.</p>

<p>The elections were held amid widespread fears of fraud by the government and a campaign tainted by accusations of political intimidation.</p>

<p>Pollsters had predicted a resounding victory for the opposition.</p>

<p>In the early hours of Monday, the CNE said Maduro had won 51.2 per cent of votes cast compared to 44.2 per cent for Gonzalez Urrutia.</p>

<p>The opposition cried foul, prompting Attorney General Tarek William Saab to link Machado to an alleged cyber "attack" seeking to "adulterate" the results.</p>

<h3><strong>'Another fraud'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The outcome sparked concern and calls for a "transparent" process from the United Nations, the United States, the European Union and several countries in Latin America.</p>

<p>The CNE has not provided a detailed breakdown of the result.</p>

<p>Allies including China, Russia and Cuba congratulated Maduro.</p>

<p>Gonzalez Urrutia, a 74-year-old former diplomat, on Monday acknowledged the deep discontent in society with the CNE results and vowed that "we will fight for our liberty."</p>

<p>Machado assured Venezuelans that "the leaders of the world" are validating the results, and called families to turn out Tuesday for "popular assemblies" nationwide to show support for a peaceful transition of power.</p>

<p>Nine Latin American countries called in a joint statement Monday for a "complete review of the results with the presence of independent electoral observers."</p>

<p>The US-based Carter Center, one of a few organizations allowed to bring observers into Venezuela, urged the CNE to immediately publish detailed polling station-level results.</p>

<p>Brazil and Colombia also urged a review of the numbers while Chile's president said the outcome was "hard to believe."</p>

<p>Peru recalled its ambassador and Panama said it was suspending relations with Venezuela.</p>

<p>The Organization of American States, based in Washington, called an emergency meeting for Wednesday at the request of Argentina and other countries that challenged the official election tally.</p>

<p>Caracas hit back Monday, saying it was withdrawing diplomatic staff from Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Panama, Peru, the Dominican Republic and Uruguay for "interventionist actions and statements." It also suspended flights to and from Panama and the Dominican Republic.</p>

<h3><strong>'Bloodbath' warning&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Independent polls had predicted Sunday's vote would end 25 years of "Chavismo," the populist movement founded by Chavez.</p>

<p>Maduro has been at the helm of the once-wealthy oil-rich country since 2013. The last decade has seen GDP drop by 80 per cent, pushing more than seven million of its 30 million citizens to emigrate.</p>

<p>He is accused of locking up critics and harassing the opposition in a climate of rising authoritarianism.</p>

<p>In the run-up to the election, he had warned of a "bloodbath" if he lost.</p>

<p>Ballots were cast on machines that sent electronic votes directly to a centralized CNE database.</p>

<p>The machines printed out paper receipts that were placed in a container and counted by hand as a backup measure meant to be open to public scrutiny.</p>

<p>The opposition had deployed about 90,000 volunteer election monitors nationwide.</p>

<h3><strong>Economic misery&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Sunday's election was the product of a deal reached last year between the government and the opposition.</p>

<p>That agreement led the United States to temporarily ease sanctions imposed after Maduro's 2018 reelection, rejected as a sham by dozens of Latin American and other countries.</p>

<p>Sanctions were snapped back after Maduro reneged on agreed conditions.</p>

<p>Venezuela boasts the world's largest oil reserves but has seen severely diminished production capacity in recent years.</p>

<p>Most Venezuelans live on just a few dollars a month and endure biting shortages of electricity and fuel.</p>

<p>Economic misery in the South American nation has been a major source of migration pressure on the southern border of the United States, where immigration is a major presidential election issue.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta Platforms on Monday said it will roll out a new tool called AI Studio that will allow users to create, share and design personalized AI chatbots.<br />
<br />
The AI Studio will allow users to create customized AI characters and also allow Instagram creators to use the AI characters "as an extension of themselves" that can handle common DM questions and story replies, Meta said.</p>

<p>Users can share their AI characters on the social media giant's various platforms.</p>

<p>The new tool is built with Meta's Llama 3.1, the biggest version of its mostly free artificial intelligence models released last week, which is available in multiple languages and has performance metrics that compete with paid models from rivals like OpenAI.</p>

<p>ChatGPT maker OpenAI is working on a project code-named "Strawberry," the details of which are tightly kept secret even within OpenAI, as the startup races to show that the types of models it offers are capable of delivering advanced reasoning capabilities, Reuters exclusively reported earlier in July.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Veterinarians using a stethoscope were unable to detect Nuggi's heartbeat because of his extreme weight, according to the SPCA statement.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman from New Zealand was sentenced to two months in prison after her dog, who weighed 53 kilograms (118 pounds) and was severely obese, died, as per a report in <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newsweek.com/dog-owner-jailed-obese-dog-dies-1930819">Newsweek</a></em>. According to a statement from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), the dog, named Nuggi, was found by police in 2021 weighing about 54 kilograms (120 pounds) and nearly immobile.</p>

<p>Nuggi was taken from his owner's Auckland house, where police discovered "a number of" dogs, and given over to the SPCA.</p>

<p>Nuggi died of a liver haemorrhage even though it lost 8.8 kilograms (19.6 pounds) or around 16.5 per cent of his body weight in two months while in the care of the SPCA. The organisation claims that an autopsy disclosed additional health issues, including Cushing's illness and liver problems.</p>

<p>According to the statement, the owner pleaded guilty to failing to provide for the dog's medical, behavioural, and physical needs. As a result, the Manukau District Court in Auckland sentenced the owner to two months in jail and a fine of $1,222 NZD ($720). It is also said that she will not be allowed to own dogs for a year.</p>

<p>Veterinarians using a stethoscope were unable to detect Nuggi's heartbeat because of his extreme weight, according to the SPCA statement. The dog also had a lot of skin growths, especially on contact regions like his elbows and tummy, and his claws were enlarged. Further, Nuggi had conjunctivitis as well.</p>

<p>Todd Westwood, SPCA Chief said that the dog was "drastically overfed" and "clearly" did not have proper care. "Nuggi was one of the most obese animals we've ever come across," Mr Westwood said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Sadly, we see animals on a daily basis that are underweight, starved or malnourished, but it's equally heartbreaking to see a helpless animal that's been severely overfed," he continued.</p>

<p>The SPCA added that the pet dog was fed around 10 pieces of chicken every day along with dry food. Nuggi allegedly struggled to travel around 10 meters to the car when veterinarians took him away from his owner, pausing three times to gather breath. The SPCA said, "His legs could not support his huge body."</p>

<p>"Part of being a responsible dog owner is providing your pet with an appropriate diet and daily exercise, which was clearly not the case here. Nuggi was being drastically overfed, and instead of seeking help or amending the behaviour, his owner continued to overfeed him until he could barely walk. This is unacceptable," Mr Westwood added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Burrill was forced to resign from his position after the Christian news website published a story exposing his visits to gay bars and use of the dating app.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Wisconsin priest who lost his job after being outed for using Grindr is suing the queer dating app, alleging that his data was sold without his knowledge or consent.</p>

<p>Monsignor Jeffrey Burrill, who served as the top administrator of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) until his resignation in 2021, claims that Grindr failed to inform him that his data was being sold to vendors, thereby allowing people outside the app to discover his presence on it.</p>

<p>Burrill's lawsuit, obtained by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/27/priest-grindr-privacy-lawsuit/"><em>Washington Post</em></a>, states that the release of his data caused "significant damage" to his reputation, particularly given his vow of celibacy as a priest and the Catholic Church's long-standing stance against homosexual acts.</p>

<p>Burrill was forced to resign from his position after the Christian news website "The Pillar" published a story exposing his visits to gay bars and use of the dating app, reporting that it had tracked and verified his behaviour using online data.</p>

<p>In his lawsuit, Burrill alleges that The Pillar obtained the data from Catholic Laity and Clergy for Renewal (CLCR), a Christian non-profit organization that purchased data from queer dating apps to identify Church leaders using them in violation of their vows, implying that Grindr had sold the data to the organization.</p>

<p>“We want answers so we can use that as a warning to other Grindr users,” said Gregory Helmer, an attorney for Burrill.</p>

<p>The priest said he'd never have joined the app had he known his data would be available to the public, according to the lawsuit.</p>

<p>“To have that decision forced out of your hands and into the public realm is reprehensible,” James Carr, another attorney representing Burrill, told the Washington Post.</p>

<p>Burrill, who is still "getting on his feet" following the "shame and embarrassment" of his outing, according to his lawyer Helmer, requested $5 million in damages from Grindr in June.</p>

<p>After Grindr declined his request, Burrill filed a lawsuit on July 18, seeking damages and the implementation of policies to prevent user data from being publicly available without users' knowledge.</p>

<p>Grindr told the Washington Post it would "respond vigorously to these allegations, which are based on mischaracterizations of practices relating to user data," and previously denied making user data publicly available.</p>

<p>CLCR admitted to obtaining data from Grindr in the past to expose clergy members but claimed it did not provide any data to The Pillar.</p>

<p>Burrill's ousting sparked widespread criticism, with many condemning The Pillar's use of data as dangerously homophobic.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro claimed victory in the country's presidential election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro claimed victory in the country's presidential election in the early hours of Monday morning, even as the country's opposition said its candidate Edmundo Gonzalez was the victor and it had the polling to prove it.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE COUNT?</strong></h3>

<p>The country's electoral authority (CNE) said just after midnight on Monday that Maduro had won a third six-year term with 51% of the vote.</p>

<p>The authority said Gonzalez won 44%, but opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said opposition candidate Gonzalez had secured 70% of the vote and that multiple independent exit polls and quick counts decisively showed his victory.</p>

<p>Gonzalez said he was not calling for supporters to take to the streets or commit any acts of violence and Machado said the opposition has copies of about 40% of voting records.</p>

<p>Edison Research, known for its polling of U.S. elections, had predicted in an exit poll that Gonzalez would win 65% of the vote, while Maduro would win 31%.</p>

<p>Local firm Meganalisis predicted a 65% vote for Gonzalez and just under 14% for Maduro.</p>

<h3><strong>WAS VOTING PEACEFUL?</strong></h3>

<p>The government said that except for some isolated minor incidents, voting was peaceful.</p>

<p>Motorcycle-riding ruling party supporters known as 'collectives' clashed briefly in the evening with opposition supporters outside the country's largest polling place, a school in central Caracas.</p>

<p>Armed collectives were reported in at least six other locations, according to a local NGO, which also reported the gun death of one man in the border state of Tachira during a confrontation with collective members.</p>

<p>The tense campaign was marked by arrests of opposition figures and other moves by the authorities that the opposition said were meant to prevent a fair election.</p>

<p>Maduro, a former bus driver who was the hand-picked successor of his mentor Hugo Chavez, has been in power since Chavez's death in 2013.</p>

<p>His government has presided over a sharp economic and social deterioration. The U.S. reimposed oil sanctions in April, accusing Maduro of reneging on deals reached with the opposition to ensure free elections.</p>

<h3><strong>WHO IS GONZALEZ?</strong></h3>

<p>A long-time but low-profile member of the opposition, Gonzalez, 74, a former diplomat, is known for his calm demeanor.</p>

<p>He was originally registered as a placeholder in March, after neither primary winner Machado nor her alternate were able to register. In April, he was named as the opposition's definitive candidate.</p>

<p>Machado, 56, has thrown herself into campaigning for Gonzalez.</p>

<p>The two - speaking to large crowds around the country - have employed emotional rhetoric, including about their hope for the many who have emigrated from Venezuela in recent years to return home.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT WAS THE INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE?</strong></h3>

<p>The United States has serious concerns that the results announced by the electoral authority do not reflect the votes of the people, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday, asking that a detailed tabulation of votes be published.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, reactions from Latin American leaders were mixed.</p>

<p>Argentine President Javier Milei called the official result fraud, while Costa Rica and Peru rejected it and Chile said it would not accept any result that was not verifiable.</p>

<p>Cuba, Honduras and Bolivia cheered Maduro's victory.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A deadly rocket strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights has added to concerns that Israel and the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah could be sucked into a full-scale war - something they have both previously indicated they want to avoid but for which they have also said they are ready.</p>

<p>Israel said on Sunday it would strike hard at Hezbollah after accusing the group of killing 12 children and teenagers in a rocket attack on a football field in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Hezbollah denied any responsibility for the attack on Majdal Shams, the deadliest in Israel or Israeli-annexed territory since Hamas' Oct. 7 assault sparked the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>This is the background to hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah:</p>

<p><strong>Why Are They Fighting?</strong></p>

<p>Hezbollah began trading fire with Israel on Oct. 8, a day after the Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked communities in southern Israel and sparked the Gaza war.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, a Hamas ally, says its attacks aim to support Palestinians who are under Israeli bombardment in Gaza.</p>

<p>The Gaza war has drawn in Iran-backed militants across the region. Hezbollah is widely deemed the most powerful member of the Iran-backed network, known as the Axis of Resistance.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has said repeatedly it will not halt its attacks on Israel unless a ceasefire in Gaza comes into force.</p>

<p>While linked to Gaza, the conflict has its own dynamics.</p>

<p>Israel and Hezbollah have fought numerous wars.</p>

<p>The last was in 2006.</p>

<p>Israel has long viewed Hezbollah as the biggest threat at its borders and has been deeply alarmed by its growing arsenal, and the foothold it has established in Syria.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's ideology is largely defined by conflict with Israel. It was founded by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in 1982 to fight Israeli forces that had invaded Lebanon that year, and waged years of guerrilla war that led Israel to withdraw from south Lebanon in 2000.</p>

<p>Hezbollah deems Israel an illegitimate state established on occupied Palestinian lands and wants to see it gone.</p>

<p><strong>What's The Impact So Far?</strong></p>

<p>The current conflict has already taken a toll on both sides.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes on both sides of the border. Israeli airstrikes have pounded areas where Hezbollah operates in southern Lebanon and struck the Bekaa Valley near the Syrian border.</p>

<p>Israel has also occasionally hit elsewhere, notably killing a senior Hamas commander in Beirut on Jan. 2.</p>

<p>Israeli strikes have killed some 350 Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon and more than 100 civilians, including medics, children and journalists, according to security and medical sources and a Reuters tally of death notifications issued by Hezbollah.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said after Saturday's attack the death toll among civilians killed in Hezbollah attacks had risen to 23 since October, along with at least 17 soldiers. Hezbollah denied it was responsible for Saturday's attack.</p>

<p>In Israel, the displacement of so many Israelis is a big political issue. Officials had hoped they would be able to go home for the school year beginning Sept. 1 but that has looked increasingly unlikely as the standoff has continued.</p>

<p><strong>How Much Worse Could It Get?</strong></p>

<p>A lot. Despite the ferocity of these hostilities, this is still seen as a relatively contained confrontation.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned in December that Beirut would be turned "into Gaza" if Hezbollah started an all-out war.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has previously signalled it is not seeking to widen the conflict while also saying it is ready to fight any war imposed on it and warning that it has used only a small part of its capabilities so far.</p>

<p>Any move by Israel to expand the conflict would be met by "devastation, destruction and displacement" in Israel, Hezbollah deputy leader Sheikh Naim Qassem said in an interview with Al Jazeera in June.</p>

<p>Past wars have inflicted heavy damage.</p>

<p>In 2006, Israeli strikes levelled large areas of Beirut's Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs, knocked out Beirut airport, and hit roads, bridges and other infrastructure. Nearly 1 million people in Lebanon fled their homes.</p>

<p>In Israel, the impact included 300,000 people fleeing their homes to escape Hezbollah rockets and some 2,000 homes destroyed.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has a far bigger arsenal than in 2006, including rockets it says can hit all parts of Israel.</p>

<p>It has demonstrated advances in its weaponry since October, shooting down Israeli drones, launching its own explosive drones into Israel, and firing more sophisticated guided missiles.</p>

<p>Israeli troops have invaded Lebanon several times in the past, reaching as far as Beirut in the 1982 invasion that aimed to crush Lebanon-based Palestinian guerrillas.</p>

<p><strong>Is Escalation Avoidable?</strong></p>

<p>Much will depend on what happens in Gaza, where efforts to agree a ceasefire and a return of Israeli hostages have faltered. A ceasefire there could help bring about a rapid de-escalation of tensions in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>The United States, which deems Hezbollah a terrorist group, has been at the heart of diplomatic efforts aimed at easing the conflict.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has signalled its eventual openness to an agreement that benefits Lebanon, but has said there can be no discussions until Israel halts the Gaza offensive.</p>

<p>Israel has also said it would prefer a diplomatic settlement that would restore security in the north, but says it is also prepared for a military offensive to achieve the same goal.</p>

<p>The U.S. official at the heart of diplomatic contacts, Amos Hochstein, brokered an unlikely diplomatic deal between Lebanon and Israel in 2022 over their disputed maritime boundary.</p>

<p>Hochstein said on May 30 he did not expect peace between Hezbollah and Israel but that a set of understandings could remove some of the impetus for conflict and establish a recognised border between Lebanon and Israel.</p>

<p>A French proposal submitted to Beirut in February included elite Hezbollah fighters withdrawing 10 km (6 miles) from the frontier and negotiations aimed at settling disputes over the land border.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Monday backed his running mate, Senator JD Vance, over past comments about "childless cat ladies" that have gone viral and become a political headache for their White House campaign.</p>

<p>Vance's 2021 comments criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris and other Democrats as "a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives" resurfaced after Trump selected the Ohio senator as his running mate earlier this month.</p>

<p>The comments prompted a backlash and warnings from some political strategists that they could cost the Trump campaign valuable votes in a close election that could be decided in a handful of states by a few thousand voters. Harris is the likely Democratic Party presidential nominee for the Nov. 5 election following President Joe Biden's decision to quit the race.</p>

<p>Trump said in an interview on Fox News he did not place a higher value on people with families.</p>

<p>"You know, you don't meet the right person, or you don't meet any person. But you're just as good, in many cases, a lot better than a person that's in a family situation," Trump said.</p>

<p>Harris has two stepchildren with her husband, lawyer Doug Emhoff. Emhoff's ex-wife has called such attacks "baseless" and described Harris as a "loving, nurturing, fiercely protective" co-parent.</p>

<p>Trump said Vance, who had a tough upbringing in Ohio and was largely raised by his grandmother, was simply trying to show how much he values family life.</p>

<p>"He grew up in a very interesting family situation, and he feels family is good. And I don't think there's anything wrong in saying that," Trump said.</p>

<p>In the Fox interview, Trump also did little to clear up questions over whether he will participate in a Sept. 10 debate with Harris. The event had been previously scheduled against Biden.</p>

<p>"I'll probably end up debating," Trump said. "But I can also make a case for not doing it."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump on Monday called the Olympics opening ceremony in Paris a "disgrace," after its creators came under fire for what some said was a show gone too far.</p>

<p>"I'm very open-minded but I thought what they did was a disgrace," Trump told Fox News.</p>

<p>His comments followed condemnation from Catholic groups and French bishops of a ceremony scene involving dancers, drag queens and a DJ in poses that appeared to recall depictions of the Last Supper, although creators have said it was not meant to represent the religious setting.</p>

<p>The sequence drew international criticism from Christian groups and far-right politicians on social media.</p>

<p>When asked by host Laura Ingraham what he would do if he's reelected president in time for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, Trump replied: "We won't be having a 'Last Supper' as portrayed the way they portrayed it last night."</p>

<p>Thomas Jolly, the director of the opening ceremony, later responded to criticism by saying he intended for the production to "reconcile" and "repair."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire X owner Elon&nbsp;Musk&nbsp;was facing&nbsp;criticism&nbsp;Monday for sharing a&nbsp;deepfake&nbsp;video&nbsp;featuring US Vice President&nbsp;Kamala&nbsp;Harris, which tech campaigners said violated the platform's own policies.</p>

<p>Musk&nbsp;reposted a manipulated&nbsp;Harris&nbsp;campaign&nbsp;video&nbsp;in which a voiceover mimicking her calls President Joe Biden senile, and declares that she does not "know the first thing about running the country," adding that as a woman and a person of color, she is the "ultimate diversity hire.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;video&nbsp;was originally posted by an X account linked to the conservative podcaster Chris Kohls and labeled a "parody."</p>

<p>But&nbsp;Musk's repost on Friday made no such disclosure, stating only: "This is amazing," along with a laughing emoji.</p>

<p>Musk's repost garnered more than 130 million views and comes amid growing alarm&nbsp;over&nbsp;AI-enabled political disinformation ahead of the US presidential election in November.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We believe the American people want the real freedom, opportunity, and security Vice President&nbsp;Harris&nbsp;is offering; not the fake, manipulated lies of Elon&nbsp;Musk&nbsp;and Donald Trump,"&nbsp;Harris's presidential campaign said in a statement.</p>

<p>With nearly 192 million followers,&nbsp;Musk&nbsp;is a highly influential voice on the platform, previously called Twitter, which he purchased in 2022 in a $44 billion deal.</p>

<p>Earlier this month,&nbsp;Musk&nbsp;endorsed Trump&nbsp;in a post on X shortly after the Republican narrowly escaped an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California, posted on X that the manipulated&nbsp;Harris&nbsp;video&nbsp;"should be illegal" and that he would soon sign a bill banning such media.</p>

<p>A defiant&nbsp;Musk&nbsp;responded to his post, saying "parody is legal in America," while including the original&nbsp;video&nbsp;below it.</p>

<p>Musk's repost appeared to violate X's policies, which prohibit sharing "synthetic, manipulated or out-of-context media that may deceive or confuse people and lead to harm."</p>

<p>X did not respond to AFP's request for comment.</p>

<p>"Ignoring the rules of the road (because) he bought the road," Nora Benavidez, senior counsel at the watchdog Free Press, wrote on X, referring to&nbsp;Musk's apparent violation of the site's policies.</p>

<p>Disinformation researchers are fearful of rampant misuse of AI technology in a major election year, thanks to proliferating online tools that are cheap and easy to use while lacking sufficient guardrails.</p>

<p>AI-generated content -- particularly audio, which experts say is difficult to identify -- sparked national alarm in January when a fake robocall posing as Biden urged New Hampshire residents not to vote in the state's primary.</p>

<p>"Platforms play an outsized role in election cycles," Benavidez wrote. "They must do better."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Quad foreign ministers have reinforced their call for concerted international action against Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), as well as Al-Qa'ida and the Islamic State outfit.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Warning against terrorists deploying new technologies, the Quad foreign ministers have reinforced their call for concerted international action against Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), as well as Al-Qa'ida and the Islamic State outfit.</p>

<p>After their meeting in Tokyo, the Quad ministers said in a joint statement on Monday that they were committed to working with international and regional partners to forestall "threats posed by the use of new and emerging technologies for terrorist purposes".</p>

<p>"We reiterate the call for concerted action against all UN-listed terrorist groups including Al-Qa'ida, ISIS/Daesh, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), and their proxy groups," External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Foreign Ministers Penny Wong of Australia and Yoko Kamikawa of Japan said in their statement.</p>

<p>"We deplore the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), drones, tunnels, and information and communication technologies by terrorists and terrorist entities," they said.</p>

<p>Recalling the 26/11 Mumbai and the 2016 Pathankot terrorist attacks, they called for "bringing the perpetrators of these attacks to justice without delay".</p>

<p>The ministers said the first meeting of the Quad Working Group on Counter-Terrorism established at the ministerial meeting in New Delhi last year had "fruitful discussions" at its first meeting and at the fourth tabletop exercise in Honolulu in December, and added that they looked forward to next exercise to be hosted by Japan in November.</p>

<p>The tabletop exercises look at scenarios to develop responses to an overwhelming terrorist incident in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<p>The 4,000-word joint statement ran the gamut from the conflicts in Ukraine and Palestine, and China's regional threats to cooperation on undersea cable connectivity and environment.</p>

<p>On Ukraine, where there are differences in nuances between India and the other three Quad partners who are all in on aiding Kiev, the statement said unequivocally, "We reiterate the need for a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in line with international law, consistent with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, including respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity."</p>

<p>India reiterating, this time in this forum, its joint commitment to upholding international law and the UN Charter in Ukraine comes days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Moscow which drew criticism from the West and Ukraine and underlined its independent stand on international relations.</p>

<p>The joint statement did not name Russia.</p>

<p>The ministers' statement made pointed references to the dangers to regional peace and security posed by China, but again, without naming it.</p>

<p>They reiterated their fundamental "steadfast commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, which is inclusive and resilient, and are united in our commitment to upholding the free and open rules-based international order".</p>

<p>They called for upholding "sovereignty and territorial integrity, and peaceful settlement of disputes and prohibition on the threat or use of force in accordance with the UN Charter", while also committing to "the principle of freedom, human rights, rule of law, (and) democratic values".</p>

<p>Regarding foreign manipulation through exploitation of the information infrastructure, the four ministers vowed to "leverage our collective expertise and capacity to respond" to those threats.</p>

<p>They warned of "foreign information manipulation and interference, including disinformation, which undermines trust and sows discord in the international community" which are tactics that are "intended to interfere with domestic and international interest".</p>

<p>The ministers said they would promote human rights while "supporting media freedom, addressing online harassment and abuse, and countering unethical practices".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

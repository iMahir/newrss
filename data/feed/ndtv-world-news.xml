       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>End violence, will meet your demands, said Bangladesh's army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman Monday to protesters, adding that he will form an interim government after prime minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the capital in the face of overwhelming protests.</p>

<p>"We will form an interim government," Waker said in a broadcast to the nation on state television, assuring the protesters that their demands will be met.</p>

<p>"The country has suffered a lot, the economy has been hit, many people have been killed -- it is time to stop the violence," he added.</p>

<p>"I hope after my speech, the situation will improve."</p>

<p>Waker,&nbsp;a career infantry officer who has spent nearly four decades in the military, was appointed to the military's top job as chief of army staff earlier this year.</p>

<p>"If the situation gets better, there is no need for emergency", he said, vowing the new authorities would "prosecute all murders" following weeks of deadly protests.</p>

<p>"Now the task of the students is to keep calm and help us," he said.</p>

<p>Ms Hasina, who has ruled Bangladesh since 2009, had defied weeks of demands for her to stand down but fled following a brutal day of unrest on Sunday in which nearly 100 people died.</p>

<p>Protests broke out over the reintroduction of a quota scheme that reserved more than half of all government jobs for certain groups.</p>

<p>The protests escalated despite the scheme having been scaled back by Bangladesh's top court.</p>

<p>In a hugely symbolic rebuke of Ms Hasina, a former army chief demanded the government "immediately" withdraw troops and allow protests.</p>

<p>The anti-government movement had attracted people from across society in the South Asian nation of about 170 million people, including film stars, musicians and singers.</p>

<p>The 76-year-old prime minister fled the country by helicopter, say reports, shortly after protesters had stormed her palace in Dhaka. Multiple reports say she is headed to an undisclosed location in India.</p>

<p>Bangladesh's Channel 24 broadcast images of crowds running into the compound, waving to the camera as they celebrated.</p>

<p>Others smashed a statues of Hasina's father Sheikh Mujibur Rahma, the country's independence hero.</p>

<p>Ms Hasina and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of Bangladeshi protesters defied curfew and stormed the Prime Minister's palace in capital Dhaka after reports surfaced that Sheikh Hasina has resigned and left the country.</p>

<p>Jubilant looking crowds waved flags on the streets of Dhaka, before hundreds broke through the gates of Sheikh Hasina's official residence.</p>

<p>The crowd also vandalised Ms Hasina's father and former Bangladesh President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman statue in Dhaka.</p>

<p>Soldiers and police with armoured vehicles in Dhaka had barricaded routes to Ms Hasina's office with barbed wire, AFP reporters said, but vast crowds flooded the streets, tearing down barriers.</p>

<p>Local media estimated as many as 400,000 protesters were on the streets but it was impossible to verify the figure.</p>

<p>At least 98 people were killed yesterday, including 14 police officers, in the deadliest day of the unrest. The day's violence took the total number of people killed since protests began in early July to at least 300.</p>

<p>Rallies that began last month against civil service job quotas have escalated into some of the worst unrest of Prime Minister Hasina's 15-year rule and shifted into wider calls for the 76-year-old to step down.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sheikh Hasina once helped rescue Bangladesh from military rule, but her time in power has seen the mass arrest of her political opponents and human rights sanctions against her security forces.</p>

<p>Since July, the autocratic premier has faced mass protests that began as university student-led rallies against civil service job quotas, but which have morphed into some of the worst unrest of her 15-year tenure, with opponents demanding she step down.</p>

<p>The protests were largely peaceful until attacks on demonstrators by police and pro-government student groups, sparking international condemnation.</p>

<p>The 76-year-old won a fifth term as prime minister in January, with the opposition boycotting a vote they said was neither free nor fair.</p>

<p>At the time, Hasina branded the main opposition party a "terrorist organisation".</p>

<p>Critics accuse her government of a litany of rights abuses including the murder of opposition activists.</p>

<p>The daughter of a revolutionary who led Bangladesh to independence, Hasina has presided over breakneck economic growth in a country once written off by US statesman Henry Kissinger as an irredeemable "basket case".</p>

<p>Last year she promised to turn all of Bangladesh into a "prosperous and developed country", but around 18 million young Bangladeshis are out of work, according to government figures.</p>

<p><strong>- Economic rise -</strong></p>

<p>Hasina was 27 and travelling abroad when renegade military officers murdered her father, prime minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, along with her mother and three brothers in a 1975 coup.</p>

<p>She returned after living in exile for six years to take the reins of her father's Awami League party, beginning a decade-long struggle that saw her subjected to lengthy stretches of house arrest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hasina joined forces with Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) to help oust military dictator Hussain Muhammad Ershad in 1990.</p>

<p>But they soon fell out and their ensuing rivalry has since dominated Bangladeshi politics.</p>

<p>Hasina first served a term as prime minister in 1996, but lost to Zia five years later.</p>

<p>The pair were then imprisoned on corruption charges in 2007 after a coup by a military-backed government.</p>

<p>The charges were dropped and they were free to contest an election the following year.</p>

<p>Hasina won in a landslide and has been in power ever since.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old Zia meanwhile is in ailing health and confined to hospital after graft charges saw her sentenced to a 17-year prison term in 2018, with top leaders from her party also behind bars.</p>

<p>Hasina has been praised by supporters for leading Bangladesh through a remarkable economic boom, largely on the back of the mostly female factory workforce powering its garment export industry.</p>

<p>Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries when it gained independence from Pakistan in 1971, has grown an average of more than six percent each year since 2009.</p>

<p>Poverty has plummeted and more than 95 percent of the country's 170 million people now have access to electricity, with per capita income overtaking India in 2021.</p>

<p>Hasina also received international acclaim for opening Bangladesh's doors to hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees fleeing a 2017 military crackdown in neighbouring Myanmar.</p>

<p>And she has been hailed for a decisive crackdown on Islamist militants in the Muslim-majority nation after five homegrown extremists stormed a Dhaka cafe popular with Western expatriates and killed 22 people in 2016.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>- Silencing dissent -</strong></p>

<p>But her government's intolerance towards dissent has given rise to resentment at home and expressions of concern from Washington and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Five top Islamist leaders and a senior opposition figure were executed over the past decade after convictions for crimes against humanity committed during the country's brutal 1971 liberation war.</p>

<p>Instead of healing the wounds of that conflict, the trials triggered mass protests and deadly clashes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her opponents branded them a farce, saying they were a politically motivated exercise to silence dissent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The United States imposed sanctions in 2021 on an elite branch of Bangladesh's security forces and seven of its top officers over charges of widespread human rights abuses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the face of mounting protests, Hasina has insisted she has worked for her nation.</p>

<p>Last month she toured areas of Dhaka damaged during days of deadly unrest, including a metro station that was among several government buildings torched or vandalised.</p>

<p>"Over 15 years, I've built this country," she told reporters, condemning the damage to infrastructure. "What didn't I do for the people?</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>The BBC's India correspondent reported on X (formerly Twitter) the former Prime Minister is heading to Tripura's Agartala, but this has not been confirmed. Earlier today protesters broke into her residence in capital Dhaka, but she had fled by then; news agency ANI said she, and her younger sister, Sheikh Rehana, had left the city for India in a military helicopter.</li>
	<li>Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman told the media the military will form an interim government and has appealed to the protesters to return to the path of peace.</li>
	<li>The protests, which began late last month, escalated dramatically when student activists at Dhaka University, the largest in the country, clashed violently with police and pro-government counter-protesters.</li>
	<li>Shocking visuals of protesters vandalising a statue of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, former president and the tallest leader in the country's history who led its fight for Independence from Pakistan, are playing out on Dhaka's streets.</li>
	<li>The roots of these protests lie in a controversial quota system, which reserves up to 30 per cent of government jobs for family members of veterans from Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence against Pakistan.</li>
	<li>The protesting students have announced a "March To Dhaka" programme today. Over the court of the day houses of political leaders, police stations, and other government installations were attacked, vandalised and torched in 39 districts.</li>
	<li>The demonstrations have grown into a wider anti-government movement across Bangladesh. It has attracted people from all strata of Bangladesh society, including film stars, musicians and singers. Songs calling for people's support have spread widely on social media.</li>
	<li>In response the government declared an indefinite nationwide curfew starting 6 pm Sunday, the first such step during the current wave of protests.</li>
	<li>The protesters earlier dismissed Ms Hasina's invitation for dialogue and consolidated their demands into a unified call for her resignation.</li>
	<li>After the Bangladesh Supreme Court cut the reservations to 5 per cent, student leaders put protests on hold but it flared up because they said the government ignored their call to release all their leaders, making the resignation of PM Hasina their primary demand.</li>

       <description><![CDATA[Sheikh Hasina has resigned as Bangladesh Prime Minister and fled the country amid violent clashes between her party Awami League's supporters and protesters demanding that she quit, news agency Reuters has reported.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sheikh Hasina has resigned as Bangladesh Prime Minister and the Army is moving to take control amid&nbsp;violent protests demanding that she quit.&nbsp;Bangladesh Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman told the media that the Army will form an interim government and has appealed to the protesters to return to the path of peace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There is a crisis in the country. I have met Opposition leaders and we have decided to form an interim government to run this country. I take all responsibility and promise to protect your life and property. Your demands will be fulfilled. Please support us and stop violence. If you work with us, we can move towards a proper solution. We cannot achieve anything through violence," he said.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Hasina, who started her fifth term as Prime Minister earlier this year, left state capital Dhaka in a military helicopter and may be headed to a safer location in India.</p>

<p>The 76-year-old is accompanied by her younger sister, Sheikh Rehana. Protesters demanding her resignation have, meanwhile, stormed Gono Bhaban, the Prime Minister's official residence, local media reports have said. The Bangladesh Army, it appears, is moving to take control and had reportedly given a 45-minute ultimatum to the Prime Minister to step down.</p>

<p>Shocking visuals of protesters vandalising a statue of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Ms Hasina's father and the tallest leader in the country's history who led its fight for Independence from Pakistan, are playing out on Dhaka's streets.</p>

<p><strong>What's Behind The Protests</strong></p>

<p>The protests in Bangladesh, which began last month and escalated swiftly, started as an agitation against a quota system under which 30 per cent of government jobs were reserved for family members of Muktijoddhas -- those who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971. The protesters have said this system favours supporters of the ruling Awami League and want a merit-based system to replace it. As the protests grew, the Awami League dispensation tried to crush it with an iron hand. In the clashes that followed, more than 300 people were killed.</p>

<p>What added to the protesters' anger was a remark by Prime Minister Hasina. "If not the grandchildren of the freedom fighters, then who will get quota benefits? The grandchildren of the 'Razakars'?" she asked. "This is my question. I want to ask the people of the nation. If the protesters don't comply, I can do nothing. They can continue their protest. If protesters damage properties or attack cops, the law will take its course. We can't help."</p>

<p>The Razakar remark touched a raw nerve. A paramilitary force recruited by Pakistan Army during the 1971 liberation war, Razakars carried out mass atrocities, including mass killings, rapes, and torture.</p>

<p>Reservation has been a burning issue in Bangladesh for several years now. In 2018, an agitation on this issue forced the government to water down the reservation system and cancelled quotas for some positions.</p>

<p>The latest unrest was sparked by a high court order that declared illegal the 2018 government circular cancelling 30 per cent quota for freedom fighters' descendants in government jobs.</p>

<p>This order was scrapped by the country's Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ordered that 93 per cent of government jobs must be allocated on the basis of merit and the remaining be reserved for relatives of freedom fighters. But even the top court's order could not pacify the protesters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A remote Australian island close to an Indian Ocean chokepoint for Chinese oil shipments is on a list of possible locations for US military construction aimed at deterring China, with the US saying it "may or may not" support American forces.</p>

<p>Australia's Cocos Islands is listed along with the Philippines, Timor Leste and Papua New Guinea for anticipated construction projects under the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, designed to enhance US force posture and infrastructure to counter China.</p>

<p>The Cocos Islands, with a population of 600, sits 3,000 km west of the Australian mainland and is described by the Australian Defence Force as key to its maritime surveillance operations in the Indian Ocean, where China is increasing submarine activity.</p>

<p>A US Navy construction tender published in June for various base infrastructures in the Indo-Pacific lists Cocos Islands as a possible project location, an indication the US military is also seeking access to the Indian Ocean territory.</p>

<p>"These projects may or may not support the Darwin Marines Rotational Force," a spokesman for NAVFAC Pacific, the US Navy's Pacific Fleet engineering arm, said in an emailed response to Reuters.</p>

<p>Around 2,000 US Marines are hosted in the northern Australian city of Darwin for six months of the year.</p>

<p>There was no immediate response from the Chinese foreign ministry when asked for comment on the US Navy tender list and Cocos Islands as a possible project.</p>

<p>Cocos Islands is closer to the Strait of Malacca, a chokepoint for half of China's oil shipments than the US Navy base of Diego Garcia, a launch pad for US bombers in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, but whose long-term future is under a cloud.</p>

<p>Darshana Baruah, director of security and geopolitics for the Australia India Institute, told a US Congressional hearing last year that Cocos Islands would be "critical geography" for the US to put pressure on China to deter an attack on Taiwan.</p>

<p>"Cocos is much closer to the theatre where Washington anticipates conflict scenarios," she told Reuters.</p>

<p>"The strategic location of Cocos Islands, close to both the Strait of Malacca as well as Australia's northern approaches, gives it immense geostrategic advantages," she added.</p>

<p>Australia has said it will start construction on an expanded airfield on the island this year, to carry heavier military aircraft, including the submarine-hunting P-8A Poseidon.</p>

<p>"There is currently no US investment at Cocos (Keeling) Island," an Australian Defence Force spokesman said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Australia and the US cooperate closely together to advance our force posture cooperation across various locations in Australia," the statement added.</p>

<p>The US military is constructing bomber runways and facilities at two key northern Australian air bases.</p>

<p>The US has said its Diego Garcia air base plays a vital role in regional security, and it was a matter for Britain and Mauritius to work out its future after the United Nations General Assembly voted in 2019 that it should be returned to Mauritius.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French mountaineer Benjamin Vedrines counted every second as he made history's fastest-ever ascent of K2, but says he doesn't add up the growing number of records to his name.</p>

<p>"It's not the records themselves that interest me, it's also the links that I create with certain mountains and especially in the case of K2," the 32-year-old told AFP.</p>

<p>"It fascinated me from the first moment I saw it."</p>

<p>Vedrines scaled the world's second-highest mountain -- standing at 8,611 metres (28,251 feet) on the border of Pakistan and China -- in 10 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds on Sunday, July 28th.</p>

<p>The ascent slashed by more than half the previous record for climbing K2 without bottled oxygen, completed in 23 hours by fellow Frenchman Benoit Chamoux in 1986.</p>

<p>The remarkable feat on the "Savage Mountain" came exactly two years to the day since Vedrines was forced to abort his first attempt as the high altitude starved his brain of oxygen a mere 200 metres from the top.</p>

<p>While his record has made headlines worldwide for its speed, for Vedrines it is remarkable for the opposite reason -- because it was so long in the making.</p>

<p>"I wanted to arrive there really ready, prepared, body, mind," he said. "I pay attention to doing things well, to building them. These are projects that take time."</p>

<h3><strong>'Go slow to go fast'</strong></h3>

<p>Vedrines is considered one of France's pre-eminent climbers and in 2022 set a speed record climbing Pakistan's Broad Peak -- the world's 12th highest mountain -- before descending by paraglider.</p>

<p>Back home in the French Alps, he has also broken a host of records.</p>

<p>He uses the "alpine style" of climbing which relies on minimal use of cumbersome ropes in favour of moving swiftly up the slopes.</p>

<p>But without the aid of oxygen tanks to counteract the thin atmosphere, he faced a paradox on K2 -- needing to move quickly, in one of the world's most unforgiving environments, with minimal effort.</p>

<p>"It requires knowing how to go slowly to go fast," he quips. "It is a little bit of a contradiction that we have to negotiate."</p>

<p>To make matters worse, poor weather on the mountain prevented his attempts to acclimatise.</p>

<p>"I had to face a lot of unforeseen events during this expedition," he said.</p>

<p>"I knew how to persevere. I knew how to be determined, patient and above all humble because this K2 mountain requires a lot of humility."</p>

<p>While Nepal's Mount Everest is around 240 metres taller than K2, the Pakistan peak first scaled in 1954 is regarded as a more challenging ascent.</p>

<p>Elite climbers often talk of a special connection to the mountain despite its fatal reputation.</p>

<p>Historically around one in four ascent attempts have ended in death.</p>

<p>Recent years have seen fewer fatalities, but two Japanese climbers also attempting to scale K2 using the "alpine style" fell the day before Vedrines' ascent, with their motionless bodies spotted by a helicopter.</p>

<p>A rescue was deemed impossible.</p>

<h3><strong>'K2 accepted me'</strong></h3>

<p>At times Vedrines was climbing solo, as well as at record speed.</p>

<p>"I had to forge a little path in the snow and there was this slightly mystical atmosphere that is specific to K2," he said.</p>

<p>Vedrines left K2's Advanced Base Camp at 5,350 metres just after midnight, and covered the 3,261 metres to the top before lunchtime the next day.</p>

<p>After making his descent, he spoke to AFP a week later, on Sunday, in the resort town of Skardu -- the gateway to northern Pakistan which is home to five of the world's 14 mountains above 8,000 metres.</p>

<p>"I feel very grateful that the K2 mountain finally accepted me this year," said Vedrines.</p>

<p>"It was not a form of revenge but a form of reconciliation."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The son of Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday urged the country's security forces to block any takeover from her rule as hundreds of thousands of protesters demanded she quit. "Your duty is to keep our people safe and our country safe and to uphold the constitution," US-based Sajeeb Wazed Joy said in a post on Facebook.</p>

<p>"It means don't allow any unelected government to come in power for one minute, it is your duty."</p>

<p>Joy, who is also an information and communications technology advisor to Hasina, warned progress made by Bangladesh would be threatened if she were forced out.</p>

<p>"Everything of our development and progress will vanish. Bangladesh would not be able to come back from there," he said.</p>

<p>"I don't want that and you also do not want that," he added. "Myself, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, will not let that happen as long as I can."</p>

<p>His warning comes as Bangladesh's army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman is set to address the nation, a military spokesman told AFP without giving further details.</p>

<p>Rallies that began last month against civil service job quotas have escalated into some of the worst unrest of Hasina's 15-year rule and shifted into wider calls for the 76-year-old to resign.</p>

<p>A senior advisor to Hasina told AFP Monday that the resignation of the embattled leader was a "possibility" after being questioned as to whether she would quit.</p>

<p>"The situation is such that this is a possibility, but I don't know how it will happen," the aide close to the premier said, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>The military declared an emergency in January 2007 after widespread political unrest and installed a caretaker government for two years.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Negotiations between Meta and some talent representatives have stopped and started many times because the parties can't agree on terms for use of the actors' voices.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta Platforms Inc. is offering Hollywood celebrities millions of dollars for the right to record and use their voices for artificial intelligence projects, according to several people familiar with the negotiations.<br />
<br />
The company is talking with Judi Dench, Awkwafina and Keegan-Michael Key, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the project is confidential. Representatives for Meta declined to comment.<br />
<br />
Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, is racing to close deals so it has time to develop a suite of AI tools for unveiling at its Connect 2024 event in September. While it's not entirely clear how Meta will be using the voices, it has discussed a chatbot that could serve as a digital assistant, a la Apple's Siri, or a friend, the people said. Users could speak with a chatbot that has the voice of Awkwafina, for example.</p>

<p>Negotiations between Meta and some talent representatives have stopped and started many times because the parties can't agree on terms for use of the actors' voices. Meta would like to secure rights to voices for many uses over a fixed term on a single project. Representatives for the actors are seeking stricter limits.</p>

<p>The use of artificial intelligence has spooked many in the Hollywood creative community who fear losing work as a result of the technology. Screenwriters and actors fought for protections against the use of AI during labor stoppages last year. Yet SAG-AFTRA, the primary unions for actors, has reached an agreement with Meta on terms, according to the people.</p>

<p>Meta has experimented with creating text-based chatbots inspired by celebrities like Dwyane Wade and Paris Hilton. The company has already ended that program. It has also unveiled an AI studio that allows content creators to make chatbots of themselves.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has resigned and left the capital Dhaka amid violent protests demanding her resignation, a source close to the embattled leader told the news agency AFP.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina today resigned and left the capital Dhaka amid violent clashes as vast crowds of angry protesters demanded her resignation.</p>

<p>"She and her sister have left Ganabhaban (the Prime Minister's official residence) for a safer place," the source told AFP. "She wanted to record a speech. But she could not get an opportunity to do that," the source said.</p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of protesters defied curfew, marching on the capital's streets and later storming the Prime Minister's palace. Visuals showed crowds running into the premier's official residence in Dhaka, waving to the camera as they celebrated.</p>

<p>Soldiers and police with armoured vehicles in Dhaka had barricaded routes to Ms Hasina's office with barbed wire, AFP reporters said, but vast crowds flooded the streets, tearing down barriers.</p>

<p>Local media estimated as many as 400,000 protesters were on the streets but it was impossible to verify the figure.</p>

<p>Bangladesh's army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman said an interim government will be formed after the prime minister resigned and fled the capital in the face of overwhelming protests. "We will form an interim government," he said.</p>

<p>At least 98 people were killed in fierce clashes yesterday, taking the death count since protests erupted last month to over 300.</p>

<p>Rallies that began last month against civil service job quotas have escalated into some of the worst unrest of Prime Minister Hasina's 15-year rule and shifted into wider calls for the 76-year-old to step down.</p>

<p>The demonstrations have grown into a wider anti-government movement across Bangladesh. It has attracted people from all strata of Bangladesh society, including film stars, musicians and singers. Songs calling for people's support have spread widely on social media.</p>

<p>The protesters had earlier dismissed Ms Hasina's invitation for dialogue aimed at quelling escalating violence and consolidated their demands into a unified call for her resignation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New Jersey father has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for abusing his 6-year-old son to death. Christopher Gregor was found guilty of child endangerment and manslaughter in May after a jury heard evidence that he forced his son, Corey Micciolo, to perform abusive treadmill workouts, leading to the boy's death. The prosecutor alleged the child died from injuries sustained during the father's abuse.</p>

<p>The sentence comes after a four-week trial and nearly three-and-a-half years after the boy's death in April 2021, reports Newsnation.</p>

<p>A video shown in the courtroom showed Gregor increasing the speed on a treadmill, causing his son to fly off and fall six times. Gregor allegedly thought the boy was too fat. On April 2, Corey woke up from a nap nauseated, stumbling around and slurring his words. Surveillance footage shows Gregor carrying the boy's limp and battered body into the hospital shortly before he died.</p>

<p>A registered nurse testified the little boy was not showing any signs that he “was verbal” as his head tilted backwards in the examination room. The injuries were so severe that Corey suffered a seizure during a CT scan, forcing medical staff to take emergency measures. Despite their efforts, the child was pronounced dead shortly before 5 pm.</p>

<p>In a statement to the judge ahead of his sentencing, Christopher Gregor denied responsibility for his son's death. “I did nothing to cause Corey's passing,” Gregor said, as per <a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/treadmill-abuse-dad-sentencing-corey-micciolo/ ">Newsnation</a>. “I didn't hurt my son. I loved him, and I still do. I regret not bringing him to the hospital sooner. I didn't know how sick he was. I didn't know. I just thought he was tired.”</p>

<p>Corey's mother, Breanna Micciolo called Gregor a “monster” who had made her life “an absolute living nightmare.” “Are you that crazy that you convinced yourself you didn't do this?” she asked, adding, “I hate you, and I will never forgive you.”&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon's health ministry said two people were killed Monday in an Israeli strike on the country's south, where Hezbollah has been trading near-daily fire with Israel since the start of the Gaza war in October.</p>

<p>Since last week, tensions have soared as Iran and Tehran-backed groups, including Hezbollah, vowed <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/iran-allies-vow-revenge-after-top-hamas-hezbollah-leaders-killed-6252277" target="_blank">revenge for the killing of Hamas's political leader</a> in Tehran and Israel's killing of Hezbollah's military chief in Beirut.</p>

<p>"The enemy raid that took place near the (Mais Al-Jabal) town's cemetery killed two people," Lebanon's Health Ministry said in a statement.</p>

<p>"One of the two martyrs who fell in the Mais Al-Jabal raid this morning was a Risala Scouts paramedic," Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said.</p>

<p>Ali Abbas, a rescue worker from the Risala Scouts which is affiliated with Hezbollah ally the Amal movement, told AFP that the paramedic had travelled by motorcycle with another person to inspect the site of an earlier strike.</p>

<p>He went "to see if there were civilians or people (in the area)... and the second strike happened immediately," Abbas said.</p>

<p>Mais al-Jabal, a frontline village less than two kilometres away from the border with Israel, has experienced heavy bombardment since the cross-border clashes began, forcing most residents to leave.</p>

<p>Early on Monday, Hezbollah said it had targeted military sites in northern Israel with "explosive-laden drones" in response to Israeli "attacks and assassinations" in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said "numerous suspicious aerial targets were identified crossing from Lebanon" into northern Israel, starting a fire and leaving an officer and a soldier "moderately injured".</p>

<p>The cross-border violence since October has killed at least 549 people in Lebanon, mostly fighters but also including at least 116 civilians, according to an AFP tally.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, including the annexed Golan Heights, 22 soldiers and 25 civilians have been killed, according to army figures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several international airlines unsettled by the threat of a multi-front war in the Middle East - following <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/iran-israel-tension" target="_blank">Iran-Israel tension</a>, to add to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/israel-gaza-war" target="_blank">violence in Gaza</a>, which has claimed nearly 40,00 lives and impacted neighbouring countries, like Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, and Jordan, among other nations - have cancelled, or reduced, flights to and from Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>The result is thousands of people have been left stranded, in Israel and elsewhere, or are scrambling for alternate routes (often at great expense) to get home.</p>

<p>Airlines - including <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/air-india" target="_blank">Air India</a>, which last week said it was suspending all services to Israel "in view of the ongoing situation in parts of the Middle East" - are in wait-and-watch mode while they assess safety levels and threats to aircraft, crew, and passengers.</p>

<p>Nearly a dozen airlines, including Air India and United Airlines, have cancelled or reduced flights till now. United has stopped all flights indefinitely, while Air India has done so till Thursday.</p>

<p>One of the world's biggest carrier conglomerates - Germany's Lufthansa Group - has suspended all flights, passenger and cargo - to Tel Aviv, also till Thursday.</p>

<p>This is a list of international airlines that have cancelled, or cut, flights to and/or from Israel.</p>

<p><strong>Italian airline ITA&nbsp;</strong>has halted flights to and from the Israeli capital "due to the geopolitical developments in the Middle East and to ensure safety of passengers and crew".</p>

<p>Flights have been suspended till Tuesday.</p>

<p><strong>German carrier Lufthansa Group</strong> and its subsidiaries, including <strong>Switzerland's Swiss International Airlines</strong>, have cancelled all passenger and cargo flights to and from Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>This cancellation is effective till Thursday, when it will be reviewed.</p>

<p>"The reason for this is the current development in the region," a Lufthansa spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Swiss International is suspending flights from Zurich to Tel Aviv (again, till Thursday) and to Beirut (in Lebanon, till Monday next), a company spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Services from the United States have also been affected, with <strong>Delta</strong>, <strong>United Airlines</strong>, and <strong>American Airlines</strong> also halting flights till further notice.</p>

<p>Flagship carriers of Greece (<strong>Aegean Air</strong>) and Poland (<strong>LOT</strong>), as well as budget Hungarian airline <strong>Wizz Air</strong>, followed suit. Aegean and LOT have paused flights till Tuesday and Friday.</p>

<p>Wizz Air had said it was cancelling flights till Sunday; it is unclear if services have resumed.</p>

<p>The Netherlands' flagship, <strong>KLM Airlines</strong>, has stopped flights till Tuesday.</p>

<p>Spain's three biggest carriers - <strong>Iberia Express</strong>, <strong>Vueling</strong>, and <strong>Air Europa</strong> - also briefly cancelled flights. As of this morning Iberia Express and Vueling have re-started flights. Air Europa's services remain suspended till Wednesday.</p>

<p>Several other airlines from European nations, including Belgium and Croatia, have made similar announcements. And it isn't just foreign services.</p>

<p>Israeli low-cost airline <strong>Arkia</strong> had to scramble to bring back hundreds of passengers stuck in Prague in Czechia after the foreign crew of one of its planes refused to fly to Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>Tensions in the Middle East have skyrocketed after Iran and the Hamas, with the Hezbollah, vowed revenge for the assassination of their leaders, which has been blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>Tel Aviv has been accused of assassinating Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in Iran, hours after reportedly killing Hezbollah's military chief Fuad Shukr in Beirut in Lebanon.</p>

<p>United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken has reportedly warned global leaders that an attack by Iran and Hezbollah against Israel could commence at any time. The Times of Israel reported the Benjamin Netanyahu-led government could sanction a pre-emptive strike.</p>

<p>Concerns have heightened dramatically, as months of cross-border skirmishes risk devolving into a full-scale conflict between Hezbollah and Israel. The two adversaries last engaged in a war in 2006, which saw Israel bombing Lebanon's only passenger airport in Beirut.</p>

<p>The intensity of the current situation has led various embassies, including India's, to urge their citizens to leave Lebanon while some commercial flights remain available. Multiple countries, including the US and the United Kingdom, have issued similar warnings to their citizens.</p>

<p>Riots have erupted across towns and cities in the last week after three girls were killed in a knife attack in Southport in northwest England, with 420 people arrested so far.</p>

<p>The murders were seized on by anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim groups as misinformation spread online that the suspected attacker was a radical Islamist who had just arrived in Britain. Police have said the suspect was born in Britain and are not treating it as a terrorist incident.</p>

<p>Interior Minister Yvette Cooper said rioters had felt "emboldened by this moment to stir up racial hatred", with bricks thrown at police officers, shops looted and mosques and Asian-owned businesses attacked.</p>

<p>Over the weekend riots broke out in Liverpool, Bristol, Tamworth, Middlesbrough and Belfast, in Northern Ireland, with largely young men wearing balaclavas and draped in the British flags hurling rocks and shouting "Stop the Boats", a reference to migrants arriving on the south coast in recent years.</p>

<p>In Rotherham, northern England, protesters sought to break into a hotel that housed asylum seekers.</p>

<h3><strong>Police Blame on Online Disinformation</strong></h3>

<p>Police have blamed online disinformation, amplified by high-profile figures for driving the violence. One of the most prominent of these, Stephen Yaxley-Lennon who led the anti-Islam English Defence League group, has been blamed by media for spreading misinformation to his 875,000 followers on X.</p>

<p>"They are lying to you all," Yaxley-Lennon, who is known by the pseudonym Tommy Robinson, wrote. "Attempting to turn the nation against me. I need you, you are my voice."</p>

<p>Elon Musk, the owner of X, also weighed in on the violence. Responding to a post on X that blamed mass migration and open borders for the disorder in Britain, he wrote: "Civil war is inevitable."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Civil war is inevitable</p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1819933223536742771?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 4, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Interior Minister Yvette Cooper told broadcasters that tensions had been amplified and inflamed online, and the government would be pursuing the issue with social media companies.</p>

<p>"I think what you've seen is that networks of different individuals and groups that have been trying to fan the flames," she told Sky News, swerving questions on whether foreign states had been involved.</p>

<p>While she said people had views and concerns about issues such as immigration, she blamed extremist, racist, violent groups for the violence.</p>

<p>"Reasonable people who have all those sorts of views and concerns do not pick up bricks and throw them at the police," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The practice of adulterating honey is well known, and historically adulterants such as ash and potato flour have been used. Now, advancements in technology and science have made it much easier, with "bespoke, designer or bioengineered" syrups.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lynne Ingram cuts a peaceful figure as she tends to a row of humming beehives in a leafy corner of Somerset, southwest England.</p>

<p>But the master beekeeper, who has been keeping hives for more than 40 years, has found herself in a fight against a tricky and evolving foe -- honey fraudsters.</p>

<p>The practice of adulterating honey is well known, and historically adulterants such as ash and potato flour have been used.</p>

<p>Now, advancements in technology and science have made it much easier, with "bespoke, designer or bioengineered" syrups used as diluting agents capable of fooling authenticity tests, Ingram said.</p>

<p>She founded the UK Honey Authenticity Network (HAN UK) in 2021 to raise awareness about natural honey and warn of the threat posed by fraud.</p>

<p>"One of the impacts we're seeing all over the world is beekeepers going out of business," she said.</p>

<p>Adulterated honey can be sold to retailers for a price several times lower than genuine producers can afford.</p>

<p>As well as producing their own honey, many larger-scale beekeepers have crop pollination contracts with farmers, delivering thousands of colonies to growers across the country.</p>

<p>If they go out of business due to unfair competition, this vital natural method of pollinating crops is reduced and food production suffers.</p>

<p>The British Beekeepers Association, which represents more than 25,000 producers and where Ingram is a honey ambassador, wants the risk of fraud to be recognised to protect the industry and consumers.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see an acknowledgement that there is actually an issue here," she said.</p>

<h3><strong>Better labelling</strong></h3>

<p>In May, the European Union updated its honey regulations to ensure clearer product labelling and a "honey traceability system" to increase transparency.</p>

<p>On the labelling for blended honeys, for example, all countries of origin are now required to appear near a product's name, where previously it was only mandatory to state whether blending had occurred.</p>

<p>Labelling in the UK, which has now left the EU, is not as stringent and Ingram believes consumers are "being misled" by vague packaging.</p>

<p>Behind the EU action is an apparent increase in adulterated honey arriving in the 27-nation bloc.</p>

<p>The substandard adulterates can have adverse effects on consumers' health, such as raising the risk of diabetes, obesity, and liver or kidney damage.</p>

<p>Between 2021 and 2022, 46 percent of the honey tested as it entered the EU was flagged as potentially fraudulent, up from 14 percent in the 2015-17 period.</p>

<p>Of the suspicious consignments, 74 percent were of Chinese origin.</p>

<p>Honey imported from the UK had a 100-percent suspicion rate.</p>

<p>The EU said this honey was probably produced in third countries and blended again in the UK before being sent to the bloc.</p>

<p>The UK is the second largest importer of honey in terms of volume in the whole of Europe. China is its top supplier.</p>

<p>Not all of the UK's imported honey leaves the country, however. Considerable quantities stay on the domestic market.</p>

<p>"We think there's an awful lot of it on the shelves," said Ingram, adding that adulterated honey was "widely available" in big supermarkets.</p>

<h3><strong>Lasers</strong></h3>

<p>Behind the closed blinds of a research laboratory at Aston University in Birmingham, central England, researchers fighting honey fraud are harnessing cutting-edge technology.</p>

<p>Aston scientists and beekeepers, including Ingram, are using light to reveal the contents of honey samples at the molecular level.</p>

<p>The technique -- known as Fluorescence Excitation-Emission Spectroscopy (FLE) -- involves firing lasers into samples.</p>

<p>The light frequencies re-emitted are then collated into a three-dimensional image -- or "molecular fingerprint" -- of the honey tested.</p>

<p>Alex Rozhin, the project lead and a reader in nanotechnology, said the test "can trace different molecules through the spectrum and confirm which type of biochemicals are present".</p>

<p>In the darkened lab, the light from different honeys is clearly visible.</p>

<p>The first gives off a vivid green and the second a cooler blue, indicating distinct chemical compositions.</p>

<p>Using FLE, Rozhin says his team "can immediately trace a concentration of fraud inside samples" with "different spectral bands corresponding to syrup (or) to natural honey".</p>

<p>Rozhin said FLE is more accurate than existing tests and can provide results far quicker, at a greatly reduced cost and without the need for highly trained personnel.</p>

<p>One of the Aston team's aims is to create a version of FLE that can be used by honey producers or even consumers with scaled-down equipment or eventually just a smartphone.</p>

<p>Rolling the test out like this would also accelerate the creation of a honey database which, through machine learning, could be used as a catalogue of biometric signatures.</p>

<p>"If we get a new sample and it's been tampered with and it's different from how the database is built up, we'll know there's something obscure," said Steven Daniels, an Aston research associate specialising in machine learning.</p>

<p>Ingram said the test could close international gaps in testing methods by establishing a unified standard, but the government needed to monitor the sector too.</p>

<p>"We really need to get to grips with this," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Mexican national and one of "America's Most Wanted" fugitives for 20 years, was captured in Mexico while working as a police officer. According to the<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/04/us-news/americas-most-wanted-fugitive-antonio-el-diablo-riano-arrested-in-mexico/"> New York Post,</a></em>&nbsp;Antonio ''El Diablo'' Riano&nbsp;was handed over to deputy US Marshals in Mexico City and charged with first-degree murder stemming from a 2004 fatal shooting outside a bar in Ohio.</p>

<p>On December 19, 2004, a deadly altercation occurred at the Round House Bar in Hamilton, Ohio, resulting in the tragic death of 25-year-old Benjamin Becerra.&nbsp;A few weeks prior, Mr Becerra was involved in a brawl at the same bar and was asked to leave.</p>

<p>On the day of the shooting, Mr Becerra returned to the bar, where Riano was assisting the bartender.&nbsp;A brief argument ensued between them, resulting in Riano fatally shooting Mr Becerra in the head at approximately 2:20 p.m.</p>

<p>Riano fled the scene in his van but was later identified through witness statements and surveillance footage showing him purchasing ammunition at a Walmart just 45 minutes before the shooting.&nbsp;A Grand Jury indicted him on first-degree murder on February 16, 2005, but he failed to appear at his scheduled arraignment. Instead, he fled to Mexico to escape prosecution.</p>

<p>He was placed on Butler County Sheriff's Office's "Most Wanted" list and was also profiled on a 2005 episode of ''America's Most Wanted.''</p>

<p>On Thursday, Riano was apprehended in Mexico, where he was working as a police officer, and handed over to deputy US Marshals in Mexico City.</p>

<p>''Over 20 years after the shooting the Butler County Prosecutor's Office teamed up with the U.S. Marshals Service and the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of International Affairs who worked with law enforcement partners in Mexico to secure the arrest and extradition of Riano. When Riano was arrested in Mexico he was found to be working as a local police officer,'' the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.usmarshals.gov/news/press-release/us-marshals-capture-hamilton-homicide-suspect-2004">US Marshals Service said.</a></p>

<p>He is now being extradited from Zapotitlan Palmas to the Butler County Jail, according to the U.S. Marshals Service and Butler County Prosecutor's Office.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The number of marriages in China is closely tied to the number of births, and the decline is likely to upset policymakers trying hard to boost the population which has been shrinking for two consecutive years.</p>

<p>A total of 3.43 million couples tied the knot in the first six months of the year, a drop of 498,000 from the same year-ago period, the data on marriage registrations showed.</p>

<p>Marriage is seen as a prerequisite for having children due to widespread incentives and policies, including a requirement for parents to present a marriage certificate to register their child and receive state benefits.</p>

<p>Many young Chinese are opting to stay single or delay getting married due to poor job prospects and worries about the future as growth in the world's second-largest economy slows.</p>

<p>Marriage rates have been declining in China since 2014. While there was a slight pick up in 2023 due to pent-up demand after the easing of pandemic restrictions, the rate this year is expected to drop to its lowest since 1980, demographic expert He Yafu told state-backed newspaper the Global Times.</p>

<p>Reasons for the decline in marriage registrations include a decrease in the number of young people, a higher number of males in the marriageable population versus females, the high cost of marriage, and changing attitudes, He said.</p>

<p>"The declining trend in China's birth rate in the long run will be difficult to fundamentally change unless substantial childbirth support policies are implemented in the future to address this challenge," He said.</p>

<p>China's Civil Affairs University announced a new undergraduate marriage program to develop marriage-related industries and culture, drawing scorn from social media users who questioned the need for such a course as marriage rates decline.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 45-year-old Indonesian man allegedly killed his 60-year-old neighbour after being repeatedly asked why he wasn't married. The incident took place in South Tapanuli regency, located in North Sumatra, on July 29, the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/indonesian-man-kills-neighbour-who-kept-asking-him-why-he-was-not-married-at-45">Straits Times</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Assistant Police Commissioner Maria Marpaung, the victim of the fatal attack was identified as Asgim Irianto, a 60-year-old retired civil servant. The attacker, Parlindungan Siregar, was reportedly hurt and annoyed by the victim's persistent questioning about his marital status.</p>

<p>According to the statement of the victim's wife, Siregar arrived at the victim's home on July 29, wielding a piece of wood and attacked him without warning. Mr&nbsp;Irianto&nbsp;attempted to escape by running out into the street. However, Siregar pursued him, catching up and delivering a fatal blow to the head. Even though he fell to the ground, Siregar continued to beat him mercilessly.</p>

<p>Other residents intervened, stopped the assault, and rushed Mr&nbsp;Irianto to the hospital. He died on the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The police&nbsp;arrested Siregar shortly after. &nbsp;The investigation is ongoing, but the cops suspect the motive was linked to Siregar's frustration over the elderly man's repeated inquiries about his marital status.</p>

<p>"He was determined to beat Mr Asgim to death because of the frequent taunts about his single status," said senior police officer Marpaung.</p>

<p>According to a local report, the fatal attack was not an isolated incident, but rather the culmination of a history of tensions between the two neighbours. Before the deadly assault, the duo had reportedly engaged in heated arguments over their chickens wandering into each other's coops.</p>

<p>In a similar incident, an&nbsp;Indonesian man was arrested for allegedly stabbing his friend to death after an argument over the classic riddle, "Which came first, the chicken or the egg?" According to the&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/southeast-asia/indonesia-chicken-egg-question-murder-sulawesi-b2588159.html">Independent,</a></em>&nbsp;the incident occurred on July 24 in Southeast Sulawesi province's Muna Regency, when the suspect, identified as DR, invited&nbsp;Kadir Markus for a drink.&nbsp;After a few rounds of alcoholic drinks, DR asked Mr&nbsp;Markus to answer a riddle for him.</p>

<p>As the conversation turned into a heated debate, Mr&nbsp;Markus tried to distance himself from the argument, refusing to engage further.&nbsp;Mr Markus decided to go back to his home, but DR grabbed a dagger and chased him on his bike and then on foot before <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/drunk-man-in-indonesia-stabs-friend-to-death-for-not-answering-chicken-egg-riddle-6232017">attacking him multiple times</a>.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris will name her running mate as soon as Monday, as she prepares for a tour of US battleground states aimed at turning excitement over her presidential bid into durable support that can power her to victory.</p>

<p>All paths to the White House run through a handful of swing states, and Harris will kick off her five-day run Tuesday in the largest -- Pennsylvania -- as she builds momentum for her showdown with Republican Donald Trump on November 5.</p>

<p>"At this moment, we face a choice between two visions for our nation: one focused on the future and the other on the past... This campaign is about people coming together, fuelled by love of country, to fight for the best of who we are," she posted on X.</p>

<p>Fresh from winning enough delegate votes to secure the Democratic nomination, the country's first female, Black and South Asian vice president heads into the national convention in Chicago in two weeks in total control of her party.</p>

<p>In a campaign that is barely two weeks old, the 59-year-old former prosecutor has obliterated fundraising records, attracted huge crowds and dominated social media on her way to erasing the polling leads Trump had built before President Joe Biden quit the race.</p>

<p>Next on the agenda is a vice presidential pick, with an announcement expected any time before her rally Tuesday evening alongside the mystery nominee in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania's largest city.</p>

<p>The Keystone State is the most prized real estate among the closely fought battlegrounds that decide the Electoral College system.</p>

<p>It is part of the "blue wall" that carried Biden to the White House in 2020, alongside Michigan and Wisconsin -- two states where Harris is due to woo crowds on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania is governed by 51-year-old Democrat Josh Shapiro, a frontrunner in the so-called "veepstakes" shortlist that also includes fellow state governors Tim Walz and Andy Beshear, as well as Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and US transport secretary Pete Buttigieg.</p>

<h3><strong>'Freedom'</strong></h3>

<p>Later in the week, Harris will tour the more racially diverse Sun Belt and southern states of Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina, as she seeks to shore up the Black and Hispanic vote that had been peeling away from the Democrats.</p>

<p>Just a month ago, Trump was in cruise control, having opened a significant lead in swing state polling after a dismal debate performance by Biden, with the Republican tycoon keeping the country in suspense over his own vice-presidential pick.</p>

<p>Trump's White House bid was upended on July 21 when 81-year-old Biden, facing growing concerns about his age and lagging polling numbers, exited the race and backed Harris.</p>

<p>Energetic and two decades younger than 78-year-old Trump, the vice president has made a fast start, raising $310 million in July, according to her campaign -- more than double Trump's haul.</p>

<p>While Biden made high-minded appeals for a return to civility and the preservation of democracy, Harris has focused on the future, making voters' hard-fought "freedom" the touchstone of her campaign.</p>

<p>She and her allies have also been more aggressive than the Biden camp -- mocking Trump for reneging on his commitment to a September 10 debate and characterising the convicted felon as an elderly crook and "weird."</p>

<p>While she has disavowed some of the leftist positions she took during her ill-fated 2020 primary campaign, Harris hasn't given a wide-ranging interview since jumping into the race, and rally-goers will look for more detail on her plans for the country.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Trump and his Republicans have struggled to adapt to their new adversary or hone their attacks against Harris -- at first messaging that she was dangerously liberal on immigration and crime, before suggesting she was lying about being Black.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>While it's one thing to acknowledge the limits to our knowledge of the microbial soup we live in, more recent attention has focused on how we might systematically approach future pandemic risks.</p>

<p>Former US Secretary of Defense <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406235718/http://archive.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=2636">Donald Rumsfeld</a> famously talked about “known knowns” (things we know we know), “known unknowns” (things we know we don't know), and “unknown unknowns” (the things we don't know we don't know).</p>

<p>Although this may have been controversial in its original context of weapons of mass destruction, it provides <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/what-is-disease-x">a way to think about</a> how we might approach future pandemic threats.</p>

<h3><strong>Influenza: a ‘known known'</strong></h3>

<p>Influenza is largely a known entity; we essentially have a minor pandemic every winter with small changes in the virus each year. But more major changes can also occur, resulting in spread through populations with little pre-existing immunity. We saw this most recently in 2009 with the <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/cvi.05072-11">swine flu pandemic</a>.</p>

<p>However, there's a lot we don't understand about what drives influenza mutations, how these interact with population-level immunity, and how best to make predictions about transmission, severity and impact each year.</p>

<p>The current H5N1 subtype of avian influenza (“bird flu”) <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/influenza-h5n1">has spread</a> widely around the world. It has led to the deaths of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/data-map-commercial.html">many millions</a> of birds and spread to several mammalian species <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/livestock">including cows</a> in the United States and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41182-0">marine mammals</a> in South America.</p>

<p>Human cases <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/influenza-h5n1">have been reported</a> in people who have had close contact with infected animals, but fortunately there's currently no sustained spread between people.</p>

<p>While detecting influenza in animals is a huge task in a large country such as Australia, there are <a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.au/biosecurity-trade/pests-diseases-weeds/animal/avian-influenza">systems in place</a> to detect and respond to bird flu in wildlife and production animals.</p>

<p>It's inevitable there will be more influenza pandemics in the future. But it isn't always the one we are worried about.</p>

<p>Attention has been focused on avian influenza since 1997 when an outbreak in birds in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14575073/">Hong Kong</a> caused severe disease in humans. However the subsequent <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4957980/">pandemic in 2009</a> originated in pigs in central Mexico.</p>

<h3><strong>Coronaviruses: an ‘unknown known'</strong></h3>

<p>Although Rumsfeld didn't talk about “unknown knowns”, coronaviruses would be appropriate for this category. We knew more about coronaviruses than most people might have thought before the COVID pandemic. &nbsp;</p>

<p>We'd had experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) causing large outbreaks. Both are caused by viruses <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2012-7">closely related</a> to SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID. While these might have faded from public consciousness before COVID, coronaviruses were listed in the 2015 <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2015/12/08/default-calendar/december-2015---first-list-of-top-emerging-diseases-likely-to-cause-major-epidemics">WHO list</a> of diseases with pandemic potential.</p>

<p>Previous research into the earlier coronaviruses proved vital in allowing COVID-19 vaccines to be developed rapidly. For example, the Oxford group's initial work on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X17306564?via%3Dihub">a MERS vaccine</a> was key to the development of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<p>Similarly, previous research into the structure of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5584442/">spike protein</a> – a protein on the surface of coronaviruses that allows it to attach to our cells – was helpful in developing mRNA vaccines for COVID.</p>

<p>It would seem likely there will be further coronavirus pandemics in the future. And even if they don't occur at the scale of COVID, the impacts can be significant. For example, when MERS spread to South Korea in 2015, it only caused 186 cases over two months, but the cost of controlling it was <a href="https://wellcome.org/news/cost-of-not-preparing-for-infectious-diseases">estimated at US$8 billion</a> (A$11.6 billion).</p>

<h3><strong>The 25 viral families: an approach to ‘known unknowns'</strong></h3>

<p>Attention has now turned to the known unknowns. There are about 120 viruses from <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/139601">25 families</a> that are known to cause human disease. Members of each viral family share common properties and our immune systems respond to them in similar ways.</p>

<p>An example is the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(08)60238-X/fulltext">flavivirus family</a>, of which the best-known members are yellow fever virus and dengue fever virus. This <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0714-0">family also includes</a> several other important viruses, such as Zika virus (which can cause <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsr1604338">birth defects</a> when pregnant women are infected) and West Nile virus (which causes <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1125772/">encephalitis</a>, or inflammation of the brain).</p>

<p>The WHO's <a href="https://www.who.int/teams/blueprint/who-r-and-d-blueprint-for-epidemics">blueprint for epidemics</a> aims to consider threats from different classes of viruses and bacteria. It looks at individual pathogens as examples from each category to expand our understanding systematically.</p>

<p>The US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has taken this a step further, preparing vaccines and therapies for a list of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10582320/">prototype pathogens</a> from key virus families. The goal is to be able to adapt this knowledge to new vaccines and treatments if a pandemic were to arise from a closely related virus.</p>

<h3><strong>Pathogen X, the ‘unknown unknown'</strong></h3>

<p>There are also the unknown unknowns, or “<a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/what-is-disease-x">disease X</a>” – an unknown pathogen with the potential to trigger a severe global epidemic. To prepare for this, we need to adopt new forms of surveillance specifically looking at where new pathogens could emerge.</p>

<p>In recent years, there's been an increasing recognition that we need to take a broader view of health beyond only thinking about human health, but also animals and the environment. This concept is known as “<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31486-0/fulltext">One Health</a>” and considers issues such as climate change, intensive agricultural practices, trade in exotic animals, increased human encroachment into wildlife habitats, changing international travel, and urbanisation.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34231315/">has implications</a> not only for where to look for new infectious diseases but also for how we can reduce the risk of “spillover” from animals to humans. This might include <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41684-021-00725-y">targeted testing</a> of animals and people who work closely with animals. Currently, testing is mainly directed towards known viruses, but <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40247-4">new technologies</a> can look for as yet unknown viruses in patients with symptoms consistent with new infections.</p>

<p>We live in a vast world of potential microbiological threats. While influenza and coronaviruses have a track record of causing past pandemics, a longer list of new pathogens could still cause outbreaks with significant consequences.</p>

<p>Continued surveillance for new pathogens, improving our understanding of important virus families, and developing policies to reduce the risk of spillover will all be important for reducing the risk of future pandemics.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vladimir Putin's proposed revision of Russian nuclear policy signals a worrying readiness to use the ultimate weapon against Ukraine and even NATO members, but it remains far from certain the threat will be translated into action, analysts say.</p>

<p>The proposed broadening of Russia's nuclear rules comes as Moscow's invasion of Ukraine stretches into its third year and Kyiv seeks permission from Western allies to use long-range weapons to strike targets deep inside Russia.</p>

<p>With the ramped-up rhetoric Putin is looking to dissuade Western countries from broadening support for Kyiv.</p>

<p>But with repeated threats, he is also putting himself under pressure to act on the use of nuclear weapons, not only against Ukraine but also its NATO backers.</p>

<p>Maxim Starchak, a fellow at the Centre for International and Defence Policy at Queen's University in Canada, said that with the revision of the doctrine, Putin wanted to lower the threshold for use of nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>"Putin counts on the introduction of an additional -- nuclear -- factor in the Ukraine war. He believes and hopes that this will work," Starchak said.</p>

<p>A senior European military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Putin had a limited range of options two and a half years into the war.</p>

<p>When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, "Putin went all-in. He therefore has little capacity for escalation," the official said.</p>

<p>He outlined three options at Putin's disposal: the use of nuclear rhetoric, the use of nuclear weapons, and hybrid warfare against the West.</p>

<h2><strong>WESTERN NUCLEAR RESPONSE</strong></h2>

<p>Since the invasion Putin has repeatedly threatened to use nuclear weapons, which the West has dismissed as sabre rattling.</p>

<p>But on Wednesday he went further, announcing changes to the country's nuclear doctrine during a televised meeting of the Kremlin's Security Council.</p>

<p>The updated doctrine would allow the use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states when they are supported by nuclear powers -- a clear reference to Ukraine and its Western backers.</p>

<p>The new rules would also allow Russia to unleash a nuclear response in the event of a "massive" air attack, he said.</p>

<p>For Pavel Luzin, a visiting scholar at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, Putin's threats still rang hollow.</p>

<p>"Russia is frantically looking for ways to make the world afraid of Russian nuclear weapons again," he said.</p>

<p>Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, said: "While the Ukrainian retaliation strikes into Russia are causing serious damage, a Russian nuclear response could lead to far greater damage if it triggered a Western nuclear response."</p>

<p>The European Union on Thursday denounced Putin's latest move as "reckless and irresponsible", and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the Russian leader "totally irresponsible".</p>

<h3><strong>QUESTIONS FROM PEOPLE</strong></h3>

<p>In Moscow, Alexander Khramchikhin, a Russian military analyst, said he did not see "any fundamental changes" to the doctrine, and its wording remains intentionally vague.</p>

<p>What mattered, he said, was the message the Kremlin was sending after Ukraine repeatedly crossed Moscow's "red lines", with its cross-border offensive in the western region of Kursk and the massive use of drones against targets deep inside Russia.</p>

<p>He noted that Putin was coming under increasing pressure from the military, politicians and public opinion at home to use nuclear weapons to win the Ukraine war.</p>

<p>"I am now constantly hearing questions from ordinary people who are asking why we are still not using nuclear weapons," Khramchikhin said.</p>

<p>Since the start of the war, Russian propaganda has gone into overdrive, threatening nuclear retaliation even against Western capitals.</p>

<p>Sergei Karaganov, a high-profile political scientist known for his hawkish views, has urged Putin to use limited nuclear strikes to "save" human civilisation.</p>

<p>Thirty-four percent of Russians consider the use of nuclear weapons against Ukraine to be justified, according to a poll by the Levada Centre released in July.</p>

<p>"Well-articulated direct military threats against NATO are the most effective way to communicate," said Vasily Kashin, a Russia-based political scientist. "But at the same time we must be ready to act on these threats."</p>

<p>"We may see limited strikes against facilities in Eastern Europe," Kashin said. "It could lead to a nuclear escalation. A protracted conflict is a dangerous situation."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Spanish microbiologist Pilar Bosch was casting around for a subject to investigate for her PhD in 2008, she stumbled across a paper suggesting that bacteria, her field, could be used in art restoration, her mother's own area of expertise.</p>

<p>At that same moment, her mother - Pilar Roig - was struggling to restore 18th-century paintings by Antonio Palomino in one of the oldest churches in Spain's third city, Valencia.</p>

<p>She was finding it particularly difficult to remove the glue that had been used to pull the frescoes from the walls of Santos Juanes church during restoration work in the 1960s.</p>

<p>"My mother had a very difficult problem to solve and I found a paper about bacteria used to clean frescoes in Italy," Bosch, 42, said.</p>

<p>She did her PhD on that project. And more than a decade later, daughter and mother have joined forces on a 4-million-euro ($4.46-million) project, funded by local foundations, to use some of the techniques to restore the artworks in Valencia.</p>

<p>The microbiologist trains bacteria by feeding them samples of the glue which was made from animal collagen. The bacteria then naturally produce enzymes to degrade the glue.</p>

<p>The family team then mixes the bacteria with a natural algae-based gel and spread it on the paintings - which were taken from the walls in the 1960s, then nailed back on, still covered in glue.</p>

<p>After three hours, the gel is removed, revealing glue-free paintings.</p>

<p>"In the past, we used to work in a horrible manual way, with warm water and sponges that took hours and damaged the painting," said Roig, now 75, whose father and grandfather along with other relatives also worked in art conservation.</p>

<p>Her microbiologist daughter has now joined in. "It certainly runs in the family," Bosch said, as both stood in lab coats, supervising the restoration.</p>

<p>Bosch has also applied her use of bacteria to restoration projects in Pisa and Monte Cassino in Italy and in Santiago de Compostela in northern Spain. She is now training up cohorts of a different kind of bacteria to clear walls of spray-painted graffiti.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of fishermen in Canada caught what appeared to be a giant crocodile-like fish slowly moving under the calm waters.&nbsp;As their hook jerked unexpectedly, the fishermen peered into the water, encountering a sight that was both horrifying and awe-inspiring. The gigantic fish, eerily resembling a crocodile in shape, moved slowly; its unusual markings mesmerising onlookers. Onboard, the fishermen stood in stunned silence, frozen by the sheer size and bizarre appearance of the creature.</p>

<p>Sturgeon fish are ancient creatures that have been around for over 200 million years. They are mostly found in rivers, lakes&nbsp;and coastal waters in the Northern Hemisphere. Sturgeons are easily recognised by their long, streamlined bodies and bony plates instead of scales. Some can grow up to 6 meters long and weigh over 680 kgs. These fish primarily feed on small fish, crustaceans&nbsp;and invertebrates by using their sensitive barbels to find food at the bottom of the water. They migrate between freshwater and saltwater to spawn and can live for more than 100 years.</p>

<p>Last month, a 12.25-foot male oarfish, often dubbed a "doomsday fish," was <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/two-days-after-doomsday-fish-appears-in-california-earthquake-hits-los-angeles-6409382">discovered off the coast of California</a>. Paddle-boarders found the rare deep-sea fish, which is believed to have the ability to predict natural disasters. The fish was later taken to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for examination, where scientists performed a necropsy to determine the cause of death, which remains unclear.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US first lady Melania Trump recalled learning that her husband had been bloodied by a would-be assassin's bullet, describing his near-miss as "a miracle" in a rare interview aired Thursday.</p>

<p>The wife of former president Donald Trump told Fox News she was in New York in July when live images of the attack at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania played out on television.</p>

<p>"I ran to the TV, and I rewind it. And I watched it. I was only a few minutes behind... But when I saw it... nobody really knew yet because when you see him on the floor and you don't know, you don't know what really happened," she said.</p>

<p>Trump's bid for a White House return was upended when a 20-year-old gunman opened fire at him from a nearby rooftop at the event in Pennsylvania before the would-be assassin was shot dead by a sniper.</p>

<p>Trump's ear was grazed but he suffered no serious injury.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Melania Trump praised her husband's Secret Service detail -- calling the agents "fantastic" despite criticism over the stunning security failure.</p>

<p>She also briefly recalled her reaction to the suspected second attempt on the 78-year-old Republican's life at the Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach, Florida on September 15.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I think both of the events, they were really miracles. If you really think about it, July 13 was a miracle," she said.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Invasion of privacy'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The reclusive, media-shy former first lady was giving her first television interview in two years to promote her memoir, out on October 8, less than a month before the election that could put her husband back in power.</p>

<p>But while politician's spouses often take an active role in campaigning, Melania has largely snubbed her husband's rallies.</p>

<p>The Slovenian-born former model, 54, was also absent from his court hearings in New York, where he was convicted of 34 fraud felonies as part of a scandal involving hush money payments to a porn star.</p>

<p>She was asked about her husband's various criminal cases, and she criticized an FBI search at the couple's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in 2022.</p>

<p>"It made me angry, yes. Invasion of privacy. And the way it was done... I was really surprised," she said after the bureau entered the property to recover classified documents allegedly stored unlawfully.</p>

<p>She also questioned the first assassination attempt against her husband because she felt it was being brushed under the carpet by the media.</p>

<h3><strong>'Tacky'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"I had a lot of questions. What's going on? This is not normal. And is it really shocking that all this outrageous violence goes against my husband?" she said.</p>

<p>"Especially (when) we hear the leaders from the opposition party and mainstream media branding him as a threat to democracy, calling him vile names... This needs to stop. The country needs to unite."</p>

<p>The upcoming 256-page memoir is entitled simply "Melania," and a signed version accompanied by photographs sells for $250.</p>

<p>The ex-first lady and other members of the Trump clan have been criticized over the sheer volume of expensive merchandise they have on sale leveraging the tycoon's political career.</p>

<p>This week the ex-president added a series of $100,000 watches to a trove of merchandise he has on sale, including $100 silver coins made with $ 30 worth of silver, NFT trading cards, $60 Bibles and $400 sneakers.</p>

<p>Melania herself was mocked recently over a $600 gold "Vote Freedom" necklace she was selling, branded as "tacky" by daytime TV host and political commentator Ana Navarro.</p>

<p>"Basically, (the) only time Melania shows her face is to extract money from poor suckers," Navarro said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US and its allies shared a brief moment of optimism on Wednesday as they unveiled a three-week ceasefire proposal to halt the violence between Israel and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>It didn't last long.</p>

<p>Hours after introducing the proposal - amid positive signals from Israel's ambassador to the United Nations - the US came crashing up against opposition from a leader who has repeatedly dashed US hopes to ease the turmoil in the Middle East: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government.</p>

<p>"There will be no ceasefire," Foreign Minister Israel Katz wrote on X. Soon after, Netanyahu landed in New York and said Israel would keep up its fight against Hezbollah. While in flight, his office released a photo that purported to show him ordering a strike on a Hezbollah commander.</p>

<p>The symbolism of that image could not have been any more potent. Yet despite the rejections, White House spokesman John Kirby insisted that there were still "active discussions" with the Israelis about the ceasefire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's not clear to us that from a practical perspective, that there isn't cause for us to continue to have these conversations with the Israelis," Kirby said.</p>

<p>The contradictory messaging - the US insisting Israel is considering its proposal, and Israel insisting it's not - further perpetuated a trend that's come to define the conflict and raised fresh questions about the US strategy to try to end it.</p>

<p>Israel's rejection bore strong echoes of a dialog that revolved around the bid for a ceasefire to halt the fighting between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip nearly a year after the militant group's Oct. 7 attack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Repeatedly, the US has said Israel was onboard with its plan and an accord was close, only for Netanyahu and his government to say they don't see a ceasefire coming anytime soon.</p>

<p>Experts, analysts and government officials argue that for whatever the flaws of the strategy, the Biden administration has no choice but to continue. They suggested that the three-week ceasefire plan for Lebanon, with its dozen signatories along with the EU, may have been meant as a signal to Israel.</p>

<p>"I see this as critical US leadership maximally leveraging diplomatic alliances to sharpen Israeli understanding and appreciation of the costs of proceeding unilaterally," said Mara Rudman, who worked on Middle East issues during the Clinton and Obama administrations. "It will be heard and perhaps needs to sink in."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before unveiling the ceasefire, the US, France and others marshaled a broad coalition to try and push the process forward. But now both US and French officials appear to be effectively ignoring Netanyahu's rejection in the hope that he will come around.</p>

<p>Speaking in Ottawa on Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron said Netanyahu would be making a mistake by rejecting the Lebanon plan because it would make him responsible for "an escalation far beyond that which no one would be able to control."</p>

<p>That doesn't account for the pressure Netanyahu is coming under at home. Tens of thousands of Israelis have been displaced from areas near the Lebanese border and are clamoring to return. But even Israel appeared to acknowledge it had overstepped. Later Thursday, Netanyahu's office expressed appreciation for the Biden administration's efforts and "indispensable" role.</p>

<p>The statement acknowledged that the US was seeking to promote a ceasefire, but stopped short of endorsing this arrangement.</p>

<p>Two diplomats familiar with the Biden administration approach said the impression other nations get is that the US has been repeatedly embarrassed by Israel. The diplomats, who asked not to be identified discussing private assessments, said the US sacrificed its own standing when an ally such as Israel so blatantly flouts its wishes.</p>

<p>The impatience with Biden's approach may be growing. On Thursday, Senator Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, said he would vote to oppose offensive weapons to Israel. He called them "an accelerant to ongoing hostilities."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Biden administration has had to walk a fine line between likely Democratic voters with sympathies on either side of the conflict, particularly given the razor-thin margins in swing states expected to decide the presidential election.</p>

<p>The US seems to believe that "merely expressing the expectation that a deal is imminent or within reach - that this will put pressure on Netanyahu," said Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. "It's like they're trying to manifest a ceasefire into being without actually applying real pressure or using any of the vast leverage at their disposal."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence has officially endorsed Kamala Harris for the 2024 US presidential election, citing the urgent need to safeguard abortion rights as a key reason for her decision. The 34-year-old star emphasised the critical nature of this issue, saying, "Abortion is literally on the ballot."</p>

<p>In an interview with PEOPLE magazine, Lawrence said she believed Harris would "do whatever she can to protect reproductive rights."</p>

<p>As a staunch advocate for women's rights, Lawrence elaborated on her support for Harris, saying, "I'm voting for Kamala Harris because I think she's an amazing candidate and I know that she will do whatever she can to protect reproductive rights."</p>

<p>She further encouraged others to join her in this endeavour, highlighting the importance of preventing any candidate, who would support an abortion ban, from entering the White House. "That's the most important thing, is to not let somebody into the White House who is going to ban abortion," PEOPLE quoted her as saying.</p>

<p>In addition to her endorsement, Lawrence is actively involved in producing two documentary films that reflect her political values. The projects include Bread and Roses -- about the lives of three women under Taliban rule in Afghanistan -- and Zurawski v Texas, which focuses on abortion care advocates who sued the state of Texas in 2023.</p>

<p>Acknowledging her unconventional educational background, Lawrence told PEOPLE, "As online trolls like to point out every time I get involved in politics, I didn't go to school, I dropped out of middle school, so I don't have a classic education. So storytelling is where I get most of my education."</p>

<p>Lawrence joins a growing list of prominent celebrities endorsing Harris in her bid for the presidency. George Clooney, Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish have already thrown their weight behind the Democratic candidate. The US presidential election, set to take place on November 5, will see Harris face off against Republican candidate Donald Trump.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[China's military was on "high alert" Thursday and Beijing said it had lodged a complaint with Tokyo after a Japanese warship sailed through the Taiwan Strait for the first time.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's military was on "high alert" Thursday and Beijing said it had lodged a complaint with Tokyo after a Japanese warship sailed through the Taiwan Strait for the first time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Japan's top government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi declined to comment on the reports at a regular briefing because they concerned military operations.</p>

<p>But Beijing confirmed its military had responded to "the activities of a Japanese Self-Defence Force ship entering the Taiwan Strait".</p>

<p>"China is highly vigilant about the political intentions of Japan's actions and has lodged stern representations with Japan," foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.</p>

<p>The United States and its allies are increasingly crossing through the 180-kilometre (112-mile) Taiwan Strait to reinforce its status as an international waterway, angering China.</p>

<p>The Sazanami destroyer made the unprecedented passage on Wednesday, several Japanese media outlets said.</p>

<p>Military vessels from New Zealand and Australia also sailed through the fiercely contested waterway on the same day, Wellington's defence ministry said on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A defence official told AFP that one of its ships made its first passage through the Taiwan Strait in seven years, alongside an Australian guided missile destroyer to assert the "right of freedom of navigation".</p>

<p>The official added the mission was not conducted with Japan. Japanese media said the three nations planned to conduct military drills in the contested South China Sea.</p>

<p>China's defence ministry also confirmed Thursday that vessels from the three countries "had a transit operation through the Taiwan Strait".</p>

<p>The Chinese military "stayed on high alert and monitored these passages", spokesman Zhang Xiaogang said.</p>

<p>"These operations will undermine China's sovereignty and security," he said.</p>

<p>"The (Chinese military) will remain on high alert and take all necessary measures to counter these threats and provocations," he added.</p>

<p><strong>'Threaten' China&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>In response to the "foreign warships transiting the Taiwan Strait", Beijing on Thursday said it "consistently handles such matters in accordance with laws and regulations".</p>

<p>The foreign ministry said it remained "highly vigilant against any actions that may threaten China's sovereignty and security".</p>

<p>Last week, China's Liaoning aircraft carrier sailed between two Japanese islands near Taiwan for the first time, accompanied by two destroyers.</p>

<p>The ships entered Japan's contiguous zone -- an area up to 24 nautical miles from the country's coast -- Tokyo said, calling the incident "totally unacceptable". China said it had complied with international law.</p>

<p>It followed the first confirmed incursion into Japanese airspace by a Chinese surveillance aircraft in August.</p>

<p>The Yomiuri Shimbun daily cited unnamed government sources as saying Prime Minister Fumio Kishida had ordered Wednesday's Taiwan Strait journey out of concern that doing nothing following China's intrusions could encourage Beijing to take more assertive actions.</p>

<p><strong>'Serious concern'</strong></p>

<p>Beijing, which says democratic Taiwan is part of its territory, claims jurisdiction over the body of water that separates the island from China.</p>

<p>But the United States and many other countries argue their voyages through the strait are routine, citing freedom of navigation.</p>

<p>China this month accused Berlin of heightening security risks in the Taiwan Strait, a day after two German navy ships sailed through the waters.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, China test-launched an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean in its first such exercise in decades.</p>

<p>Japan said it had not been given advance notice of the test, with Hayashi expressing "serious concern" about China's military build-up in comments he reiterated on Thursday.</p>

<p>"China's military intrusion into our territorial airspace and other incidents have been happening one after another in a short period of time," Hayashi said.</p>

<p>Japan will do its "utmost in patrolling and monitoring" the situation, he added.</p>

<p>Taiwan's defence ministry also said Thursday that 43 Chinese military aircraft and eight naval vessels were detected around the island within a 24-hour period.</p>

<p>Beijing has said it will never renounce the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in recent years upping the rhetoric of "unification" being "inevitable".</p>

<p>Bec Strating, professor of international relations at La Trobe University, said Japan's reported Taiwan Strait transit "is part of a broader pattern of greater naval presence by countries in and beyond Asia that are concerned about China's maritime assertions".</p>

<p>"Japan in particular has been dealing with China's 'grey zone' tactics in the East China Sea," including an increasing number of coast guard vessels sailing close to disputed islands, she told AFP.</p>

<p>Grey-zone tactics are actions that serve to exhaust a country's armed forces, military experts say.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man was put to death by lethal injection Thursday in the US state of Oklahoma, officials said, while Alabama was scheduled to carry out an execution with nitrogen gas, the second such execution in the country.</p>

<p>If the Alabama death sentence is carried out, it will bring the total number of executions this year in the United States to 18, including five in the past week.</p>

<p>Emmanuel Littlejohn, 52, was executed by lethal injection in Oklahoma for the murder of 31-year-old Kenneth Meers during a convenience store robbery in 1992.</p>

<p>While admitting he was present at the scene, he has always denied being the one who shot Meers.</p>

<p>Both he and his accomplice Glenn Bethany blamed each other for the killing.</p>

<p>The two men were convicted of murder, but Bethany received life imprisonment, whereas Littlejohn was sentenced to death.</p>

<p>In August, the State Board of Pardons recommended a commutation of Littlejohn's sentence, despite opposition from some of the victim's family.</p>

<p>Speaking on Wednesday to NPR, Littlejohn exhorted Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt to intervene.</p>

<p>"Governor, don't kill me for the heck of it," Littlejohn said.</p>

<p>Stitt, a Republican who had only exercised his clemency power once, ultimately denied the request.</p>

<p>Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond said Thursday that "justice has been served for the murder of Kenny Meers."</p>

<h3><strong>Nitrogen gas controversy&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Meanwhile, in Alabama, Alan Miller is scheduled to be put to death over a 1999 workplace shooting spree that killed three colleagues, Lee Holdbrooks, Scott Yancy and Terry Lee Jarvis.</p>

<p>Miller, 59, is to be executed at Atmore penitentiary by pumping nitrogen gas into a facemask, causing him to suffocate.</p>

<p>The method was controversially used by Alabama for the first time in January, despite being compared by the UN to a form of torture.</p>

<p>During that execution, 58-year-old Kenneth Smith reportedly thrashed about for several minutes.</p>

<p>State officials later attributed the convulsions to Smith attempting to hold his breath.</p>

<p>The White House, under Democratic President Joe Biden, said it was "deeply troubled" by Alabama's use of nitrogen in January.</p>

<p>It also drew rebukes from civil liberties groups, the European Union and the UN human rights office.</p>

<p>Alabama Governor Kay Ivey, a Republican, has announced in advance that she would not exercise her clemency power for Miller.</p>

<p>A previous attempt to execute Miller by lethal injection in September 2022 was called off at the last minute, due to difficulties inserting the intravenous tube and administering the lethal chemicals in the allotted time.</p>

<p>The death penalty has been abolished in 23 of the 50 US states. Six others (Arizona, California, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Tennessee) observe a moratorium on executions by decision of the governor.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's newest nuclear-powered attack submarine sank earlier this year, a senior US defence official said on Thursday, a potential embarrassment for Beijing as it seeks to expand its military capabilities.</p>

<p>China already has the largest navy in the world, with over 370 ships, and it has embarked on production of a new generation of nuclear-armed submarines.</p>

<p>A senior US defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said China's new first-in-class nuclear-powered attack submarine sank alongside a pier sometime between May and June.</p>

<p>A Chinese embassy spokesperson in Washington said they had no information to provide.</p>

<p>"We are not familiar with the situation you mentioned and currently have no information to provide," the Chinese official said.</p>

<p>The official said it was not clear what caused it to sink or whether it had nuclear fuel on board at the time.</p>

<p>"In addition to the obvious questions about training standards and equipment quality, the incident raises deeper questions about the PLA's internal accountability and oversight of China's defence industry - which has long been plagued by corruption," the official said, using an acronym for the People's Liberation Army.</p>

<p>"It's not surprising that the PLA Navy would try to conceal" the sinking, the official added.</p>

<p>Speaking in Taipei on Friday, Taiwan Defence Minister Wellington Koo said authorities "have a grasp of the situation through multiple intelligence and surveillance methods", but did not elaborate.</p>

<p>Taiwan, which China views as its own territory, keeps a close watch on the latter's military activities. In June, pictures appeared online of a Chinese nuclear submarine surfacing in the Taiwan Strait near Taiwan fishermen.</p>

<p>The Chinese submarine news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.</p>

<p>A series of satellite images from Planet Labs from June appear to show cranes at the Wuchang shipyard, where the submarine would have been docked.</p>

<p>As of 2022, China had six nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, six nuclear-powered attack submarines and 48 diesel-powered attack submarines, according to a Pentagon report on China's military. That submarine force is expected to grow to 65 by 2025 and 80 by 2035, the U.S. Defense Department has said.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, China said it had successfully conducted a rare launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean, a move likely to raise international concerns about the country's nuclear buildup.</p>

<p>The United States and China held theater-level commander talks for the first time earlier this month, amid efforts to stabilize military ties and avoid misunderstandings, especially in regional hot spots such as the South China Sea.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[These cells can transform into endothelial cells and macrophages, aiding in blood vessel growth and tissue repair, particularly when triggered by injury or poor blood flow.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, life exists in the form of cells, which are pockets that contain DNA, RNA, proteins, and other substances. However, when life first appeared over four billion years ago, cells were simpler. Researchers in Australia discovered a completely new form of cell that fills a significant gap in our understanding of how the mammal body recovers.</p>

<p>For almost a century, scientists hypothesised that such a cell existed-and now, an adult version has been discovered, hidden in the aorta of adult mice.</p>

<p>The finding was nine years in the making. The cells have been called <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-51637-7">'EndoMac progenitors',</a> and the researchers are now looking for similar players in the human body.</p>

<p>"The EndoMac progenitor cells possess the unique ability to transform into two specific cell types of cells: endothelial cells that form blood vessels and macrophages that are immune cells responsible for tissue repair and defence," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/world-first-discovery-of-new-cell-type">said Dr Sanuri Liyange</a>, a researcher at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute and the University of Adelaide.</p>

<p>"These cells have an important job: to help grow blood vessels when the body calls for it."</p>

<p>"They are activated by injury or poor blood flow, at which point they rapidly expand to aid in healing," Dr Liyanage said.</p>

<p>As per a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/world-first-discovery-of-new-cell-type"><em>release,</em></a> cells with similar functions have been theorised to exist for more than a century; however, until now, they had never been found. They were discovered in the outer layer of aortas in adult mice.</p>

<p>This discovery, led by SAHMRI's Professor Peter Psaltis, was nine years in the making, with the findings published in Nature Communications.</p>

<p>Ongoing research suggests the EndoMac progenitors could be used to boost healing in conditions like diabetes, where the body struggles to repair itself properly. Crucially, these cells don't express typical "self" markers, meaning they could be ideal candidates for stem cell transplantation as they're much less likely to be attacked by the recipient's immune system.</p>

<p>Dr Liyange and colleagues have isolated the cells from mice, grown them, and observed them forming colonies. These colonies have been tested in diabetic mouse models, showing remarkable improvements in wounds that normally wouldn't heal.</p>

<p>"When we transplanted these progenitors into diabetic wounds, we saw a dramatic improvement in healing within days, she said.</p>

<p>"In theory, this could become a game-changer for patients suffering from chronic wounds."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Olivia Nuzzi recently admitted to her editors that she was engaged in a relationship with former US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr allegedly grabbed the hand of New York magazine reporter Olivia Nuzzi during an interview last year, according to a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/olivia-nuzzi-rfk-jr-fallout" rel="nofollow,noindex">Vanity Fair</a>. The incident, described as “creepy” by a fellow journalist, reportedly took place while Kennedy, 70, and Nuzzi, 31, were on a hike during an interview for a November 2023 profile in New York Magazine.</p>

<p>Multiple sources also told Vanity Fair that Kennedy initiated the hand-grab before the two allegedly engaged in a sexting exchange. Nuzzi reportedly shared details of the encounter with a colleague who also experienced a similar interaction with Kennedy.<br />
<br />
Nuzzi has declined to comment on the matter, and the Kennedy scion has yet to react. However, the incident raises doubts about Kennedy's previous claims that Nuzzi was the aggressor in their alleged online romance. Kennedy suggested that Nuzzi “bombarded” him with explicit photos over several months and was reportedly considering legal action against her.<br />
<br />
A source close to Kennedy's camp told the New York Post that Nuzzi became “obsessed” with Kennedy Jr after interviewing him in California and pursued him persistently via text.<br />
<br />
According to Jessica Reed Kraus, a mutual acquaintance, Kennedy attempted to block Nuzzi's number multiple times but would occasionally unblock her due to what Nuzzi described as “urgent discussions about an imminent hit piece.”<br />
<br />
The pair allegedly began communicating after the publication of Nuzzi's profile on Kennedy in New York Magazine. The magazine has since placed Nuzzi on leave and issued an apology after becoming aware of their relationship.<br />
<br />
Despite Nuzzi's insistence that “the relationship was never physical,” Kennedy's team maintains they only met once, during the interview. Kennedy has since hired security expert Gavin de Becker to investigate the situation, with the possibility of civil or criminal legal action on the horizon.<br />
<br />
“This had nothing to do with romance. He was being chased by porn,” de Becker was quoted as saying by The New York Post.<br />
<br />
A source told The New York Post that Nuzzi was the aggressor, although both parties were reportedly aware of the high-stakes nature of the situation, leading to sporadic communication.<br />
<br />
Kennedy, who recently dropped his independent presidential run and endorsed former President Donald Trump, is married to actress Cheryl Hines. He was wearing his wedding ring during a recent interview, but Hines has been spotted in public without hers.</p>

<p>Nuzzi's engagement to political reporter Ryan Lizza was also called off after details of her alleged sexting with Kennedy surfaced.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"What have you done?" A mother's haunting question pierced the air after she discovered a human foot near their family van in Texas, US. Richard Ranner Ozment, 36, was arrested after allegedly attacking and killing 38-year-old Michaela Brooker with a machete-like weapon following a suspected domestic disturbance, Texas local media KWTX reported.</p>

<p>The incident took place on Saturday, September 21, around 9 am when deputies from the McLennan County Sheriff's Office responded to a call from a residence on Old China Spring Road. According to the sheriff's affidavit, Ozment's mother told deputies she walked outside her home and saw her son sweating profusely. When she tried to move past him, she stumbled upon Ms Brooker's severely injured body.</p>

<p>Ozment allegedly blocked his mother's path but, after being confronted, claimed that Ms Brooker had "tried to stab [him]," according to the sheriff's affidavit.</p>

<p>Panicked, the mother rushed inside while Ozment's father called 911. First responders arrived quickly, but Ozment fled the scene. China Spring firefighters were the first to spot him running away, but authorities couldn't locate him until 10 hours later when he was found hiding in a stock tank not far from the property.</p>

<p>Emergency responders treated Ms Brooker for severe injuries, particularly to her head, but she was later airlifted to a hospital, where she succumbed to her wounds.</p>

<p>Ozment, arrested, is now facing murder charges, with a $1 million bond.</p>

<p>McLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara was outraged over the killing, calling it "one of the most horrific, brutal, and senseless attacks that we have seen in a long time."</p>

<p>Richard Ozment has a lengthy criminal record dating back to his teens. At 16, he was convicted of aggravated sexual assault. Over the years, he faced various charges, including terroristic threats, failing to register as a sex offender and burglary. Ozment was paroled after serving only 10 years, despite a 40-year prison sentence for past crimes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This never should have happened," Sheriff McNamara said. "He never should have gotten out, but he did."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The "extremely dangerous" Hurricane Helene made landfall in the US state of Florida on Thursday, with officials warning of "unsurvivable" conditions and a potentially catastrophic storm surge high enough to swamp a two-story house.</p>

<p>More than a million people were without power and roads were already flooded ahead of what is expected to be one of the largest Gulf of Mexico storms in decades.</p>

<p>Fast-moving Helene strengthened to an "extremely dangerous" Category 4 hurricane Thursday, with the eye hitting near the town of Perry at approximately 11:10 pm local time (0310 GMT Friday), the US National Hurricane Center said.</p>

<p>It was packing winds of 140 miles (225 kilometres) per hour as it passed over the Gulf's warm waters and began hitting the Big Bend area south of Tallahassee.</p>

<p>"EVERYONE along the Florida Big Bend coast is at risk of potentially catastrophic storm surge," the NHC said on social media.</p>

<p>Tampa and Tallahassee airports have closed, with parts of St Petersburg, downtown Tampa, Sarasota, Treasure Island and other cities on Florida's west coast already flooded.</p>

<p>About 1,036,553 homes and businesses were without power, according to tracking site PowerOutage.us.</p>

<p>"We're expecting to see a storm surge inundation of 15 to 20 feet above ground level," NHC director Mike Brennan said. "That's up to the top of a second-story building. Again, a really unsurvivable scenario is going to play out here in this portion of the Florida coastline."</p>

<p>The accompanying waves "can destroy houses, move cars, and that water level is going to rise very quickly," Brennan added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden urged people to heed official evacuation warnings.</p>

<p>"I urge everyone in and near the path of Helene to listen to local officials and follow evacuation warnings," he said. "Take this seriously, and be safe."</p>

<h3><strong>'I'm stuck with them'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Authorities in Florida's Taylor County asked residents who did not act on mandatory evacuation warnings to write their names on their bodies with permanent marker, to aid in identification if they are killed.</p>

<p>In Alligator Point, a coastal town on a picturesque peninsula in the storm's path, David Wesolowski was taking no chances.</p>

<p>"I just came to button up a few things before it gets too windy," the 37-year-old real estate agent told AFP as he boarded up his house on stilts.</p>

<p>"If it stays on course, this is going to look different afterwards, that's for sure," he said.</p>

<p>Patrick Riickert refused to budge from his small wooden house in Crawfordville, a town of 5,000 people a few miles inland.</p>

<p>Most residents have bolted, but Riickert, his wife and five grandchildren were "not going anywhere," the 58-year-old insisted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I am going to hunker down" and ride out the hurricane, as he did in 2018 when deadly Hurricane Michael, a Category 5 mega-storm, blew through the Florida panhandle.</p>

<p>At a gas station in Panacea, John Luper said he was reluctantly staying put because his mother and brother refused to flee to higher ground.</p>

<p>"They're not going to leave," he said, filling jerry cans with fuel. "I'm stuck with them."</p>

<p>The NHC warned of up to 20 inches (51 cm) of rain in some spots and potentially life-threatening flooding, as well as numerous landslides across the southern Appalachians.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The National Weather Service said the region could be hit extremely hard, with floods not seen in more than a century.</p>

<p>"This will be one of the most significant weather events to happen in the western portions of the area in the modern era," it warned.</p>

<p>Tornado warnings went out across northern Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas.</p>

<p>More than 55 million Americans were under some form of weather alert or warning from Hurricane Helene.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Multi-state event'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"This is going to be a multi-state event with the potential for significant impacts from Florida all the way to Tennessee," Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator Deanne Criswell told reporters.</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris said the White House was watching.</p>

<p>"The President and I, of course, are monitoring the case and the situation closely, and we urge everyone who is watching at this very moment to take this storm very seriously," she told reporters.</p>

<p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis mobilized the National Guard and ordered thousands of personnel to be ready for search-and-rescue operations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He warned that the powerful storm would be dangerous and urged everyone to take precautions.</p>

<p>"We can't control how strong this hurricane is going to get. We can't control the track of the hurricane, but what you can control is what you can do to put yourself in the best chance to be able to ride this out in a way that's going to be safe," DeSantis said.</p>

<p>Helene could become the most powerful hurricane to hit the United States in over a year -- and almost certainly the biggest, at nearly 500 miles across.</p>

<p>Scientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of hurricanes because there is more energy in warmer oceans for them to feed on.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For nearly four years, the United States has been experiencing its worst border crisis in the history of the world, Republican presidential candidate and former president Donald Trump said.</p>

<p>The remarks by Trump on Thursday came on the eve of his Democratic rival Vice President Kamala Harris's visit to the US-Mexico border down South on Friday.</p>

<p>"For nearly four years, we have been living through the worst border crisis in the history of the world. There's never been anything like it, which has brought untold suffering, misery, and death upon our land. The architect of this destruction is Kamala Harris," Trump told reporters at a news conference in New York.</p>

<p>"When you look at the four years that have taken place after being named border czar, Kamala Harris tomorrow (Friday) will be visiting the southern border that she has completely destroyed. Why would she go to the border now, playing right into the hand of her opponent. There can be no justification for what she's done. Nobody is saying, oh, gee, she's done a fabulous job. She's done the worst job probably in the history of any border, not just our border. She keeps talking about how she supposedly wants to fix the border," Trump said.</p>

<p>"We would merely ask, why didn't she do it four years ago? She's got no plans, got no talent, got no ability to do it. I'm here today to present you with the facts and only the facts about how comrade Kamala Harris willfully threw open our border, helping to virtually destroy our country. Our country has never been under siege like this," Trump said.</p>

<p>Four years ago, he said, Harris inherited the most secure border in US history with the lowest illegal immigration on record.</p>

<p>"Those who violated our borders were captured, detained, and quickly sent back home under the Trump administration," he said.</p>

<p>"But on her first day in office, Kamala Harris terminated every single Trump policy that sealed and secured the border. She ordered an immediate stop to the completion of the border wall. It was almost complete. We built hundreds and hundreds of miles of wall, and it worked. She suspended all deportations. She instituted catch and release across the entire southern border," Trump alleged.</p>

<p>"She sent Congress a bill demanding amnesty for all illegal aliens, every single illegal alien, even if they're criminals, murderers, drug dealers, human traffickers. She wanted amnesty for everybody. This is a radical left person," he said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at an election rally in Pennsylvania, Harris told her supporters that Trump was an unserious man.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump has a very different plan based on a very different vision of who we are and the needs of the American people. I've said this before and I'll say it again. In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man. The consequences of putting him back in the White House are extremely serious," she said.</p>

<p>"Look, for example, at Project 2025, a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if elected president again. He intends to cut social security and Medicare; repeal our climate investments and send thousands of good-paying clean energy jobs overseas; and he wants to impose what I call a Trump sales tax, a 20 per cent tax on everyday necessities, which will cost the average American family an additional USD 4,000 a year," Harris said.</p>

<p>Trump is headed to Michigan on Friday to speak on manufacturing.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump is one of the biggest losers of manufacturing in American history. He makes empty promises after empty promises to American workers but never delivers. As President, he cut taxes for corporations, encouraged outsourcing, and lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs, including auto jobs. He has joked about firing workers, supported state anti-union laws, and suggested companies move jobs out of Michigan," Harris alleged on Thursday night.</p>

<p>"Enough is enough. American workers deserve a leader who keeps their promises and stands with workers when it matters, and as President, I will bring autoworker jobs back to this country and create an economy that strengthens manufacturing and unions and builds prosperity and security for America's future. I will always stand with the UAW. Trusting Donald Trump again is a risk America's autoworkers cannot afford," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The discovery has excited historians, as it offers insights into past excavation methods and the history of the area. The bottle, typically used for smelling salts, has been described as a rare archaeological "time capsule."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of student volunteers working on an archaeological site in France recently made an incredible discovery. While excavating the remains of a Gaulish town, they unearthed a little glass bottle hidden inside an earthenware pot, according to <em>the BBC.</em></p>

<p>The bottle, which had been hidden for nearly 200 years, carried a note from a prior archaeologist who had worked at the same location. Guillaume Blondel, the chief of Eu's Regional Archaeology Service, was sent in to investigate the findings. Blondel opened the bottle and read the note.</p>

<p>The message reads: "PJ Feret, a native of Dieppe, member of various intellectual societies, carried out excavations here in January 1825. He continues his investigations in this vast area known as the Cite de Limes or Caesar's Camp."</p>

</div>

<p>PJ Feret was a local notable, and municipal records confirm that he conducted a first dig at the site 200 years ago.</p>

<p>Archaeologists and historians are both excited and fascinated by the discovery. The message could provide insight into the history of the Gaulish village as well as the archaeological procedures used in the early nineteenth century.</p>

<p>"It was the kind of vial that women used to wear around their necks containing smelling salts," team leader Guillaume Blondel, who heads the archaeological service for the town of Eu, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yj7kg3zd1o"><em>BBC News.</em></a></p>

<p>"It was an absolutely magical moment," said Mr Blondel. "We knew there had been excavations here in the past, but to find this message from 200 years ago... it was a total surprise.</p>

<p>"Sometimes you see these time capsules left behind by carpenters when they build houses. But it's very rare in archaeology. Most archaeologists prefer to think that there won't be anyone coming after them because they've done all the work."&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday backed India's bid for a permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), days after US President Joe Biden and France's Emmanuel Macron made a similar pitch. Addressing the general debate of the United Nations General Assembly's seventy-ninth session in New York, Mr Starmer said the UNSC has to change to become a "more representative body".</p>

<p>At present, the UNSC comprises five permanent members and 10 non-permanent member countries which are elected for a two-year term by the General Assembly of the United Nations. The five permanent members are Russia, the UK, China, France, and the United States, which have the power to veto any substantive resolution.</p>

<p>"We want to see permanent African representation on the Council, Brazil, India, Japan, and Germany as permanent members, and more seats for elected members as well," Mr Starmer said.</p>

<p>Earlier on Wednesday, French President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/french-president-emmanuel-macron-backs-india-for-permanent-un-security-council-membership-6655596" target="_blank">Emmanuel Macron</a> had also voiced strong support for India's inclusion as a permanent member of the UNSC.</p>

<p>"As long as we have a Security Council that is blocked, I would say, reciprocally according to the interests of each party, we will have difficulty moving forward. So let's just make these United Nations more effective, first by perhaps making them more representative. That is why France, and I repeat here, is in favor of the Security Council being expanded," he told the UN General Assembly.</p>

<p>"Germany, Japan, India, and Brazil should be permanent members, as well as two countries that Africa will decide to represent it," he added.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris has taken the lead over her Republican presidential rival Donald Trump in several key battleground states like Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania, according to various polls released here.</p>

<p>Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, enjoys a slight lead over former president Trump in Michigan, as per the latest poll released by UMass Lowell's Center for Public Opinion and YouGov. Harris is slightly leading 48 per cent to 43 per cent in the Great Lakes State against Trump, it said.</p>

<p>"For a swing state, this margin is good news for the vice president's campaign," Rodrigo Castro Cornejo, UMass Lowell political science assistant professor and Center for Public Opinion associate director, said.</p>

<p>If Trump wants to beat this margin, he has an uphill battle to fight in the Great Lakes State. "The Trump campaign," Castro Cornejo said, "has a negative favorability in Michigan that needs to be overcome if they want to remain competitive in the state." Harris stands at 48 per cent against Trump's 46 per cent in Pennsylvania, the UMass Lowell's Center for Public Opinion said.</p>

<p>"The presidential race remains very close in Pennsylvania with the coming weeks a crucial time for both campaigns," Cornejo said.</p>

<p>"As can be expected in a highly competitive race with few undecided voters, get-out-the-vote strategies will become increasingly important to mobilise supporters and ensure they go to the polls on Election Day," he said.</p>

<p>According to a new poll from Fox News, Harris has a slight lead over Trump in Georgia but trails behind in Arizona.</p>

<p>In Georgia, Harris has 51 per cent of votes against Trump's 48 per cent, the poll said. However, in Arizona, as per the Fox News poll, Trump leads Harris by a similar margin. He has the support of 51 per cent against Harris' 48 per cent.</p>

<p>According to Real Clear Politics, which tracks all major polls, Trump trails Harris by two percentage points nationally, while in the battleground states, it is a statistical tie. Harris leads Trump by 0.3 percentage points in battleground states, it said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

	<li class="CetSht_li">According to reports, Srur, born in 1973, was among a number of top advisers sent by Hezbollah to Yemen to train the country's Huthi rebels.</li>

	<li class="CetSht_li">"We will speak in actions, not words," he wrote on X. "Let no one be confused: we will not stop hitting Hezbollah until we return our residents safely to their homes," he said in another post.</li>

       <description><![CDATA[Elon Musk's X told Brazil's Supreme Court it has complied with orders to stop the spread of misinformation and asked a judge to lift a ban on the platform, in a major retreat by the billionaire battling "censorship".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's X told Brazil's Supreme Court it has complied with orders to stop the spread of misinformation and asked a judge to lift a ban on the platform, according to a document seen by Reuters, in a major retreat by the billionaire battling "censorship".</p>

<p>A decision from the court on X's return is still pending, but people close to Musk in Brazil believe service could be restored in a matter of days.</p>

<p>The request to resume activities in Brazil, one of X's largest and most coveted markets, followed a series of conciliatory moves by the social media platform signalling a dramatic backdown in Musk's months-long feud with Justice Alexandre de Moraes.</p>

<p>The judge, who has spearheaded a local crusade against perceived attacks on democracy and the political use of disinformation, had shut down Brazilians' access to the platform formerly known as Twitter in late August.</p>

<p>The draconian move followed Musk's decision to shutter X's offices in Brazil as he resisted complying with Moraes' orders.</p>

<p>The judicial battle eventually affected another prominent business controlled by Musk, satellite Internet provider Starlink, whose accounts Moraes froze in a move leading Musk to brand him a "dictator."</p>

<p>The Brazil spat was just one of a series of recent face-offs between Musk, who views himself as a champion of free speech, and governments including Australia and the UK seeking to prevent the spread of online misinformation.</p>

<p>Brazil was X's sixth-biggest market globally, with about 21.5 million users.</p>

<p>"Musk was afraid to lose market share, he also realized that this was a nonsense battle and that Brazilians were not turning their backs on Justice Alexandre de Moraes as he had expected," said Thiago de Aragao, a senior researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</p>

<p>In a final attempt at circumventing Moraes' ban, X used cloud services offered by third parties, allowing Brazilians to access its platform in spite of the prohibition, but the attempt was short-lived, especially after Moraes threatened to impose heavy fines on the company.</p>

<p>Late last week, X moved in a more conciliatory direction, appointing a local legal representative as Moraes had demanded.</p>

<p>In the document sent to the Brazilian Supreme Court, the company controlled by Musk said it had blocked nine accounts under investigation in a hate speech and misinformation probe.</p>

<p>"His backtracking is very positive. Whether one agrees with it or not, the law is to be respected not defied," Rubens Barbosa, a former Brazilian ambassador to the United States, told Reuters.</p>

<p>According to two people familiar with Musk´s thinking, the billionaire will take a very different approach once X comes back to Brazil, adding he may still be combative but will likely try to respect the law. "From now on, he will fight in the courts," one of the people said.</p>

<p>X did not reply to a request for comment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

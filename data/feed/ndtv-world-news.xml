       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The European Union on Friday imposed asset freezes and visa bans on several firms and individuals accused of helping to finance Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, Brussels said.</p>

<p>The sanctions were the second round to be imposed by the EU on the Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad groups after their attack on Israel on October 7.</p>

<p>Overall the bloc has so far blacklisted 12 individuals and three entities linked to the operatives.</p>

<p>Among the latest targets were three front companies used by key financier Hamza Abdelbasit to funnel funds to the group, including Spanish real estate firm Al Zawaya Group, and two others based in Sudan, an EU statement said.</p>

<p>Also hit were the head of Hamas' "foreign investment activities", a money changer enabling transfers from backer Iran and the official in charge of the groups "Charitable Institutions Association", it said.</p>

<p>The EU said in addition it was imposing sanctions on Ali Morshed Shirazi, a senior Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp official overseeing Tehran's links to Palestinian groups from Lebanon.</p>

<p>Top Hamas official Maher Rebhi Obeid "responsible for directing Hamas' terrorist operatives in the West Bank" was also put on the list.</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The operatives also seized hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza although the army says 42 are dead.</p>

<p>In response Israel unleashed a devastating military campaign in Hamas' stronghold Gaza that has killed at least 37,765 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.</p>

<p>EU diplomats said that following the latest sanctions on Hamas the bloc should now impose a second round of measures targeting violent Israeli extremists in the West Bank.</p>

<p>The 27-nation EU -- which has struggled for a united position on the Gaza war -- in April imposed sanctions on four "extremist" Israeli settlers and two groups over violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A temporary US aid pier has again been removed from the Gaza coast due to high seas and will be towed to an Israeli port, the Pentagon said on Friday.</p>

<p>It is the third time the pier has been detached from the shore because of weather conditions since its initial installation in mid-May, and the effort is also facing difficulties with distribution of assistance once it reaches Gaza.</p>

<p>"Due to high sea states expected this weekend, Central Command has removed the temporary pier from its anchored position in Gaza and will tow it back to Ashdod, Israel," Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told journalists, referring to the military command responsible for the Middle East.</p>

<p>She said she does not have a date for the pier's reinstallation, and that "the commander will continue to assess the sea states over the weekend."</p>

<p>The pier was first anchored to the Gaza coast in mid-May, but was damaged by bad weather later in the month and had to be removed for repairs.</p>

<p>It was then reattached on June 7, but was moved to Ashdod on June 14 to protect it from anticipated high seas -- a situation that is now being repeated.</p>

<p>When the pier has been operational, it has been used to deliver a large amount of aid to the shore.</p>

<p>"Since May 17, Central Command has assisted in the delivery of more than 8,831 metric tons, or approximately 19.4 million pounds, of humanitarian aid to the shore for onward distribution by humanitarian organizations," Singh said.</p>

<p>But distribution has been a problem, with the UN World Food Program suspending its deliveries of assistance that arrive via the pier earlier this month to assess the security situation.</p>

<p>The move came after Israel conducted a military operation nearby that freed four hostages, but which Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry said killed more than 270 Palestinians.</p>

<p>As a result, aid is piling up in the marshalling yard where it is delivered onshore.</p>

<p>"There's still some room there, but it's, I would say majority is pretty full right now," Singh said.</p>

<p>Gaza is suffering through a war which broke out after Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The operatives also seized hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza although the army says 42 are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,765 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Gaza.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Russia should resume production of intermediate and shorter-range nuclear-capable missiles and then consider where to deploy them after the United States brought similar missiles to Europe and Asia.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Russia should resume production of intermediate and shorter-range nuclear-capable missiles and then consider where to deploy them after the United States brought similar missiles to Europe and Asia.</p>

<p>Putin's move finally kills off all that remains from one of the most significant arms controls treaties of the Cold War amid fears that the world's two biggest nuclear powers could be entering a new arms race together with China.</p>

<p>The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, signed by Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan in 1987, marked the first time the superpowers had agreed to reduce their nuclear arsenals and eliminated a whole category of nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>The United States under former President Donald Trump formally withdrew from the INF Treaty in 2019 after saying that Moscow was violating the accord, an accusation the Kremlin repeatedly denied and dismissed as a pretext.</p>

<p>Russia then imposed a moratorium on its own development of missiles previously banned by the INF treaty - ground-based ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of 500 km to 5,500 km.</p>

<p>Putin said Russia had pledged not to deploy such missiles but that the United States had resumed their production, brought them to Denmark for exercises and also taken them to the Philippines.</p>

<p>"We need to respond to this and make decisions about what we will have to do in this direction next," Putin was shown on state television telling Russia's Security Council.</p>

<p>"Apparently, we need to start manufacturing these strike systems and then, based on the actual situation, make decisions about where - if necessary to ensure our safety - to place them," he said.</p>

<p><strong>DISINTEGRATION</strong></p>

<p>Russia and the United States, by far the biggest nuclear powers, have both expressed regret about the disintegration of the tangle of arms control treaties which sought to slow the Cold War arms race and reduce the risk of nuclear war.</p>

<p>Trump in 2018 said he wanted to terminate the INF Treaty because of what he said were years of Russian violations and his concerns about China's intermediate-range missile arsenal.</p>

<p>Putin has said in the past that the U.S. withdrawal would trigger a new arms race.</p>

<p>The United States publicly blamed Russia's development of the 9M729 ground-launched cruise missile, known in NATO as the SSC-8, as the reason for it leaving the INF Treaty.</p>

<p>In his moratorium proposal, Putin suggested Russia could agree not to deploy the missiles in its Baltic coast exclave of Kaliningrad. Since leaving the pact, the United States has tested missiles with a similar profile.</p>

<p>Putin said earlier this month he could deploy conventional missiles within striking distance of the United States and its European allies if they allowed Ukraine to strike deeper into Russia with long-range Western weapons.</p>

<p>In his comments on Friday, Putin gave no indication of where the missiles could be deployed.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Friday condemned the negligence in the treatment of Satnam Singh, an Indian worker who died in north Italy, stating that his employer, responsible for his medical care, has been arrested.</p>

<p>MEA official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal called for humane treatment of workers, adding that all possible assistance was being provided to the family of Satnam Singh.</p>

<p>"His employer who was supposed to provide him medical care has been arrested and the investigation goes on. We condemn such treatment. We call for the human treatment of workers. We are providing all possible assistance to his family," said Jaiswal during a weekly briefing.</p>

<p>India has also raised this issue with Italy and has called for prompt action against those responsible for his demise.</p>

<p>The secretary (Consular Passport and Visa Division and Overseas Indian Affairs) in the Ministry of External Affairs, Muktesh Pardeshi raised the matter with Luigi Maria Vignali, Director General for Migratory Policies and Italians Abroad, Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>Muktesh Pardeshi further said that the Indian Embassy in Italy is in contact with the family of Satnam Singh for consular help and transportation of body to India.</p>

<p>"@SecretaryCPVOIA Muktesh Pardeshi conveyed to @LuigiVignali Italian DG our deep concern about death of Satnam Singh &amp; called for prompt action against those responsible. Embassy is in contact with family of Satnam Singh for consular help &amp;transportation of mortal remains @MEAIndia," the Indian embassy in Italy posted on X on June 26.</p>

<p>Indian national Satnam Singh lost his life after being abandoned on the street following an accident, according to the Flai CGIL trade union.</p>

<p>The accident, which resulted in the severing of his arm, happened while he was working at the farm.</p>

<p>According to the Flai CGIL trade union, instead of receiving help from the employer, "Singh was dumped like a bag of rubbish near his home."</p>

<p>Earlier last week, the Embassy said that it is in contact with local authorities and that efforts are being made to contact the family and provide consular assistance.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Europe's weather satellite operator has cancelled plans to use the European rocket Ariane 6 less than two weeks before its first-ever launch, opting to go with US firm SpaceX instead, the French newspaper Le Monde has reported.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Europe's weather satellite operator has cancelled plans to use the European rocket Ariane 6 less than two weeks before its first-ever launch, opting to go with US firm SpaceX instead, the French newspaper Le Monde has reported.</p>

<p>The latest blow to European space efforts comes after four years of delays to the Ariane 6, which is scheduled to finally blast off for the first time on July 9.</p>

<p>Contacted by AFP on Friday, the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) could not immediately be reached, while the French company Arianespace, which developed and operates the Ariane 6 rocket, did not comment.</p>

<p>According to the Le Monde report, EUMETSAT's executive committee asked the board of directors representing the organisation's 30 member states to launch the MTG-S1 weather satellite on SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket.</p>

<p>That would mean cancelling the contract EUMETSAT signed with Arianespace four years ago.</p>

<p>The MTG-S1 satellite had been planned to be the third launch on an Ariane 6 rocket, scheduled to blast off sometime early next year.</p>

<p>The Le Monde report did not specify exactly why EUMETSAT ditched the European rocket for US billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX.</p>

<p>The CEO of France's CNES space agency Philippe Baptiste said it was "quite a brutal change as the flight was supposed to take place very soon."</p>

<p>"Clearly, today is a very disappointing day for European space efforts," he wrote in a LinkedIn post.</p>

<p>"I am impatiently waiting to understand what reasons could have led EUMETSAT to such a decision, at a time where all major European space countries as well as the European Commission are calling for launching European satellites on European launchers!</p>

<p>"How far will we, Europeans, go in our naivety?"</p>

<p>Baptiste called on the European Commission to "take the necessary measures so that all European institutional satellites are launched on small and large European launchers."</p>

<p>Ariane 6's long-awaited inaugural flight comes at a difficult time for European space efforts.</p>

<p>The years of Ariane 6 delays, setbacks for the lighter Vega-C launcher and Russia's withdrawal of its Soyuz rockets has left Europe without an independent way to blast its missions into space.</p>

<p>Before the latest setback, Ariane 6 rockets had an order book of 30 missions, and planned to launch nine times a year.</p>

<p>SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket -- which is reusable, unlike Ariane 6 -- is planning 144 launches this year alone.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The head of France's top cinema institution, Dominique Boutonnat, was on Friday given a three-year prison sentence, including two years suspended, after being convicted of sexually assaulting his godson in 2020.</p>

<p>In a statement released immediately after the ruling, Boutonnat announced he was stepping down as head of the National Centre of Cinema (CNC), whose role includes overseeing measures to curb sexual violence in the industry.</p>

<p>He will be able to serve his one-year jail term at home wearing an electronic bracelet, said the Nanterre criminal court outside Paris. Boutonnat, 54, was also banned from having any contact with the victim for three years.</p>

<p>In its verdict, the court ruled that the "plaintiff's version was more credible" than that of Boutonnat who, according to the court, always exercised "a real influence" over his godson.</p>

<p>In the statement released by the CNC, Boutonnat "reaffirmed his innocence" and said he would appeal.</p>

<p>Boutonnat's godson has accused him of trying to masturbate him during a holiday in Greece in 2020 when he was 19.</p>

<p>In court, the young man has described Boutonnat as "more than a godfather."</p>

<p>"It's someone using me to masturbate," he said.</p>

<p>Boutonnat denies any sexual assault has taken place. He has said in court that it was his godson who had initiated the situation and kissed him on the mouth.</p>

<p>"I feel bad about leaving an ambiguous situation, but to say there was a sexual assault is false," he has told the court.</p>

<p>He was placed under investigation in February 2021 but still reappointed by the government as head of the CNC in July 2022.</p>

<p>"This case is a perfect demonstration of what sexual assault is," said Caroline Toby, the victim's lawyer, adding that "the abuse of authority" had been recognised in court.</p>

<p>On June 14, the public prosecutor had requested a three-year suspended prison sentence for Boutonnat.</p>

<p>The trial came as French cinema reels from a renewed #MeToo reckoning that has seen several big names, including acting legend Gerard Depardieu, accused of sexual abuse.</p>

<p>Activists had denounced Boutonnat's leadership of the National Centre of Cinema (CNC).</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A German court on Friday sentenced a 15-year-old boy to four years in jail for planning an Islamist attack on a Christmas market in the western city of Leverkusen.</p>

<p>The teenager wanted to rent a truck and "kill as many people as possible" by ramming it into the traditional market, the court in Cologne said in a statement.</p>

<p>The boy had started to become "radicalised" in autumn 2023, the court said.</p>

<p>The evidence against him included a video in a chat group announcing his plans for an attack on "infidels" with a recognisable Islamist symbol in the background.</p>

<p>The boy had planned the attack along with another teenager who was supposed to film it and share the video, the court said.</p>

<p>The 16-year-old from Brandenburg, the state that surrounds Berlin, will stand trial in a different court from July.</p>

<p>The 15-year-old made a "comprehensive confession" during his trial, a court spokesman told AFP.</p>

<p>Islamist extremists have carried out several attacks in Germany in recent years, the deadliest being a truck rampage at a Berlin Christmas market in December 2016 that killed 12 people.</p>

<p>More recently, an Islamist motive is suspected in the killing of a police officer in a knife attack on the market square in the city of Mannheim in late May.</p>

<p>The number of people considered Islamist extremists in Germany fell slightly from 27,480 in 2022 to 27,200 last year, according to a report from the federal domestic intelligence agency.</p>

<p>However, in presenting the report, Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said Germany would be "continuing to step up the fight against Islamist terrorism".</p>

<p>In another case involving teenagers, two boys and two girls aged 15 to 16 were arrested at Easter this year on suspicion of planning an Islamist attack in the same region of western Germany.</p>

<p>Herbert Reul, interior minister of North Rhine-Westphalia state, said the young age of the suspects left him "speechless", adding that it posed a "huge challenge for society as a whole".</p>

<p>Germany's biggest-selling daily Bild reported that the four youths were allegedly planning to carry out Molotov cocktail and knife attacks in the name of the Islamic State group.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A prominent cardinal has asked Vatican authorities to stop displaying the artwork of a Jesuit priest accused of abusing nuns and other women, to avoid a suggestion of indifference to the victims' suffering.</p>

<p>Father Marko Ivan Rupnik, whose mosaics adorn about 200 churches and chapels around world as well as the Vatican, was expelled from the Jesuit order last year.</p>

<p>About 20 people, mostly former nuns, have accused him of various types of abuse, either when he was a spiritual director of a community of nuns in Slovenia about 30 years ago or after he moved to Rome to pursue his career as an artist.</p>

<p>He has not commented on the allegations, which the Jesuit Order said last year were "very highly" credible.</p>

<p>Five women who accused Rupnik of sexual and psychological violence had asked bishops around the world to remove his mosaics from churches to avoid offending the feelings of the faithful.</p>

<p>"Pastoral prudence would prevent displaying artwork in a way that could imply either exoneration or a subtle defence" of alleged perpetrators of abuse, the president of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Cardinal Sean O'Malley, said in a letter to Vatican officials.</p>

<p>"We must avoid sending a message that the Holy See is oblivious to the psychological distress that so many are suffering."</p>

<p>The letter dates from Wednesday but was published on Friday after the lawyer of some of Rupnik's alleged victims questioned the appropriateness of keeping his artworks in places of worship, causing possible disturb to the faithful.</p>

<p>The lawyer said in a letter addressed to more than 80 bishops from various dioceses that some women were abused during the creation of the mosaics, when posing as models or participating in the installation of the artworks.</p>

<p>The head of the Vatican's Dicastery for Communication, Paolo Ruffini, opposed the removal of the artist's works, considering that was not the right way to help the victims.</p>

<p>"I don't think we have to throw stones, thinking it is the way of healing someone," Ruffini said last week at a Catholic media conference, whose video footage was obtained by The Pillar. "The Christian faith is saying other things."</p>

<p>Still, some dioceses are considering the possible removal of the Jesuit priest's paintings, including Lourdes, where a mosaic by Father Rupnik adorns the facade of the Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary. A decision is expected shortly.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A 42-year-old man from Western Australia faces charges for allegedly setting up fake Wi-Fi networks at airports and on domestic flights across Perth, Melbourne, and Adelaide.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 42-year-old man from Western Australia has been charged by Australian police for allegedly setting up fraudulent Wi-Fi networks at airports and on domestic flights. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) claims that these fraudulent networks pretended to be real ones in order to obtain personal information from unwary tourists. The man was supposed to appear in court in Perth on Friday in relation to nine allegations related to cybercrime.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/incidents/man-charged-with-evil-twin-wifi-scam-at-airports-and-on-flights/news-story/a6143f56b0b060f34003bb6968e92588"><em>News Corp Australia</em></a>, police allege the man, 42, used a device in a number of locations, including airports in Perth, Melbourne, and Adelaide, and on domestic flights, to create "evil twin" copies of legitimate wi-fi networks.</p>

<p>When users tried to connect their devices to the networks, they were allegedly taken to a fake web page and required to sign in using their email or social media logins.</p>

<p>Those details were then allegedly saved to the man's devices and could be used to access more personal information, including a victim's online communications, stored images and videos, or bank details, police said.</p>

<p>The alleged scam was reported to police by an airline in April after its employees identified a suspicious wi-fi network during a domestic flight.</p>

<p>As per the news portal, AFP Western Command Cybercrime Detective Inspector Andrea Coleman said internet users should always be cautious when logging on to any public wi-fi networks.</p>

<p>"To connect to a free wi-fi network, you shouldn't have to enter any personal details - such as logging in through an email or social media account," she said.</p>

<p>Inspector Coleman said those using public hotspots should install a reputable VPN on their devices to encrypt and secure their data.</p>

<p>"When using a public network, disable file sharing, don't do anything sensitive - such as banking -while connected to it and once you finish using it, change your device settings to 'forget network'," she said.</p>

<p>"We also recommend turning off the wi-fi on your phone or other electronic devices before going out in public, to prevent your device from automatically connecting to a hotspot."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The conservative-majority US Supreme Court on Friday overturned 40 years of legal precedent to weaken the power of federal agencies, which regulate myriad issues affecting the everyday lives of Americans, from air pollution to food and drugs.</p>

<p>"Courts may not defer to an agency interpretation of the law simply because a statute is ambiguous," said the majority opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts.</p>

<p>At the heart of the matter is a 1984 ruling in Chevron v Natural Resources Defense Council, which said judges should defer to government agencies in determining a "reasonable" interpretation of the law if the language is ambiguous.</p>

<p>At the time, the case was a win for the administration of Republican president Ronald Reagan, who accused the country's progressive federal judges of burying corporate America under masses of unnecessary and restrictive red tape.</p>

<p>But the political right has since decried the ruling, saying it unfairly empowers the central government over the judiciary and means agencies can alter the meaning of statutes, depending on who is in charge.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Biden administration will expand deportation relief and work permits to an estimated 309,000 Haitians in the country already, the US Department of Homeland Security said on Friday.</p>

<p>The administration will expand access to the Temporary Protected Status program to Haitians through February 2026 due to violence and security issues in Haiti that limit access to safety, healthcare, food and water, the department said.</p>

<p>About 264,000 Haitians in the U.S. were already covered by the program, according to the U.S. government.</p>

<p>U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat seeking another term in Nov. 5 elections, has walked a political tightrope when it comes to immigration, trying to step up security at the U.S.-Mexico border while also taking a more humane approach to immigrants in the U.S. illegally.</p>

<p>In a presidential debate on Thursday, Biden's Republican challenger, former President Donald Trump, criticized Biden for failing to stem high levels of illegal immigration.</p>

<p>Gang wars in Haiti have displaced over half a million people and nearly five million are facing severe food insecurity. Armed groups, which now control most of the capital, have formed a broad alliance while carrying out widespread killings, ransom kidnappings and sexual violence.</p>

<p>Under the latest move, TPS will now be available to Haitians who were in the U.S. on or before June 3.</p>

<p>The TPS program offers deportation relief and work permits to people in the U.S. whose home countries face armed conflict, natural disasters and other extraordinary events. The designations last six to 18 months but frequently are renewed.</p>

<p>As president, Trump tried to end most TPS enrollment but was blocked in federal courts.</p>

<p>Thousands of Haitian migrants crossed the U.S.-Mexico border into Del Rio, Texas, in September 2021 as part of a rise in illegal crossings after Biden took office. In recent years, the number of Haitians caught crossing illegally has plummeted as many have used new legal pathways to the U.S.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India government bonds or government securities are set for inclusion in the global bond index from today.</p>

<p>JP Morgan will add Indian government bonds to its Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets (GBI-EM) from June 28. It is the first time ever that Indian government bonds would be included in this index.</p>

<p>Government securities inclusion in the global bond index will have a positive impact on the Indian economy.</p>

<p>Indian bonds will have a 10 per cent weightage in the JP Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index. The weightage of India's government bonds will be gradually increased in this index in a phased manner from June 28, 2024, to March 31, 2025, by one per cent each in the next 10 months.</p>

<p>JP Morgan announced the inclusion of Indian bonds in GBI-EM in September 2023, since then there has been an inflow of more than $10 billion into Indian bonds.</p>

<p>The move will enable foreign inflow to accelerate into Indian bonds. Demand for Indian government bonds will increase due to the inflow of foreign investment. This will increase the size of the Indian bond market. Besides, liquidity and efficiency will also increase.</p>

<p>Till now, only banks, insurance companies, and mutual funds have been major investors in government bonds. Now, a large number of global investors will be able to invest in Indian bonds. This will reduce the bond yield and will also reduce the cost of borrowing for the government which is expected to reduce the fiscal deficit.</p>

<p>Demand for the rupee will increase due to foreign inflow and hence it may remain strong in the coming months.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India and the US have decided to extend a 2 per cent equalisation levy or digital tax on e-commerce supplies until June 30, the finance ministry said on Friday.</p>

<p>In a major reform of the international tax system, India and the US have joined 134 other members of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework (including Austria, France, Italy, Spain, and the UK) in reaching an agreement on October 8, 2021, on the statement on a two-pillar solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy.</p>

<p>On October 21, 2021, the US and Austria, France, Italy, Spain, and the UK reached a political compromise on the transitional approach to the unilateral measures in force while Pillar 1 is implemented.</p>

<p>On November 24, 2021, India and the US agreed that the same terms that apply under the October 2021 Joint Statement shall apply between India and the US with respect to India's charge of 2 per cent equalisation levy on e-commerce supply of services and the US' trade action regarding the said Equalisation Levy.</p>

<p>The validity of this agreement was from April 1, 2022, till implementation of Pillar 1 or March 31, 2024, whichever is earlier.</p>

<p>On December 18, 2023, the Inclusive Framework issued a statement calling for a finalisation of the text of the Pillar 1 multilateral convention by the end of March 2024 with a view to holding a signing ceremony by the end of June 2024.</p>

<p>On February 15, 2024, the US and Austria, France, Italy, Spain, and the UK decided to extend the political compromise set forth in the October 21 Joint Statement until June 30, 2024.</p>

<p>"In light of above developments, India and the United States have decided to extend the validity of the agreement reflected in November 24 Statements until June 30, 2024. All other terms of the transitional approach remain the same," the finance ministry said in a statement.</p>

<p>India and the US will remain in close contact to ensure that there is common understanding of the respective commitment and endeavour to resolve all issues on this matter through constructive dialogue, it added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan scheduled snap parliamentary elections for Sept. 1 in a decree published on Friday in a widely expected move that appears unlikely to radically change the parliament's make-up.</p>

<p>Aliyev, in power since 2003, won a snap presidential election in February, and his New Azerbaijan Party, which holds 69 of 125 seats in the outgoing parliament, is expected to win a fresh majority in the oil-rich country, which has been courted by the West, Russia and Turkey.</p>

<p>Opposition deputies in parliament are loyal to Aliyev, but some opponents outside parliament say they have faced persecution after a string of independent journalists and political activists were arrested ahead of this year's presidential election, which Aliyev won with more by 92% of the vote.</p>

<p>Some of those detained faced charges for what they said were politically-motivated crimes, including smuggling. The authorities said the arrests were not political.</p>

<p>Aliyev has touted the success of a September lightning offensive which retook the former breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh from what Baku said were its illegitimate ethnic Armenian leaders.</p>

<p>Almost all of the region's more than 100,000 ethnic Armenians fled and Baku is now rebuilding the region amid plans to resettle it with Azerbaijanis.</p>

<p>Western energy firms such as BP operate in Azerbaijan, which is party to the "OPEC+" pact between the OPEC oil producers' club and other key exporters such as Russia to restrict output in order to support world prices.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[North Korea enforces strict control over information and entertainment, imposing severe punishments for violations.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea has said that in 2022, a 22-year-old man was publicly executed by North Korea for sharing and listening to K-pop music and South Korean films. The information is taken from testimonials of North Korean defectors that were published in a human rights report by the South Korean ministry of unification.</p>

<p>According to<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://unikorea.go.kr/nkhr/ko/ebook/index.html#page=1"> the report</a>, the man from South Hwanghae province was accused of listening to 70 K-pop songs, watching 3 South Korean films, and distributing this prohibited media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>North Korea has strict control over the information its citizens consume, includes strict rules regarding entertainment consumption, and has very harsh punishments for those who violate them.</p>

<p>The report further reveals that North Korea tightened its grip on outside culture in 2020 with a law banning "reactionary ideology and culture." This law is seen as a tool to shield citizens from Western influences, which the North Korean government considers detrimental.</p>

<p>North Korea has consistently denied accusations of human rights violations, calling them attempts to undermine its leadership.</p>

<p>The ban on K-pop is part of an effort to protect North Koreans from the negative influence of Western culture. This campaign began under the former leader, Kim Jong-il, and has become more intense under his son, Kim Jong-un.</p>

<p>In 2022, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/korea/fashion-05062022172129.html"><em>Radio Free Asia,</em></a> funded by the US government, reported that the regime was cracking down on "capitalist" fashion and hairstyles. This included targeting skinny jeans, T-shirts with foreign words, and dyed or long hair.</p>

<p>Experts believe that allowing South Korean popular culture to enter North Korean society could threaten the ideology that demands complete loyalty to the "infallible" Kim dynasty, which has ruled the country since its founding in 1948.</p>

<p>Despite these strict measures, the influence of South Korean culture, including recent television shows, seems unstoppable, according to a recent North Korean defector.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will lead the Indian delegation at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit next week, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) announced on Friday.</p>

<p>The SCO summit will take place from July 3-4 in Astana, the capital city of Kazakhstan.</p>

<p>While the first US presidential debate of the 2024 race dwelled little on foreign policy, a shaky performance by President Joe Biden will have America's allies steeling for the return of Donald Trump, analysts say.</p>

<p>Biden's supporters had hoped the debate would erase worries that he was too old to serve, but several lawmakers, analysts and investors said the event had given Trump a boost.</p>

<p>"Mr. Trump didn't win but Mr. Biden might have imploded," said Kunihiko Miyake, a former Japanese diplomat and now research director at the Canon Institute for Global Studies, a think tank.</p>

<p>"Unlike eight years ago, we are much more prepared, as are other European and Asian allies. Still, Mr. Trump is unpredictable."</p>

<p>For Japan and South Korea, among the closest U.S. allies in Asia, relations with Trump's administration were at times strained by his demands for more payments towards military assistance as well as trade tensions.</p>

<p>"The biggest question for Japan would be whether Trump will truly value and maintain the security alliance," said Takashi Kawakami, a professor at Japan's Takushoku University in Tokyo.</p>

<p>Peter Lee, research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, said the debate had put into "much more stark relief" the possibility of a second Trump administration. Lee said he expected Trump to be "very tough" second time around in pressuring allies to up their defence spending.</p>

<p>Trump also started a tariff war with China, the world's second largest economy, and has floated tariffs of 60% or higher on all Chinese goods if he wins the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>Overseas firms dependent on U.S. markets, such as automakers, would also be wary of the heightened possibility of Trump's return given the "myriad" of tariff-related policies he imposed during his previous term, said Lee Jae-il, analyst at Eugene Investment &amp; Securities.</p>

<p>"Trump, like a trade war maniac, might not just target China but impose tariffs against other countries as well under the concept of American exceptionalism," added Stephen Lee, chief economist at Meritz Securities in Seoul.</p>

<p><strong>WAR IN UKRAINE</strong></p>

<p>In Europe, Trump's criticisms of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and demands that other members pay more dominated his previous administration. His scepticism towards NATO is causing further anxiety this time, as Russian's war in Ukraine has brought conflict to the bloc's doorstep.</p>

<p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz previously cheered on Biden's prospects for re-election. But on Friday a senior defence figure in the ruling coalition lamented Biden's performance and urged Democrats to find another candidate.</p>

<p>"The fact that a man like Trump could become president again because the Democrats are unable to put up a strong candidate against him would be a historic tragedy that the whole world would feel," Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, of the liberal FDP party, told the Rheinische Post paper.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Scholz did not comment on the specifics of the debate, but stressed the chancellor valued Biden highly and that Scholz had never spoken to Trump as their terms did not overlap.</p>

<p>During the debate, Trump accused Biden of not standing up to China on trade. He also said China's Xi Jinping, North Korea's Kim Jong Un and Russia's Vladimir Putin "don't respect" Biden and that he was driving the country "into World War Three".</p>

<p>Biden retorted by saying Trump's tariff proposals would result in higher costs for American consumers, and that he "cuddles up" to the likes of Kim and Putin.</p>

<p>Putin has said it made little difference to Russia who was in the White House, and on Friday the Kremlin declined comment on what it said was an internal U.S. matter.</p>

<p>U.S. allies including Japan and Germany have in any case started laying the groundwork for a possible Trump return in recent months.</p>

<p>"The possibility of a Trump comeback may have increased. High tariffs and support for Ukraine will also bring about major changes," said Kazuhiro Maeshima from the Sophia University in Tokyo.</p>

<p>"The Japanese government has also been anticipating various developments in the event of a Trump and has been gradually taking steps to deal with them, including making contact with people close to Trump."</p>

<p><strong>'TRUMP 2.0'</strong></p>

<p>In Sydney, several Australian officials and experts had attended a workshop titled "Trump 2.0" as the debate was aired.</p>

<p>"The overwhelming feeling from today is that it was a disaster for Biden," said Peter Dean, a professor at the United States Studies Centre in Sydney who was at the workshop.</p>

<p>"The mood has changed considerably after the debate and the general view is that if you weren't preparing for a Trump 2.0 then that is the smart play and the smart move now."</p>

<p>Keir Starmer, the leader of Britain's Labour party and the frontrunner in an election due next week, was asked on BBC radio if he was concerned about Biden after the debate.</p>

<p>"I've got enough on my hands with our own election campaign at the moment...The relationship between the UK and the US is strong, it's historic, and obviously, it's above the individuals," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A historic letter written by Albert Einstein to former US President Franklin D Roosevelt in 1939 is going up for auction. The letter urged the US to develop its own nuclear programme in fear that Nazi Germany might be on the path to creating atomic bombs, according to the <em>BBC.</em></p>

<p>The letter is part of a collection belonging to Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and will be sold alongside other artefacts.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/how-ak-47-emerged-as-weapon-of-the-century-5895531">Also Read | How AK-47 Emerged As 'Weapon Of The Century'</a></strong></p>

<p>As per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxxxx1w9znko">news outlet</a>, the letter urged the US to initiate its own nuclear program. President Roosevelt responded by establishing a committee, a precursor to the Manhattan Project led by J Robert Oppenheimer.</p>

<p>This project ultimately produced the atomic bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, closing World War II but also opening the door to the nuclear age.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/3-99-store-vase-turns-out-to-be-2-000-year-old-mayan-artifact-5947824"><strong>Also Read | $3.99 Store Vase Turns Out To Be 1,800-Year-Old Mayan Artifact</strong></a></p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/style/albert-einstein-letter-fdr-auction-paul-allen-estate-12c80eb2?mod=hp_listc_pos3"><em>Wall Street Journal,</em></a> Christie's plans to ask for at least $4 million for this two-page, typed letter, which is dated August 2, 1939, and begins bluntly. "Sir, recent work in nuclear physics has made it probable that uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy."</p>

<p>The letter isn't likely to break the $13 million record set in 2021 for one of Einstein's few surviving records detailing his theory of general relativity. But the record for any letter by Einstein is $2.8 million set in 2018 for a letter in which the physicist ruminates on God and religion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shares of Trump Media &amp; Technology Group rose as much as nearly 13% in premarket trading on Friday after President Joe Biden's faltering performance against Republican rival Donald Trump at the first 2024 U.S. presidential debate.</p>

<p>Biden delivered a shaky, halting performance while Trump battered him with a series of often false attacks at the debate on Thursday, as the two oldest presidential candidates ever exchanged personal insults ahead of the November election.</p>

<p>"Investors are probably going to give Trump the benefit of the doubt given how positive he was for markets in his presidency," said Ben Laidler, global markets strategist at digital brokerage eToro.</p>

<p>"If you're looking for a real-time proxy of investor expectations for the result in November, they're (Trump stocks) telling you that Trump is in pole position for this election, and he's cemented his perceived lead last night."</p>

<p>Shares of Trump Media &amp; Technology Group (TMTG), which owns Trump's social media platform Truth Social, was last up 7.3% at $39.54, while software developer Phunware, which worked on Trump's 2020 election campaign app, climbed 8.1% to $6.81.</p>

<p>Shares of video-sharing platform Rumble, popular with conservatives, edged up 0.5% to $5.7.</p>

<p>TMTG's shares have jumped about 110% this year as Trump gained momentum in his bid to become the Republican candidate in the election. The stock however came under pressure earlier this month after a jury found Trump guilty of falsifying documents to cover up a payment to silence a porn star.</p>

<p>Trump owned 64.9% of TMTG as of June 10, which is worth about $6.5 billion as of last close.</p>

<p>He had vowed to stick exclusively with Truth Social after being banned by Twitter following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters.</p>

<p>However, Trump returned to social media platform X, formerly Twitter, months after his ban was reversed by new owner Elon Musk.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

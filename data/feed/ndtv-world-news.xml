       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Batoul and her family have been scrambling to secure housing outside Beirut's southern suburbs where an Israeli strike killed a senior Hezbollah commander last week, but spiking demand has sent prices soaring.</p>

<p>Many in the southern suburbs -- a packed residential area known as Dahiyeh which is also a Hezbollah bastion -- have been trying to leave, fearing full-blown war between the Iran-backed group and Israel in the wake of the commander's killing.</p>

<p>"We are with the resistance (Hezbollah) to death," said Batoul, a 29-year-old journalist, declining to give her last name as the matter is sensitive.</p>

<p>"But it's normal to be scared... and look for a safe haven," she told AFP.</p>

<p>Iran and its regional allies have vowed revenge for the killing, blamed on Israel, of Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week, just hours after the Israeli strike in Beirut's southern suburbs killed Hezbollah's top military commander Fuad Shukr.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has traded near-daily fire with Israeli forces in support of ally Hamas since the Palestinian militant group's October 7 attack on Israel triggered war in Gaza.</p>

<p>After the twin killings, fears have mounted of an all-out war, with foreign airlines suspending Beirut flights and countries urging their nationals to leave.</p>

<p>Last week's Beirut strike also killed an Iranian adviser and five civilians -- three women and two children.</p>

<p>"Whoever says they want to stay in Dahiyeh while it's being bombed is lying to themself," Batoul said.</p>

<p><strong>'No choice'</strong></p>

<p>On Tuesday, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said his Shiite Muslim movement and Iran were "obliged to respond" to Israel "whatever the consequences".</p>

<p>Batoul said she had been trying unsuccessfully to rent in "safe areas" -- unaffiliated to Hezbollah -- outside Beirut, but landlords were charging "exorbitant prices".</p>

<p>She said one landlord cancelled suddenly even after she agreed to pay six months' rent in advance for a flat in the mountain town of Sawfar.</p>

<p>A 55-year-old teacher and Hezbollah supporter, who requested anonymity because the matter is sensitive, said she felt lucky to find a flat about 15 kilometres (nine miles) outside Beirut.</p>

<p>But it came with a price tag of $1,500 a month, in a country battered by more than four years of economic crisis.</p>

<p>The teacher, also a Dahiyeh resident, said price gouging was rampant, noting another apartment was listed online for $1,500 a month "but when we arrived, they asked for $2,000".</p>

<p>"They know we have no choice. When there is a war, people will pay any amount of money to be safe," she said.</p>

<p>But "many people will stay (in Dahiyeh) because they cannot afford to rent," she added.</p>

<p>Riyad Bou Fakhreddine, a broker who rents out homes in the Mount Lebanon area near Beirut, said apartments were being snapped up "within half an hour to an hour of being listed".</p>

<p>Some landlords have asked him to raise apartments normally priced at around $500 a month to as high as $2,000, he said.</p>

<p>He said he refused.</p>

<p>"I tell them I'm not a crisis profiteer. I don't want to take advantage of people's fears," he said.</p>

<p><strong>'Polarisation'</strong></p>

<p>Almost 10 months of cross-border violence have killed some 558 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including at least 116 civilians, according to an AFP tally.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, including in the annexed Golan Heights, 22 soldiers and 25 civilians have been killed, according to army figures.</p>

<p>Ali, who rents serviced apartments in central Beirut, said his phone had "not stopped ringing" ahead of Nasrallah's speech.</p>

<p>"I booked 10 flats in two days," he said.</p>

<p>"Many people walked in and booked on the spot... Or called me and were here within an hour," said the 32-year-old, who requested to be identified only by his first name.</p>

<p>In 2006, Hezbollah fought a devastating war with Israel, whose air force bombarded Beirut's southern suburbs nightly for a month, flattening hundreds of apartment blocks.</p>

<p>Back then, many people from across Lebanon's sectarian divides expressed support for Hezbollah and solidarity with the Shiite Muslim community, many of whom lost their homes and livelihoods.</p>

<p>But this time, Dahiyeh resident Batoul said solidarity was lacking, with politicians divided after Hezbollah decided unilaterally to begin attacking Israeli positions on October 8.</p>

<p>In 2006, "there wasn't such polarisation," she said.</p>

<p>Landlords and others profiting from high demand on housing now are simply driven by greed, Batoul said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former UN official from Canada who now works as a North Korea specialist has been detained in Switzerland on charges of spying, likely for China, media reports said on Thursday, citing unnamed intelligence sources.</p>

<p>The reports were part of a joint investigation by the German news outlet Der Spiegel, the Swiss media company Tamedia and North Korea-focused website NK News.</p>

<p>The Swiss attorney general's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the case.</p>

<p>The suspect regularly travelled to China for his work as an environmental consultant before being arrested earlier in the spring on espionage charges, said NK News, an online outlet that has staff in the US, Europe and South Korea.</p>

<p>It said it did not publish the official's full name as he has not been convicted and authorities have not made public charges against him.</p>

<p>The person, in his 50s and a resident of Geneva, was in pretrial detainment for several months pending the conclusion of an investigation by the Swiss attorney general's office, the NK News report said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran accused Israel on Thursday of wanting to spread war in the Middle East, as diplomatic efforts sought a regional de-escalation following the killings of Tehran-allied militant leaders.</p>

<p>Ali Bagheri, Iran's acting foreign minister, told AFP that Israel had committed "a strategic mistake" by killing Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week -- hours after the assassination in Beirut of Hezbollah's military chief.</p>

<p>Although Israel has not admitted to killing Haniyeh, Iran and its allies have vowed to retaliate, setting the region on edge as the Gaza war raged on into its 11th month.</p>

<p>Israel seeks "to expand tension, war and conflict to other countries", but has neither "the capacity nor the strength" to fight Iran, Bagheri said.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking at a military base on Wednesday, said Israel was "prepared both defensively and offensively" and "determined" to defend itself.</p>

<p>Haniyeh's group named a successor on Wednesday -- Yahya Sinwar, who Israel says had a key role in planning Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack that sparked the Gaza war.</p>

<p>Analysts believe Sinwar -- Hamas's leader in the Gaza Strip since 2017 -- has been both more reluctant to agree to a ceasefire and closer to Tehran than Haniyeh, who lived in Qatar.</p>

<p>On the ground in Gaza, fighting continued on Thursday with the Israeli military issuing its latest evacuation order and rescuers and medics reporting at least 13 killed in strikes.</p>

<p><strong>'Cycle of reprisals'</strong></p>

<p>The front pages of some of Israel's leading newspapers on Thursday cited "assessments" that Iran may be rethinking its course of action, reportedly in part due to US pressure.</p>

<p>Officials and leaders in the Middle East and beyond have called for calm, with Britain's minister for international development, Anneliese Dodds, telling AFP on a visit to Jordan: "We must see a de-escalation".</p>

<p>The United States, which has sent extra warships and jets to the region, has urged both Iran and Israel to avoid an escalation.</p>

<p>France's President Emmanuel Macron spoke Wednesday with his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian and later with Israel's Netanyahu, telling both to "avoid a cycle of reprisals", according to the French presidency.</p>

<p>Israel's military chief Herzi Halevi told troops "we are not stopping" targeting the leaders of "our most dangerous enemies", vowing to "find" and "attack" Sinwar too, according to an army statement.</p>

<p>Also on Wednesday, the 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, meeting in the Saudi city of Jeddah, declared that Israel was "fully responsible" for Haniyeh's "heinous" killing.</p>

<p>Bagheri said OIC members voiced support for Iranian retaliation.</p>

<p>"Western countries, who claim they have asked Iran to restrict its response... are not in the position to advise the Islamic Republic of Iran."</p>

<p><strong>'Inevitable'</strong></p>

<p>The Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip has already drawn in Tehran-aligned militants in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.</p>

<p>Lebanese Hamas ally Hezbollah, which has traded near-daily cross-border fire with Israeli troops throughout the Gaza war, has vowed retaliation for military chief Fuad Shukr's killing.</p>

<p>Israel said the Beirut strike that killed him was in response to deadly rocket fire from Lebanon last month on the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights.</p>

<p>And in Yemen, the Iran-backed Huthis said Thursday their retaliation for a deadly Israeli strike last month on the Red Sea port of Hodeida was "inevitable and will come".</p>

<p>The Huthis, who have carried out maritime attacks since November in a campaign they say is in solidarity with Gaza, claimed a drone attack on Tel Aviv a day before the Hodeida strike.</p>

<p>A Lebanese government official told AFP on Thursday that "there are efforts to calm the situation" across the region including with a continued push to secure a Gaza truce after months of stalled negotiations.</p>

<p>"But we must stay alert, even if tensions have relatively subsided over the past two days," said the source, requesting anonymity.</p>

<p>Numerous airlines have suspended flights to Lebanon due to security fears.</p>

<p><strong>Israel PM 'sorry'</strong></p>

<p>The Hamas attack that triggered the war in Gaza resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Palestinian militants seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,699 people, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>Netanyahu, who has resisted making an apology for security failures over Israel's worst-ever attack, said in an interview published Thursday that he was "sorry, deeply, that something like this happened".</p>

<p>"You always look back and you say, 'Could we have done things that would have prevented it?'" Netanyahu told Time magazine.</p>

<p>The Israeli military meanwhile issued a new evacuation order for parts of Khan Yunis, southern Gaza's main city, telling Palestinians to flee places from where "rockets are launched" at Israel.</p>

<p>The civil defence agency said an Israeli strike targeting a Khan Yunis house killed at least five people.</p>

<p>In the territory's north, AFP journalists reported air strikes and constant shelling overnight in Gaza City, where medics said eight people were killed in two separate incidents.</p>

<p>On the diplomatic front, an Israeli decision to revoke the diplomatic status of Norway's envoys to the Palestinian Authority over "anti-Israel behaviour" drew anger from Oslo.</p>

<p>"Today's decision will have consequences for our relationship with the Netanyahu government," said Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The family of Paul Henri-Nargeolet hopes that by holding OceanGate accountable, they can prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The family of renowned Titanic explorer Paul Henri-Nargeolet is seeking $50 million in damages from OceanGate, the company behind the doomed Titan submersible. The lawsuit alleges that the company's reckless disregard for safety led to the tragic deaths of all five crew members, including Nargeolet, who endured unimaginable terror before the vessel's catastrophic implosion.</p>

<p>At the heart of the suit are accusations of gross negligence against OceanGate and its CEO, Stockton Rush. The company is alleged to have prioritized profit and publicity over the safety of its passengers. By circumventing industry standards, ignoring expert advice, and cutting corners, OceanGate created a perilous environment for those aboard the Titan, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/titan-submersible-wrongful-death-lawsuit-b2592900.html"><em>Independent </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The lawsuit contends that Rush's obsessive pursuit of innovation blinded him to the critical importance of safety. His alleged disregard for established protocols, coupled with the company's failure to disclose the full extent of the risks involved, created a deadly recipe for disaster.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The family of Paul Henri-Nargeolet hopes that by holding OceanGate accountable, they can prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future. The legal battle promises to shed light on the circumstances surrounding the fatal expedition and may lead to significant changes in the regulation of deep-sea exploration.</p>

<p>For instance, while titanium is typically used in deep-sea submersibles, Rush believed it was unnecessarily heavy and chose carbon fiber for the Titan's hull instead. The lawsuit notes that carbon fiber "breaks down over time under pressure," and although Rush acknowledged the potential for "catastrophic failure" due to imperfections in the carbon fiber structure, he installed an acoustic safety system to detect problems.</p>

<p>The Titan had only made a few trips to the depth of the wreck site before the mission, but these journeys may have weakened the vessel's "carbon-fiber hull and/or the connections and seals between disparate types of material," the suit contends.</p>

<p>OceanGate's head of marine operations, who was "ultimately most responsible for the safety of anyone sailing" on Titan, requested a scan of the carbon fiber hull as part of a detailed safety report. This request reportedly angered Rush, who not only refused to conduct the scan but also fired the safety chief after addressing the report.</p>

<p>In addition to this expert's concerns, Rush received warnings from other experts and the Marine Technology Society, which sent a letter to OceanGate in 2018 cautioning that the company's "experimental" approach "could result in negative outcomes (from minor to catastrophic)." According to the lawsuit, "None of the warnings were heeded."</p>

<p>The vessel was also never certified by the leading certification group DNV. Rush declined to seek DNV certification for Titan, believing it would be too difficult to "educate" DNV personnel-who are world-class experts on the requirements and dangers of deep-sea diving-on the supposed advantages of Titan's "innovative" design, the complaint states.</p>

<p>The lawsuit also alleges that crew members were required to sign a waiver that "failed to disclose many key, relevant risk factors...regarding the design and operation of TITAN or the materials used in its construction."</p>

<p>Despite his extensive knowledge of the ocean floor near the Titanic wreck, the 77-year-old Nargeolet was never fully informed about the safety of the vessel, the suit claims. "Neither Rush nor OceanGate ever fully or accurately disclosed all of the material facts regarding Titan's design and construction...On the contrary, Rush and OceanGate actively fostered Nargeolet's (and others') false impressions about the safety and seaworthiness of the vessel."</p>

<p>Tragically, when the acoustic safety system's alarm indicated that the hull was "cracking under extreme pressure," the pilot attempted to abort the expedition by releasing weight.</p>

<p>The crew, however, had no communications and likely no power. "Common sense dictates that the crew were well aware they were going to die, before dying," the suit states.</p>

<p>"The crew may well have heard the carbon fiber's crackling noise grow more intense as the weight of the water pressed on TITAN's hull," the filing says. "By experts' reckoning, they would have continued to descend, in full knowledge of the vessel's irreversible failures, experiencing terror and mental anguish prior to the Titan ultimately imploding."</p>

<p>Aside from the Titan, no commercial manned submersible has ever suffered an implosion, the suit says.</p>

<p>Both Mr Rush and Mr Nargeolet died in the implosion, along with British explorer Hamish Harding, 58, UK-based Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood, 48, and his 19-year-old son Suleman.</p>

<p>Tony Buzbee, one of the lawyers for the family, said in a statement: "We are hopeful that through this lawsuit we can get answers for the family as to exactly how this happened, who all were involved, and how those involved could allow this to happen."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist Muhammad Yunus takes over as the head of Bangladesh's caretaker government on Thursday when the country is facing tough economic challenges.</p>

<p>Here is a look at his economic beliefs as he takes the helm of the South Asian country until elections are held and a new administration is put in place.</p>

<p><strong>Social Businesses</strong></p>

<p>Mr Yunus advocates "social businesses" that solve problems rather than simply create wealth, with any profit generated being ploughed back to create more value.</p>

<p>Grameen Bank, the microfinance lender he founded, was rooted in this idea and lauded for helping to boost growth and alleviate poverty in Bangladesh.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Yunus was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his pioneering work in microfinance which was replicated in other developing countries and led to him being known as "banker to the poor".&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Poverty</strong></p>

<p>Mr Yunus' belief that poverty - which plagued more than 18% of Bangladesh's population in 2022 - is a "threat" and causes problems ranging from terrorism to trafficking, informs most of his work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You can't leave people poor and live happily...they are in a desperate situation. When you are desperate, you disturb peace," Mr Yunus told Nobelprize.org in 2006.</p>

<p>It was to solve this problem that he sought to inculcate "sound financial principles" in the poor through his microcredit system.</p>

<p><strong>Globalisation</strong></p>

<p>Mr Yunus has called for "multi-national social businesses" that either give the poor ownership or keep profits within poor countries.</p>

<p>When he dabbled in politics in 2007, he suggested upgrading the Chittagong port to a continental seaport - a plan critics said could endanger national security, jobs and the environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Yunus also spoke of a "global civilisation" in an interview with The Indian Express newspaper last week, in which he criticised India for saying the upheaval in Bangladesh was an "internal matter" and warned the chaos could spill over to its neighbours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Diplomacy has a much richer vocabulary than saying it is their internal affair," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Women</strong></p>

<p>Mr Yunus emphasises the role of women in building the future and has been part of multiple international commissions catering to them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Women currently outnumber men in Bangladesh and constitute 97% of Grameen Bank's members.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Women want to build up something for the future with their money. Men want to spend it enjoying themselves," he told Harvard Business Review in 2012.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vice President Kamala Harris did not agree to discuss imposing an arms embargo on Israel during an exchange with pro-Palestinian activists who are pushing for changes to US policy toward its ally over the Gaza war, an aide said on Thursday.</p>

<p>The Uncommitted National Movement had said late on Wednesday that Harris, the 2024 Democratic presidential candidate, had "shared her sympathies and expressed an openness to a meeting with Uncommitted leaders to discuss an arms embargo" during the interaction while campaigning in Detroit, the aide said.</p>

<p>The aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Harris did not express a willingness to discuss an arms embargo. But a campaign spokesperson said the vice president did tell members of the Muslim and Palestinian community she would continue to engage with them on the war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas in Gaza, which local officials say has killed nearly 40,000 people.</p>

<p>"The vice president has been clear: She will always work to ensure Israel is able to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups. The vice president is focused on securing the ceasefire and hostage deal currently on the table," the campaign spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Two founders of the group, Layla Elabed and Abbas Alawieh, said they spoke briefly with both Harris and newly minted running mate Tim Walz of Minnesota about their concerns about the U.S. supplying weapons to Israel as it wages war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Alawieh said on Thursday that both he and Elabed specifically asked for a meeting to discuss the demand for an arms embargo on Israel, "and in both cases, Vice President Harris expressed an openness to following up."</p>

<p>He said he was very encouraged by his engagements with Harris' office and "we're hopeful that continued discussions will continue to be fruitful."</p>

<p><strong>HUMANITARIAN CRISIS</strong></p>

<p>Israel launched its assault on the besieged Palestinian enclave in retaliation for an Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel by Hamas militants who killed 1,200 people and took some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>The Uncommitted political group was organized to oppose President Joe Biden's staunch support for Israel's war, which has displaced nearly 80 percent of Gaza's 2.3 million people and caused severe food shortages.</p>

<p>The humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza has prompted calls for Washington to put conditions on the billions of dollars in military funding and other assistance it provides to Israel, which has received more U.S. foreign aid since World War Two than any other country.</p>

<p>The United States in May paused a shipment of 2,000-pound and 500-pound bombs due to concern over the impact they could have in Gaza.</p>

<p>The Uncommitted movement amassed sizable vote totals in presidential nominating contests in Michigan, Minnesota and Hawaii, and has won at least 25 delegates. Leaders have said they want to use their influence at this month's Democratic National Convention in Chicago.</p>

<p>In a reminder of how divisive the issue has been for Democrats, a group of pro-Palestinian protesters briefly interrupted Harris' speech in Detroit on Wednesday, chanting, "Kamala, Kamala, you can't hide, we won't vote for genocide."</p>

<p>She paused for a moment, saying she believed in democracy and the importance of every voice, and then added, "But I am speaking now." When the chants continued, she repeated, "You know what? If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I'm speaking."</p>

<p>Trump has criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for Israeli security failures that enabled Hamas to carry out the Oct. 7 attack and said he would work to bring about a quick end to the war.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Signalling the beginning of a new chapter after 15 years of Sheikh Hasina as the prime minister, Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus took oath as the head of the interim government in Bangladesh on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I will uphold, support and protect the constitution and will perform my duties sincerely," Mr Yunus said at the swearing-in event, which comes at a tumultuous time for Bangladesh. The country has witnessed violence and clashes even after the student-led protests forced Ms Hasina to resign and flee the country on Monday.</p>

<p>Mr Yunus, 84, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for pioneering microcredit and microfinance, which he put into action through the Grameen Bank. He was sworn in hours after he returned to Dhaka from Paris, where he had been undergoing medical treatment. The oath was administered by Bangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin at his official residence, 'Bangabhaban'.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended his best wishes to Mr Yunus and said India is hoping for an early return to normalcy in Bangladesh, which would also ensure the safety of Hindus and other minorities.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) <a href="https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1821574094195769549?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>"My best wishes to Professor Muhammad Yunus on the assumption of his new responsibilities. We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities. India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfill the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development," PM Modi wrote on X.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Advisory Council</strong></p>

<p>Mr Yunus has been sworn in as the chief adviser in the interim government, a position akin to that of prime minister, and a 16-member council of advisers will be assisting him. The advisers include Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, two key leaders of the protests that led to Ms Hasina's ouster.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Among the other members of the council are Adilur Rahman Khan, a prominent rights activist who was sentenced to a two-year jail term under Ms Hasina; women's rights activist Farida Akhtar; Grameen Telecom trustee Nurjahan Begum; former foreign secretary Touhid Hossain; and AFM Khalid Hossain, deputy chief of right-wing party Hefazat-e-Islam.</p>

<p>Speaking before the swearing-in ceremony, Mr Yunus said, "Today is a glorious day for us... Bangladesh has created a new victory day. Bangladesh has got a second independence."</p>

<p>Urging a return to normalcy, he added, "We cannot take a step forward unless we fix the law and order situation. My call to the people is that if you have trust in me, make sure there will be no attacks against anyone, anywhere in the country... We are one big family."</p>

<p><strong>Violent Protests</strong></p>

<p>Trouble had been brewing in Bangladesh since before the January 7 elections, which was won by Sheikh Hasina's Awami League in a landslide, but the electoral exercise was widely seen as being far from free and fair.</p>

<p>A fresh wave of protests led by students began in June - in which over 450 people have been killed so far - &nbsp;after a Bangladeshi high court reinstated 30 per cent reservation in government jobs for family members of freedom fighters and veterans from Bangladesh's 1971 War of Independence. The quota was later scaled back by the country's Supreme Court but Ms Hasina's handling of the protests and her alleged use of an offensive label for the protesters infuriated students.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Protests continued with students demanding that Ms Hasina step down and clashes between agitators and the police left over 100 dead and dozens injured across the country on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Monday saw lakhs of students flooding the streets and heading towards the prime minister's official residence, Ganabhaban, forcing Ms Hasina to resign and flee to India. Violence continued in some places even after Ms Hasina resigned and there have been reports of minorities, including Hindus, being targeted.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Afghan government employees must attend mosque five times a day or face punishment, Taliban supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada said Thursday in his latest edict enforcing an austere interpretation of Islam.</p>

<p>Since the 2021 Taliban takeover Akhundzada has overseen sweeping restrictions on society -- shutting many women and girls out of education, ordering male chaperones for females and effectively banning music.</p>

<p>"The officials of the ministries and institutions of the (Taliban government) are obliged by Sharia to pray in congregation at their fixed times," said the order signed by Akhundzada.</p>

<p>It added that employees who miss a prayer "without a reasonable excuse" should receive a warning, and if they repeat the transgression "the relevant official is obliged to appropriately punish him".</p>

<p>A Taliban government spokesman did not respond to a query from AFP asking what the punishment would entail.</p>

<p>According to Islam, Muslims must strive to pray five times a day, either in private or at a mosque.</p>

<p>The times are adjusted according to the sun, but some fall within working hours.</p>

<p>It was not immediately clear how the order for employees to attend prayer during non-work hours would be policed.</p>

<p>Akhundzada directs the government from his hideout in southern Kandahar, the spiritual heartland of the Taliban movement which first ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001.</p>

<p>He rarely appears in public, and when he does bodyguards prohibit spectators from taking photographs or video of the man who has led the Taliban since 2016.</p>

<p>But his intermittent edicts now define how Afghans can lead their lives.</p>

<p>A United Nations report last month said "restrictive measures to regulate activities of individuals in both public and private spheres contribute to a climate of fear and intimidation among segments of the population".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in an interview published Thursday that he was "sorry" that Hamas was able to carry out its October 7 attack, without explicitly taking responsibility.</p>

<p>Netanyahu, who has resisted making an apology for security failures over Israel's worst-ever attack and focused on destroying Hamas, was asked if he would apologize during an interview with Time magazine.</p>

<p>"Apologize?" he was quoted as replying.</p>

<p>"Of course, of course. I am sorry, deeply, that something like this happened. And you always look back and you say, 'Could we have done things that would have prevented it?'" he said.</p>

<p>The right-wing leader is Israel's longest-serving prime minister and has long billed himself as a staunch protector of Israel's security.</p>

<p>Shortly after the October 7 attack, Netanyahu posted on social media that intelligence services had failed to anticipate the Hamas operation and warn him.</p>

<p>He deleted and apologized for that post after numerous Israelis accused him of deflecting blame and jeopardizing national unity.</p>

<p>In the interview, Time asked Netanyahu what his message would be to a political rival who presided over the country's worst security failure.</p>

<p>Netanyahu replied that it depended on whether the leader could lead Israel "to victory."</p>

<p>"Can they assure that the postwar situation will be one of peace and security? If the answer is yes, they should stay in power."</p>

<p>Hamas on October 7 carried out the deadliest attack in Israel's history. A total of 1,198 people died, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Palestinian militants seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,677 people, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich's suggestion that starving millions to death in Gaza was "justified and moral" has sparked global outrage. His comments, made during a speech last week, have been widely condemned by global powers, including the European Union, the United Kingdom and France.</p>

<p>Smotrich remarked that halting aid to the besieged territory could be a means to "free the hostages".</p>

<p>"No one in the world will allow us to starve two million people, even though it might be justified and moral in order to free the hostages," the far-right minister said, as quoted by news agency AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The EU swiftly responded, labelling the deliberate starvation of civilians a "war crime" and demanding the Israeli government distance itself from the minister's words. They said the remarks showed "contempt for international law and for basic principles of humanity".</p>

<p>France expressed "deep dismay" and criticised the far-right minister, stating that providing humanitarian aid to Gaza is an "obligation under international humanitarian law" due to Israel's control over the territory's access, AFP reported.</p>

<p>Germany strongly denounced the remarks, calling them "completely unacceptable and outrageous". A spokesman for the Foreign Office in Berlin stated that civilians must be protected in war and have access to essential resources like water and food as it was a "basic principle" mandated by international humanitarian law.</p>

<p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy called on the Israeli government to "retract and condemn" the remarks, while in a separate development, the US State Department demanded a full investigation into allegations of sexual abuse against Palestinian detainees by Israeli soldiers. The allegations came to light following the release of a video on Israel's Channel 12, which appeared to show soldiers leading a detainee out of camera view to commit acts of abuse.</p>

<p>The video has intensified scrutiny of Israel's treatment of Palestinian detainees, with Israeli authorities launching an investigation into alleged abuse by soldiers. The investigation has already led to the arrest of nine soldiers, which led to protests from right-wing Israelis who stormed two military facilities in response.</p>

<p>Amid growing concerns, Israeli rights group B'Tselem has published a report stating the mistreatment of Palestinian prisoners had become so widespread that it amounted to a policy of "institutionalised abuse."</p>

<p>In May, International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan announced plans to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The warrants are related to war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Gaza. The devastating conflict, now nearing 10 months, has left vast areas of Gaza in ruins. A crippling blockade has severely limited access to essential resources like food, clean water, and medicine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel's war in Gaza has created a dire humanitarian crisis, displacing almost all 2.4 million residents, killing nearly 40,000 and injuring almost 1 lakh Palestinians. Israel faces accusations of genocide at the International Court of Justice, which has ordered an immediate halt to military operations in Rafah. The southern city had provided refuge for over 1 million Palestinians before being invaded and bombed in May.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since April, the world has seen record high ocean temperatures and that's bad news for the plants and animals that call the ocean home.</p>

<p>Longer and more frequent bouts of extreme temperatures can cause the exodus of some species and the invasion of others, with potentially devastating impacts on the resident ecosystem.</p>

<p>Global warming manifests as a gradual increase in temperatures over time around the world, caused by increased greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>However, scientists are finding that the most important impacts come from short-term spikes in temperature.</p>

<p>In the ocean, these discrete periods of extreme temperatures, lasting weeks to months, are called marine heatwaves.</p>

<p>Marine heatwaves can be generated by either the atmosphere or by ocean processes.</p>

<p>For example, weather systems like high pressure systems can lead to low cloud and greater solar heating while ocean changes can be driven by strengthened poleward currents that move heat from high to low latitudes.</p>

<p>The likelihood and intensity of these atmospheric and oceanic drivers of marine heatwaves can also be affected by large-scale phenomena like El Nino or La Nina.</p>

<p>Larger portions of the oceans are likely to experience marine heatwaves during El Nino events.</p>

<p>Marine heatwaves can have dramatic impacts on marine organisms and ecosystems that may extend for long periods after temperatures have returned to normal.</p>

<p>Impacts range from the suppressed growth of microscopic marine plants to mass deaths in fish and marine mammals, encroachment of invasive species and toxic algal outbreaks.</p>

<p>Importantly, marine heatwaves have been associated with extensive dieback of species like coral reefs, kelp forests and seagrass beds that form the homes and breeding grounds for a large amount of the ocean's biodiversity.</p>

<p>These impacts can have devastating knock-on effects for fisheries, aquaculture and tourism industries, with individual events linked to direct losses of up to hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

<p>The Ningaloo Nino that formed early in 2011 was an iconic extreme event.</p>

<p>Intensified winds along the Pacific equator - associated with an extreme La Niña - forced warm water westwards and through the Indonesian Archipelago, into the Indian Ocean and poleward along the coast of Western Australia.</p>

<p>This flood of warm water caused a record-breaking marine heatwave that wiped out the endemic kelp forest for over 100 km along the Australian coast along with one-third (1,300 square kilometres) of the Shark Bay seagrass meadow, a UNESCO world heritage site.</p>

<p>The Ningaloo Nino caused deaths and reduced reproduction in abalone, scallops and crabs that led to the closure of associated fisheries for several years.</p>

<p>The Tasman Sea is another hotspot for ocean warming and marine heatwaves.</p>

<p>Two consecutive extreme events occurred the summer of 2015/16 and 2017/18. Their causes were very different.</p>

<p>The first was primarily caused by an intensification of the warm East Australian Current while the second was caused by a long-lasting high pressure system over the ocean.</p>

<p>These and previous events brought an invasion of sea urchins from mainland waters that led to the decimation of kelp forests off eastern Tasmania.</p>

<p>The 2015/16 event alone led to new diseases in cultured oysters, poor salmon performance and high mortalities of abalone. Together this led to economic losses of more than half a billion dollars.</p>

<p>As marine heatwaves exist on the backdrop of long-term global ocean warming, these extreme events are becoming more intense and more frequent.</p>

<p>Over the past century the number of days each year experiencing marine heatwave conditions has increased by more than 50 percent.</p>

<p>The shorter time between marine heatwaves means that many populations no longer have the time to recover between events, which can lead to species moving their range or being wiped out.</p>

<p>And this will only worsen in the future.</p>

<p>Many studies show that some coral reefs are losing their hard corals.</p>

<p>And with increased future warming the very existence of tropical coral reefs are in doubt.</p>

<p>Since April, the oceans have been warmer than at any time during the instrumental record.</p>

<p>It's probably at least 100,000 years - before the last ice age - since temperatures could have been this warm.</p>

<p>As a consequence, scientists are seeing more of the ocean experiencing marine heatwave conditions than ever. And that's before the added push from the developing El Nino.</p>

<p>Over the past few weeks alone, there have been extreme marine heatwaves in all of the ocean basins, including around the UK and Japan, off Peru and in waters extending off of the Californian, Florida and east and west Canadian coasts.</p>

<p>As the Northern Hemisphere enters its warmest season, marine heatwaves are at their most dangerous, pushing marine organisms above their thermal limits.</p>

<p>Over the next few months, expect reports of significant ecosystem harm to start to emerge.</p>

<p>An understanding of the physical drivers of these events and their biological impacts provides scientists with some ability to forecast their likelihood in the future.</p>

<p>This can help marine resource managers make decisions, like moving aquaculture stocks, reducing fishing quotas or taking direct action to suppress warming (like shading of aquaculture cultivation areas, or moving aquaculture pens out of harm's way) in small, high-value regions.</p>

<p>But ultimately, to avoid escalating impacts the only solution is to stop greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taylor Swift fans turned to social media on Thursday, grappling with sorrow, anger, and disbelief after the singer's three Vienna concerts were abruptly cancelled following the Austrian government's confirmation of a planned attack at the venue.</p>

<p>Some 195,000 fans in total were expected for the concerts at Vienna's Ernst Happel Stadium, with many having travelled from abroad for a chance to see the pop superstar live.</p>

<p>"One year of excitement is gone in one second," lamented a fan in response to the organizer's Instagram message cancelling the concerts, less than 24 hours before the first was due to begin.</p>

<p>The post gained over 5,500 responses, ranging from understanding to outrage, with many urging Swift to address her fans directly and reschedule her shows in the Austrian capital.</p>

<p>"Please reschedule Vienna, your silence is just heartbreaking," another fan wrote. The 34-year-old singer-songwriter has yet to issue a public statement.</p>

<p>Austrian Interior Minister Gerhard Kanner expressed understanding for the decision to cancel, emphasizing, "I repeat, this has prevented a tragedy."</p>

<p>Austrian police on Wednesday detained two people suspected of plotting attacks. The main suspect, a 19-year-old Austrian who has North Macedonian roots, had allegedly masterminded a plot to attack Swift fans in Vienna with a bomb or knife and had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State terrorist group, authorities said on Thursday.</p>

<p>He made a full confession in custody, Austria's general director for public security Franz Ruf told a news conference.</p>

<p>Swift has previously spoken about her fears regarding safety on tour, especially in light of the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing that killed 22 and the Las Vegas shooting that claimed 60 lives.</p>

<p>"I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn't know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months," she shared in a 2019 interview with Elle magazine, revealing that her fear of violence had made her carry military-grade bandages for emergencies.</p>

<p>Barracuda Music, the concert organizer, said all tickets would be automatically refunded within 10 days. However, for many fans who had travelled from afar, the reimbursement fell short of covering their expenses.</p>

<p>"What are the people that have spent thousands of dollars to see her in Vienna supposed to do!?," one frustrated fan commented on the singer's Taylor Nation's Instagram, which has over nine million followers. Others expressed a mix of gratitude for their safety and disbelief at the situation.</p>

<p>Tracy Jo Clark Neusser said she was shocked and devastated after flying from the United States for the concert.</p>

<p>"We would never be able to afford the trip back again even if she does reschedule," Neusser wrote on Instagram, asking how she could get a poster for the cancelled concert.</p>

<p>"It would certainly be a story on our wall, even if it's an unfortunate one. Gonna just have to believe everything happens for a reason," she added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus will today take oath as the leader of the interim Bangladesh government. After landing in the country, Yunus paid tribute to those killed in Bangladesh's deadly protests that toppled Sheikh Hasina's government, saying their sacrifices had brought the nation a "second independence".</p>

<p>"Today is a glorious day for us," he told reporters at the airport in Dhaka shortly after returning to the country to lead a caretaker government.</p>

<p>"Bangladesh has created a new victory day. Bangladesh has got a second independence."</p>

<p>Yunus called for the restoration of order after weeks of violence that left at least 455 people dead, calling on citizens to guard each other, including minorities who came under attack.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Chidimma Adetshina, a law student, has been the subject of vicious, xenophobic attacks on social media since she was announced as a finalist in July.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Miss South Africa contestant whose Nigerian heritage sparked a national controversy and a government investigation withdrew from the beauty pageant Thursday.</p>

<p>Chidimma Adetshina's announcement that she would not take part in Saturday's final came a day after the Home Affairs ministry accused her mother of fraud and identity theft.</p>

<p>"After much careful consideration, I have made the difficult decision to withdraw myself from the competition for the safety and wellbeing of my family and I," Adetshina, 23, wrote on Instagram.</p>

<p>Adetshina, a law student, has been the subject of vicious, xenophobic attacks on social media since she was announced as a finalist in July, with many -- including cabinet ministers -- questioning her credentials because of her Nigerian descent.</p>

<p>Adetshina has previously told local media she was born in Soweto to a Nigerian father and a South African mother of Mozambican descent.</p>

<p>The ruckus led to an investigation into her citizenship following a request from the pageant's organisers.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, home affairs minister Leon Schreiber said the investigation uncovered "prima facie indications" that Adetshina's mother might have committed fraud and stolen the identity of a South African woman.</p>

<p>The ministry said it was obtaining legal advice on the implications of this on the citizenship of Adetshina, who was an infant at the time of the alleged fraud.</p>

<p>South Africa grants citizenship by birth to anyone born in the country after 1995 to a South African parent or permanent resident.</p>

<p>Adetshina's participation in the pageant stoked anti-foreigner sentiment in the nation, which has witnessed violent, and at times deadly, attacks on immigrants in the past.</p>

<p>Politicians, celebrities and ordinary citizens weighed in on the debate. While many came to her defence, others argued she should be disqualified.</p>

<p>Announcing her decision to quit, Adetshina thanked everyone who "stood beside me right from the start of my Miss South Africa journey".</p>

<p>"I am really grateful for all the love and support I have been shown," she wrote.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 19-year-old has been detained in Austria for allegedly plotting to kill people outside a stadium at a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/austrian-police-disrupts-taylor-swift-concert-attack-plot-seizes-chemicals-6291225" target="_blank">Taylor Swift concert</a>, prompting the cancellation of the pop superstar's three shows in Vienna this week.</p>

<p>Two other teenagers have been identified as suspects.</p>

<p>Here is what security officials have said about the three.</p>

<h3><strong>THE 19-YEAR-OLD</strong></h3>

<p>The Austrian national with North Macedonian roots was arrested in the early hours of Wednesday during a police operation at his home in Ternitz, a town near the Hungarian border.</p>

<p>The teen, who had posted a video online confessing to the plot, quit his job on July 25, telling people that he "had big plans", public security chief Franz Ruf told reporters on Thursday.</p>

<p>The suspect had recently changed his appearance and had been consuming and sharing Islamist propaganda online, security officials said, adding that he had pledged allegiance to Islamic State but also held sympathies for Al Qaeda.</p>

<p>A neighbour told Austrian broadcaster Puls24 that the young man kept himself to himself and that he had grown a "Taliban beard".</p>

<p>During a search of his home, law enforcement authorities secured various substances and tools used for building bombs, as well as Islamic State propaganda, 21,000 euros ($23,000) in counterfeit money, machetes, knives and blank ammunition.</p>

<p>The Kurier newspaper, citing sources familiar with the situation, reported that the suspect had stolen the chemicals from his former workplace, a metal processing company also in Ternitz. Officials did not comment on where he got the chemicals from, adding that this was a focus of their investigation.</p>

<h3><strong>THE 17-YEAR-OLD</strong></h3>

<p>After initially being tipped off to a single suspect, Austrian investigators came across the other two, including a 17-year-old Austrian national with Turkish-Croatian roots who was arrested in Vienna on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>He had been acting conspicuously in the area of the Ernst Happel Stadium, where Swift's stadium shows had been due to take place on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.</p>

<p>The 17-year-old had been given a job with a company a few days ago that was providing services at the stadium.</p>

<p>The boy, who also appears to have been radicalised and was already known to authorities, had recently broken up with his girlfriend, Ruf said.</p>

<p>He is still to make a statement to police so his exact role in the plot is unclear, but he had extensive contact with the main suspect, officials said.</p>

<h3><strong>THE 15-YEAR-OLD</strong></h3>

<p>The third and final suspect is an Austrian national with Turkish heritage.</p>

<p>During questioning, the youngster said the main suspect had changed considerably in recent months and had also regularly enquired about devices to ignite explosives, officials said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Chinese-American scholar, who projected himself as a pro-democracy activist, has been convicted by a US court of using his reputation to gather information on dissidents and sharing it with the Chinese government.</p>

<p>A federal jury in New York delivered the verdict on Tuesday, The Guardian reported.</p>

<p>The 75-year-old lived a double life for over a decade at the behest of China's main intelligence agency, the Ministry of State Security, the prosecutors said.</p>

<p>In an opening statement last month, US attorney Ellen Sise said that Wang pretended to be opposed to the Chinese government to "get close to people who were actually opposed to the Chinese government”.</p>

<p>“And then, the defendant betrayed those people, people who trusted him, by reporting information on them to China," Sise noted.<br />
<br />
<strong>'Plot of a spy novel'</strong></p>

<p>Wang was convicted of providing the contact information of prominent dissidents to the intelligence agency in his homeland. He further lied to federal law enforcement officers about the scheme. The jury found him guilty on four counts following the week-long trial in the Brooklyn federal court, Reuters reported.</p>

<p>“The indictment could have been the plot of a spy novel, but the evidence is shockingly real,” Breon Peace, the US attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Wang was willing to betray those who respected and trusted him," Peace noted.<br />
<br />
Wang faces up to 25 years in prison, when he is to be sentenced on January 9 next year.<br />
<br />
<strong>Who is Shujun Wang?</strong><br />
<br />
Wang, an American citizen, has been settled in New York since the 1990s after his stint as a visiting university scholar of East Asian studies, The New York Times reported.</p>

<p>To commemorate figures linked to the 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising, he helped found a pro-democracy group in 2006 in the Flushing neighbourhood of Queens.</p>

<p>Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang Memorial Foundation is named for two leaders of the Chinese Communist Party in the 1980s. As per its official website, the group's mission is to promote China's "constitutional transformation.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, prosecutors said that Wang used his position and status among the Chinese community to act as a “covert intelligence asset in his own community,” since at least 2006.</p>

<p>Wang, according to the prosecutors, was ordered to collect information about topics and people the Chinese government deemed undesirable. Later, he passed on this information to his handlers via in-person meetings as well as written correspondence, including “diaries,” describing his interactions with prominent activists</p>

<p>Ellen Sise, in the opening statements, noted that Wang led a "double life".&nbsp;</p>

<p>“He portrayed himself as an academic and a pro-democratic activist... Appearances can be deceiving,” she said.</p>

<p>Wang emigrated to the US in 1994. He was arrested by officials in March 2022.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian prosecutors have requested a 15-year prison sentence for a dual US-Russian national charged with "treason" for making a donation to a pro-Ukraine organisation.</p>

<p>The FSB security service said in February it had arrested ballerina Ksenia Karelina, who lives in the United States and was visiting family in Russia, accusing her of providing financial assistance to the Ukrainian army.</p>

<p>"The state prosecutor asked the court to sentence Karelina to 15 years in prison," the Sverdlovsk Regional Court in the Urals city of Ekaterinburg said in a statement Thursday.</p>

<p>Her lawyer, Mikhail Mushailov, also confirmed the 15-year request in a post on his Instagram account.</p>

<p>Karelina donated around $50 to a US-based pro-Ukraine charity after Russia launched its full-scale military offensive in 2022, US media reported, citing her family and employer.</p>

<p>Russia's FSB security service accused her of collecting money that was "used to purchase tactical medical supplies, equipment, weapons and ammunition for the Ukrainian armed forces."</p>

<p>"The defendant pleaded guilty," the court said in its statement.</p>

<p>The verdict will be delivered next Thursday.</p>

<p>Russian courts almost always side with the prosecution, and acquittals in treason cases are almost unheard of.</p>

<p>Moscow has launched dozens of criminal cases against Russian citizens it accuses of supporting or collaborating with Kyiv.</p>

<p>Karelina, who is in her early 30s and worked in Los Angeles, is just one of a string of US citizens and dual nationals that have also been targeted.</p>

<p>Last week Russia released three of them -- journalists Evan Gershkovich and Alsu Kurmasheva, as well as ex-marine Paul Whelan -- in the largest East-West prisoner swap since the Cold War.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel committed a costly "strategic mistake" with its killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week, Iran's acting foreign minister told AFP in an interview on Thursday.</p>

<p>"The act that the Zionists carried out in Tehran was a strategic mistake because it will cost them gravely," Ali Bagheri said one day after attending an extraordinary session of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in the Saudi coastal city of Jeddah.</p>

<p>Although Israel has not commented on Haniyeh's death, Iran has vowed to retaliate, setting the region on edge.</p>

<p>Bagheri accused Israel of wanting "to expand tension, war and conflict to other countries," while asserting it was not in a position to fight Iran.</p>

<p>"The Zionists are in no position to start a war against the Islamic Republic of Iran," he said.</p>

<p>"They neither have the capacity nor the strength."</p>

<p>The meeting on Wednesday of foreign ministers from the 57-member OIC produced a declaration holding Israel "fully responsible" for the "heinous" killing of Haniyeh, who lived in Qatar and was a major player in talks to end the war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>The war began with Hamas's October 7 attacks on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Palestinian militants seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,699 people, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>Hamas's Lebanese ally Hezbollah has also pledged to retaliate for Haniyeh's killing and that of its military commander Fuad Shukr in an Israeli strike in Beirut hours earlier.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's anti-doping agency on Thursday called for an independent probe into its US counterpart after a media investigation found that American authorities allowed athletes who failed drug tests to continue to compete.</p>

<p>The report by the Reuters news agency on Wednesday said the global and US anti-doping authorities were in disagreement over the American side's tactic of allowing athletes who tested positive for banned substances to avoid prosecution in return for giving undercover information on other drug cheats.</p>

<p>The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) said the strategy by the US authority (USADA) was "in direct contravention of the World Anti-Doping Code" and "threatened the integrity of sporting competition".</p>

<p>The China Anti-Doping Agency (CHINADA) said Thursday that it "strongly calls for an independent investigation into USADA's cover-up of serious violations" of the code designed to prevent athletes from taking illicit substances that improve performance.</p>

<p>"USADA's practice... seriously damaged fair competition in sports and the rights and interests of clean athletes, and showed that its anti-doping work lacked transparency," CHINADA said.</p>

<p>It added that the revelations showed the US exercised "double standards" in criticising alleged doping by other countries while "turning a blind eye" to its own issues.</p>

<p>Chinese and American sports authorities have traded barbs since a separate media investigation in April found 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for a banned substance before the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 but were still allowed to compete.</p>

<p>They were not punished because WADA accepted the argument of Chinese authorities that the positive results were caused by contaminated food.</p>

<p>The disclosures brought widespread criticism of WADA, particularly from the US, which infuriated China by accusing the global governing body of a cover-up.</p>

<p>CHINADA said in a separate statement earlier Thursday that US track and field athletes were plagued by "systemic" doping abuses.</p>

<p>It cited the case of American sprinter Erriyon Knighton, who tested positive for a banned substance in March but was cleared to compete in Paris after an independent arbitrator ruled that the result likely came from contaminated meat.</p>

<p>Knighton has qualified for Thursday's Olympic 200m final in Paris.</p>

<p>CHINADA called for more tests on American track and field athletes, alleging "deep-rooted stains in... US athletics and USADA's repeated disregard for procedures and standards".</p>

<p>CHINADA provided no evidence that American athletes currently at the Games had failed doping tests.</p>

<p>The US tops the Olympics medals table with 27 golds, just ahead of China on 25.</p>

<p>China named 11 of the swimmers implicated in the doping scandal in their Paris Olympics team. China's swimmers finished with 12 medals -- two gold, three silver and seven bronze.</p>

<p>CHINADA said in June that it would "never" agree to a US demand to release details of its investigation into the 23 swimmers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is "increasingly likely" 2024 will be the hottest year on record, despite July ending a 13-month streak of monthly temperature records, the EU's climate monitor said Thursday.</p>

<p>The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said last month was the second warmest on record books going back to 1940, only slightly cooler than July 2023.</p>

<p>Between June 2023 and June 2024, each month eclipsed its own temperature record for the time of year.</p>

<p>"The streak of record-breaking months has come to an end, but only by a whisker," said Samantha Burgess, deputy director of C3S.</p>

<p>Last month the global average temperature was 16.91 degrees Celsius, only 0.04C below July 2023, according to C3S's monthly bulletin.</p>

<p>But "the overall context hasn't changed, our climate continues to warm," said Burgess.</p>

<p>"The devastating effects of climate change started well before 2023 and will continue until global greenhouse gas emissions reach net zero," she said.</p>

<p>From January to July global temperatures were 0.70C above the 1991-2020 average.</p>

<p>This anomaly would need to drop significantly over the rest of this year for 2024 not to be hotter than 2023 -- "making it increasingly likely that 2024 is going to be the warmest year on record", said C3S.</p>

<p><strong>'Too hot to handle'</strong></p>

<p>July 2024 was 1.48C warmer than the estimated average temperatures for the month during the period 1850-1900, before the world started to rapidly burn fossil fuels.</p>

<p>This has translated into punishing heat for hundreds of millions of people.</p>

<p>The Earth experienced its two hottest days on record with global average temperatures at a virtual tie on July 22 and 23 reaching 17.6C, C3S said.</p>

<p>The Mediterranean was gripped by a heatwave scientists said would have been "virtually impossible" without global warming as China and Japan sweated through their hottest July on record.</p>

<p>Record-breaking rainfall pummelled Pakistan, wildfires ravaged western US states and Hurricane Beryl left a trail of destruction as it swept from the Caribbean to the southeast of the United States.</p>

<p>"The end of record-breaking monthly temperatures is not cause for celebration," said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at London's Imperial College.</p>

<p>Otto described the heat-related deaths of 21 people in a single day in Morocco in July as "a shocking illustration of just how deadly extreme heat can be".</p>

<p>"To stop climate change, we need to stop burning fossil fuels, stop deforestation and replace them with renewable energy. We have all the technology and know-how to do that... We just lack the political will," she said.</p>

<p>Temperatures for the oceans, which absorb 90 percent of the excess heat caused by human activities, were also the second warmest on record for the month of July.</p>

<p>Average sea surface temperatures were 20.88C last month, only 0.01C below July 2023.</p>

<p>This marked the end of a 15-month period of tumbling heat records for the oceans.</p>

<p>However, scientists at C3S noted that "air temperatures over the ocean remained unusually high over many regions" despite a swing from the El Nino weather pattern that helped fuel a spike in global temperatures to its opposite La Nina, which has a cooling effect.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Celeste Saulo reflected on a year of "widespread, intense and extended heatwaves".</p>

<p>"This is becoming too hot to handle," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

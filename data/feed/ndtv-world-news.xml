       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has released a video explaining its strikes deep inside Lebanon where it alleged Hezbollah had hidden weapons in populated areas.</p>

<p>The IDF said Hezbollah has been hiding weapons inside Lebanese homes.</p>

<p>"For the last 20 years, Hezbollah built its terror network within population centres in Lebanon - primarily throughout southern Lebanon, an area that they turned almost entirely into a launch pad to attack Israel," the IDF said.</p>

<p>"Hezbollah doesn't want you to watch this video. And they really don't want you to share it," it said in the video posted on X.</p>

<p>The IDF's video is being seen as an effort to ward off criticism over attacks in populated areas in Lebanon.</p>

<p>"The IDF has launched a defensive operation against the Hezbollah terror organisation by conducting precise intelligence-based strikes on hundreds of Hezbollah targets. Our goal is to thwart imminent attacks planned by Hezbollah who intended to use the very weapons that we destroyed - at Israeli homes," the IDF said.</p>

<p>"Our goal is to make sure that Israeli families can safely and securely return to their homes," it said.</p>

<p>In the latest strikes today, Israel bombed a Hezbollah commander's location in Beirut's southern suburbs, a source close to the group told news agency AFP, as Israel's army announced it was carrying out precision raids in the Lebanese capital.</p>

<p>"An Israeli strike targeted a Hezbollah commander," the security source said, requesting anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media. It is the fourth such attack targeting Hezbollah commanders in the area in a week.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French President Emmanuel Macron has voiced strong support for India's inclusion as a permanent member of a reformed United Nations Security Council (UNSC), along with Germany, Japan, Brazil, and two African nations.</p>

<p>"Germany, Japan, India and Brazil should be permanent members, as well as two countries that Africa would designate to represent it. New elected members should also be admitted," Mr Macron said while addressing the general debate at the 79th session of the UN General Assembly in New York early Thursday, India time.</p>

<p>The French President stressed the need for reforms within the UN to make it more effective and representative, particularly in light of the challenges posed by the current structure of the Security Council.</p>

<p>"The United Nations should not be discarded, but rather reformed to reflect today's realities," he said.</p>

<p>He said that the current Security Council, often blocked by conflicting interests, needs to evolve.</p>

<p>"Is there a better system? I don't think so. So let's just make these United Nations more effective, first by perhaps making them more representative. That is why France and I repeat here, is in favour of the Security Council being expanded," Mr Macron said.</p>

<p>The French President said that he hopes that "this reform will also make it possible to change working methods, to limit the right of veto in the event of mass crime and to focus on operational decisions that are necessary to maintain international peace and security. This is what we must have the courage and audacity to do and that we must carry forward with the current permanent members."</p>

<p>Earlier, Chilean President Gabriel Boric Font also advocated for India's inclusion, proposing a deadline for the reform to align the UNSC with modern geopolitical realities by the UN's 80th anniversary.</p>

<p>The call for India's permanent membership has also been echoed by other global leaders, including US President Joe Biden, who reiterated Washington's full support for India's bid during his recent bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>

<p>Russia, too, continues to back India's aspiration for a permanent seat, with the country's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov emphasising the need for greater representation of developing countries in the council during the ongoing annual UN event.</p>

<p>The growing consensus among world leaders highlights the urgency of reforming the UNSC to reflect the contemporary global order and ensure more inclusive and effective international governance.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ms Webb's death sparked a police investigation, with Gloucestershire Police arresting two individuals on suspicion of manslaughter.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alice Delsie Preete Webb, a 34-year-old mother of five and beauty therapist, died after undergoing a non-surgical liquid Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) procedure. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/09/26/mum-of-five-first-person-die-brazilian-butt-lift-procedure-uk-21675248/">Metro</a></em>, she is thought to be the first person in Britain to die from the risky procedure. As per the report, Ms Webb was an advanced aesthetic practitioner at Crystal Clear in Wotton-under-Edge, a market town in Gloucestershire. Ms Webb leaves behind her partner, Dane Knight, and their five children —Delsie, 15, Preete, 13, Gracie, 12, Nylie, 10, and Clarie, 7.</p>

<p>Her death sparked a police investigation, with Gloucestershire Police arresting two individuals on suspicion of manslaughter. Although they have been released on bail, the incident raises serious concerns about the risks of unregulated cosmetic procedures.</p>

<p>A Gloucestershire Police spokesperson said: ''Two people have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter following the death of a woman in her 30s in Gloucester.&nbsp;Police had been called by the ambulance service at around 11.35 pm on Monday (23 September) with a report a woman had become unwell following a suspected cosmetic procedure.&nbsp;She was taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital and died in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Her next of kin and the coroner are aware. The woman's family are being supported by specially trained officers. an investigation, led by the Major Crime Investigation Team, is ongoing.''</p>

<p>The procedure, which involves injecting hyaluronic acid and dermal fillers into the buttocks, was reportedly performed by an unqualified individual without medical training. The liquid BBL procedure typically costs around 2,500 pounds and takes approximately 60 minutes. However, its non-surgical nature can be misleading, as it still carries significant risks, especially when performed by unqualified practitioners.</p>

<p><strong>About Liquid Brazilian Butt Lift</strong></p>

<p>The liquid Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) differs from the traditional BBL, which involves fat grafting. Instead, liquid BBL uses injectable products for volumising and contouring, making it a less invasive procedure with no liposuction or fat transfer required. This results in a faster recovery time. However, the results of a liquid BBL are temporary, lasting approximately one to two years, depending on the product used and how the body metabolizes it.</p>

<p>In contrast, traditional BBL provides more long-lasting results, albeit at a higher cost, ranging from 5,000-6,000 pounds in the UK, with a procedure time of roughly two hours. The liquid BBL, on the other hand, typically costs 2,500 pounds and takes around 60 minutes to complete. Despite being marketed as a "risk-free" and "cheaper" alternative, liquid BBL carries risks, especially when performed by unqualified practitioners. Some individuals opt for the procedure in Turkey, where it is offered at a lower cost.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A sharp escalation in border warfare between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon has sent Western nations scrambling to update contingency plans for evacuations from the region.</p>

<p>Cyprus, the closest EU member to the Middle East, is a likely hub, having processed around 60,000 people fleeing the Hezbollah-Israel war in 2006.</p>

<p>Neighbouring Turkey has offered facilities as well.</p>

<p>Operations-wise, most contingency planning seems to be by sea, enabling movement of larger groups, but that will be defined by the security situation, a source familiar with the process told Reuters. It takes about 10 hours to Cyprus by sea, or 40 minutes by plane from Beirut.</p>

<p>Here are some details on contingency planning:</p>

<p><strong>Australia</strong></p>

<p>Authorities have made contingency plans that could include evacuation by sea, though it has urged an estimated 15,000 of its citizens in Lebanon to leave while Beirut airport remains open.</p>

<p><strong>Canada</strong></p>

<p>News reports from Canada suggest it will cooperate with Australia in evacuating nationals by sea. The plan involves contracting a commercial vessel to transport 1,000 people out each day, The Toronto Star reported.</p>

<p><strong>United Kingdom</strong></p>

<p>Britain has called for its nationals to leave immediately. It has moved around 700 troops to Cyprus, bolstering its presence in the area where it already has military assets, including two Royal Navy ships. It also has two military bases on the island.</p>

<p><strong>United States</strong></p>

<p>The US has ordered the deployment of dozens of troops to Cyprus to help prepare for scenarios, including an evacuation of Americans from Lebanon.</p>

<p><strong>Portugal</strong></p>

<p>Prime Minister Luis Montenegro on Wednesday advised against travel to Lebanon. The country has a plan to evacuate Portuguese citizens living there in cooperation with partner countries in the EU, he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan said Thursday it would have to go through "transitional pain" after the International Monetary Fund agreed to a new relief package of $7 billion to bolster its faltering economy.</p>

<p>Although the South Asian nation's economy has stabilised since it came close to defaulting last summer, it is dependent on IMF bailouts and loans from friendly countries to service its huge debt, which swallows up half of its annual revenues.</p>

<p>"There will be transitional pain, but if we are to make it the last programme, then we have to carry out structural reforms," Minister of Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb told local broadcaster Geo News.</p>

<p>The IMF said in a statement it would issue an "immediate disbursement" of around $1 billion.</p>

<p>The three-year loan programme "will require sound policies and reforms" to support Pakistan's ongoing efforts to strengthen its economy "and create conditions for a stronger, more inclusive, and resilient growth", it added.</p>

<p>Pakistan in July agreed to the deal -- its 24th IMF payout since 1958 -- in exchange for unpopular reforms, including cutting back on power subsidies and widening its chronically low tax base.</p>

<p>Speaking on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Wednesday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the deal came through thanks to the "tremendous support" of Saudi Arabia, China and the UAE.</p>

<p>"In the final phase (of negotiations), the IMF's conditions were related to China. The way the Chinese government supported and strengthened us during this time is something I am truly grateful for," he told reporters shortly before the deal was announced.</p>

<p>Last month, Aurangzeb had said Pakistan was negotiating a $12 billion loan reprofiling from bilateral lenders.</p>

<p>The amount comprised $5 billion from Saudi Arabia, $4 billion from China and $3 billion from the UAE for a three- to five-year period.</p>

<p>Reacting to the news, Pakistan's stock exchange briefly reached a new record high before losing ground in later trade.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Formidable vulnerabilities' -</strong></p>

<p>Kaiser Bengali, a Pakistani economist, told AFP: "This deal will help us pay back our immediate debts, but nothing more than that.</p>

<p>"The only economic reforms that we are required to implement is more taxes. There is no progress on reducing government expenditures."</p>

<p>At the end of 2023, Pakistan -- long locked in a cycle of overlapping political and economic crises -- had amassed a total debt of more than $250 billion, or 74 per cent of GDP, according to the IMF.</p>

<p>About 40 per cent of its debt is owed to external creditors in foreign currencies. Its biggest single foreign creditor is China and Chinese commercial banks, at just under $30 billion, followed by the World Bank at more than $20 billion, according to the report.</p>

<p>Last year the country came to the brink of default as the economy shrivelled amid political chaos following catastrophic 2022 monsoon floods and decades of mismanagement, as well as a global economic downturn.</p>

<p>It was saved by last-minute loans from friendly countries as well as an IMF rescue package.</p>

<p>Islamabad wrangled for months with IMF officials to unlock the latest loan, which came on the condition of reforms including hiking household bills to remedy a permanently crisis-stricken energy sector and raising pitiful tax takings.</p>

<p>In a nation of more than 240 million people where most jobs are in the informal sector, only 5.2 million filed income tax returns in 2022.</p>

<p>The IMF said Pakistan "has taken key steps to restore economic stability with consistent reforms". But "despite this progress, Pakistan's vulnerabilities and structural challenges remain formidable", it warned.</p>

<p>"A difficult business environment, weak governance, and an outsized role of the state hinder investment, which remains very low compared to peers," it added.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US Secret Service agent has been accused of sexually assaulting a staffer for Kamala Harris in a hotel room, <em>The Independent</em> reported. The alleged incident took place last week when an agent and several Harris staffers were dining and drinking alcohol at a restaurant in Wisconsin during an advance trip. The group reportedly went back to the staffer's hotel room when the unnamed Secret Service agent allegedly forced himself on her and groped her in front of others. Those inside the room then allegedly kicked the agent out into the hallway, where he was said to have been so drunk he passed out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The U.S. Secret Service Office of Professional Responsibility is investigating a misconduct allegation involving an employee," a Secret Service spokesperson said in a statement, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/secret-service-sexual-assault-harris-b2619047.html" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>The Independent</em></a>. "The Secret Service holds its personnel to the highest standards. The employee has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation," it added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Kamala Harris campaign office also confirmed the incident, saying that it was aware of the allegation. "We have zero tolerance for sexual misconduct," it told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/25/secret-service-harris-aide-assault" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>The Guardian</em></a>. "Senior OVP [Office of the Vice President] officials were alerted by the USSS about an incident involving an agent and informed that USSS initiated an investigation," it added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Secret Service agents have been accused of misbehaviour on trips in the past, including a 2012 scandal where agents in Colombia allegedly brought prostitutes back to a hotel. In 2014, the three agents then-US President Barack Obama were also sent home and suspended for excessive drinking during a trip to Amsterdam.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the recent incident comes as the agency tasked with protecting the president and presidential candidates faces enormous pressure after two recent failed assassination attempts against former President Donald Trump. A Senate report found repeated failures of leadership and communication at the July 13 Trump rally in which the Republican leader was shot in the ear by a would-be assassin perched on a nearby rooftop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"(United States Secret Service) failures in planning, communications, security, and allocations of resources... were foreseeable, preventable, and directly related to the events resulting in the assassination attempt," the report said.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The European Union on Thursday rejected as "reckless and irresponsible" a plan by President Vladimir Putin to authorise a nuclear response to a massive air attack on Russia.</p>

<p>Putin on Wednesday announced an updated nuclear doctrine that would allow the use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states when they are supported by nuclear powers -- a clear reference to Ukraine and its Western backers.</p>

<p>"Not for the first time, Putin is playing (a) gamble with his nuclear arsenal," EU foreign policy spokesman Peter Stano told reporters. "We of course strongly reject these threats."</p>

<p>The proposed broadening of Russia's nuclear rules, which Putin himself has the power to approve, comes as Ukraine seeks permission from Western allies to use long-range weaponry to strike targets deep inside Russia.</p>

<p>Kyiv says it is necessary to target Russia's airfields and military infrastructure that it uses to launch attacks on Ukraine. The United States and other Western countries are cautious about enabling further escalation.</p>

<p>Earlier on Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the planned changes should be seen as a "specific signal" to the West.</p>

<p>Western powers have accused Putin of dangerous nuclear sabre-rattling throughout the Ukraine conflict. The Kremlin leader has issued multiple apparent threats about Moscow's willingness to deploy nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>"This is just the continuation of the very irresponsible and unacceptable behaviour on the side of Putin," the EU's Stano said of the latest threat, which came as many world leaders attended the United Nations General Assembly in New York.</p>

<p>Putin's stance was all the more "reckless," Stano said, coming from the leader of a permanent member of the UN Security Council.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have made a new finding that provides a fascinating insight into the future of our solar system. A new exoplanet, about 1.9 times the mass of Earth, has been discovered around a white dwarf star, according to <em>ScienceAlert. </em>This extraordinary discovery throws light on the possible fate of our own planet as the Sun finally turns into a white dwarf.</p>

<p>Despite the planet's hostile conditions caused by the star's destructive red giant phase, the discovery provides insights into planetary evolution. White dwarfs, which are leftovers of stars such as the Sun, arise following the red giant period. This study, led by Keming Zhang of the University of California, focusses on how planets might survive this chaotic period, expanding our understanding of planetary survival and evolution.</p>

<p>"The simplest explanation is that the planet survived through the red giant host star," Zhang told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.sciencealert.com/earth-like-planet-discovered-orbiting-an-alien-star-theres-just-one-big-problem"><em>ScienceAlert.</em></a></p>

<p>"The white dwarf lens was nearly perfectly aligned with the background source star during the event, causing it to be magnified by over 1,000 times," Zhang explained.</p>

<p>"For these rare ultra-high magnification microlensing events, a companion as small as a terrestrial planet could significantly affect the magnification pattern, enabling us to accurately infer the lens configuration across a wide range of masses and orbital separations."</p>

<p>This allowed the researchers to not just determine the mass and orbital separation of the Earth-like, or terrestrial, exoplanet, but the presence of a brown dwarf orbiting the white dwarf, too, an object about 30 times the mass of Jupiter.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday his government had not responded to a push by the United States and its allies for a 21-day ceasefire in Israel's fight with the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah.</p>

<p>"It is an American-French proposal, which the prime minister has not even responded to," said a statement from Netanyahu's office, adding that he had ordered the army "to continue the fighting with full force".</p>

<p>The United States, European Union and other allies including several Arab states issued a joint call for a 21-day ceasefire in Lebanon after Israeli air strikes on Hezbollah killed hundreds and displaced tens of thousands in Lebanon this week.</p>

<p>The situation in Lebanon has become "intolerable" and "is in nobody's interest, neither of the people of Israel nor of the people of Lebanon," said a joint statement from US President Joe Biden, his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, and other allies.</p>

<p>"We call for an immediate 21-day ceasefire across the Lebanon-Israel border to provide space for diplomacy towards the conclusion of a diplomatic settlement."</p>

<p>The statement was issued jointly with Western powers, Japan and key Gulf Arab powers -- Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- as leaders met on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.</p>

<p>The call for a three-week ceasefire came hours after Israeli army chief Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi on Wednesday told soldiers to prepare for a possible ground offensive against Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Israeli aerial bombardment of Hezbollah strongholds around Lebanon has killed hundreds of people this week, while the militant group has hit back with barrages of rockets and said a ballistic missile targeted Tel Aviv.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sarco Pod, a futuristic capsule designed for assisted suicide, has sparked a massive controversy in Switzerland, especially after a 64-year-old American woman used one recently. Despite assisted suicide being legal in Switzerland, the incident has led to several arrests and scrutiny from authorities.</p>

<p><strong>What happened?</strong></p>

<p>On Monday, the Sarco Pod was used by a woman suffering from severe health issues at a woodland retreat in Merishausen, near the German border. Reports said she underwent a psychiatric assessment and wished to die due to years of suffering from a serious condition related to immune compromise. Her death was described as <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/if-you-want-to-die-chilling-message-us-woman-got-in-suicide-pod-6644385 ">“peaceful, fast, and dignified”</a> by Florian Willet, co-president of The Last Resort, the organisation behind the capsule.<br />
<br />
Following the incident, <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/swiss-police-make-arrests-after-suicide-capsule-is-used-for-first-time-6651845 ]">Swiss police arrested several people</a>, including Willet, and opened criminal proceedings for “inducing and aiding and abetting suicide.” Authorities said that they previously warned the organisation that using Sarco could have legal consequences.<br />
<br />
<strong>Is assisted suicide legal in Switzerland?</strong></p>

<p>In Switzerland, assisted suicide is permitted if the individual acts voluntarily and without coercion. However, active euthanasia – where a medical professional administers a lethal injection – is illegal. The legal framework says that those assisting in suicide must not do so for self-serving motives.<br />
<br />
<strong>Why the arrests?</strong></p>

<p>The arrests, following the incident, stem from concerns that the operators of the Sarco may have violated Swiss laws regarding assisted suicide. The authorities have opened an investigation to determine whether any criminal acts occurred in relation to the woman's death.</p>

<p>Swiss Interior Minister Elisabeth Baume-Schneider said on Monday that the Sarco capsule does not comply with existing product safety laws and it was “not legal”, AFP reported.</p>

<p><strong>How the Sarco pod works</strong></p>

<p>Invented by Philip Nitschke, a known figure in right-to-die advocacy, the Sarco Pod operates by filling a sealed chamber with nitrogen gas. This process reduces the oxygen levels significantly, leading to death by hypoxia. Once inside the pod, the user presses a button, triggering the release of nitrogen. According to Nitschke, the user loses consciousness within two minutes and dies within five minutes.</p>

<p>The use of this suicide pod has also led to some ethical debates about the nature of assisted dying. Some argue it provides a peaceful and self-directed option for those suffering, while critics worry about the implications of such devices and the potential for misuse or coercion.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The United States and its allies have called for a 21-day ceasefire on the Israel-Lebanon border, effective immediately.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States and its allies have called for a 21-day ceasefire on the Israel-Lebanon border, effective immediately. The proposed pause, endorsed by a 12-nation bloc, including the UK, EU and several Arab states, comes amid intense fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Israeli airstrikes have killed nearly 600 people and displaced roughly 5 lakh people in Lebanon since Monday.</p>

<p>The joint statement, issued by President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, stressed the need for safety and security, urging both Israel and Lebanon to agree to a temporary halt in hostilities. “The exchange of fire since October 7th, and in particular over the past two weeks, threatens a much broader conflict, and harm to civilians,” the leaders said. They said the proposed ceasefire would allow diplomatic efforts to succeed and “enable civilians to return to their homes.”</p>

<p>The call comes after Israel's military chief, Lt Gen <a href="http:// https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hints-at-lebanon-hezbollah-ground-invasion-as-joe-biden-warns-of-all-out-war-in-middle-east-6651437 ">Herzi Halevi, signalled that extensive airstrikes</a> on Hezbollah in Lebanon could lead to Israeli forces entering enemy territory. The joint statement by the US and its allies noted that the hostilities were presenting the risk of broader regional “escalations” across the border.</p>

<p>Despite the international push, official responses from the Israeli and Lebanese governments are still pending. According to a senior US official, negotiations with Lebanon are underway, expecting the government, and not Hezbollah, to take the lead in handling non-state actors within its borders, the BBC reported.</p>

<p>Earlier, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also called for an immediate ceasefire in Lebanon, cautioning that “hell is breaking loose.”</p>

<p>Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the airstrikes, calling them a violation of Lebanese sovereignty. He hoped for a resolution that pressured Israel into agreeing to the ceasefire, adding, “We are facing blatant violations of our sovereignty and human rights.”</p>

<p>In response, Israel's UN envoy, Danny Danon, maintained that Israel does not seek a full-scale war but is committed to using “all means at our disposal” to protect its citizens, in line with international laws.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, cross-border attacks continue, with Hezbollah targeting Israeli military and intelligence installations.</p>

<p>Iran, Hezbollah's primary backer, condemned Israel's airstrikes, warning that the Middle East is facing a “full-scale catastrophe.” Tehran also vowed it would support Lebanon by “all means necessary” should Israel intensify its military offensive.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 64-year-old woman from the US recently died by suicide using the Sarco suicide pod at a woodland retreat in Switzerland. The device delivered a haunting message in her final moments: “If you want to die, press this button,” reported AFP. The Sarco pod, with its futuristic design, operates by filling with nitrogen, leading to death through hypoxia. This self-operated, human-sized capsule has raised legal and ethical questions in Switzerland, where active euthanasia is illegal, yet assisted dying has been permitted for decades.</p>

<p>On the day the pod was used, Switzerland's Interior Minister, Elisabeth Baume-Schneider, told lawmakers that the Sarco remained “not legal,” leading to a fresh debate around its use.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at what the Sarco suicide pod is, how it works, and the controversies.<br />
<br />
<strong>What is the Sarco Pod?</strong><br />
<br />
The <a href="https://www.exitinternational.net/sarco/">Sarco pod</a>, short for sarcophagus, is a controversial euthanasia device that has attracted significant attention due to its innovative design and intended use. This 3D-printed, detachable capsule is mounted on a stand and contains a canister of liquid nitrogen, allowing individuals to end their lives through inert gas asphyxiation. First introduced in Switzerland in 2019, the capsule offers a means for people to die without the need for medical supervision. It releases nitrogen gas inside and reduces the oxygen levels to lethal amounts.<br />
<br />
The Sarco pod is the brainchild of Philip Nitschke, an Australian physician known for his advocacy of assisted suicide since the 1990s. His work has played a significant role in the ongoing discussions around the ethics and legality of euthanasia, according to CNN.<br />
<br />
The 3D-printable Sarco capsule cost over 6,50,000 euros (around Rs 6.06 crore) to research and develop in the Netherlands over 12 years, according to AFP.<br />
<br />
<strong>How does the Sarco pod work?</strong><br />
<br />
The Sarco pod replaces the oxygen inside with nitrogen, resulting in death by hypoxia. To operate the Sarco pod, the individual wishing to die must follow some steps:</p>

<ul>
	<li>To use the Sarco, individuals must first pass a psychiatric assessment.</li>
	<li>Users climb into the capsule, close the lid, and answer automated questions about their identity and understanding of the process.</li>
	<li>Once the button is pressed, the oxygen level in the capsule drops from 21% to 0.05% in less than 30 seconds.</li>
	<li>Individuals quickly lose consciousness and die within approximately five minutes.</li>
	<li>An emergency exit button is also located inside the pod, providing a potential escape route if needed.</li>
	<li>Once the hypoxia process is complete, the biodegradable capsule can be detached from the machine's base, allowing it to serve as the deceased individual's coffin.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nitschke's Exit International, which owns the Sarco, is a non-profit organisation funded by donations, with users only paying 18 Swiss francs (around Rs 1,769) for the nitrogen.<br />
<br />
<strong>Its legality in Switzerland</strong><br />
<br />
Switzerland has permitted assisted suicide since the 1940s, saying the ones assisting must have no direct interest in the individual's death. This legal framework has established Switzerland as a notable "death tourism" destination, attracting individuals from around the globe seeking the right to end their lives on their terms, Reuters reported. The use of the Sarco suicide pod has led to a renewed debate on the ethics and legality of euthanasia not just in Switzerland but across the world.</p><p><div class='table-div suicide'><table class='table'><thead><tr><th colspan='2'>Helplines</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vandrevala Foundation for Mental Health</td><td><a href='tel:+919999666555'>9999666555</a> or <a href='mailto:help@vandrevalafoundation.com'>help@vandrevalafoundation.com</a> </td></tr><tr><td>TISS iCall</td><td><a href='tel:+912225521111'>022-25521111</a> (Monday-Saturday: 8 am to 10 pm)</td></tr> <tr><td colspan='2'>(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Frano Selak, a Croatian man, miraculously cheated death seven times before eventually winning the lottery.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Frane Selak, an elderly Croatian man, is known around the world for being the luckiest man alive. What has happened with him has been more like movie scripts, which are larger than life but mostly unbelievable. However, Selak believes that reality is much stranger than anything the film industry can offer. Let's explore this intriguing story of a man whose life has been filled with a remarkable string of incredibly awful events.</p>

<p>This modest man was born in 1929 in Croatia. As a music teacher, which is hardly a thrilling job out there, he had a quite ordinary life. That is, until a tragic bus and train ride that started an absurdly long chain of events</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-27414609.amp"><em>the BBC,</em></a> Frano Selak is an octogenarian music teacher from Croatia. His run of near escapes began back, he says, in 1957, when he plunged into the river on a bus. Six more brushes with death followed. His train derailed and hurtled into a river; he walked away from not one but two exploding cars and survived a plane crash by landing on a haystack after being thrown clear. A protruding tree saved him when he drove off a cliff, and he bounced back from being hit by a bus. Then, as if to prove that he was the luckiest-rather than the unluckiest-man in the world, Selak won around $1 million (Rs 8,36,77,100) in a lottery, giving most of it away to friends and family.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ripleys.com/stories/unluckiest-man"><em>Ripley's,</em></a> in the mid-2000s, as though to make up for the horrible, horrible deal Lady Luck had given him, Selak won the lottery in Croatia. His jackpot was worth around $1 million (Rs 8,36,77,100). With this, he bought a luxurious home, only to have a change of heart and sell it in 2010. He returned to a humble life with his fifth wife.</p>

<p>Whatever happened along the way, Frane's story has a happy ending. He spent the last of his winnings on a hip operation and on a shrine to the Virgin Mary in thanks for his good fortune.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mira Murati quit as the Chief Technology Officer of OpenAI on Wednesday. She's the latest to join a growing list of high-profile exits from the company. Ms Murati's decision comes after six years with the artificial intelligence pioneer behind ChatGPT.</p>

<p>In a post on X, Ms Murati described her time at OpenAI as “an extraordinary privilege” and her decision to leave as “difficult.” “There's never an ideal time to walk away from a place one cherishes, but the moment feels right. I want to create the time and space to do my exploration,” she said.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded with a touching tribute to X, thanking her for her contributions and conveying his support.&nbsp;“It's hard to overstate how much Mira has meant to OpenAI, our mission, and to us all personally,” the CEO wrote. “I feel tremendous gratitude towards her for what she has helped us build and accomplish.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>He said he was "excited for what she'll do next."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Mira Murati, 35, played a major role in developing ChatGPT and overseeing releases of image generator Dall-E and AI code generator Codex. Her exit comes after her brief tenure as interim CEO following Mr Altman's ousting last November.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sam Altman announced Mark Chen as senior VP of research and Josh Achiam as head of mission alignment to ensure a smooth transition.</p>

<p>Mira Murati's departure follows those of co-founders Greg Brockman (on extended leave) and John Schulman (joined rival Anthropic), as well as a product team leader and former Meta employee. Earlier this year, co-founder Ilya Sutskever exited OpenAI after a boardroom dispute. Ms Murati's exit now leaves only two of its 11 founders remaining.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The shakeup comes as OpenAI releases its new Strawberry AI model, designed to improve "thinking" in generative AI chatbots. The company aims to address "hallucinations" - persuasive but incorrect content - and provide more accurate responses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A Japanese court on Thursday acquitted Iwao Hakamada, the world's longest-serving death row prisoner, closing a nearly six decades-long chapter.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Japanese court on Thursday acquitted Iwao Hakamada, the world's longest-serving death row prisoner, closing a nearly six decades-long chapter. After spending nearly half a century in solitary confinement, Hakamada was finally declared innocent of the 1968 murders that led to his conviction.</p>

<p>At 88, the former professional boxer was not present in the courtroom due to fragile health, but his 91-year-old sister, Hideko Hakamada, stood in his place, bowing deeply to the judge as the verdict was read. “The court finds the defendant innocent,” declared Judge Koshi Kunii at the Shizuoka District Court, as per AFP.</p>

<p>In 1968, Iwao Hakamada was convicted for the brutal murders of his boss, his boss's wife, and their two teenage children. The family was found stabbed to death in their home, which was subsequently set on fire. Hakamada, who worked at a soybean processing plant owned by the victim, confessed to the crime after 20 days of police interrogation, only to later retract his confession, saying it was forced through violence and intimidation.</p>

<p>Human rights activists have long decried Japan's so-called "hostage justice" system, where suspects are subjected to long periods of detention and aggressive questioning, often leading to forced confessions.</p>

<p>For nearly half a century, Iwao Hakamada lived in solitary confinement, waiting for the hangman's noose. Japan, unlike many industrialised nations, still retains the death penalty. Executions are carried out by hanging, and inmates are notified only hours before their execution.</p>

<p>Hakamada's lengthy detention took a significant toll on his mental health. According to his lawyers, he often appears disoriented, living in what they describe as a "world of fantasy."&nbsp;</p>

<p>His sister, Hideko Hakamada, who has campaigned tirelessly for his release, said her brother struggled to recognise reality. "We have not even discussed the trial with Iwao because of his inability to recognize reality," Ms Hideko, now 91, told AFP. "Sometimes he smiles happily, but that's when he's in his delusion."</p>

<p>Despite his mental state, Hakamada's brief taste of freedom over the past decade has provided some solace. According to Ms Hideko, small acts, such as taking care of two cats he adopted in February, have helped him reconnect with life outside prison walls. He also enjoys daily drives with his supporters, during which he indulges in his favourite pastries and juice.</p>

<p>Supporters of Hakamada gathered outside the court on Thursday with many holding banners and flags demanding his acquittal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"For so long, we have fought a battle that has felt endless," Hideko Hakamada said during a press conference earlier this year. "But this time, I believe it will be settled."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Iwao Hakamada's legal team, led by Hideyo Ogawa, is hopeful that the court will deliver a not-guilty verdict, bringing an end to this decades-long ordeal. "We told prosecutors that the onus is on them to put an end to this 58-year-old case," Mr Ogawa told reporters. However, prosecutors remain adamant that the initial conviction was just and that Hakamada should face the death penalty.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[According to reports, Kate Middleton played a significant role in composing the birthday greeting for Prince Harry.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prince Harry celebrated his 40th birthday on September 15, receiving warm wishes from his sister-in-law Kate Middleton and brother Prince William on social media.</p>

<p>Reports indicate that Kate played a significant role in composing the birthday greeting shared on the official accounts of the Prince and Princess of Wales&nbsp;after spotting signs Harry was "homesick".</p>

<p>They posted a heartfelt message on X (formerly Twitter), celebrating Harry's special day.</p>

<p>The message read: “Wishing a Happy 40th Birthday to The Duke of Sussex!”</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Wishing a Happy 40th Birthday to The Duke of Sussex! <a href="https://t.co/ZKJbYDmV6L">https://t.co/ZKJbYDmV6L</a></p>
— The Prince and Princess of Wales (@KensingtonRoyal) <a href="https://twitter.com/KensingtonRoyal/status/1835250588692455712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>According to a report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1952573/prince-kate-prince-harry-call-birthday-worrying" rel="nofollow,noindex">Daily Express</a>, an insider said that Kate, who worried about the Duke of Sussex feeling “homesick”, was behind this kind gesture.</p>

<p>This public acknowledgement didn't go unnoticed among royal observers, given the ongoing tensions between the brothers. The Daily Express, citing a source, reported that Kate was the “driving force” behind reaching out to Harry, “as she slowly makes good on her vow to restore some kind of peace and forgiveness between the estranged royal and his family before it's too late.”</p>

<p>Despite the geography separating them, she ensured Harry received a birthday call and a thoughtful gift to celebrate the occasion.</p>

<p>“She (Kate) told William in no uncertain terms that this is not the time for resentment, they needed to show the world that love and family are front and centre of their values, but more importantly she wanted Harry to have this message on his big day,” The Daily Express quoted the insider as saying.</p>

<p>The source also added the outreach meant a great deal to Harry.<br />
<br />
Living in California with the Duchess of Sussex and their children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, Harry celebrated his special day with family before reportedly heading out for a gathering with friends.</p>

<p>The birthday messages marked the first public acknowledgement from the royal family since 2021, following Harry's controversial claims about the family in his interview with Oprah Winfrey and in his memoir, <em>Spare.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Plenty Richmond Farm is engineered to produce over four million pounds (1.8 million kg) of strawberries annually.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An innovative new agricultural project has started in Richmond, Virginia, United States, representing an impressive step forward in sustainable food production. The Plenty Richmond Farm is the world's first indoor, vertically farmed berries facility at a scale where they are harvested and preserved.</p>

<p>This new technique, backed by a worldwide team of scientists, which promises to make it possible to produce ample food supplies without badly impacting the environment. The farm-based approach uses towering structures in controlled conditions to grow strawberries, dramatically less land compared with traditional agriculture.</p>

<p>The strawberries, developed in collaboration with the multinational corporation Driscoll's, are anticipated to hit grocery store shelves in early 2025. This invention marks a significant expansion of vertical farming capabilities, which have previously been centred on leafy greens such as lettuce.</p>

<p>"With agriculture serving as the Commonwealth's largest private sector industry, Plenty choosing Virginia for the world's first farm to grow indoor, vertically farmed berries at scale reinforces Virginia's leading role in the controlled environment agriculture industry," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/plenty-opens-worlds-first-farm-to-grow-indoor-vertically-farmed-berries-at-scale-302255372.html">said Governor Glenn Youngkin.</a> "Plenty's farm will boost local agriculture production and drive economic development, all while diversifying against risks and protecting the environment. We look forward to supporting their innovative approaches to revolutionizing the industry, and know that Plenty's success will be Virginia's success."&nbsp;</p>

<p>By managing temperature, light, and humidity, the farm can improve plant growth and pollination, resulting in more consistent and high-quality product. This fresh approach is projected to reduce waste while increasing overall efficiency in the agriculture industry.</p>

<p>"This farm is a model for the positive impact climate-agnostic agriculture can have, and proof that vertical farming can deliver the crop diversity, scaled and local production needed to future-proof the global food system," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/plenty-opens-worlds-first-farm-to-grow-indoor-vertically-farmed-berries-at-scale-302255372.html">said Arama Kukutai</a>, Plenty CEO. "The Plenty Richmond Farm is the culmination of 200 research trials over the past six years to perfect growing strawberries with consistent peak-season flavor indoors year-round. Driscoll's sets an incredibly high bar for the quality of its berries and we're excited to join forces to consistently deliver an ultra-premium Driscoll's strawberry year-round."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati on Wednesday said she is leaving the company behind ChatGPT, adding to a growing list of high-level departures. Murati called her more than six years at the San Francisco-based company "an extraordinary privilege" and described her decision to leave as difficult in a post on X, formerly Twitter.</p>

<p>"There's never an ideal time to walk away from a place one cherishes, but the moment feels right," Murati said in the post.</p>

<p>"I want to create the time and space to do my own exploration."</p>

<p>OpenAI chief Sam Altman replied to Murati's post with his thanks for what Murati has helped the company build, and promised details on a transition plan soon.</p>

<p>Murati is the latest influential member of the OpenAI team to step away from their position.</p>

<p>Co-founder Greg Brockman is on an extended leave of absence and fellow OpenAI founder John Schulman left for AI sector rival Anthropic, according to a report in The Information.</p>

<p>A product team leader who OpenAI had lured over from Meta also left, the report said.</p>

<p>OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever exited OpenAI early this year in the wake of a boardroom battle that saw Altman temporarily ousted from the company.</p>

<p>OpenAI earlier this month released a new series of artificial intelligence models designed to spend more time thinking -- in hopes that generative AI chatbots provide more accurate and beneficial responses.</p>

<p>The new model, nicknamed Strawberry, is designed to tackle complex tasks and solve more challenging problems in science, coding and mathematics -- something that earlier models have been criticized for failing to provide consistently.</p>

<p>Unlike their predecessors, these models have been trained to refine their thinking processes, try different methods and recognize mistakes before they deploy a final answer.</p>

<p>OpenAI's push to improve "thinking" in its model is a response to the persistent problem of "hallucinations" in AI chatbots.</p>

<p>This refers to their tendency to generate persuasive but incorrect content that has somewhat cooled the excitement over ChatGPT-style AI features among business customers.</p>

<p>The new release came as OpenAI was raising funds that could see it valued around $150 billion, which would make it one of the world's most valuable private companies, according to US media.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Former staffers alleged that the 42-year-old royal mistreated employees and often made them feel "like s**t."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following accusations labelling her as "just terrible," "a dictator," and "absolutely relentless," Meghan Markle is now facing fresh claims regarding her conduct as a boss. In a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/former-employees-of-demon-meghan-markle-share-their-truth-on-her-psycho-moments" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>Daily Beast </em></a>report, a former staff member described the Duchess of Sussex as a "demon" prone to "psycho moments." Former staffers alleged that the 42-year-old royal mistreated employees and often made them feel "like s**t."</p>

<p>One ex-staffer, who claimed to have worked for Meghan and Prince Harry during their time at the palace, was particularly critical.</p>

<p>"There were definitely bad, even psycho moments," the source told the Daily Beast. "I saw people being berated in person and over the phone, made to feel like s-t."</p>

<p>The source admitted it was a stressful period and gave the royal the benefit of the doubt, referencing her admission of suicidal thoughts.</p>

<p>Another source, who reportedly worked with Meghan leading up to her 2018 wedding, labelled her a "narcissist."</p>

<p>"I always thought she was a classic narcissist, and getting her staff to praise her in magazines only confirmed it," the insider said, adding, "She's lovely when things go her way but a demon when they don't."</p>

<p>A different insider alleged a florist was "screamed at" for over half an hour for posting a minor detail about a bouquet online.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"They vowed never to work with her again, despite the prestige," the insider noted, claiming staff were often treated "like tradesmen who could be treated like s-t."</p>

<p>While The Daily Beast's report paints Markle in a negative light, Us Weekly released a more favourable account, featuring positive remarks from Ben Browning, who worked on Meghan and Harry's 2022 Netflix documentary, and former chief of staff Catherine St-Laurent, both describing their time with the couple as meaningful and supportive.</p>

<p>However, the Hollywood Reporter presented a contrasting narrative, with sources accusing Markle of belittling her staff and acting as a "dictator in high heels." One source claimed to have witnessed her reduce "grown men to tears."</p>

<p>Throughout the years, Markle and Prince Harry have faced a high turnover of staff. In 2018, Buckingham Palace investigated claims of Meghan's bullying behavior, but the findings were never made public, with Markle dismissing the allegations as part of a "calculated smear campaign."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Hindu College in Delhi has expressed its "immense pride" in its alumna, Harini Amarasuriya, becoming the 16th Prime Minister of Sri Lanka.</p>

<p>"Hindu College proudly celebrates the remarkable achievement of its alumna, Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, who has made history by becoming the 16th Prime Minister of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and the third woman to hold this prestigious office. Dr. Harini's journey from the classrooms of Hindu College to the highest office in her country is a moment of immense pride for her alma mater," the college said in a statement.</p>

<p>Amarasuriya of the National People's Power (NPP) party is an academic, rights activist, and university lecturer and is known for her work in education and social justice. Her appointment marks a significant milestone in Sri Lankan politics.</p>

<p>Reflecting on this extraordinary milestone, Hindu College's principal, Prof. Anju Srivastava, shared, "Dr. Harini Amarasuriya was a student of the Sociology Department during her academic years at Hindu College from 1991 to 1994. We are incredibly proud of her success and her rise to such a significant leadership role. We are sure that her time at Hindu College played a part in shaping her path to becoming a transformative leader."</p>

<p>Hindu College has long fostered leadership skills through its unique student-led parliamentary system, where students elect a prime minister and leader of the opposition each year.</p>

<p>"This system broadens students' horizons and helps cultivate the leaders of tomorrow. Dr. Harini Amarasuriya is a shining example of how this experience can inspire and empower students to make a lasting impact on society and their nation," Srivastava said .</p>

<p>"We are confident that Dr. Harini Amarasuriya's leadership, vision, and unwavering commitment to public service will serve as a beacon of hope for Sri Lanka, guiding the nation towards greater progress and prosperity," she added.</p>

<p>Amarasuriya becomes Sri Lanka's third woman Prime Minister after Sirimavo Bandaranaike and Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. The new Sri Lankan PM is the first academic-turned-politician to assume office. Harini Amarasuriya entered Parliament through the NPP national list in 2020.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

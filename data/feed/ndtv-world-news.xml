       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pope Francis said Friday that he considered both candidates for the US presidency "against life", citing Donald Trump's anti-immigrant policies and Kamala Harris's support for abortion rights.</p>

<p>"Both are against life. The one who discards migrants and the one who kills children. Both are against life," Francis told reporters aboard his plane returning to Rome after a 12-day tour of Asia.</p>

<p>"I am not an American and I will not be voting there. But let it be clear: both sending migrants away and not giving migrants the ability to work or welcoming them is a sin, it is serious," he said.</p>

<p>Former president Trump has promised to round up illegal immigrants and deport them as he seeks to return to the White House in the looming November election.</p>

<p>He also paved the way for a 2022 US Supreme Court overturning of Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling that made abortion a national right for women -- a right that Harris has pledged to restore.</p>

<p>"One has to choose the lesser of two evils. Who is the lesser evil? That lady or that gentleman? I don't know. Everyone have to think and make this decision according to their conscience," Francis said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris again took their campaigns to battleground states Friday as a racially charged row over Haitian immigrants intensified with the Republican leader promising "large deportations."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris again took their campaigns to battleground states Friday as a racially charged row over Haitian immigrants intensified with the Republican leader promising "large deportations."</p>

<p>Trump, 78, was due to hold a rally later Friday in Nevada, where his campaign says he will focus on voters' economic worries, including inflation.</p>

<p>Harris, coming off a strong performance in Tuesday's televised debate against Trump, was headed to Pennsylvania -- arguably the most crucial of the swing states that decide the winner in close presidential elections.</p>

<p>Opinion polls show a near dead heat with only seven weeks until election day.</p>

<p>Stung by widespread agreement, including among some prominent Republicans, that Democrat Harris won Tuesday's debate, Trump is doubling down on harsh rhetoric about illegal immigration -- the issue at the core of his campaign.</p>

<p>In remarks from his luxury golf course near Los Angeles, Trump accused "communist" Harris of "allowing illegal aliens to stampede across our border."</p>

<p>And he homed in on the small Ohio city of Springfield, saying Haitian immigrants there are "destroying their way of life."</p>

<p>"We will do large deportations from Springfield, Ohio," he said. "We're going to have the largest deportation in the history of our country."</p>

<p>Springfield is at the center of swirling conspiracy theory spread by Republicans and Trump's campaign that claims Haitians are eating local residents' pets.</p>

<p>On Friday, Springfield authorities evacuated schools for a second day amid unspecified threats linked to the growing tension.</p>

<p>The head of the local Haitian community center, Viles Dorsainvil, told AFP that the FBI was investigating threatening phone calls to the organization.</p>

<p>Trump magnified the false story about the pets in extended comments Thursday where he claimed park geese were likewise being killed by Haitians -- and told a rally that "young American girls being raped and sodomized and murdered by savage criminal aliens."</p>

<p>President Joe Biden, who dropped out of his own reelection campaign to endorse Harris instead, intervened Friday to say that Trump "has to stop" inflaming tensions, and that "there's no place in America for this."</p>

<p><strong>- Far-right entourage -</strong></p>

<p>There was also mounting controversy over the presence of far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer in Trump's entourage.</p>

<p>She traveled with him to the debate on Tuesday and also accompanied him to Ground Zero on the anniversary of the September 11 attacks -- despite having claimed that the deadliest terrorist attack in US history was an "inside job."</p>

<p>"I don't control Laura, Laura says what she wants," Trump told reporters in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>"Laura has been a supporter of mine," he said, adding that he'd never heard she had spread 9/11 conspiracies.</p>

<p>Loomer has drawn fire from even hard-right Republicans over her comment that Harris, whose mother was Indian, would make the White House "smell like curry."</p>

<p>As November 5 election day rapidly approaches, Trump has been forced to pivot his campaign to fight Harris, rather than Biden, who at 81 was seen by his own Democratic Party as unlikely to win.</p>

<p>Trump's struggles have been increasingly visible, including his televised remarks at the golf course Friday.</p>

<p>He spoke defensively about the polls, which he claimed showed him far ahead, and insisted again that he had dominated Harris at the debate. He has also refused her challenge to hold another debate.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Trump was in the toss-up state of Arizona, while Harris held two rallies in North Carolina, likewise a battleground.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Turn the page' -</strong></p>

<p>Harris, 59, has largely avoided responding directly to Trump's personal attacks, choosing to pitch herself as a leader from a new generation who will end the constant drama and division that characterized Trump's presidency and post-presidential career.</p>

<p>When Trump brought up the false story about pets being eaten by migrants in their debate, she responded by shaking her head disbelievingly.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Harris told rally-goers in North Carolina, "It's time to turn the page."</p>

<p>Despite raising huge amounts of donations and drawing neck-and-neck with Trump in the polls, Harris again insisted Thursday that she still has a lot of work to do.</p>

<p>"We know ours will be a very tight race until the very end. We are the underdog. Let's be clear about that," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Pope Francis on Friday criticized both former U.S. President Donald Trump over his plan to deport millions of immigrants and Vice President Kamala Harris over her stance supporting abortion rights.</p>

<p>Asked about the U.S. presidential election on his flight back to Rome from Singapore, the pope said not welcoming migrants is a "grave" sin, and likened having an abortion to an "assassination".</p>

<p>He said U.S. Catholics would have to "choose the lesser evil" when they vote in November, without elaborating.</p>

<p>Francis was speaking in a press conference with journalists after a demanding 12-day tour across Southeast Asia and Oceania. Although the pope did not use Trump and Harris' names, he referred specifically to their policies and their genders. Despite criticizing both candidates, he said Catholics should vote.</p>

<p>"Not voting is ugly," the 87-year-old pontiff said. "It is not good. You must vote."</p>

<p>"You must choose the lesser evil," he said. "Who is the lesser evil? That lady, or that gentleman? I don't know. Everyone, in conscience, (has to) think and do this."</p>

<p>American Catholics, numbering roughly 52 million nationwide, are often seen as crucial swing voters. In some battleground states, including Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, more than 20% of adults are Catholic.</p>

<p>Francis, leader of about 1.4 billion Catholics globally, is usually careful about weighing in on national political elections. But he frequently criticizes abortion, which is forbidden by Catholic teaching, in sharp terms. He has also previously criticized Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. During the 2016 election, he said Trump was "not Christian" in his views.</p>

<p>On Friday, Francis said both candidates' policies are "against life".</p>

<p>"Whether it is the one who is chasing away migrants, or the one who that kills children," said the pope. "Both are against life."</p>

<p>Trump has promised to crack down on illegal immigration and deport millions of immigrants already in the U.S. if elected to a second term as president. He has also refused to rule out building detention camps for undocumented immigrants.</p>

<p>Harris has promised to sign any legislation passed by Congress to restore national protections for abortion access, which were struck down by the Supreme Court in its 2022 Dobbs decision.</p>

<p>The two candidates sparred over both issues on Wednesday in their first debate together. Most polls show a tight race, with Harris leading slightly.</p>

<p>The pope called immigration "a right," citing Bible passages that call orphans, widows and foreigners three kinds of people that society must care for. "Not giving welcome to migrants is a sin," said the pope. "It is grave."</p>

<p>Francis said abortion "is killing a human being". He said there could be no excuses for an abortion. "It is an assassination," he said. "On these things we must speak clearly. No 'but' or 'however'."</p>

<p>Balancing political priorities has become a subject of discussion among the U.S. bishops, who have issued a similar election guidance each presidential cycle since 2007-08, with some updates.</p>

<p>Their latest version, released with a new introduction in November 2023, states that the "threat of abortion" is a "preeminent priority" for Catholics.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A Brazilian businessman, Leo Kryss, has filed a lawsuit against realtor Douglas Elliman, alleging he was misled into selling his Miami Beach mansion for $6 million less to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Brazilian businessman alleges a realtor deceived him into selling his Miami Beach mansion for $6 million lower than its true worth to Amazon Boss Jeff Bezos and is now suing him, according to a lawsuit reported reported by <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Leo Kryss, one of the founders of the Brazilian toy and electronics company Tectoy, claims the real estate company Douglas Elliman told him that a prospective buyer for his house in exclusive Indian Creek Village won't pay more than $79 million. Mr Kryss had listed the seven-bedroom, 11 1/2-bathroom mansion, covering 19,000 square feet, for $85 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now Kryss is suing Elliman for the $6 million he believes he forfeited by not realizing Bezos was the buyer, according to people familiar with the matter, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/luxury-homes/jeff-bezos-indian-creek-home-lawsuit-3403cdc7?mod=hp_trending_now_article_pos5"><em>The WSJ.</em></a></p>

<p>The lawsuit filed in July by Kryss said that he asked Douglas Elliman CEO Jay Parker if the interested buyer was the world's second richest man, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Parker allegedly let him know that Bezos had nothing to do with it. Later on, in fact, Kryss would agree to sell the mansion for $79 million, unconscious of the fact that Bezos was indeed the buyer, according to the complaint.</p>

<p>The legal dispute highlights the significance of transparency in high-profile real estate deals. At the moment, Kryss is suing them over fraud allegations by the real estate firm.</p>

<p>"Wealthy individuals often shield their identities throughout the process of purchasing a home, from the initial showing through the closing," Miami real estate agent Danny Hertzberg told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/luxury-homes/jeff-bezos-indian-creek-home-lawsuit-3403cdc7?mod=hp_trending_now_article_pos5"><em>WSJ</em></a>. "Many billionaires, when they're purchasing a property, are concerned that when the seller knows their identity, they're going to want a larger number," he said.</p>

<p>In February of last year, Bezos announced his move to Miami from Seattle. He now owns more than four bayfront acres on Indian Creek Island, a gated community sometimes referred to as the Billionaire Bunker. The island has drawn well-known residents, including Tom Brady, Jared Kushner, and Ivanka Trump.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced Friday that 49 Ukrainian POWs had been returned from Russia, with AFP witnessing the group being greeted at the border with Belarus.</p>

<p>Zelensky did not clarify whether it was part of an exchange with Russia, as is usually the case, but AFP journalists had earlier seen Russian prisoners of war being loaded onto a bus near the border.</p>

<p>It would be the second exchange between the warring countries since Kyiv's surprise incursion into Russia's Kursk region.</p>

<p>Zelensky said civilians were also among the returnees, including a "girl who was taken hostage when she came to take care of her sick father".</p>

<p>He said the exchange also included fighters from Mariupol's 2022 Azovstal battle, as well as soldiers, border guards and police officers.</p>

<p>AFP spoke to two women in their 20s wrapped in Ukrainian flags and receiving flowers, who said they were at the Azovstal plant that fell to Russia after a siege in 2022.</p>

<p>"I'm finally home, I can't believe it," said 28-year-old Tamara Miroshnikova, commander of an armed vehicle of Ukraine's National Guard, said.</p>

<p>Another woman, 29-year-old Tetiana Bugay, said she was a medic at the Azov brigade that fought for Azovstal.</p>

<p>Earlier, AFP saw the Ukrainian military driving Russian POWs in a bus, some were wearing hoods hiding their faces, which were removed as they were loaded into a minivan.</p>

<p>AFP spoke to some of them briefly, and all those who spoke said they were taken captive during Ukraine's surprise Kursk offensive last month.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pop star Justin Timberlake was handed a sentence of community service on Friday after he changed his plea to guilty following his arrest for drunk driving, US media reported.</p>

<p>On June 18, the 43-year-old entertainer was pulled over in the town of Sag Harbor, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of New York City, after police observed his BMW go through a stop sign and struggle to stay within road lanes.</p>

<p>Sag Harbor Village Justice Court justice Carl Irace handed Timberlake a community service sentence and ordered the star to make a public statement after the 43-year-old pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of driving while alcohol impaired, The New York Post reported.</p>

<p>The officer who pulled over the "Cry Me a River" singer said he was in no fit state to drive.</p>

<p>"His eyes were bloodshot and glassy, a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage was emanating from his breath, he was unable to divide attention, he had slowed speech, he was unsteady afoot, and he performed poorly on all standardized field sobriety tests," the police report said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The co-founder of the deadly Mexican Sinaloa cartel, Ismael Zambada, appeared in court in Brooklyn Friday, pleading not guilty to a raft of charges following his arrest in a dramatic sting by US agents.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The accused Mexican kingpin Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking charges on Friday in the same New York courthouse where fellow Sinaloa cartel co-founder Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman was convicted five years earlier.</p>

<p>Zambada entered the plea to the 17 felony counts he faces, which also include money laundering and weapons charges, at a hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge James Cho in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Cho ordered that Zambada, 76, be jailed pending trial.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Francisco Navarro called Zambada "one of the most, if not the most, powerful narcotics kingpins in the world."</p>

<p>"A United States jail cell is the only thing that will prevent the defendant from committing further crimes and ensure his return to court," Navarro told the hearing.</p>

<p>Defense lawyer Frank Perez did not object to prosecutors' request to jail Zambada.</p>

<p>Wearing a gray short-sleeve shirt, Zambada did not speak other than to answer "yes" or "no" to the judge's questions through an interpreter.</p>

<p>Zambada was taken into custody on July 25 at a New Mexico airfield along with one of Guzman's sons, Joaquin Guzman Lopez, in a major coup for U.S. law enforcement.</p>

<p>He was then taken to El Paso, Texas, where he pleaded not guilty in federal court to separate drug trafficking charges.</p>

<p>U.S. District Judge Kathleen Cardone last week had him transferred to Brooklyn after the U.S. Department of Justice asked that he face trial there first.</p>

<p>Zambada was wheelchair bound for his first court appearance in El Paso, but walked on his own on Friday.</p>

<p>"His health is very good," Perez told reporters after the hearing.</p>

<p>The Brooklyn case began in 2009 and includes allegations related to the trafficking of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid fueling an epidemic in the United States.</p>

<p>Zambada is next due in court on Oct. 31.</p>

<p>"El Chapo" Guzman is serving a life sentence at a maximum security prison in Colorado. His son has pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking charges in Chicago.</p>

<p>Shootouts this week in the western Mexican state of Sinaloa kindled fears that an intra-cartel war is about to break out following Zambada's arrest.</p>

<p>Fighting has killed 12 people since Monday, and on Thursday state authorities canceled national day celebrations and shut schools in response to the escalating violence.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three U.S. citizens on trial for their role in a failed coup in Democratic Republic of Congo were sentenced to death by a military court on Friday.</p>

<p>Armed men briefly occupied an office of the presidency in the capital Kinshasa on May 19 before their leader, U.S.-based Congolese politician Christian Malanga, was killed by security forces.</p>

<p>His son, Marcel Malanga, was among the Americans on trial, along with Marcel's friend Tyler Thompson who played high school football with him in Utah. Both are in their 20s.</p>

<p>The third American, Benjamin Zalman-Polun, was a business associate of Christian Malanga.</p>

<p>All three were found guilty of criminal conspiracy, terrorism and other charges, and sentenced to death in a ruling read out on live TV.</p>

<p>Malanga had previously told the court that his father had threatened to kill him unless he participated. He also told the court it was his first time visiting Congo at the invitation of his father, whom he hadn't seen in years.</p>

<p>The Americans are among around 50 people, including U.S., British, Canadian, Belgian and Congolese citizens, standing trial following the failed coup.</p>

<p>The verdict was read out under a tent in the yard of Ndolo military prison on the outskirts of Kinshasa. The defendants were seated in front of the judge, wearing blue and yellow prison-issued tops.</p>

<p>The trial began in July.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Modernas new cancer vaccine, mRNA-4359, shows promising results in early clinical trials. Utilizing mRNA technology, similar to its Covid-19 vaccine, this treatment primes the immune system to identify and destroy cancer cells.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A groundbreaking vaccine against cancer cells has given encouraging early results from its first clinical trials, according to <em>The Metro</em>. Developed by Moderna Pharmaceuticals-the same company that made headlines with its Covid-19 vaccine-the jab, known as mRNA-4359, is designed to activate the body's immune system to identify and destroy cancer cells.</p>

<p>Uses mRNA technology, such as that employed by Covid-19 vaccines, to instruct the immune system to recognise healthy cells versus tumour cells. In a phase-one clinical trial involving 19 patients with advanced solid tumours, it was observed that eight patients had no growth of the tumours and no new tumours appeared. Importantly, the vaccine was found to be well tolerated, without any serious adverse effects.</p>

<p>Chief investigator Dr Debashis Sarker, a clinical reader in experimental oncology at King's College London and a consultant in medical oncology at Guy's &amp; St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/09/13/cancer-fighting-jab-showing-early-promise-trials-21596668/"><em>The Metro</em></a>: "This study evaluating an mRNA cancer immunotherapy is an important first step in hopefully developing a new treatment for patients with advanced cancers. We have shown that the therapy is well tolerated without serious side effects and can stimulate the body's immune system in a way that could help to treat cancer more effectively."</p>

<p>"However, as this study has only involved a small number of patients to date, it's too early to say how effective this could be for people with advanced stage cancer."</p>

<p>Now the study is enrolling patients with specific cancers, namely melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer.</p>

<p>Among such studies, the mRNA-4359 trial is one of the studies being conducted exploring the likelihood of cancer vaccines. Others include a personalised mRNA vaccine for melanoma by Moderna and a lung cancer vaccine under test by BioNTech. These vaccines are major breakthroughs in treating cancer, offering the first rays of hope for patients in advanced stages of cancer.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Russia started producing a new long-range attack drone called the Garpiya-A1 last year using Chinese engines and parts, which it deployed in the Ukraine war, according to two sources from a European intelligence agency and documents seen by Reuters.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia started producing a new long-range attack drone called the Garpiya-A1 last year using Chinese engines and parts, which it has deployed in the war in Ukraine, according to two sources from a European intelligence agency and documents seen by Reuters.</p>

<p>The intelligence - which included a production contract for the new drone, company correspondence on the manufacturing process and financial documents - indicated that IEMZ Kupol, a subsidiary of Russian state-owned weapons maker Almaz-Antey, produced more than 2,500 Garpiyas from July 2023 to July 2024.</p>

<p>The existence of the new Russian drone incorporating Chinese technology has not been previously reported. IEMZ Kupol and Almaz-Antey did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>The two intelligence sources said that the Garpiya, which means Harpy in Russian, has been deployed against military and civilian targets in Ukraine, causing damage to critical infrastructure as well as both civilian and military casualties.</p>

<p>They shared with Reuters what they said were images from Ukraine of the wreckage of a Garpiya, without providing further details. Reuters found information that reinforces this conclusion, but was unable to confirm the images independently.</p>

<p>The sources asked that neither they nor their agency be identified due to the sensitivity of the information. They also asked that certain details, such as dates, related to the documents be withheld.</p>

<p>Samuel Bendett, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington DC-based think tank, told Reuters that Garpiya, if confirmed, would mark a departure from Russia's reliance on Iranian designs for long-range drones.</p>

<p>"If this is happening, it could indicate that Russia can now rely more on domestic development as well as, obviously, on China, since both sides in this war depend on many Chinese components for drone production," he said.</p>

<p>Iran, which didn't comment for this story, has supplied more than a thousand Shahed "kamikaze" drones to Russia since the start of the invasion in February 2022, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in May last year.</p>

<p>They have been used to exhaust Ukrainian air defences and hit infrastructure far from the front lines. Iran has repeatedly denied sending drones to Russia for use in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment for this story. The Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement to Reuters that Beijing strictly controls the export of items with potential military applications, including drones.</p>

<p>"With regard to the Ukrainian crisis, China has always been committed to promoting peace talks and political settlement," the statement said. It added that there were no international restrictions on China's trade with Russia.</p>

<h2><strong>NATO APPEAL</strong></h2>

<p>NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg last week called on China to stop supporting Russia's war in Ukraine and said Beijing's assistance has been a significant factor in the continuation of the conflict.</p>

<p>The Garpiya "closely resembles the Shahed" but it has several distinguishing features, including a unique bolt-on fin and Limbach L-550 E engines, the European agency said in a statement to Reuters. The engine, which was originally designed and manufactured by a German company, is now produced in China by a local firm, Xiamen Limbach. The company did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Reuters reviewed a contract worth more than 1 billion rubles (10 million euros) signed in the first quarter of 2023 between the Russian defence ministry and Kupol for the development of a factory to produce the drones.</p>

<p>The intelligence sources said a former cement factory situated in Izhevsk, Udmurt Republic, in western Russia - which was purchased by Kupol in 2020 - is being used to produce the drones.</p>

<p>Using a video of a Russian drone production facility posted on the Telegram messaging app, Reuters was able to identify the site as the factory in Izhevsk from the colour and design of the building's beams and internal architecture which matched file imagery of the site. The location of the file imagery was verifiable from nearby buildings, roads, and trees that matched street views and satellite imagery.</p>

<p>A prototype of the Garpiya was launched in the first half of 2023, company communications showed. Production reached several hundred in the second half of 2023 and more than doubled to around 2,000 in the first half of 2024, the agency said.</p>

<p>Bendett, the defence analyst, said 2,500 drones per year would represent a sizeable chunk of Russia's output. Ukraine's top military commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said last month that Russia has fired nearly 14,000 strike drones since it invaded in February 2022, including the Iranian Shahed as well as the Russian-made Geran-2 and Lancet drones.</p>

<p>Corporate documents dated from the second quarter of 2023, reviewed by Reuters, showed that supplier TSK Vektor procured parts from Chinese companies for assembly at the Kupol site; 800 Chinese engines were also to be delivered to the new plant where the production line was due to ready by end of the quarter.</p>

<p>TSK Vektor did not respond to request for comment.</p>

<p>The European intelligence service said in the statement it was concerned that Chinese companies were continuing to provide components that enabled Russian production of large kamikaze drones. "The export of the essential components to Russia needs to stop," it said.</p>

<h3><strong>UNITED STATES VOICES CONCERN</strong></h3>

<p>Washington has repeatedly warned Beijing over its support for Russia's defence industry. It has imposed hundreds of sanctions aimed at curbing Moscow's ability to exploit certain technologies for military purposes. The State Department and the White House did not respond to a request for comment for this story.</p>

<p>In July, China said it would tighten drone export rules starting on Sept. 1. Beijing has said U.S. sanctions on Chinese entities over the Ukraine war are "illegal and unilateral".</p>

<p>The Garpiya has a take-off weight of less than 300 kilos and a maximum range of 1,500 kilometres, the production contract between Kupol and the Russian defense ministry said - roughly similar to Iran's Shahed-136 drones that Moscow has used extensively in Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Washington Post reported in August that Russia aimed to increase production of a domestic version of the Shahed-136, known as the Geran-2, at a plant in the Alabuga Special Economic Zone, in Tatarstan. Ukraine said in April it had carried out a drone strike against a drone manufacturing plant at Alabuga.</p>

<p>A third document reviewed by Reuters - a delivery status update between the intermediary TSK Vektor and the manufacturer Kupol, dated in the first quarter of 2024 - detailed an order for 100 axles, carburettors and other Limbach engine parts supplied by two other Chinese companies: Juhang Aviation Technology and Redlepus Vector Industries, both based in Shenzhen.</p>

<p>Juhang, which was placed under British sanctions in February and U.S. sanctions in May for providing Russia with drone equipment, and Redlepus did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Customs data, obtained from a commercial supplier that records and compiles the information, showed that from April 2022 to December 2023, TSK Vektor imported $36.3 million in goods from Chinese Juhang Aviation Technology, and $6.2 million from Redlepus TSK Vector Industrial Shenzhen Co Ltd.</p>

<p>According to the customs documents, the goods included aircraft engines, transistors, electronic modules, connectors, plugs and sockets, spare parts and components most of them marked as "for general civil purpose", "for general industrial purpose", "for general civil use".<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China and Maldives have signed a new agreement today that allows Beijing to lend more financial support to the already debt-distressed nation. China's central bank has said the pact will also help strengthen trade and investment.</p>

<p>The memorandum of understanding or MoU between the People's Bank of China and Maldives' Economic Development Ministry allows Beijing and Male to boost direct investments and permit local currency settlement for current account transactions.</p>

<p>China has not revealed anything else about the agreement. Maldives, which is already facing a massive debt, is barely managing to avoid default.</p>

<p>In a statement after the agreement, China's foreign ministry said it has active communication with Maldives over its mounting debt to Beijing and is increasing its financial cooperation.</p>

<p>"China will, as always, provide support and assistance to the economic and social development of the Maldives within its capability," Mao Ning, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said.</p>

<h2>MALDIVES' RISING DEBT WORRY</h2>

<p>Maldives's debt concern is a serious one and is rising at a rapid pace. The Maldivian government vowed&nbsp; on Thursday that it will not become the first nation to default on Islamic sovereign debt by failing pay $25 million which is due next month.</p>

<p>According to the World Bank, Maldives' biggest lender is China and the debt it owes to Beijing has risen to above $1.3 billion. China has been in talks with Maldives to lend even more "support".</p>

<p>Maldives' debt crisis has come with the change in government and its political and geopolitical stance. The new government in Maldives has increasingly been pro-China despite its rising debt to the nation.</p>

<p>Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu's party managed a landslide win the the parliamentary elections held in April this year. The outcome has led to a major shift in stance with the island nation's ties growing rapidly with China and moving away from its traditional partner, India.</p>

<p>Maldives has been criticised in recent weeks over doubts that it may not be able to pay back its debt.</p>

<h3><strong>INDIA-MALDIVES TIES STRAINED</strong></h3>

<p>Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu will travel to India on an official visit "very soon", his spokesperson has said.</p>

<p>The announcement of Mr Muizzu's visit came on a day when two junior ministers, suspended in January for derogatory comments against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, resigned from the government.</p>

<p>Mr Muizzu, known for his pro-China leanings, visited New Delhi on June 9 to attend Prime Minister Modi's swearing-in ceremony. Unlike his predecessors, who made the first port of call to New Delhi after assuming office, Mr Muizzu travelled to Turkiye first and to China for his first state visit in January.</p>

<p>India's relationship with the Maldives came under strain since Mr Muizzu took charge as the President. Within hours of his oath, he had demanded the withdrawal of Indian military personnel manning three aviation platforms gifted by India to the Maldives. After talks between the two sides, the Indian military personnel were replaced by civilians.</p>

<p>Things escalated after three Maldivian deputy ministers made controversial remarks regarding India and Prime Minister Modi on social media.</p>

<p>Maldives Foreign Ministry distanced itself from their remarks, saying they do not represent the views of the Male government.</p>

<p>The three junior ministers were suspended, and two of them - Mariyam Shiuna and Malsha Shareef - have now resigned.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seven men who sexually abused two girls two decades ago received hefty jail sentences in the UK on Friday as a result of Britain's biggest ever investigation into child abuse.</p>

<p>The men were imprisoned for between seven and 25 years after being convicted in June of offences committed in Rotherham, in northern England, in the early 2000s.</p>

<p>The cases stem from the National Crime Agency's (NCA) Operation Stovewood, a decade-long investigation into child sexual abuse that is the largest of its kind in UK history.</p>

<p>It began in 2014 following the publication of the Jay Report, which sent shockwaves around the country.</p>

<p>It found that at least 1,400 girls were abused, trafficked and groomed by gangs of men of mainly Pakistani heritage in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013.</p>

<p>The report found that police and social services failed to put a stop to the abuse.</p>

<p>Some 36 people have been convicted so far as a result of the operation, according to the NCA, which investigates serious, organised and international crime.</p>

<p>The latest convictions came at the end of a nine-week trial at Sheffield Crown Court.</p>

<p>The trial heard how the victims, who were aged between 11 and 16 at the time of the offences and were both in the care of social services, were groomed and often plied with alcohol or cannabis before being raped or assaulted.</p>

<p>They would often be collected by their abusers from the children's homes where they lived at the time, the NCA said.</p>

<p>"These men were cruel and manipulative, grooming their victims and then exploiting them by subjecting them to the most harrowing abuse possible," said NCA senior investigating officer Stuart Cobb.</p>

<p>Rotherham, a once prosperous industrial town that has suffered years of economic decline, experienced some of the worst anti-migrant violence during this summer's riots in England when hundreds of people attacked a hotel housing asylum-seekers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Morocco has recorded a case of mpox in the tourist city of Marrakesh, the first in north Africa since the WHO declared an international emergency last month, the Africa CDC said.</p>

<p>"Africa CDC confirms the first mpox case in North Africa for 2024, reported by Morocco's Ministry of Health" on September 12, a statement on the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention website said on Thursday.</p>

<p>With Morocco, 15 African Union member states have reported cases -- now across every region of the continent, according to Africa CDC.</p>

<p>Mpox, previously known as monkeypox, is caused by a virus transmitted to humans by infected animals but can also be passed from human to human through close physical contact.</p>

<p>Sometimes deadly, it causes fever, muscular aches and large boil-like skin lesions.</p>

<p>The 32-year-old patient from Marrakesh "tested positive and is receiving treatment," Africa CDC said.</p>

<p>"The Moroccan authorities have activated emergency operations, deployed a rapid response team and begun epidemiological investigations and contact tracing," the statement added.</p>

<p>Morocco's health ministry said separately that the patient was receiving care at a specialised medical centre in Marrakesh and was "in a stable health condition that does not give cause for concern".</p>

<p>So far, nobody who has been in contact with the patient is showing symptoms, the ministry added.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization declared an international emergency on August 14, concerned by the surge in cases of the new Clade 1b strain in the Democratic Republic of Congo that spread to nearby countries.</p>

<p>Africa CDC figures show most of the cases are in Central Africa.</p>

<p>According to the agency, since the beginning of the year, 26,544 cases have been reported in the 15 affected countries, 5,732 of which were confirmed. It said that 724 deaths have also been reported.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Floods in Myanmar sparked by Typhoon Yagi have displaced more than 235,000 people and killed at least 33, the junta said on Friday.</p>

<p>"There are 236,649 people from 59,413 households who were displaced because of typhoon floods... There were 33 deaths and one person injured around the country," junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun said in an audio statement.</p>

<p>He said authorities have "lost communication with some areas" and urged those living near river banks to seek shelter elsewhere and "be vigilant" until Sunday.</p>

<p>Earlier Friday, Myanmar's fire service gave a higher death count of 36.</p>

<p>Authorities were investigating reports that dozens of migrant workers in gold mining areas in central Mandalay region were missing following landslides, the junta spokesman said.</p>

<p>People in parts of Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and Myanmar have been battling floods and landslides in the wake of Typhoon Yagi, which dumped a colossal deluge of rain when it hit the region last weekend.</p>

<p>More than 2.7 million people were already displaced in Myanmar by conflict triggered by the junta's 2021 coup, which has plunged the country into turmoil.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar while addressing the Indian diaspora in Geneva said that life is not "<em>khata-khat</em>" (an easy job), it requires hard work. The use of the phrase was also a jibe at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi who had claimed that the Congress would solve issues 'Khata Khat" if voted to power.</p>

<p>Talking about human resources needed to build infrastructure, he said that people who have worked understand the importance of hard work and diligence.</p>

<p>"Until we develop the human resources, it requires hard work, until you build the infrastructure, until you have those policies. So life is not <em>'khata-khat</em>'. Life is hard work. Life is diligence. Anybody who's held a job and laboured at it, knows it. So that's my message to you, that we have to work hard at it," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said that a country cannot be a major power in the world without manufacturing.</p>

<p>"And there are...people who say that we are incapable of it, we should not even attempt it. So, now ask yourself, can you actually be a major power in the world without manufacturing? Because a major power needs technology. Nobody can develop technology without developing manufacturing," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said that in terms of human resources, India has achieved a lot and the intent today is to ramp it up even more.</p>

<p>"In terms of human resources... it's again important to look here at achievements. So I can tell you the intent today is actually to speed it up, to ramp it up, to increase it, to keep telling ourselves that what we have done is just a beginning. I mean there is no intention of resting on whatever levels there may be," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said that apart from the professional conversation, world leaders are interested in what is happening in India.</p>

<p>"When I travel around the world- and you would have noticed I do a fair deal of that [chuckles]- most of my counterparts, most of the presidents and prime ministers are meet. Yes, we do the foreign policy, but that's the professional part of it. But they are enormously interested, actually, in what is happening in India," he said.</p>

<p>"Sometimes the conversation, even the words, are very similar. I had the leader of a very major Arab country actually say, we have food distribution system and, Minister, you don't know how much leakage we have. Because he was very interested, how do we today manage the food support, where today they are covering 830 million people. How do we manage that with actually much less leakage than there has ever been in the past? People who ask today, how have you improved your income tax collection? Because every president and prime minister is interested in increasing their revenues," Jaishankar added, talking about food support in India.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said that in what India is doing, there are lessons for the rest of the world.</p>

<p>"When I look back at these ten years, yes, there have been changes for the good in our country, but I will also say to all of you that those changes actually globally resonate. That other countries today look with deep interest, they may not be able to exactly copy it, but somewhere in what we are doing there are lessons for the rest of the world. And people feel this country, which, bear in mind, which still has USD 3000 per capita income below that, is able to do that much," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar added that achievements are meant to motivate and not be satiated.</p>

<p>"Achievements not to satiate but to motivate. Not to say I've done well, so I'm done. But to say I've done well and I could have done so much more. And if I could have done this in two terms, how much more can I do in a third?" he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Before becoming the 45th US President, Donald Trump was a celebrity and a property tycoon.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald John Trump has had a profound impact on US politics. His presidency is still, and perhaps forever, be remembered for bold statements and decisions he took. To explain who Donald Trump is and what makes him tick involves lots of metaphors. From "insomniac", to "Godzilla" and a "Navy SEAL", the 45th President of the United States has earned praises and brickbats from his countrymen.</p>

<p>Mr Trump, born into wealth and growing up in the heart of New York's business world, rose to global prominence as POTUS. From real estate mogul to reality TV star to the most powerful political figure in America, his life has been anything but conventional. His presidency (2017-2021) saw major political upheaval, deeply polarising the nation. Even after his term ended, Trump continues to dominate the political conversation, and in a debate with Vice President and Democrat nominee Kamala Harris, he made a strong pitch why the US needs him in power.</p>

<h3><strong>Donald Trump Birth And Early Life</strong></h3>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">

<p>He was born on June 14, 1946, in Queens, New York City, to Frederick Christ Trump, a wealthy real estate developer, and Mary Anne MacLeod, a Scottish immigrant. He was the fourth of five children in a well-off family that built its fortune in the post-World War II construction boom.</p>

<p>Fred Trump was a powerful figure in real estate, particularly in Brooklyn and Queens, which profoundly influenced Donald's ambitions. Raised with a competitive spirit and taught the value of success from a young age, Donald followed closely in his father's footsteps. His early years were marked by privilege but also discipline. Trump's parents sent him to the New York Military Academy at age 13 to channel his energy and focus on his studies.</p>

<h3><strong>Donald Trump Education</strong></h3>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/t2q61958_donald-trump-real-estate-getty_625x300_13_September_24.jpg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Trump attended the New York Military Academy before moving on to Fordham University for two years. He then transferred to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/10/did-donald-trump-attend-wharton/75168213007/">Wharton School</a> of the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a degree in economics in 1968.</p>

<p>Armed with a business education and the family fortune, Trump joined his father's real estate business, eventually taking control in 1971 and renaming it The Trump Organisation. His early projects included transforming rundown buildings in Manhattan into luxury high-rises. Trump's career was characterised by a knack for branding and a relentless pursuit of high-profile deals. Notably, he developed the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York and Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, both of which bolstered his reputation as a high-stakes real estate mogul.</p>

<p>In the 1980s, Trump expanded into the casino business with mixed success. His ventures, such as Trump Plaza and Trump Castle helped cement his image as a larger-than-life businessman, though financial trouble followed. Trump's companies declared bankruptcy several times, but he consistently rebounded, largely due to his mastery of public relations and branding.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><span class="ins_instory_span_credit">Photo Credit: Getty</span></p>
</div>

<p>Trump's personal life, including his three marriages, has been as highly publicised as his professional one. His first marriage, to Ivana Zelnickova, a Czech model and businesswoman, lasted from 1977 to 1992, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-62172028">according to the <em>BBC</em></a>. Together, they had three children: Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric Trump. The couple was a fixture in the New York social scene throughout the 1980s, though their relationship ended in a widely publicised divorce amid rumours of Trump's infidelity.</p>

<p>In 1993, Trump married actress Marla Maples, with whom he had one daughter, Tiffany Trump. This marriage, too, ended in divorce, in 1999.</p>

<p>In 2005, Trump married Slovenian model Melania Knauss, with whom he has a son, Barron Trump. Melania would go on to become the First Lady during Trump's presidency. Throughout his personal and professional life, Trump has kept his family close, with his children playing prominent roles in both his business empire and his political campaigns.</p>

<h3><strong>Donald Trump Net Worth</strong></h3>

<p>In May this year, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/article/the-definitive-networth-of-donaldtrump/"><em>Forbes</em></a> released the answer to the question people were asking for decades - what's Donald Trump really worth? As per the magazine, $7.5 billion. The figure includes the assets and businesses the former US President owns. Truth Social, the platform Trump owns, is alone worth $5.6 billion. His real estate business is worth $1.1 billion, while the clubs and resorts $0.81 billion. Mr Trump has $0.41 billion as cash and $0.1 billion in other assets, as per Forbes.</p>

<p>The outlet further said that he reached the $1 billion mark in 1988, but was out of Forbes' 400 list from 1990 to 1995.</p>

<h3><strong>Donald Trump Age</strong></h3>

<p>At 78, Trump is still actively involved in politics and business. He maintains a high-profile presence, particularly through his social media platform, Truth Social.</p>

<h3><strong>Donald Trump Presidency</strong></h3>

<p>Though Trump flirted with politics for years, his serious plunge into the political arena came in 2015 when he announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for President. Few in the Republican Party believed when Trump launched his improbable White House bid that he'd still be a factor at the end of that year. But the billionaire topped national polls after entering the race, as per CNN.</p>

<p>Donald Trump quickly emerged as the frontrunner, gaining notoriety for his unfiltered rhetoric, often attacking rivals and the media. His promise to build a wall along the US-Mexico border and his tough stance on immigration became central themes of his campaign.</p>

<p>In November 2016, Trump defied pollsters and political analysts by defeating Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in one of the most shocking political upsets in US history. His electoral victory, largely fuelled by wins in key swing states, underscored the deep divides in American society.</p>

<p>Trump's presidency was marked by a series of unconventional and controversial actions, from his combative relationship with the press to his unpredictable foreign policy moves. Domestically, Trump implemented tax cuts, rolled back regulations, and installed conservative judges at a record pace, including three Supreme Court Justices, reshaping the judiciary for decades.</p>

<h3><strong>Donald Trump political career</strong></h3>

<p>One of the Trump administration's defining moments came in 2020 with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump's handling of the crisis received heavy criticism, with detractors accusing him of downplaying the severity of the virus and mishandling the federal response. His administration's policies on immigration, trade and race relations also ignited fierce debates and further polarised the country.</p>

<p>Trump's foreign policy approach was similarly contentious. He withdrew the US from several international agreements, including the Paris Climate Accord and the Iran Nuclear Deal, while also seeking a more assertive stance against China. Trump's "America First" policy, which often alienated traditional US allies, further underscored his unorthodox approach to global affairs.</p>

<p>In December 2019, Trump became the third US president to be impeached by the House of Representatives, accused of abusing his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden. The Senate ultimately acquitted him in February 2020. He was impeached for the second time by the House of Representatives on January 13, 2021, one week before his term expired for incitement of insurrection. He is the only US President to be impeached twice.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK will ban junk food advertising on the internet and daytime TV in a bid to tackle childhood obesity, sparking criticism on the political right over "nanny state" meddling.</p>

<p>The measure was included in the Labour manifesto that won Keir Starmer's Labour a resounding victory in July, and is due to be introduced on October 1, 2025, the government said Thursday.</p>

<p>The announcement came after Starmer promised wide-ranging reforms to the crisis-hit National Health Service (NHS), in particular by placing a greater emphasis on prevention.</p>

<p>Junior health minister Andrew Gwynne said in a written statement to parliament that more than one in five children in England are "overweight or living with obesity by the time they start primary school" at age four or five.</p>

<p>By the time they leave at aged 11, the figure is more than one third, he added.</p>

<p>"These restrictions will help protect children from being exposed to advertising of less healthy food and drinks, which evidence shows influences their dietary preferences from a young age," he said.</p>

<p>Advertising for foods that are too fatty, too sweet or too salty will be banned before 9:00 pm on television and completely online.</p>

<p>The ban was supported by the Conservative Party under Boris Johnson, who has talked about his own struggles with weight gain, but was postponed to give manufacturers in the sector more time to adapt.</p>

<p>Others on the political right, however, criticised the move as an attack on individual freedom.</p>

<p>They included the Conservative-supporting Daily Mail, whose front-page headline Friday read "Nanny Starmer's ban on junk food ads 'to save NHS'".</p>

<p>"Keir Starmer ushered in a new era of the nanny state yesterday by unveiling plans for a pre-watershed ban on junk food advertising," it added.</p>

<p>The Labour government plans other interventions to ease the strain on the health system, such as banning high-sugar and caffeine energy drinks for under-16s.</p>

<p>Children's think-tank The Centre for Young Lives on Friday urged the government to "ignore 'Nanny State' critics and expand sugar taxes, ban (the) sale of energy drinks to under 16s, and roll out national supervised toothbrushing programme in schools."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Adalina, an Italian restaurant in Chicago led by Top Chef alum Soo Ahn, has launched a "Marrow Martini," considered one of the most expensive cocktails in the US Priced at several thousand dollars.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An ultra luxurious new cocktail in Chicago, Illinois, comes with a several thousand dollar price tag attached. According to <em>Fox News Digital,</em> Adalina, an Italian restaurant in the Windy City, has unveiled the "Marrow Martini, which contains more than just a drink; it's a piece of stunning diamond jewellery.</p>

<p>Led by Top Chef alum Soo Ahn, Adalina partnered with the jewellery brand Marrow Fine, headquartered just underneath the restaurant, to develop a truly unique experience. The martini will be served with a 9-carat diamond tennis necklace featuring 150 diamonds set in 14K gold.</p>

<p>With that, "it's likely the most expensive Martini in the United States," says Colin Hofer, a manager at Adalina, in an email to<em> <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/chicago-restaurant-serving-most-expensive-martini-us-priced-13k">Fox News Digital.</a> </em>It pumps up the luxury within the cocktail scene in the United States.</p>

</div>

<p>"Instead of traditional spirits like gin or vodka, I chose Mezcal because I believe it has untapped potential as a luxury spirit. Mezcal, much like heirloom jewellery, is often overlooked despite its richness. The particular Mezcal we use is a rare, sought-after brand made from Green Agave, native to the deserts of San Luis Potosi, Mexico," Hofer said.</p>

<p>Jillian Sassone, founder of Marrow Fine, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/chicago-restaurant-serving-most-expensive-martini-us-priced-13k"><em>Fox News Digital </em></a>via email she suspects the drink will make for memorable evenings.</p>

<p>"Adalina was a natural choice to partner with, not only because of its proximity but also because of their world-class menu from Top Chef Soo Ahn. Each time I have visited Adalina, I'm blown away by every dish but also by the palpable energy and excitement in the restaurant," she said.</p>

<p>"While it's not something we expect to see sold frequently, it has sparked a lot of interest among our clientele. It's more about creating an iconic experience for a select few rather than broad popularity," Hofer said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US presidential election 2024 is a battle of the sexes.</p>

<p>Historically speaking, women have leaned towards voting for Democrats more than men have, since the 1980s and this gap has only grown wider since.</p>

<p>This time around, Democrats have been losing support from key demographics such as Black and Latino men. However, they have gained support in other areas - women voters.</p>

<p>According to the Center For American Women and Politics, "The number of female voters has exceeded the number of male voters in every presidential election since 1964" so voter turnout is crucial for both the parties.</p>

<p>Apart from the major issues, such as economy and employment, two important topics that will heavily impact election results are abortion and immigration, Democrat Kamala Harris is gaining ground with the former and Republican Donald Trump with the latter.</p>

<p>Based on an analysis by Gallup, "Women aged 18 to 29 today are more liberal than young women in the past on specific issues, particularly the environment and abortion" which explains the surge in women voters for the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>Trump has struggled to connect with women voters. In fact, women tend to favor Harris over Trump by a significant margin. This trend is consistent with previous elections, where Trump has failed to win over female voters. In 2020, Joe Biden took a major slice of women voters at 55% while Trump only won 44%. Similarly, in 2016, Hillary Clinton claimed 54% of women voters while Trump won 39%.</p>

<p>Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist posted, "Early vote has been disproportionately female. If men stay at home, Kamala is president. It's that simple. If you want a vision of the future if you don't vote, imagine Kamala's voice cackling, forever. Men need to GO VOTE NOW" urging men to cast their ballot.</p>

<p>Women are of utmost importance in this election because they can make or break the election. "The women's vote will be decisive this election," Katherine Tate, a Brown University political scientist, said. "If Harris wins, it will be because women elected her." She also added that, "Trump has alienated female voters by his abrasive language and aggression."</p>

<p>On that note, Trump touched a nerve when he said, "You will no longer have anxiety from all of the problems our country has today. You will be protected, and I will be your protector. Women will be happy, healthy, confident and free. You will no longer be thinking about abortion." He was posing as the liberator and messiah for women, at a campaign rally in Indiana. It had a patronising tone that snatched agency from the voices of women and took America back several years.</p>

<p>However, according to a CNN report, Trump has been asking his close allies why women don't like him. The gender gap is a serious concern for the Trump campaign. Speaking for the Republican candidate, Karoline Leavitt, the campaign's spokesperson, told The Independent, that he is "loved by millions of women across the country, and those who know him personally, myself included, will tell you he's supportive, generous and kind."</p>

<p>It is also noteworthy that since the 1970s at least 27 women have accused Trump of sexual assault and misconduct, all of which the former president has denied.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Russian rocket will launch two privately built Iranian satellites into orbit early Tuesday, the Iranian embassy in Moscow said, hailing close space cooperation between Moscow and Tehran.</p>

<p>The two countries have deepened ties and trade amid Russia's military offensive on Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East, with space launches just one aspect of their burgeoning partnership.</p>

<p>"In continuation of the development of Iran-Russia scientific and technological cooperation, two Iranian satellites -- Koswar and Hodhod -- will be launched into 500-kilometre orbit," Iran's ambassador in Moscow, Kazem Jalali, said Monday on social media.</p>

<p>He said the launch will take place at 02:48 Tehran time (2318 GMT on Monday) using a Russian Soyuz rocket.</p>

<p>The imaging and communications satellites were designed and built by Iran's Omid Faza Company, the statement said, and will support agriculture, environmental monitoring and communications in remote areas.</p>

<p>Russia has previously launched some Iranian satellites, but this is the first instance for a private sector initiative, Jalali said.</p>

<p>"There is hope that with the launch of these two satellites, a firm and decisive first step will be taken towards the entry of the private sector of the Islamic Republic of Iran into the space sphere," he said.</p>

<p>The West has raised concerns over Iran's fledgling space programme, fearing the same technology could also be used to launch nuclear-equipped ballistic missiles.</p>

<p>Tehran says its space programme is peaceful and complies with a UN Security Council resolution that aims to restrict Iran's ballistic missile programme.</p>

<p>Moscow has been accused of using Iranian military hardware and technology, most notably self-detonating Shahed drones, throughout its offensive on Ukraine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having survived two assassination attempts this summer, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Sunday suggested that he would not mind if somebody took a shot at him through fake news.</p>

<p>Addressing his supporters at an election rally at Lititz in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, Trump generated another controversy by saying that he should not have left the White House after his defeat in the 2020 elections.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have left, I mean, honestly. We did so well," Trump said in his speech but immediately changed the topic. "So now, every polling booth has hundreds of lawyers standing there."</p>

<p>Trump had refused to accept the results of the November 2020 elections. His supporters ended up attacking the US Capitol on January 6, which is considered to be the worst day in American democracy.</p>

<p>The former president, who is now 78, expressed frustration over the enhanced security around him after his recent assassination bids.</p>

<p>"I have a piece of glass over here. I don't have a piece of glass there. And I have this piece of glass here. But all we have really over here is the fake news, right? And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news. I don't mind that so much. I don't mind. I don't mind that," Trump said, referring the thick bullet proof glass around him and the gap in his protective glass.</p>

<p>"I have a piece of glass here. The problem with that glass is it's - I don't look great on television when you have a four-inch piece of glass that a howitzer can't go through. No, when you see yourself on television, you say, boy, you're really not very recognizable, to be honest with you, which is good. But here's the problem. So I have glass here. I have glass here. Now, I'm not worried about this. Look, what do I have? A couple of people. And they're friends, generally. There are a couple of people I don't like in that group, but that's like," he said.</p>

<p>His remarks were criticized by the Democrats. Harris-Walz Director of Rapid Response Ammar Moussa said as Harris spent today at church in Detroit, talking to voters about her vision to lift up all Americans, Donald Trump was busy violating the Ninth Commandment.</p>

<p>"Trump is spending the closing days of his campaign angry and unhinged, lying about the election being stolen because he's worried he will lose. The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth and will walk into the Oval Office focused on them - that's Vice President Harris," Moussa said.</p>

<p>Steven Cheung, Trump Campaign Communications Director, said Trump was talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life, including one that came within 1/4 of an inch from killing him, something that the media constantly talks and jokes about.</p>

<p>"The President's statement about protective glass placement has nothing to do with the Media being harmed, or anything else. It was about threats against him that were spurred on by dangerous rhetoric from Democrats," he said.</p>

<p>"In fact, President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also. There can be no other interpretation of what was said. He was actually looking out for their welfare, far more than his own!" Cheung said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the U.S. presidential election approaches, Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B has publicly criticized Elon Musk after he called her a "puppet" supporting Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. Musk, an avid Donald Trump supporter, took a swipe at Cardi B, responding to a Trump fan account's post featuring a clip of her at a rally in Milwaukee for Harris.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Another puppet who can't even talk without being fed the words," Mr Musk said in a quote tweet, referring to a teleprompter malfunction that caused Cardi B to stall until she was handed her speech notes on a phone.</p>

<p>Cardi B quickly responded, "I'm not a puppet, Elon. I'm a daughter of two immigrant parents who worked hard to provide for me!" She continued, "I'm a product of welfare, section 8, poverty, and the reality of a system that's set up against you... But you wouldn't know anything about that. You don't understand the American struggle. PS fix my algorithm."</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I'm not a puppet Elon.. I'm a daughter of two immigrant parents that had to work their ass off to provide for me! I'm a product of welfare, I'm a product of section 8, I'm a product of poverty and I'm a product of what happens when the system is set up against you….But you don't… <a href="https://t.co/BBYQ2O0KYJ">https://t.co/BBYQ2O0KYJ</a></p>
— Cardi B (@iamcardib) <a href="https://twitter.com/iamcardib/status/1852830829996556310?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>Musk, who was born in South Africa to wealthy parents, including his father Errol Musk, who reportedly held a stake in a Zambian emerald mine, has faced criticism for his remarks on socioeconomic issues.</p>

<p>At the rally, Cardi B delivered a powerful speech on women's rights, condemning Donald Trump's alleged sexism. "Just like Kamala Harris, I've been the underdog, underestimated and discredited. Women have to work ten times harder to prove themselves, and still, we're questioned. I can't stand a bully, and like Kamala, I'll always stand up to one."</p>

<p>The 2024 U.S. presidential election is set for November 5.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A court in Pakistan on Monday witnessed emotional scenes when jailed former premier Imran Khan's wife Bushra Bibi burst into tears, expressing her utter helplessness against the inefficient justice system and her husband's "unjust sentencing". &nbsp;The former first lady appeared before Islamabad District Magistrate Afzal Majoka's court to acquire bail for her husband in six cases and herself in another case, registered at Tarnol, Karachi Company, Ramna, Secretariat and Kohsar police stations.</p>

<p>During the hearing held at the Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, Khan was not produced in the court. He was also not allowed to appear through a video link.</p>

<p>When Bushra took to the rostrum to speak, she became emotional.</p>

<p>"I have been facing injustice by those responsible for serving justice for the past nine months. I and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder were unjustly sentenced," she said.</p>

<p>"There is no justice. I haven't come to seek justice," she sobbed, and even blamed lawyers, saying all lawyers, including the one representing her, "only waste the time".</p>

<p>"The person inside [the prison], isn't he a human? Doesn't any judge see this," she said, adding that she would not come to this court again, where "there is no justice".</p>

<p>She told the judge that she had her blanket and other belongings in her car outside the court and that she was ready to go back to jail if ordered.</p>

<p>Bushra was released from jail<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pak-ex-pm-imran-khans-wife-bushra-bibi-released-on-bail-freed-from-jail-6864928"> last month</a> following the approval of her bail in the new Toshakhana case, but Khan remains incarcerated.</p>

<p>The former first lady was arrested after a court on January 31 convicted and sentenced her and Khan to 14 years in prison after finding them guilty of retaining and selling state gifts in violation of government rules while the PTI founder was in power.</p>

<p>However, they deny all allegations against them.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump capped off his rally in Georgia by dancing to the classic hit 'YMCA'.</p>

<p>As he rallied support just ahead of the US Presidential Elections, Trump declared his "commitment to restoring the American Dream," criticising Democratic rival and US Vice President Kamala Harris for allegedly "undermining that dream". He vowed, "I will bring back the American dream, and we'll bring it back stronger than ever before," while promising to address pressing issues like inflation and immigration.</p>

<p>Trump said his leadership would usher in a new era of prosperity, asserting, "America will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer and stronger than ever before." His campaign rhetoric contrasted what he termed the "incompetence and failure" of the current administration with the transformative success he claims would follow his return to office.</p>

<p>In a pointed critique of President Joe Biden, Trump expressed scepticism about Biden's visibility leading up to the elections, asking, "Where the hell is he?" He further suggested that Harris had undermined the electoral process, accusing her of stealing the election from Biden. In a provocative statement, Trump called for Biden to "fire Kamala," saying, "You're the worst ever. Kamala, you're fired. Get the hell out of here."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kamala Harris will continue her rallies on November 5 breezing through Atlanta, Detroit, Las Vegas, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Raleigh, and Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>"In this election, we need to remind our neighbours and friends that their vote is their voice, and their voice is their power. Don't let anybody take your power from you. When you love something, you fight for it--and I love this country with all my heart, " Harris said in her posts on X.</p>

<p>As the November 5 elections draw near, recent polling data indicates a competitive race, with a New York Times and Siena College survey showing Trump and Harris tied at 48 per cent in the popular vote. With both candidates vying for a historic moment in US politics, the upcoming election promises to be a pivotal event in the nation's future.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two days back, a young Iranian woman took the Internet by storm when she stripped to her underwear on a Tehran university campus, apparently to protest against the country's strict dress code for women. Visuals showed her roaming on the campus of Islamic Azad University as others gaped in surprise. Soon after, security guards detained her and took her away. Her current location is not known.</p>

<p><strong>Who Is She?</strong></p>

<p>The identity of the woman, who has emerged as a feminist icon since the visuals went viral, is not known yet. While most posts on social media stress that her move to undress was a form of protest against the dress code, a university spokesperson has claimed that the police have found that she is suffering from a "mental disorder" and was under "severe mental pressure". The spokesperson, Amir Mahjob, said the woman had separated from her partner and was mother to two children.</p>

<p><strong>Claims, Counter Claims</strong></p>

<p>An Iranian student social media channel, Amir Kabir newsletter, reported that the woman stripped to her underwear after members of Basij, a volunteer paramilitary force, harassed her for not following the dress code properly. Amnesty said she was "violently arrested" after she protested the "abusive enforcement" of the dress code. Iran's Fars news agency said two security personnel had "calmly spoken" to her and asked her to follow the dress code. The university spokesperson said there was no face-off between the student and security guards. He claimed that the woman was filming her classmates without their consent and they had objected to this. The security was alerted because of the "violation of the privacy of the students and professors", he said.</p>

<p><strong>Where is she now?</strong></p>

<p>Visuals on social media show a group of people grabbing the woman and putting her into a car. The university spokesperson's remarks suggest she was taken to a police station. He insisted that her health condition was fine. With no clear answers regarding the woman's whereabouts, apprehensions have surfaced over her well-being. The Amir Kabir newsletter has alleged that she was beaten during the arrest, AFP reported. Amnesty International demanded her immediate release and said authorities must protect her from torture and other ill-treatment. The London-based rights group also demanded an independent probe into allegations of violence against her.</p>

<p><strong>The Mahsa Amini Backdrop</strong></p>

<p>The Iranian woman's move and her subsequent detention have played out against the growing resistance in Iran to the strict dress code for women. Earlier, in 2022, nationwide protests had erupted in the country after an Iranian-Kurdish woman, Mahsa Hamini, died after she was arrested for an alleged breach of the dress code. The protests saw women remove their headscarves and burn them. Thousands were arrested and over 500 protesters were killed as the authorities cracked down hard on the agitation.</p>

<p>Hossein Ronaghi, a prominent Iranian activist who was jailed during the protests, has now praised the "bravery" of the student seen in the video. "The symbolic and protest movement of the research science student is a revolt against government repression; A cry from the bottom of the heart against the oppression that has taken life from people, especially women," he said in a post on X.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[No motive for the attack has yet been identified, Gallatin County Sheriff said in a statement.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 41-year-old suspect, Daren Christopher Abbey, has been arrested in connection with the death of a Montana man, initially believed to have been killed by a bear, according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c629xz8z15go" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>BBC</em></a>.</p>

<p>On October 30, the Gallatin County Sheriff's Office confirmed they had "identified a suspect" after the body of 35-year-old Dustin Kjersem was discovered in a tent approximately 2.5 miles up Moose Creek Road, near Big Sky, Montana, on October 12.</p>

<p>Sheriff Dan Springer reported that Abbey had been invited by Kjersem to share his campsite, located about 35 miles south of Bozeman. Prosecutors allege that Abbey later attacked Kjersem, hitting him with a piece of wood, stabbing him with a screwdriver, and assaulting him with an axe.</p>

<p>Abbey reportedly returned to the scene to remove items he thought might incriminate him but overlooked a beer can that remained. Authorities say Abbey has confessed to the killing, stating that he attacked Kjersem after finding him at a campsite he had intended to use.</p>

<p>Police indicated that Abbey led them to several items he allegedly took from the campsite, including an axe, firearms, and a cooler.</p>

<p>"This appears to be a heinous crime committed by an individual with no regard for the life of Dustin Kjersem," Sheriff Springer said, adding, "We have part of his story, but we don't fully understand the whole truth."</p>

<p>Abbey was ordered to be held on $1.5 million bail during a court appearance on Friday.</p>

<p>The Sheriff's Office also reassured the community that they could safely resume outdoor activities, adding that additional details and charges are forthcoming. Further comments on the case will be withheld until charges are filed.</p>

<p>Sheriff Springer expressed gratitude to the detectives for their "unrelenting pursuit of justice," highlighting their tireless dedication over nearly three weeks with little rest. He praised the Gallatin County Sheriff's Office and all involved agencies for their commitment to the community's safety.</p>

<p>Kjersem, a resident of Belgrade, Mont., was last seen on Thursday, October 10, and his body was discovered around 10:07 a.m. local time two days later.</p>

<p>In his concluding statement, Springer offered condolences to Kjersem's family: "Our thoughts and prayers remain with the family of Dustin Kjersem. We hope our efforts bring them some peace during this difficult time, as our entire community mourns with them."</p>

<p>Earlier, on Oct. 24, the Sheriff's Office issued a release seeking information on several items "believed to have been removed from the scene of the crime," including a camp axe, shotgun, revolver, and cooler.</p>

<p>The individual who found Kjersem's body initially suspected a bear attack. However, a state Fish, Wildlife, and Parks agent found no evidence of bear activity in the area, leading investigators to treat the case as a homicide. An autopsy later confirmed that Kjersem's death resulted from a "vicious attack," according to prior statements from the Sheriff's Office.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India on Monday said it "condemns acts of violence perpetrated by extremists and separatists", referring to an incident at a Hindu temple in Brampton, in the Canadian province of Ontario, last week, and called on Canada to ensure that all places of worship are adequately protected.</p>

<p>"We also expect that those indulging in such violence will be prosecuted," External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a statement issued Monday.</p>

<p>The Indian government, Mr Jaiswal, said, remains "deeply concerned" about the safety and security of its citizens in that country, and said efforts to provide consular services to Indian and Canadian citizens - a camp was being held inside the temple - "will not be deterred".</p>

<p>India's response comes after both the incident at the temple and a clash between those protesting the attack and the police cops. A video showed a cop charging at a protester and hitting him several times.</p>

<p>The journalist who shared the video - Daniel Bordman, a senior reporter with The National Telegraph - claimed cops went after the protesters to protect "Khalistanis who came to harass temple-goers..."</p>

<p>Earlier, the Indian High Commission said the "violent disruption" to the consular camp came despite an advance request for strong security measures, and that it feared for Indian citizens' safety.</p>

<p>The violence at Brampton's Hindu Sabha temple - blamed by Indo-Canadian MP Chandra Arya on Khalistani extremists - saw men breach the gates and assault people inside. Mr Arya said <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/canada-hindu-temple-attacked-canadian-mp-chandra-arya-condemns-attack-says-red-line-has-been-crossed-6938832" target="_blank">a "red line" had been crossed</a> and that the attack "shows how brazen Khalistani extremism has become..."</p>

<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - whose relationship with India is in the doldrums following repeated, and unsubstantiated, allegations about "agents" of Delhi being involved in the killing of Khalistani leader Hardeep Nijjar, branded a terrorist by India - called the violence "unacceptable".</p>

<p>Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown, meanwhile, called for punishment to the "greatest extent of law" for those who participated in the violence. "Religious freedom is a foundational value in Canada. Everyone should feel safe in their place of worship," he wrote on X.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for local police has said no arrests have been made, as yet.</p>

<p>The violence comes amid ongoing diplomatic back-and-forth between India and Canada, including two rounds of expulsion of diplomats. On Saturday, Ottawa named Delhi as a cyberthreat adversary, suggesting state-sponsored actors could be spying against it. India firmly dismissed the claim.</p>

<p>On that topic Mr Jaiswal said today, "This appears to be another example of a Canadian strategy to attack India. As I mentioned earlier, their senior officials have confessed they are seeking to manipulate global opinion against India. As on other occasions, imputations are made without evidence."</p>

<p>All of this comes after Canada accused India of orchestrating the 2023 killing, in Vancouver, of 45-year-old naturalised Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a prominent Khalistan activist.</p>

<p>Last year, a Hindu temple in Windsor, also in Ontario, was defaced, sparking widespread calls for action from both Canadian and Indian officials. Similar earlier incidents in Brampton saw temples targeted as well, drawing strong reactions from the Indian community in Canada.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Votes in the US state of Pennsylvania hold the power to make or break the chances of entering the White House for both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Pennsylvania holds 19 electoral votes. It was pivotal for the Democrats win in the 2020 election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">Formally called the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Democrats (blues) have enjoyed good strength in Pennsylvania since 1992, except in 2016 when the Republican (reds) leader Donald Trump was elected President.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Not getting big numbers in Pennsylvania could worsen Kamala Harris' chances as no Democrat has entered the White House without Pennsylvania since 1948.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">There are six lakh Asian-Americans in Pennsylvania, with Indian-Americans comprising the largest group. The Trump and Harris campaigns have acknowledged they face the toughest challenge in this state.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The major concerns in Pennsylvania include rising inflation and pressure on cost of living. For some time grocery prices have been rising the fastest in Pennsylvania.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Though Pennsylvania is considered a swing state with 19 electoral votes, it is no longer what it used to be a century ago when it had 38 electoral votes, double of what it has now. Many industrial states in the northern parts of the US have seen people migrate to other areas. Pennsylvania was no exception.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">To win the US elections, a candidate needs 270 of the electoral college votes. The results in seven battleground states of Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia will decide who will be the next President.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Along with Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia have an inordinate influence on deciding the winner because unlike the other states which are firmly with either party, these states can go either way - with the reds or the blues.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Donald Trump has been talking about illegal migration, crime, bringing back manufacturing and jobs, and inflation while also going off the teleprompter to add impromptu comments. In Pennsylvania, he mostly dumped the machines and went extempore.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">A day before the election, the presidential race appears to be hurtling toward a photo finish, with the final set of polls by The New York Times and Siena College finding Kamala Harris gaining new strength in North Carolina and Georgia.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Pennsylvania is also known as a "keystone state", to mean a central, wedge-shaped stone which holds all the other stones of a structure in place to form an arch. In early America, Pennsylvania played a vital geographic and strategic role in holding together the states of the newly formed Union.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Air Quality Index in Pakistan's Lahore stood at 1,900 on Sunday, its highest ever, prompting the country to write a letter to the Indian government to open a dialogue on the issue.</p>

<p>Even as the AQI in the city of 14 million people stood at least six times more than the limit defined by the World Health Organisation, the government imposed emergency measures like closing schools and issuing work-from-home mandates.</p>

<p>The level of deadly PM2.5 pollutants -- fine particulate matter in the air that causes the most damage to health -- peaked at 610 -- more than 40 times the limit of 15 in a 24-hour period considered healthy by the WHO.</p>

<p>Citizens have been urged to stay indoors, keep doors and windows shut, and avoid unnecessary travel, while smog counters have been set up at hospitals, Senior Minister of Punjab Marriyum Aurangzeb said. The government has also imposed a ban on three-wheelers known as rickshaws and halted construction in certain areas to reduce the pollution levels.</p>

<p>Pakistan said the situation has arisen due to winds carrying pollution from neighbouring India.&nbsp;Secretary for Environment and Climate Change Raja Jahangir Anwar told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/04/asia/pakistan-punjab-climate-diplomacy-india-smog-intl-hnk/index.html"><em>CNN</em></a>, "We need climate diplomacy, as a regional and global issue."</p>

<p>"We are suffering in Lahore in a way due to the eastern wind corridor coming from India. We are not blaming anyone, it's a natural phenomenon," he said.</p>

<p>Like in northern India, pollution spikes during the winters in Pakistan, leading to health complications among residents, including breathing difficulties, coughing and burning eyes. Smog is particularly pronounced in winter, when cold, denser air traps emissions from poor-quality fuels used to power the city's vehicles and factories at ground level.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the AQI in Delhi stood at 276 on Monday afternoon.</p>

<p>AQI as high as 151-200 is considered unhealthy, while an AQI rating between 201 to 300 is more harmful and AQI over 300 has been extremely hazardous.</p>

<p>Pollution in excess of levels deemed safe by the WHO shortens the life expectancy of Lahore residents by an average of 7.5 years, according to the University of Chicago's Energy Policy Institute.</p>

<p>According to UNICEF, nearly 600 million children in South Asia are exposed to high levels of air pollution and half of childhood pneumonia deaths are associated with air pollution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The first documented case of a woman using the Sarco “suicide pod” in Switzerland has taken a new turn. An autopsy reportedly found strangulation marks on her neck, sparking speculations about her death. This has led to questions about a possible equipment malfunction or interference, according to the Dutch newspaper de <a href="https://www.volkskrant.nl/kijkverder/v/2024/the-secrets-that-were-kept-regarding-the-death-of-a-64-year-old-woman-in-the-suicide-capsule-sarco~v1200398/?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F" rel="nofollow,noindex">Volkskrant</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The 64-year-old American woman died on September 23 in a secluded forest area near a cabin in Merishausen, a sparsely populated region of Switzerland close to the German border, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8144v9pveo" rel="nofollow,noindex">BBC</a> reported.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Sarco pod, designed by Dr Philip Nitschke, founder of Exit International, is intended to allow terminally ill patients to end their lives. Operated by the Swiss assisted-dying group The Last Resort, the pod requires the user to press an internal button, which releases nitrogen gas, causing them to fall asleep and then die peacefully within minutes due to oxygen deprivation.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Swiss police were notified and later found the woman's body inside the pod. Dr Florian Willet, president of The Last Resort, was reportedly the only person present at the time of her death and remains in custody.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Swiss Chief Prosecutor Peter Sticher, leading the investigation, has suggested that the woman's death may not have been as intended, indicating the possibility of “intentional homicide,” according to de Volkskrant. The report highlights that strangulation could be a factor, raising questions about the circumstances of her death.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The report notes that the pod was opened and closed several times before the procedure began to verify its seal.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">A forensic expert testified in court that the woman had severe injuries to her neck, which has further fuelled suspicion.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The incident was reportedly recorded by two surveillance cameras – one inside the pod, focused on the control button, and another mounted on a nearby tree. These cameras were motion-activated and not set to record continuously. De Volkskrant, who reviewed the footage, observed that the internal camera activated twice in quick succession around two minutes after the woman pressed the button, although the camera angle did not clearly show what occurred.</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to the report, Dr Willet later informed police that about two and a half minutes into the procedure, the woman's body appeared to cramp strongly – a reaction he described as typical in deaths involving nitrogen. Six and a half minutes after the woman initiated the process, the pod's iPad reportedly emitted a loud alarm, prompting Dr Willet, who was on a call with Dr Philip Nitschke, to say, “She's still alive, Philip.” The alarm ceased after some time, and roughly 30 minutes after pressing the button, Dr Willet reportedly confirmed, “She really looks dead.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Swiss authorities have yet to confirm these findings publicly, and the prosecutor's office has refrained from making an official statement on the ongoing investigation.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Swiss law prohibits assisted suicide if external assistance is involved or if those assisting have any “self-serving motive.”</p><p><div class='table-div suicide'><table class='table'><thead><tr><th colspan='2'>Helplines</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vandrevala Foundation for Mental Health</td><td><a href='tel:+919999666555'>9999666555</a> or <a href='mailto:help@vandrevalafoundation.com'>help@vandrevalafoundation.com</a> </td></tr><tr><td>TISS iCall</td><td><a href='tel:+912225521111'>022-25521111</a> (Monday-Saturday: 8 am to 10 pm)</td></tr> <tr><td colspan='2'>(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An 18-year-old man lost his life due to electrocution while charging his mobile phone on a bus in Malaysia. The incident took place on November 1 at the Penang Sentral bus terminal in Butterworth, shortly after he boarded an express bus heading to Kuala Lumpur. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/southeast-asia/malaysia-teen-electrocuted-phone-charger-bus-death-b2640786.html">Independent</a></em>, the teen plugged his phone into a bus socket to charge it.&nbsp;About ten minutes later, passengers heard him scream and noticed him foaming at the mouth. Witnessing the horrific scene, fellow passengers swiftly called emergency services.&nbsp;Emergency responders arrived at the scene around 6:20 pm local time. Tragically, paramedics pronounced the 18-year-old victim dead shortly after arrival.</p>

<p>An autopsy later confirmed electrocution as the official cause of death.&nbsp;According to the bus driver, the victim appeared to have suffered a severe electric shock, with burn marks visible on the fingers of his left hand. The charging cable had melted, and the phone had overheated, pointing to a critical failure of the electrical system.</p>

<p>''An initial investigation revealed burn marks on the victim's left fingers, suspected to be from an electric shock while he was charging his phone. The special task force will investigate the cause of the incident to ensure it does not recur and that the safety of passengers will be guaranteed,'' Mr Abdul Rahman, assistant commissioner of police, said in a statement, according to&nbsp;<em>The Straits Times.</em></p>

<p>Malaysian transport minister Anthony Loke said the department would form a special task force to investigate the incident.</p>

<p>''The transport ministry treats this electric shock incident, which tragically resulted in the death of a teenager while he was charging his phone on the express bus, with utmost seriousness,'' he said.&nbsp;He added that the task force has been given a deadline of two weeks to provide a full report on the incident.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>World leaders kick off UN climate talks next week, days after a knife edge US election that could send shockwaves through global efforts to limit dangerous warming.</p>

<p>The stakes are high for the COP29 conference in Azerbaijan where nations must agree a new target to fund climate action across huge swathes of the world.</p>

<p>It comes in a year likely to be the hottest in human history that has already witnessed a barrage of devastating floods, heatwaves and storms in all corners of the globe.</p>

<p>Nations are falling far short of what is needed to keep warming from hitting even more dangerous highs in the future.</p>

<p>But leaders arriving in Baku are wrestling with a host of challenges, including trade spats, economic uncertainty and conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine.</p>

<p>Adding to the uncertainty, the US vote and potential return of Donald Trump, who pulled out of the Paris Agreement and has called climate change a "hoax", could ripple through the negotiations and beyond.</p>

<p>"You can imagine that if Trump is elected, and if the election outcome is clear by the time that we get to Baku, then there will be sort of a crisis moment," said Li Shuo, a Washington-based expert on climate diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute.</p>

<p>He said that countries, likely including China, are preparing to send a "clear message" in support of global climate cooperation if Trump beats his rival Kamala Harris to the White House.</p>

<p>The UN talks are seen as critical to laying the groundwork for a major new round of climate commitments due early next year.</p>

<p>Current pledges would see the world blast past the internationally agreed limit of a 1.5 degrees Celsius rise in temperatures since the pre-industrial era.</p>

<p>"Decisions in Baku could profoundly shape the climate trajectory and whether 1.5 degrees remains within reach," said Cosima Cassel, of think tank E3G.</p>

<p><strong>Clash over cash</strong></p>

<p>Azerbaijan hosting the 11-22 November talks has drawn concerns over its heavy reliance on fossil fuels and its human rights record.</p>

<p>Countries last year committed to transition away from fossil fuels and triple renewables usage by 2030.</p>

<p>This year, negotiators must increase a $100 billion-a-year target to help poorer nations prepare for worsening climate impacts and wean off coal, oil and gas.</p>

<p>The overall amount of this new goal, where it comes from, and who has access are major points of contention.</p>

<p>Experts commissioned by the UN estimate that developing countries, excluding China, will need to spend $2.4 trillion per year by 2030 on climate priorities.</p>

<p>From that, $1 trillion must come from international public and private finance.</p>

<p>Wealthy existing donors, including the EU and US, have said new sources of money will have to be found, including from China and oil-rich Gulf states.</p>

<p>China –- today the world's largest polluter and second-largest economy –- does pay climate finance but on its own terms.</p>

<p>Between 2013 and 2022, China paid on average $4.5 billion a year to other developing countries, the World Resources Institute said in a September paper.</p>

<p>Money could also be raised by pollution tariffs, a wealth tax or ending fossil fuel subsidies, among other ideas.</p>

<p>Rachel Cleetus, policy director of the Climate and Energy programme at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said negotiators in Azerbaijan should aim for a $1 trillion deal.</p>

<p>This money "is not charity", Cleetus told AFP, adding that it should mostly come as aid or very low interest loans to avoid adding to developing nations' debt.</p>

<p>"Finance might sound like a technical issue, but we all know money talks," she told AFP.</p>

<p>"Nations either make those investments up front, or we'll be paying dearly for it after the fact, in disaster costs, in pollution costs. So this is a fork in the road. We have a choice."</p>

<p><strong>Green power</strong></p>

<p>Current climate pledges, even if implemented in full, would see the world lurch towards 2.6C warming by the end of the century -- threatening catastrophe for human societies and ecosystems, the UN Environment Programme has said.</p>

<p>A deal in Baku is seen as crucial to underpinning a set of more ambitious national pledges in the coming months.</p>

<p>Li said those future pledges could be impacted by the US vote, with countries, including China, waiting to see the outcome before finalising longer-term targets.</p>

<p>Beyond Baku, there is also an "increasing interconnection between climate and the economic agenda", he said, including trade tussles between clean energy powerhouse China and the US and Europe.</p>

<p>He said progress is more visible in "the green economy, who is winning the race when it comes to solar, wind, electric vehicles and energy storage".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For much of its history, the political landscape of the United States has seen two dominant forces: the Democrats and Republicans and it has continued since the mid-1800s. As the election approaches, the voters once again have two choices: Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican former President Donald Trump.</p>

<p><strong>History</strong></p>

<p>When the US Constitution was established in 1789, it made no mention of political parties. Many of the founders, including George Washington, were wary of factions, fearing it might lead to tyranny. Despite this, political groups quickly formed, primarily around two opposing views on federal power - the Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, and the Anti-Federalists, led by Thomas Jefferson.</p>

<p>The election of 1800, in which Jefferson defeated John Adams, was a turning point. The event led to the decline of Federalism and the rise of the Democratic-Republican Party. Over time, this party evolved, and by the 1820s, new coalitions formed, leading to the creation of the modern Democratic Party and the Republican Party in the mid-19th century.</p>

<p><strong>Implications Of The Electoral System</strong></p>

<p>One of the major reasons American voters face limited choices at the ballot box is the winner-take-all electoral system, particularly evident in single-member districts. In this setup, the candidate who receives the most votes wins, while all other votes effectively count for nothing. This system creates significant barriers for third parties, as voters often feel compelled to support one of the two major parties to avoid "wasting" their votes. Consequently, potential voters for third-party candidates may choose to align with Democrats or Republicans.</p>

<p>The structure of the Electoral College also reinforces this phenomenon during presidential elections. To win the presidency, candidates must secure a majority of electoral votes, which are awarded on a winner-take-all basis in most states. This further diminishes the chances for third-party candidates to gain traction, as they typically lack the resources and support necessary to compete on the national scale.</p>

<p><strong>Political Socialisation</strong></p>

<p>Political socialisation also plays a significant role in maintaining the two-party system. From a young age, Americans are often taught to identify with one of the two main parties through family, education and media. This creates a mindset that emphasises a binary choice in politics - that one must either be a Democrat or a Republican. The major parties have also built extensive fundraising networks and grassroots organisations, giving them an advantage in campaigning and outreach.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump doubled down Sunday on his baseless predictions of voter fraud in battleground states as he and rival Kamala Harris launched their frantic final 48 hours of campaigning to court the last holdouts in a bitterly contested US election.</p>

<p>The presidential race is going down to the wire, with more states functionally tied in polls at this point than in any comparable election.</p>

<p>Over 77.3 million people have now voted ahead of Election Day on Tuesday, just over half of the total ballots cast in 2020.</p>

<p>With the hours ticking away, 78-year-old Trump again indicated he may not accept a defeat and he added to his increasingly dark rhetoric by musing to supporters that he wouldn't mind if journalists were shot.</p>

<p>Democrats are "demonic," he told a crowd in Lititz, Pennsylvania, also telling his own supporters they would be "stupid" if they don't vote.</p>

<p>The Republican often sprinkles speeches with colorful insults, but the tone has become increasingly apocalyptic and tinged with violence.</p>

<p>Despite no evidence of any meaningful election cheating in the United States, he claimed that Democrats in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania "are fighting so hard to steal this damn thing."</p>

<p>And during his often unfocused 90-minute address, he recalled the near-miss assassination attempt against him in July, adding that for him to be shot again the bullet would have to pass through the crowd of media.</p>

<p>"To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news -- and I don't mind that so much. I don't mind that," he said to laughter.</p>

<p>Around the same time, Harris was quoting scripture in a majority-Black church in Detroit, Michigan and urging Americans to look beyond Trump.</p>

<p>"Let us turn the page and write the next chapter of our history," the US vice president said.</p>

<p>"While we know there are those who seek to deepen divisions, sow hate, spread fear and cause chaos, this moment in our nation has to be about so much more than partisan politics."</p>

<p>Harris called Trump's accusations of election fraud an attempt to make people feel "their vote won't matter."</p>

<p>"The systems that are in place for this election in 2024 have integrity," she said. "The people will determine the outcome of this election."</p>

<p>Harris also said she has mailed in her absentee ballot to California, and was "feeling great" about the 48-hour sprint.</p>

<p>A final New York Times/Siena poll Sunday flagged incremental changes in swing states, but the results from all seven remained within the margin of error.</p>

<p>Harris -- desperate to shore up the Great Lakes states known as the "blue wall" seen as essential to any Democratic victory -- was spending the day in Michigan, where she also heads to Pontiac and an evening rally at Michigan State University.</p>

<p>Trump's Sunday timetable centered on Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia, the three biggest swing-state prizes in the Electoral College system that awards states influence according to their population.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Trump made a rare admission to ABC News that "I guess you could lose, can lose. I mean, that happens, right?"</p>

<p>But at his Pennsylvania rally he said that in 2020, when he lost his reelection effort to Joe Biden and then tried to overturn the results, he "shouldn't have left" the White House.</p>

<p><strong>Final polls</strong></p>

<p>Like Pennsylvania, Michigan is among the closely watched battlegrounds.</p>

<p>Trump flipped the former Democratic stronghold on his way to defeating Hillary Clinton in 2016. Biden returned it to the Democratic column in 2020, buoyed by unionized workers and Black voters.</p>

<p>But this time, Harris risks losing the support of a 200,000-strong Arab-American community that has denounced Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Pollsters have noted an erosion in Black support for the Democratic ticket and Harris's aides acknowledge they still have work to do to turn out enough African-American men to match Biden's winning 2020 coalition.</p>

<p>But with abortion rights a top voter concern, her campaign has taken some comfort from the large proportion of women turning out among early voters.</p>

<p>Harris got a boost Saturday as the final Des Moines Register poll for Iowa -- seen as a highly credible test of wider public sentiment -- showed a stunning turnaround, with Harris ahead in a state won easily by Trump in 2016 and 2020.</p>

<p>Trump dismissed the findings as a "fake poll."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Furious locals hurled mud and insults at Spain's king, queen and prime minister on Sunday in a startling show of anger in the worst hit town in the flood disaster that has killed more than 210 people.</p>

<p>More heavy rain fell on the Valencia region after King Felipe VI, Queen Letizia and Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez were forced to leave Paiporta where more than 70 people died in floods last Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mud hit the monarchs in the face and clothes as they tried to calm the angry crowd in scenes that underscored the fury over the response to the disaster that has now killed at least 217 people with many more still missing.</p>

<p>The king and queen went to a crisis centre in Paiporta. But extra security guards soon had to keep the angry crowd, shouting "murders", away from the royals and prime minister. They put up umbrellas to stop mud hitting the royal couple.</p>

<p>The king said later that Spain had to "understand the anger and frustration" of people affected by the devastation to towns where cars have been left in muddy heaps in streets.</p>

<p>In a social media video, the king called on the public to give the victims "hope and their guarantee that the state in its entirety is present".</p>

<p>Most of the fury seemed directed at Prime Minister Sanchez and Valencia regional government head Carlos Mazon.</p>

<p>"I understand the social anger and of course, I'm here to receive it. This is my political and moral obligation," Mazon said in a post on X.</p>

<p>The rear window of Sanchez's car was broken before he and the local politicians quickly left. The socialist leader said that while he empathised with the "anguish and suffering" of the victims, he condemned "all forms of violence".</p>

<p>Spanish media later reported of the possible involvement of far-right groups during the incident. Sanchez's deputy Maria Jesus Montero reacted to the allegations on X, saying "We will not allow radical groups to profit from people's pain."</p>

<p>Spain's meteorological agency issued a "red alert" for new storms in the Valencia region on Sunday and heavy rain started falling in the night.</p>

<p>Police using megaphones urged Valencia residents to stay in their homes. While the alert was later downgraded, schools in Valencia were to remain closed Monday.</p>

<p><strong>'Towns buried by mud'</strong></p>

<p>Authorities have come under fire over the lack of warnings before the floods and the slow reaction after.</p>

<p>"I am aware the response is not enough, there are problems and severe shortages ... towns buried by mud, desperate people searching for their relatives ... we have to improve," Sanchez said.</p>

<p>With an extra 10,000 troops, police and civil guards sent to the Valencia region, Spain has now ordered its largest peacetime military and security force deployment, Sanchez said.</p>

<p>"Thank you to the people who have come to help us, to all of them, because from the authorities: nothing," a furious Estrella Caceres, 66, told AFP in the town of Sedavi.</p>

<p>In Chiva, restaurant owner Danna Daniella said she was still in shock, haunted by memories of people trapped by the raging floods "asking for help and there was nothing we could do".</p>

<p>"It drives you crazy. You look for answers and you don't find them."</p>

<p><strong>Volunteers out in droves</strong></p>

<p>Transport Minister Oscar Puente told El Pais daily that certain places would probably remain inaccessible by land for weeks.</p>

<p>An army of volunteers with food, water and cleaning equipment have played a key role in the recovery, though authorities have urged people to stay home to avoid congestion.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the Valencia government limited the number of volunteers authorised to travel to the city's southern suburbs to 2,000 and restricted access to 12 localities.</p>

<p>Despite this thousands made their way to stricken communes on foot, carrying brooms and shovels.</p>

<p>Storms coming off the Mediterranean are common this time of year. But scientists have warned that climate change is increasing the ferocity, length and frequency of extreme weather events.</p>

<p>Emergency services on Sunday listed 213 dead in the Valencia region, one in Andalusia in the south and three in Castilla-La Mancha neighbouring Valencia.</p>

<p>Authorities have warned the toll could rise as vehicles trapped in tunnels and underground car parks are cleared.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Mohamad Hamad purchased and tested explosive materials to cause harm, according to the criminal complaint.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two residents of Pittsburg in Pennsylvania have been arrested on hate crime charges related to the vandalism of Jewish buildings in July. Mohamad Hamad, one of the two arrested, identified himself as a “Hamas operative.” The <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69326681/united-states-v-hamad/ " rel="nofollow,noindex">criminal complaint</a> details that Hamad, a dual US-Lebanese citizen and a member of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard, purchased and tested explosive materials with the intention of causing harm.</p>

<p>Hamad, who showed support for extremist groups, allegedly donated to progressive Democrats known for their anti-Israel positions. He reportedly said he desired to die a martyr for Islam, sharing this with a known FBI informant through the encrypted messaging app Signal. In one message, he shared a photo of himself wearing a green headband with the Hamas logo and a sweatshirt that read, “Respect existence or expect resistance,” the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/03/us-news/pittsburgh-hamas-operative-allegedly-bought-explosives-vandalized-jewish-buildings-and-donated-to-squad-democrats/" rel="nofollow,noindex">NY Post</a>&nbsp;reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Talya Lubit, Hamad's alleged accomplice, is accused of spray-painting pro-Hamas graffiti on a synagogue and a Jewish community centre. In her communications, she referred to Jews as “enemies” and asked for her county council to pass a resolution calling for a cease-fire against Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jeremy Kazzaz, executive director of the Beacon Coalition, pointed out the troubling trend of anti-Israel sentiment infiltrating the Democratic Party. He told the NY Post, “In Pittsburgh, we've seen an infiltration of the Democratic Party by anti-Israel extremists who frequently target the Jewish community.” This particularly follows incidents of violence against Jewish students at the University of Pittsburgh this semester.</p>

<p>The complaint reveals that Hamad planned to conduct a practice run for an explosion and was excited about detonating explosive devices. Messages indicate he purchased 0.91 kg of aluminum powder and 0.91 kg of potassium perchlorate, materials commonly used in explosives.</p>

<p>Mr Kazzaz stressed the potential danger posed by the anti-Israel rhetoric from certain Democratic officials, suggesting that such rhetoric could embolden extremists. He said, “The way that Summer Lee views the world and has used her bully pulpit has legitimised these extremists.”</p>

<p>Both Hamad and Lubit have connections to the broader anti-Israel movement. Hamad reportedly donated to members of Congress who have publicly called for cease-fires.</p>

<p>“Jewish hatred can actually morph into dangerous situations and violence,” Mr Kazzaz said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On election eve in the United States, the presidential race is deadlocked. The polls are exceptionally close across the country and in all the swing states – Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin in the industrial midwest; Nevada and Arizona in the west; and Georgia and North Carolina in the south.</p>

<p>The final&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/us/politics/harris-trump-times-siena-poll.html?smid=nytcore-android-share">New York Times/Siena poll</a>&nbsp;shows Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris leading by a very small margin or tied with Republican former President Donald Trump in all the swing states. The exception is Arizona, where Trump leads by a few percentage points.</p>

<p>While there is no clear favourite to win, there are several critical factors that will driving voters' decisions on Election Day. This is what to watch.</p>

<h2>Republicans turning against Trump</h2>

<p><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/">Trump's favourability</a>&nbsp;is stuck around 43% in nationwide polling. In the past two presidential elections, he fell short of taking 50% of the national popular vote. As president, he never achieved over 50% favourability. And he has never topped 50% since leaving office.</p>

<p>This means he has hit a ceiling in his support and is highly unlikely to win the national popular vote on Tuesday.</p>

<p>This also reflects what happened to Trump in the Republican primaries to win the nomination. He dominated the field, defeating Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, and several others. But in most of those primaries, 15-20% of Republican voters did not vote for Trump.</p>

<p>Where will these Republican voters ultimately land on Tuesday? Probably half want to vote Republican and will go with Trump. Others will not being able to bring themselves to vote for Harris and will simply not vote for president.</p>

<p>Others will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/11/01/shy-kamala-harris-voters-polling-00186653?nname=politico-toplines&amp;nid=0000018f-3124-de07-a98f-3be4d1400000&amp;nrid=0000014e-f10e-dd93-ad7f-f90fc4bd0001&amp;nlid=2758340">switch their support to Harris</a>. Indeed, there has never been such a swelling of support from members of one party to support the other party's presidential candidate.</p>

<p>Harris needs those “Republicans for Harris” votes. In addition, she'll need to replicate the coalition of young voters, voters of colour and women who backed current President Joe Biden against Trump in 2020 in those same swing states and nationally.</p>

<p>Her&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/kamala-harris/">favourability ratings are higher</a>&nbsp;than Trump, at around 46%. The closer a presidential candidate is to 50% approval ratings, the better their chance of winning the election.</p>

<h2>It's the economy, stupid</h2>

<p>At the same time, the country is in a bad mood. There is a classic polling question asked at elections: is the country on the right track, or moving in the wrong direction? Between 60–70% of Americans believe the country is on the&nbsp;<a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/trackers/direction-of-the-united-states">wrong track</a>.</p>

<p>That is a signal this election is about change. Historically, that sentiment has not favoured the incumbent in the White House. As Biden's vice president, Harris is directly facing this headwind.</p>

<p>There are four key issues in this election. The most important is the hip pocket issue: household budgets, cost of living pressures and voters' concerns about their future economic security.</p>

<p>Since Biden and Harris took office nearly four years ago, the cost of groceries, household items, utilities and services such as insurance have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/31/economy-election-inflation-voters/?utm_campaign=wp_evening_edition&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;carta-url=https://s2.washingtonpost.com/car-ln-tr/3f7c234/6723efd22153e40ab67f980e/596bc4da9bbc0f403f965aab/12/50/6723efd22153e40ab67f980e">risen</a>&nbsp;between 10–40%. Petrol&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2022/why-gas-prices-so-high/?itid=lk_inline_manual_41">prices</a>&nbsp;have&nbsp;<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/gas-prices-climbed-14-year/story?id=108652610">gone up</a>&nbsp;even more.</p>

<p>Though interest rates&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/31/us-inflation-report">have fallen</a>, American households are hurting. When asked who is best to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/21/harris-trump-post-schar-school-poll/">manage the economy</a>, voters in swing states say Trump by a 15-point margin.</p>

<p>The next-biggest issue is immigration. Since Trump first became a presidential candidate in 2015, he has relentlessly pushed the immigration button, declaring the border with Mexico is out of control, with crime and pillage rising in its wake.</p>

<p>The first three years of Biden's term were also marked by big surges of immigrants crossing the border, though&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/07/illegal-crossings-border-migrants-drops/75553327007/#:%7E:text=The%20decline%20puts%20U.S.%20Border,2%20million%20in%20fiscal%202023.">rates have fallen</a>&nbsp;dramatically in 2024.</p>

<p>Voters view Trump as best placed to manage this issue, too, by&nbsp;<a href="https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/50846-donald-trump-leads-on-immigration-and-inflation-kamala-harris-on-abortion-and-health-care">nearly 15 points</a>.</p>

<p>So, Trump is seen as a more effective leader on the&nbsp;<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/652970/economy-immigration-abortion-democracy-driving-voters.aspx">two most important policy issues</a>&nbsp;in this election.</p>

<h2>A surge in support from women</h2>

<p>Abortion rights and reproductive health services are the third major issue. Many women across America are repelled by the Supreme Court's decision to take away their long-held constitutional right to an abortion. Now, this policy is decided at the state level. And several conservative Republican states – including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/17/ohio-abortion-rights-republicans-overturn">Ohio</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/2022-live-primary-election-race-results/2022/08/02/1115317596/kansas-voters-abortion-legal-reject-constitutional-amendment">Kansas</a>&nbsp;– have voted to restore abortion rights.</p>

<p>Harris is seen as the champion of these issues. Multiple&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/21/harris-trump-post-schar-school-poll/">polls</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/50846-donald-trump-leads-on-immigration-and-inflation-kamala-harris-on-abortion-and-health-care">show voters</a>&nbsp;trust her more than Trump on reproductive rights, by wide margins.</p>

<p>As a result, polling shows&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380132/gender-gap-election-harris-trump">Harris is leading Trump with women voters</a>&nbsp;in the swing states, by 15 points or more.</p>

<p>Abortion rights are also on the ballot in two swing states,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/states-abortion-laws-ballot-2024/">Nevada and Arizona</a>, which should help Harris in both.</p>

<p>The future of American democracy is the fourth major issue facing voters. According to a new poll,&nbsp;<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-fascist-concerns-poll/story?id=115083795">half the country</a>&nbsp;sees Trump as a profound threat to America's democracy who will wield authoritarian power to enforce his policies and programs.</p>

<p>Harris has pledged to turn the page, heal divisions and get Republicans and Democrats working together again.</p>

<p>In these closing days, Trump continues to make provocative statements with violent imagery. At a rally in Arizona last week, for instance, he again&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/us/politics/trump-liz-cheney-tucker-carlson.html?smid=nytcore-android-share">attacked</a>&nbsp;Liz Cheney, the former Republican congresswoman who&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/05/liz-cheney-urges-doj-to-prosecute-trump-if-it-finds-evidence-of-crimes-.html">advocated</a>&nbsp;for the prosecution of Trump over the January 6 insurrection:</p>

<p>This may have provided Harris with a final cut-through moment on Trump's fitness for office in the final days of the campaign. She&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/01/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/harris-calls-out-trump-00186804">said</a>&nbsp;in response:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anyone who wants to be president of the United States who uses that kind of violent rhetoric is clearly disqualified and unqualified to be president. […] Trump is increasingly, however, someone who considers his political opponents the enemy, is permanently out for revenge and is increasingly unstable and unhinged.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>So, who is going to win?</h2>

<p>Trump's team sees victory in all the polls. His chief pollster&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/10/31/trump-2024-election-polls-memo">wrote</a>&nbsp;late last week:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>President Trump's position nationally and in every single battleground state is significantly better than it was four years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The polls may also be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/23/polls-undercounting-trump-support">undercounting</a>&nbsp;the full measure of Trump's support, as was the case in 2016 and 2020. And the polls may not be reflecting the extent of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/26/republican-kamala-harris-racist-sexist-attacks">antipathy</a>&nbsp;towards Harris as a Black and south Asian woman.</p>

<p>Jen O'Malley Dillon, Harris' campaign director, and who headed the 2020 Biden campaign that defeated Trump, has&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/KamalaHarris/status/1851278124782141626">told her troops</a>, meanwhile, that undecided voters are “gettable”, adding:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have multiple pathways to victory […] Our folks are voting at levels we need them to vote in order for us to win.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Harris has built a US$1 billion (A$1.5 billion) machine designed to reach voters in the swing states – through personal contact. This machine made&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/joeygarrison/status/1852904117619835175?s=58">three million phone calls and door knocks on homes</a>&nbsp;in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin alone on Saturday. If this machine delivers, it could be the boost Harris needs on election night.</p>

<p>Harris' campaign also signalled over the weekend that late-deciding voters, and especially women, are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/01/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/plouffes-message-00186821">breaking their way</a>&nbsp;by double digits. There is a sense among Democrats that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/02/harris-future-forward-election/">Harris is now peaking</a>&nbsp;as the campaign concludes.</p>

<h2>The final analysis</h2>

<p>If Harris wins, it will be because she has successfully&nbsp;<a href="https://theblackwallsttimes.com/2024/10/30/full-transcript-of-vice-president-kamala-harriss-ellipse-speech/">sealed the deal</a>&nbsp;with those voters and made the election a referendum on Trump – that on balance the country has had enough of him after eight years. It also means her ground game delivered the votes.</p>

<p>If Trump wins, it will mean voters trusted him to manage inflation and the cost-of-living squeeze on households, as well as what they see as out-of-control immigration and crime. These messages would also have been further embellished by unease about Harris, a Black and south Asian woman, as president.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Iranian Revolutionary Guards general and pilot were killed in a helicopter crash during an anti-terror operation in the country's restive southeast, state media reported on Monday.</p>

<p>The "ultra-light gyroplane" of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps "had an accident while conducting combat operations" in a border area, IRNA news agency said.</p>

<p>It said the crash happened in Sirkan, a city in Sistan-Baluchistan province, and identified the dead as General Hamid Mazandarani, the commander of the Nineveh Brigade of Golestan province, and Hamed Jandaghi, a pilot of the IRGC ground forces.</p>

<p>Iran's armed forces have been mounting an operation in the region since October 26, when 10 police officers were killed in an attack claimed by Sunni Muslim militants.</p>

<p>They have killed several militants and arrested others during the operation, according to Iranian media outlets.</p>

<p>Sistan-Baluchistan borders Pakistan and Afghanistan, and is one of the most impoverished provinces in the Islamic republic.</p>

<p>It is home to a large number of the Baluch minority, an ethnic group spread between Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan who practise Sunni Islam in contrast to the country's predominantly Shiite population.</p>

<p>The province has experienced recurring clashes between Iranian security forces and rebels from the Baluch minority, radical Sunni groups and drug traffickers.</p>

<p>Helicopter accidents are a rare sight in Iran, but former president Ebrahim Raisi was killed when his helicopter crashed into a mountainside in May, triggering snap elections in the country.</p>

<p>The ultra-conservative president was accompanied by then foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and six other people who were all killed.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

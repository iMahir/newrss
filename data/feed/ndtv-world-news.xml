       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Texas man was put to death by lethal injection on Tuesday evening for the murders of teenage twin sisters, prison officials said, the sixth death row inmate to be executed in the United States in the past 12 days.</p>

<p>Before he was put to death in the state penitentiary in the city of Huntsville, Garcia White, 61, apologized to his victims' family. He was pronounced dead at 6:56 pm local time.</p>

<p>A former high school football star, White was convicted in 1996 of stabbing Annette and Bernette Edwards to death in December 1989.</p>

<p>According to court and prison records, White killed the mother, Bonita Edwards, of the 16-year-old girls following an argument at their Houston home and then murdered the two sisters.</p>

<p>White was not tried for the death of Bonita Edwards or for two other murders he confessed to committing, one in 1989 and another in 1995.</p>

<p>White's lawyers had filed a last-minute request for a stay of execution with the US Supreme Court, arguing that he was intellectually disabled and therefore not eligible for the death penalty.</p>

<p>"I would like to apologize for all the wrong I have done, and for pain I've caused to the Edwards family," White said before the execution, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice said in a statement. "I regret, I apologize, and I pray that you can find peace."</p>

<p>Texas has carried out four executions this year at the state penitentiary in Huntsville and another inmate, Robert Roberson, 57, is scheduled to be put to death on October 17, despite questions about his guilt.</p>

<p>Lawmakers in Texas, medical experts and the best-selling novelist John Grisham are among those seeking to halt the execution of Roberson, who was convicted of the 2002 death of his two-year-old daughter Nikki.</p>

<p>Roberson, who is autistic, took the girl to a hospital with severe head trauma and the child died the next day.</p>

<p>Roberson's lawyers and advocates have argued that the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome, made at the hospital where the child died, was erroneous.</p>

<p>In a letter to Texas officials, 34 doctors said the cause of death was in fact severe pneumonia, aggravated by the little girl being prescribed the wrong medication.</p>

<p>Roberson's autism, which was not diagnosed until 2018, was misconstrued at the time as showing indifference to the death of the toddler and this perception weighed heavily in his conviction, according to his lawyers.</p>

<p>Four executions were carried out in the United States last week and one the week before, bringing the total this year to 18.</p>

<p>The death penalty has been abolished in 23 of the 50 US states, while six others -- Arizona, California, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Tennessee -- have moratoriums in place.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Brazilian judge on Tuesday ordered the unblocking of the bank accounts of Elon Musk's X in the country after the social media platform agreed to pay more than $5 million in fines. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The ruling by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes paves the way for the suspension of X to be lifted in Brazil, where it has been off-limits to users since August 31 in a standoff over disinformation between the judge and Musk.</p>

<p>Moraes ordered X shut down in Latin America's biggest country after Musk refused to remove dozens of right-wing accounts and then failed to name a new legal representative in the country as ordered. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his latest decision, the judge ordered Brazil's central bank to unblock X's bank accounts so it can receive transfers and "immediately make payment of the fines indicated."&nbsp;</p>

<p>X had informed the court it would pay fines to the tune of some $5.2 million, according to the ruling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>High-profile judge Moraes has been engaged in a long feud with Tesla and SpaceX owner Musk as part of his drive to crack down on disinformation in Brazil. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The clash between the Brazilian court and the billionaire has morphed into a high-stakes tussle testing the limits of both freedom of expression and corporate responsibility in South America's largest country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>X had more than 22 million users in Brazil before the ban, which was put into place on August 31. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The company has in the last week started complying with the Brazilian court's conditions to get reactivated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Musk has repeatedly hit out at Moraes in social media posts, calling him an "evil dictator" and dubbing him "Voldemort" after the villain from the "Harry Potter" series. &nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump are hurtling toward their November election showdown, one of the closest contests in modern American history.</p>

<p>And in the handful of critical states framing the 2024 race, there is little daylight between the rivals with barely a month before Election Day on November 5.</p>

<p>Under the US Constitution, America's founding fathers established that each of the 50 states would hold its own vote for president.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then, under the complex Electoral College system, each state has a certain number of "electors," based on population. Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to whoever wins the popular vote.</p>

<p>With candidates needing 270 of the 538 electors to win, elections tend to be decided in the hotly contested "swing states" with a history of alternating between Republican and Democratic candidates.</p>

<p>This year, there are seven such battlegrounds, and virtually everyone is a toss-up. Here is a look:</p>

<h3><strong>Pennsylvania (19 Electoral College votes)</strong></h3>

<p>Pennsylvania was once reliably Democratic, but these days, they don't come much tighter than the Keystone State.</p>

<p>Republican Trump won the most populous battleground, with 13 million residents, by 0.7 percentage points in 2016. Joe Biden claimed it by 1.2 percentage points in 2020.</p>

<p>Known for its "Rust Belt" cities like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania has been blighted for decades by the steady decline of its industrial manufacturing base.</p>

<p>Trump and Harris have campaigned repeatedly in the eastern state. Trump, who survived an assassination attempt at a July rally there, is courting the rural white population and warning that migrants are overwhelming small towns.</p>

<p>Harris is touting recent infrastructure wins, and in Pittsburgh, she outlined plans to invest $100 billion in manufacturing, a key issue for state residents.</p>

<h3><strong>Georgia (16)</strong></h3>

<p>This southeastern state was an election flashpoint at the end of Trump's first term, and the controversy simmers.</p>

<p>Prosecutors in Georgia indicted Trump in an election interference case after he called state officials urging them to "find" enough votes to overturn Biden's narrow 2020 victory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But in a boost for Trump, the case is paused until after the election.</p>

<p>Biden was the first Democrat to win the Peach State since 1992. Demographic changes are likely to benefit Harris, who has courted minority voters across Georgia.</p>

<h3><strong>North Carolina (16)&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The southeastern state has voted Democratic only once since 1980, but Harris believes it's back in play.</p>

<p>The population, now over 10 million, is expanding and growing more diverse, benefiting Democrats.</p>

<p>Complicating matters for Trump, a scandal involving the state's Republican gubernatorial candidate has infuriated party officials who worry it could sink Trump in a close race.</p>

<p>As in neighbouring Georgia, one wild card is how the devastation from storm Helene, which recently laid waste to towns in western North Carolina, might impact the vote.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Michigan (15)</strong></h3>

<p>Trump flipped Michigan, a former Democratic stronghold, on his way to defeating Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p>

<p>Biden returned it to the blue column in 2020, buoyed by unionized workers and a large Black community.</p>

<p>But this time, Harris risks losing the support of a 200,000-strong Arab-American community that has denounced Biden's -- and by extension her -- handling of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.</p>

<h3><strong>Arizona (11)</strong></h3>

<p>The Grand Canyon state was among 2020's tightest races, with Biden triumphing by just 10,457 votes.</p>

<p>Trump hopes frustrations over the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policy will swing Arizona, which shares a border with Mexico, back in his favour.</p>

<p>Harris visited Arizona's border last week vowing to crack down on migration and work on reviving last year's bipartisan border bill, which she said Trump "tanked" for political purposes.</p>

<p>Of the battlegrounds, Arizona is showing the largest poll advantage: Trump up by two percentage points.</p>

<h3><strong>Wisconsin (10)</strong></h3>

<p>Clinton lost Wisconsin after giving the state a wide berth during the 2016 campaign.</p>

<p>As with Midwestern neighbour Michigan, it was a different story when Trump's opponent was Biden, who turned a 23,000-vote deficit into a winning margin of 21,000 for Democrats.</p>

<p>Trump considers it winnable, and his party held its summer national convention there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While Trump led early against Biden, Harris has a tiny polling edge.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The two candidates for US president offer starkly different visions of the world, with November's election carrying the potential to dramatically change policy toward Ukraine and other partners.</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris largely offers continuity with President Joe Biden, though she has sought more nuance on the Middle East in particular, while a return of Donald Trump would likely mean a sharp rupture from current US foreign policy.</p>

<h3><strong>Ukraine&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Few issues divide the two candidates as much as Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump has scoffed at the billions of dollars in US aid to Ukraine, saying that Russia, which invaded its smaller neighbour in February 2022, is destined to win.</p>

<p>The Republican has in the past voiced admiration for Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, comments seized upon by Harris, who in their September debate said, "If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now."</p>

<p>Harris has promised to keep up support for Ukraine, while Trump's aides have suggested leveraging US assistance to force Ukraine into territorial concessions to end the war quickly.</p>

<p>Trump has also mocked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as the "greatest salesman" in a jab at his lobbying for US military aid, although the two recently had a cordial meeting.</p>

<h3><strong>Middle East</strong></h3>

<p>Harris and Trump are both solidly pro-Israel but they diverge on how far to pressure the US ally as war spreads in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Harris, like Biden, has made clear she will keep arming Israel, distancing herself from calls from the left of their Democratic Party for an arms embargo for the sake of sparing civilians.</p>

<p>But Harris has also called for Palestinian "self-determination" and said she will "not be silent" on the suffering in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Trump's Republican base is staunchly pro-Israel and he has repeatedly attacked Biden's record as a failure, including on Tuesday as Iran fired missiles in response to Israel's killings of top Hezbollah militants and Iranian commanders in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Trump as president took a series of landmark actions on Israel's behalf, including moving the US embassy to flash point Jerusalem and giving Arab nations incentives to recognize Israel.</p>

<p>But he also has a complicated history with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he criticized for joining other world leaders in recognizing that Biden won the 2020 US election -- an outcome that Trump refused to accept despite overwhelming evidence.</p>

<h3><strong>China and Taiwan&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Policymakers of both US political parties have spoken of China as the top long-term challenger, though they differ on rhetoric and approach.</p>

<p>Trump has relentlessly attacked China in his stump speeches and has vowed to impose massive tariffs on Chinese goods, hoping to boost manufacturing at home. But despite his public statements, he has also indicated he is open to deal-making with President Xi Jinping.</p>

<p>Biden has in some ways gone further than Trump, including by imposing a sweeping ban on high-tech chip exports.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris has highlighted Trump's reluctance while he was in office to take similar measures, charging that he "basically sold us out," with China's military benefiting from US technology.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Taiwan, the self-ruling democracy claimed by Beijing, Trump has caused jitters by suggesting that it pay for its defence, likening the United States to an insurance company.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris, as vice president, has pledged to maintain the status quo, stating that "we support Taiwan's self-defence, consistent with our longstanding policy."</p>

<h3><strong>US allies&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In a sharp break from previous presidents of both parties, Trump has questioned the utility of NATO, the collective defence alliance formed at the start of the Cold War.</p>

<p>Trump even said in February he would encourage the Russians to do "whatever the hell they want" to NATO allies that do not pay more on defence.</p>

<p>Harris has frequently pointed to Trump's remarks as she promises, like Biden, to work with allies and stand by NATO.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump in his first term showed he was ready to break with international agreements he does not like, including the Iran nuclear deal.</p>

<p>He would also be expected to champion tough US pressure against leftist leaders in Latin America, particularly Cuba and Venezuela, although neither Biden nor Harris has deviated sharply from his approach.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US vice presidential contenders JD Vance and Tim Walz took on the crisis in the Middle East as they met Tuesday for what could be an unusually important undercard debate, competing for decisive votes weeks before the election.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/tim-walz-jd-vance-shake-hands-before-us-vice-presidential-debate-starts-6696928">showdown</a> between Walz, the Democratic Minnesota governor chosen by Kamala Harris, and Vance, the Republican senator from Ohio who is Donald Trump's running mate, is likely to be the last of the 2024 campaign.</p>

<p>Trump has refused a second debate with Vice President Harris, meaning this could be the final chance to see the two tickets go head to head.</p>

<p>The first question of the night was on Iran's missile attack on Israel and Walz immediately turned his fire on Trump's foreign policy record, slamming the ex-president for his "turn towards" Russia's Vladimir Putin" and his withdrawal of the United States from the 2015 Iran nuclear disarmament deal, known as the JCPOA.</p>

<p>"As much as Governor Walz just accused Donald Trump of being an agent of chaos, Donald Trump actually delivered stability in the world," Vance countered.</p>

<p>"And he did it by establishing effective deterrence. People were afraid of stepping out of line."</p>

<p>Vance, 40, and Walz, 60, each claim to be the true voice of the crucial <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/why-the-vance-walz-debate-boils-down-to-contrasting-versions-of-masculinity-6683266">swing states</a> -- including Michigan and Wisconsin -- that could decide an election that remains on a knife edge with five weeks to go.</p>

<p>History suggests vice-presidential debates rarely move the dial much. But in an election campaign that has seen Harris step in for President Joe Biden unprecedentedly late in the game, Tuesday's contest may have added significance.</p>

<p>Biden offered words of encouragement for Walz, telling him in a post on X ahead of his big night: "Coach, I got your back tonight!"</p>

<p>The race has seen Vance and Trump use increasingly divisive rhetoric and even falsely accuse immigrants of eating people's pets -- meaning the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/the-vance-walz-us-vice-presidential-debate-all-you-need-to-know-6672924">debate</a> could make for fiery television.</p>

<p>"It will whet a lot of people's appetites for November 5," Thomas Whalen, an associate professor of social sciences at Boston University, told AFP.</p>

<p>But the debate itself risked being overshadowed by Mideast tensions, after Iran launched ballistic missiles against Israel, which said it largely repelled the attack.</p>

<p>Trump, visiting swing state Wisconsin on Tuesday, focused on the crisis, insisting that "if I were in charge, today's attack on Israel never would have happened."</p>

<p>Should Harris and Walz win, he warned, "the world goes up in smoke."</p>

<p>Trump told Vance to "have fun" when he was asked what advice he would give, praising his running mate as a "warrior."</p>

<p>Harris for her part pledged her "unwavering" commitment to the security of Israel after Iran launched what she called "a reckless and brazen attack" on America's ally.</p>

<p>The CBS clash comes as several states dig out from enormous storm Helene, which has left at least 150 people dead and brought misery to many thousands more.</p>

<h3><strong>'High drama'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Walz and Vance were each picked by their bosses to reach out to voters in the Midwestern battlegrounds where, thanks to the country's idiosyncratic electoral college system, a few thousand votes could determine who wins the White House race.</p>

<p>Both are military veterans with strong blue-collar credentials. Vance authored the Rust Belt memoir "Hillbilly Elegy" while Walz boasts a folksy persona as a former teacher and football coach.</p>

<p>The similarities end there.</p>

<p>The combative Vance shares Trump's penchant for courting controversy, whether by smearing Democrats as "childless cat ladies" or by boosting false claims that Haitians living in an Ohio town ate residents' pets.</p>

<p>His goal will be to overcome polls that initially had him as one of the least popular VP nominees in history after a series of previous comments on women and abortion were unearthed.</p>

<p>"Vance has to be careful because I think a trap has been laid for him," said Whalen.</p>

<p>The cheery Walz will be seeking to introduce himself to a public that barely knows him, after Harris's swift rise to replace Biden as the Democratic nominee.</p>

<p>He became a hit with Democrats for branding Vance and Trump "weird" and for his progressive politics -- but that will be a target for Vance as he and Trump seek to paint Walz and Harris as "Marxists."</p>

<p>Vance "is going up against a moron, a total moron," Trump said in an interview Monday on Fox Nation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran launched a barrage of 181 ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday night, triggering nationwide air raid sirens and forcing nearly 10 million Israelis into bomb shelters. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported that a large portion of the missiles was intercepted by the country's advanced missile defence systems, including the Iron Dome and Arrow systems. However, several projectiles managed to penetrate the defence shield, leading to minor damage and light injuries.</p>

<h2><strong>Immediate Response</strong></h2>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the attack, stating that Iran had made a "big mistake" and warned Tehran that it "will pay for it."</p>

<p>The missile salvo is the second direct attack by Iran on Israel this year, following a similar offensive in April, which was quickly subdued by Israeli and allied defences. Tuesday's strikes, according to Iranian officials, were in retaliation for the recent killing of senior Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Israeli military operations.</p>

<p>Guy Nir, spokesperson of the Israeli embassy in India, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ndtv-exclusive-will-irans-missile-attack-lead-to-a-full-scale-war-israeli-spokesperson-guy-nir-gives-a-hint-6696110#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll">speaking exclusively to NDTV</a>, said an appropriate response will be given to Tehran. "If he (Ayatollah Ali Khamenei) plans to initiate a full-scale war with Israel, it will be a mistake for them (Iran)," Mr Nir told NDTV. "Israel's response is going to be something strategic and pin-pointed, and not a full-scale war. I don't think any side wants that."</p>

<p>Iran's Ambassador to India<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ndtv-exclusive-iran-ambassador-calls-israel-pm-benjamin-netanyahu-hitler-of-21st-century-says-india-can-help-stop-war-6696604#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll"> Iraj Elahi warned that his country will "strike Israel again"</a> if it doesn't de-escalate tensions in the region. "If the Hitler of our time (Netanyahu) stops his brutality and hostility, then his country won't have to face the consequences," Mr Elahi told NDTV.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>US Warning Of Severe Consequences</strong></h2>

<p>In response to the attack, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan issued a stark warning to Iran, stating that the missile strike represented a "significant escalation" and that there would be "severe consequences." During a press briefing at the White House, Sullivan pledged that the US would stand by Israel and support any retaliatory measures.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden echoed this sentiment, expressing full support for Israel and indicating that military discussions were underway to determine an appropriate response. Biden assured that the US military would assist in Israel's defence and intercept any further Iranian missile strikes. Asked about the scope of US involvement, Biden commented that discussions on a joint response were "active" and "ongoing."</p>

<h2><strong>The Attack And Aftermath</strong></h2>

<p>Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) claimed responsibility for the missile assault, targeting three Israeli military bases near Tel Aviv. Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi declared the attack concluded unless Israel escalated further. The IRGC warned that any Israeli retaliation would result in "crushing attacks."</p>

<p>Although the majority of missiles were intercepted, there were scattered reports of damage and injuries. In Tel Aviv, two civilians were lightly injured by shrapnel, while in the West Bank city of Jericho, a Palestinian civilian was killed by debris from one of the missiles, news agency AFP reported. The Israeli military quickly announced that the immediate threat had passed, and civilians were allowed to leave bomb shelters after an hour.</p>

<h2><strong>Regional And Global Implications</strong></h2>

<p>Tehran's missile strike comes amid growing fears of a broader regional conflict. In a related escalation, Israeli forces conducted ground raids in southern Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah positions. Lebanese authorities reported that the latest Israeli airstrikes had killed at least 55 people, adding to the mounting casualties since the conflict intensified in early October.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry stated that over 1,800 people had been killed since the conflict began, with hundreds of thousands displaced across the region. The potential for further escalation between Israel and Iranian-backed groups in Lebanon and Gaza has raised alarms across the international community.</p>

<h2><strong>International Reactions</strong></h2>

<p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the attack, calling for an immediate ceasefire and warning against the broadening conflict in the Middle East. "This must stop. We absolutely need a ceasefire," Guterres said in a statement.</p>

<p>As tensions continued to rise, Jordan, Iraq, and Israel closed their airspace, and flights were suspended at Tehran International Airport, Ben Gurion Airport in Israel, and other regional hubs. Neighbouring countries, including Iraq and Jordan, are bracing for further fallout, with Iran-backed Iraqi militias threatening to target US bases in the region should Washington become involved in the conflict.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Democrat Tim Walz and Republican JD Vance, two sons of America's Midwestern heartland with deeply opposing views on the issues gripping the country, shook hands on Tuesday night to start the only vice presidential debate of the Nov. 5 election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrat Tim Walz and Republican JD Vance, two sons of America's Midwestern heartland with deeply opposing views on the issues gripping the country, shook hands on Tuesday night to start the only vice presidential debate of the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>Walz, 60, the liberal governor of Minnesota and a former high school teacher, and Vance, 40, a bestselling author and conservative firebrand US senator from Ohio, are expected to clash early and often, with each trying to land a lasting blow in an event that has historically had little measurable impact on White House campaigns.</p>

<p>Aides to the two men predicted fireworks during the 90-minute televised debate at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York, as they defended themselves and spoke up for the candidates at the top of each ticket, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican former President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Walz has called his Republican opponents "weird," and Vance came under fire for past comments disparaging some Democrats as "childless cat ladies."</p>

<p>Harris and Trump were expected to watch the debate, which began at 9 p.m. (0100 GMT on Wednesday), and Trump said he would offer a play-by-play commentary of the event on social media.</p>

<p>Harris was widely viewed as the winner of her sole debate with Trump on Sept. 10 in Philadelphia, which was watched by an estimated 67 million people.</p>

<p>That square-off did little to change the trajectory of an extremely close election battle. While Harris has edged ahead in national polls, most surveys show voters remain fairly evenly divided in the seven states that will decide the November election.</p>

<p>Political analysts say vice presidential debates can be fiery but generally do not alter the outcome of an election. That said, even a slight shift in public opinion could prove decisive with the race on a razor's edge five weeks before Election Day.</p>

<p>The main takeaway from the last V.P. debate, the 2020 encounter between then-Senator Harris and then-Vice President Mike Pence, was a fly that landed on Pence's head unbeknownst to Pence himself.</p>

<p>With no more debates planned, the stand-off allows Walz and Vance to make closing arguments on behalf of their campaigns - just as early voting ramps up across the country.</p>

<h3><strong>MUD-SLINGING</strong></h3>

<p>Walz, who has sought to cultivate a homespun image as a former high school football coach, is expected to get Vance to defend his 2021 comments criticizing Harris and other Democrats as "a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Walz is also likely to go after Vance for spreading a fictional story of Haitian immigrants eating household pets in Springfield, Ohio, a false claim that Trump has repeated and that local officials say has drawn bomb threats.</p>

<p>The Democrat will seek to introduce himself to U.S. voters who may not be familiar with him while aiming to keep the conversation focused on Harris' agenda, said a Walz adviser who asked to remain anonymous to discuss strategy.</p>

<p>Trump advisers said Vance will try to force Walz to defend the Biden-Harris administration's policies on immigration and the economy, as well as his own handling of the riots in Minneapolis in 2020 after the death of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of a white policeman.</p>

<p>Vance will also bring up questions about Walz's military service, said Tom Behrends, a retired command sergeant major who joined a Trump campaign call about the debate.</p>

<p>Republicans have accused Walz of exaggerating his final rank in the Army National Guard, where he served for 24 years. In the past, Walz described himself as a retired command sergeant major, one of the highest non-commissioned officer positions in the Army.</p>

<p>While he achieved that rank, he did not meet the requirements to retire with that title.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign says also Walz "misspoke" in 2018 during his gubernatorial campaign in Minnesota when he referred to "weapons of war, that I carried in war." Walz was never deployed to a war zone.</p>

<p>Vance is a former Marine who served as a military journalist. He was deployed to Iraq but never saw combat.</p>

<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Minnesota Public Radio reported that Walz was not in China during the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown as he had previously claimed but travelled there months later, another misstatement likely to draw Vance's fire.</p>

<p>Despite Vance's having written "Hillbilly Elegy," a popular 2016 memoir, US voters have a negative view of him, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows, with 51% of registered voters saying they view him unfavourably, compared with 39% who view him favourably. Meanwhile, Walz was viewed favourably by 44% of registered voters, with 43% reporting an unfavourable view in the Sept. 20-23 poll.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>an said early on Wednesday that its missile attack on Israel was finished barring further provocation, while Israel and the U.S. promised to retaliate against Tehran's escalation as fears of a wider war intensified.</p>

<p>Washington said it would work with longtime ally Israel to make sure Iran faced "severe consequences" for Tuesday's attack.</p>

<p>The United Nations Security Council scheduled a meeting about the Middle East for Wednesday, and the European Union called for an immediate ceasefire.</p>

<p>"Our action is concluded unless the Israeli regime decides to invite further retaliation. In that scenario, our response will be stronger and more powerful," Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said in a post on X early on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Israel early on Wednesday renewed its bombardment of Beirut's southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold, with at least three strikes against what it said were targets belonging the group.</p>

<p>Large smoke plumes seen rising from parts of the suburbs. Israel issued new evacuation orders for the area, which have largely emptied after days of heavy strikes.</p>

<p>In its biggest ever military blow against Israel, Iran fired more than 180 ballistic missiles on Tuesday, according to Israel. Sirens sounded across the country and explosions rattled Jerusalem and the Jordan River valley as the entire population was told to seek shelter in bomb shelters.</p>

<p>No injuries were reported in Israel, but one man was killed in the occupied West Bank, authorities there said.</p>

<p>Iran described the campaign as defensive and solely aimed at Israeli military facilities. Iran's state news agency said three Israeli military bases had been targeted.</p>

<p>Tehran said its attack was responding to Israeli killings of militant leaders and aggression in Lebanon against the Iran-backed armed movement Hezbollah and in Gaza.</p>

<p>Israel activated air defences against Iran's bombardment and most missiles were intercepted "by Israel and a defensive coalition led by the United States," Israeli Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a video on X, adding: "Iran's attack is a severe and dangerous escalation."</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to hit back. "Iran made a big mistake tonight - and it will pay for it," Netanyahu said at the outset of an emergency political-security cabinet meeting late on Tuesday, according to a statement.</p>

<p>Any Israeli response to Tuesday's missile attack would be met with "vast destruction" of Israeli infrastructure, Iran's General Staff of the Armed Forces said in a statement carried by state media, also promising to target regional assets of any Israeli ally that got involved.</p>

<p>Fears that Iran and the U.S. would be drawn into a regional war have risen with Israel's growing assault on Lebanon in the past two weeks, including the start of a ground operation there on Monday, and its year-old conflict in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Iran's forces on Tuesday used hypersonic Fattah missiles for the first time, and 90% of its missiles successfully hit their targets in Israel, the Revolutionary Guards said.</p>

<p>Israel's Hagari said central and southern Israel received limited strikes. A video released by the military showed a school in the central city of Gadera heavily damaged by an Iranian missile.</p>

<p>U.S. Navy warships fired about a dozen interceptors against Iranian missiles headed toward Israel, the Pentagon said. Britain said its forces played a part "in attempts to prevent further escalation in the Middle East" without elaborating.</p>

<p>U.S. President Joe Biden expressed full U.S. support for Israel and described Iran's attack as "ineffective." Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate for U.S. president, backed Biden's stance and said the U.S. would not hesitate to defend its interests against Iran.</p>

<p>"We will act. Iran will soon feel the consequences of their actions. The response will be painful," Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon told reporters.</p>

<p><strong>U.S. DOES NOT URGE RESTRAINT</strong></p>

<p>The White House similarly promised "severe consequences" for Iran and spokesman Jake Sullivan told a Washington briefing the U.S. would "work with Israel to make that the case."</p>

<p>Sullivan did not specify what those consequences might be, but he stopped short of urging restraint by Israel as the U.S. did in April when Iran carried out a drone and missile attack on Israel. The Pentagon said Tuesday's airstrikes by Iran were about twice the size of April's assault.</p>

<p>U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned what he called "escalation after escalation", saying: "This must stop. We absolutely need a ceasefire."</p>

<p>EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell also called for an immediate regional ceasefire. "The dangerous cycle of attacks and retaliation risks ... spiralling out of control," he posted on X.</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke with the leaders of Germany and France, and they agreed on a need for restraint from all sides, Downing Street said.</p>

<p>Nearly 1,900 people have been killed and more than 9,000 wounded in Lebanon in almost a year of cross-border fighting, most in the past two weeks, according to Lebanese government statistics on Tuesday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday survived a second vote of no confidence in as many weeks, brought again by his main Tory rival intent on unseating his beleaguered Liberals.</p>

<p>The 207 to 121 vote was largely a repeat of the Conservatives' failed attempt last week to trigger snap elections, which saw two smaller factions in parliament siding with Trudeau's minority government.</p>

<p>The motion accused the government of failing to address a housing crunch, rising crime and costs of living, and of being "the most centralizing government in Canadian history."</p>

<p>With a 20-point lead in public opinion polling, Tory leader Pierre Poilievre has been itching to go to the polls since the leftist New Democratic Party (NDP) last month tore up a coalition agreement with the Liberals, leaving the Trudeau administration vulnerable to being toppled.</p>

<p>But the NDP and other opposition parties, whose support is needed to bring down the Liberals, have pushed back against his right-wing agenda.</p>

<p>Still, Poilievre has vowed to keep trying.</p>

<p>In Canada's Westminster parliamentary system, a ruling party must hold the confidence of the House of Commons, which means maintaining support from a majority of members.</p>

<p>The Liberals currently have 153 seats, versus 119 for the Conservatives, 33 for the Bloc Quebecois, and the NDP's 25.</p>

<p>Trudeau swept to power in 2015, and has managed to hold on through two ballots in 2019 and 2021.</p>

<p>But his popularity has plunged and he has faced a number of setbacks in recent months, including by-election losses in two of his party's strongholds.</p>

<p>The deal with the New Democratic Party to prop up the Liberals would have kept his government in office until late 2025.</p>

<p>But the NDP, seeing its alignment with the Liberals hurting its own popularity, exited the pact early.</p>

<p>Most analysts have told AFP they do not anticipate Canadians going to the polls before spring 2025, but added that the situation is fluid.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Liberals have been left weakened as they seek to continue governing in a fractured parliament.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Iran's Ambassador to India Iraj Elahi today said that his country will "strike Israel again", if Tel Aviv doesn't refrain from attacking Tehran's national assets and interests in the region.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's Ambassador to India Iraj Elahi today said that his country will "strike Israel again", if Tel Aviv doesn't refrain from attacking Tehran's national assets and interests in the region.</p>

<p>Calling the missile attack on Israel a "retaliatory operation", the Ambassador said that "Iran does not joke about its international interests and national security." The Ambassador's remarks come after a sharp escalation in the West Asia conflict when Tehran on Tuesday fired nearly 200 missiles targeting all of Israel.</p>

<p>The nearly year-long conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza strip has intensified with Tel Aviv going after Hezbollah - an Iran-backed militant organisation which supports Hamas. Iran had vowed to avenge the killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, killed last week, and had warned Israel of an imminent ballistic missile attack against it.</p>

<p>Speaking exclusively to NDTV, Iran's Ambassador said, "If Israel does not stop its hostility and its violations against the Iran's national interests, it will face such strikes again and again."</p>

<p>He went on to say that "People, not only in the region, but across the world are witnessing Israel's hostile moves in West Asia. Everyone is seeing the bloodshed in Gaza and south Lebanon. People are angry. Israel has violated all human rights treaties, all international laws, so, many people all over the world are very angry with what Israel is doing in the region."</p>

<p>The Ambassador further said that he believes Iran's missile attack on Israel will be "supported by many, many people around the world. You have seen how people marched in universities across the world protesting against Israel's brutality against Palestine."</p>

<h2><strong>NETANYAHU'S WARNING AFTER IRAN MISSILE ATTACK</strong></h2>

<p>Meanwhile, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu called Iran's missile attack on Israel "A failed attempt", as Israel's Iron Dome and other mechanisms to stop such attacks prevented most of the 180-plus missiles from hitting its territories, with only a few missiles penetrating its defence.</p>

<p>Mr Netanyahu also said that "Iran made a big mistake tonight - and it will pay for it."</p>

<p>Speaking about the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Elahi referred to him as "the new Hitler of this century". Repeating his statement, the Ambassador further said, "If the Hitler of our time stops his brutality and hostility, then his country won't have to face the consequences," adding that "Iran will keep retaliating if Israel continues."</p>

<h3><strong>AMERICA BACKING ISRAEL</strong></h3>

<p>President Joe Biden has come in support of Israel and condemned the "provocative escalation" by Israel, according to a statement by the White House. The US President ordered the US military to help Israel against any further missile attacks. The US reportedly also warned that areas from where missiles will be launched against Israel will be targeted by the US military.</p>

<p>Commenting about US's support to Israel, the Ambassador told NDTV that "I hope the United States realises and reaches the conclusion that if they stop their support to Tel Aviv, Israel cannot carry on its crimes in the region. I hope the US Administration will convince Netanyahu and oblige (guide) him to stop the brutality."</p>

<p>"We have seen what America has done in Afghanistan, in Iraq, in Libya, and many other parts of the world. So, we believe that the US is behind many developments leading to the instability of the region," he added.</p>

<p>"It is up to Israel now - whether they want to keep continuing this escalation or not (end it). If they continue, we will keep retaliating," Mr Elahi further said, suggesting that the ball is now in the court of "the decision makers of Israel".</p>

<h3><strong>INDIA'S ROLE AS 'FRIEND' OF BOTH IRAN AND ISRAEL</strong></h3>

<p>The Iranian Ambassador saiid he has always believed that "India is a very important player in the region. It has good relations with Israel, and as PM Modi has mentioned that this is not the era for war. We in Iran believe that. But if a country violates the sovereignty of another country, what else can that country do?"</p>

<p>He hoped however, that "India, which has close ties with both sides (Iran and Israel), can help convince Israel to stop its brutality in the region."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose by $1.09, or 1.56%, to $70.92 per barrel at 2254 GMT on fears of oil supply disruptions in the Middle East after Iran fired ballistic missiles at Israel.</p>

<p>Brent futures will resume trading at 0000 GMT on Wednesday. Brent gained $1.86, or 2.6%, on Tuesday to settle at $73.56 a barrel.</p>

<p>Iran fired more than 180 ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday, Israel said, in retaliation for Israel's campaign against Tehran's Hezbollah allies in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Iran, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), is a major oil producer in the region.</p>

<p>"The direct involvement of Iran, an OPEC member, raises the prospect of disruptions to oil supplies," ANZ Research said in a note, referring to the conflict.</p>

<p>Iran's oil output rose to a six-year high of 3.7 million barrels per day in August, ANZ added.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised Iran would pay for its missile attack against Israel, while Tehran said any retaliation would be met with "vast destruction", raising fears of a wider war.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, said on Tuesday that Iran was a "dangerous" and "destabilizing" force in the Middle East and Washington was committed to Israel's security.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, said on Tuesday that Iran was a "dangerous" and "destabilizing" force in the Middle East and Washington was committed to Israel's security.</p>

<p><strong>WHY IT'S IMPORTANT</strong></p>

<p>The comments from Harris, who faces Republican former President Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 U.S. election, came hours after Iran fired ballistic missiles at Israel in retaliation for Israel's military campaign in Lebanon, drawing vows of a sharp response from Israel and the U.S.</p>

<p>No injuries were reported in Israel and Washington called Iran's attack ineffective.</p>

<p><strong>KEY QUOTES</strong></p>

<p>"I'm clear-eyed Iran is a destabilizing, dangerous force in the Middle East," Harris said. "I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist militias."</p>

<p>"I fully support President (Joe) Biden's order for the U.S. military to shoot down Iranian missiles targeting Israel," Harris said. "Initial indications are that Israel, with our assistance, was able to defeat this attack."</p>

<p>Harris added that Washington will work with its allies to disrupt what she called Iran's "aggressive behavior."</p>

<p><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>

<p>Israel has escalated its military campaign in Lebanon in recent days, killing hundreds and displacing more than a million due to operations that Israel says are targeting Lebanese Iran-backed Hezbollah militants.</p>

<p>Israel's military campaign in Lebanon is in addition to its war in Gaza that followed a deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Palestinian Hamas militants. Israeli's military assault on Gaza has killed tens of thousands according to Palestinian health authorities, displaced nearly everyone there, caused a hunger crisis and prompted genocide allegations that Israel denies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel Defense Forces or IDF is currently assessing the missile attack by Iran today and an appropriate response will be given to Tehran, said Guy Nir, spokesperson of the Israeli embassy in India, speaking exclusively to NDTV.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel Defense Forces or IDF is currently assessing the missile attack by Iran today and an appropriate response will be given to Tehran, said Guy Nir, spokesperson of the Israeli embassy in India, speaking exclusively to NDTV.</p>

<p>Iran today fired a barrage of missiles at Israel - nearly 200 of them - in its attempt to send a message to Tel Aviv in the aftermath of the killings of the Hamas and Hezbollah chiefs. While Israel was able to block out most of the missiles, there were some that hit regions across the north and south of the country.</p>

<p>This has been the sharpest escalation in tensions in West Asia (Middle East) since the start of the Israel Hamas war in Gaza nearly a year ago. Iran's Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is currently sheltered in a safe house at an undisclosed location, was the one who reportedly gave the green signal for the missile attack on Israel today.</p>

<p>Speaking to NDTV, The Israel Embassy spokesperson warned that "If he (Ayatollah Ali Khamenei) plans to initiate a full-scale war with Israel, it will be a mistake for them (Iran)." He went on to say that Israel's response to Tuesday's attack will be a strategic, pin-pointed one. "Israel's response is going to be something strategic and pin-pointed, and not a full-scale war. I don't think any side wants that," he said.</p>

<p>The Israeli spokesperson also cautioned any other nation which might consider joining Iran to attack Israel. "If any country is wanting to join Iran, all I can hope is that they don't, because if they do, the outcome will be devastating for them too," he warned.</p>

<p>Speaking about Israel's top-notch defence mechanism, the Israeli spokesperson said that it is not just renowned 'Iron Dome', but other systems too, but did not give more details on what they are. "It is not just the Iron Dome, we have many other defence systems in place that I cannot elaborate on for security reasons, which were helping us to bring this situation under control. The systems are very precise and out of over 180 missiles, most of them were not able to penetrate through these," he said.</p>

<p>The spokesperson further confirmed that at the moment "there are no casualties in Israel, but there is one in Palestinian territories". This he said, was because Iran targeted the entire region. He also explained how every Israeli national is prepared and trained for such scenarios, thereby preventing the loss of lives across the country.</p>

<p><strong>Q) Will it be an all-out war? Or is there a possibility that it will be contained?</strong><br />
A) Right now IDF is saying they are trying to understand, assess and calculate the next steps to take this forward. We have confirmed that 181 missiles have been fired at Israel by Iran. It seems like the attack is complete now and Israeli citizens are out of their bunkers and shelters.</p>

<p><strong>Q) What is the situation in Israel at the moment?</strong><br />
A) Two hours ago, the Israel Defence Force of IDF had asked all citizens to go into shelters and bunkers to prepare for this attack. Around an hour ago we began to see missiles in the air and also falling all across Israel. All together, over 180 missiles were fired on Israel. As of now, the attack is finished and people are out of their shelters.</p>

<p><strong>Q) Video footage shows that these missiles have hit many targets and there might by casualties. Do you have an update on this?</strong><br />
A) So what we are seeing is that missiles have fallen across north and south Israel. These missiles have hit either buildings or in open areas. Up to now, we do not have any Israeli casualties as all Israelis went into their bunkers and safe rooms. However, there is one casualty in Palestinian territories as Iran launched missiles across the region. So currently we have confirmation of this one Palestinian person being killed in the Iran attack.</p>

<p><strong>Q) How efficient has the Iron Dome system been for Israel?</strong><br />
A) It is not just the Iron Dome, we have many other defence systems that I cannot elaborate on for security reasons, which were helping us to bring this situation under control. The systems are very precise and out of over 180 missiles, most of them did not go through.</p>

<p><strong>Q) Do you think Israel will now attack Iran as well and this will turn into an all-out war?</strong><br />
A) So, at the moment I want to be very cautious of what I am going to say. The IDF is currently assessing the situation to see what is going to be the proper way to respond. Will it be an all-out war or will it be something more strategic? Well, I guess Israel's response is going to be something more strategic and pin-pointed and not a full-scale war. I don't think any side wants that.</p>

<p><strong>Q) As per reports, the Supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Khameni, is the one who had given the green signal for this missile attack. What is your take on this?</strong><br />
A) I believe that if he plans to initiate a full-scale war with Israel, it will be a mistake for them.</p>

<p><strong>Q) It is believed that many other nations will join Iran in this war. Is Israel prepared for that?</strong><br />
A) Israel is prepared for many scenarios. Israel is not alone. We have a number of our allies who will help us too. As for any country wanting to join Iran, all I can hope is that they don't, because if they do, the outcome will be devastating for them too.</p>

<p><strong>Q) According to you, which countries might join Iran in this offensive against Israel?</strong><br />
A) I hope none.</p>

<p><strong>Q) How is your family in Israel? Hope they are safe after this attack?</strong><br />
A) I have spoken to my family after all this began. All of them are fine. I have a friend who lives very close to one of the areas that was attacked. I called her right away to make sure she was okay. All my family and relatives are fine.</p>

<p><strong>Q) What is the kind of drill that most people in Israel are trained for, for such situations?</strong><br />
A) So, every single person in Israel has a bunker or safe room in their homes - which have a double-sided wall which is unpenetrable for such missile attacks. All Israelis know and are trained that when there are alarms, they must get into their safe rooms within a specific time period given to them - which is usually 60 seconds to 120 seconds, depending on where you live. And we let them know in advance when they need to be close to a safe room as within the next hour or so there might be an alarm. The Israeli people always adhere to this. They are always prepared. They listen to these instructions very carefully. So, even today, when the final call happened, everyone was already close to a safe room, so they could go in fast and close the door.</p>

<p><strong>Q) So, every home or building across Israel has a safe home within it or attached to it?</strong><br />
A) Yes, a majority of the homes in Israel have them. Since 1991 we have a law which requires all buildings, all homes and apartments have a room like this. So, all new buildings and apartments have them. Older buildings usually have safe rooms at the ground level (covered bunkers). So everyone goes down to the ground level and sits there.</p>

<p><strong>Q) After today's attack by Iran, is there any chance of containing this war in the next two or three days, or even the week ahead?</strong><br />
A) I hope so.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's ballistic missile assault on Israel was "defeated and ineffective", the White House said on Tuesday, warning that Tehran could expect severe consequences for the attacks.</p>

<p>"Based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective," Jake Sullivan, US President Joe Biden's national security advisor, told reporters.</p>

<p>Sullivan hailed US efforts to repel some of the attacks, which involved American naval destroyers shooting down some of the missiles.</p>

<p>Iran's attack was however a "significant escalation" of tensions in the Middle East, Sullivan said -- adding that it was an "ongoing situation" that meant he could only answer a few questions before getting back to his desk.</p>

<p>"Obviously, this is a significant escalation by Iran, a significant event, and it is equally significant that we were able to step up with Israel," Sullivan told the briefing.</p>

<p>The White House official would not say what consequences Tehran could expect to face, saying it would discuss "next steps" with Israel.</p>

<p>"We have made clear that there will be consequences, severe consequences, for this attack, and we will work with Israel to make that the case," Sullivan said.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said separately that Iran's missile attack was "unacceptable" and that the entire world should condemn it.</p>

<p>"Initial reports suggest that Israel, with the active support of the United States and other partners, effectively defeated this attack," Blinken told reporters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

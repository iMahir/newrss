       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump delivered a dark speech to a rally Saturday in the US swing state of Wisconsin, while Democrat Kamala Harris hunkered down in another crucial battleground, Pennsylvania, preparing for next week's televised presidential debate.</p>

<p>Trump and Harris are now essentially tied in the polls, with the Republican again shrugging off a mountain of scandals that would have sunk candidates of the past.</p>

<p>At the rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin, the former president delivered his characteristic stream of insults, exaggerations and outright falsehoods, painting a picture of an apocalyptic America run by a leftist dictatorship -- a "rogue regime."</p>

<p>Under President Joe Biden and Vice President Harris, "your government imported murderers, child predators and serial rapists from all over the planet, while weaponizing law enforcement to jail political opponents," Trump told several thousand supporters at an airport in the heartland of Trump's mostly white, conservative base.</p>

<p>"With your vote this election, their lying, cheating, thieving, hoaxing and plotting will come to an end."</p>

<p>He denounced the string of criminal cases he faces over everything from attempting to overthrow his 2020 election loss to Biden, to dozens of felony fraud convictions in New York.</p>

<p>Harris, taking a break from days of debate preparation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, visited a spice store where she drew a contrast to Trump's grim tone.</p>

<p>Asked what message she would most like to get across in their debate Tuesday, she replied: "It's time to turn the page on the divisiveness. It's time to bring our country together -- chart a new way forward."</p>

<p>Harris said she was "honored" by the recent endorsements of two prominent conservatives, former vice president Dick Cheney and his daughter, former representative Liz Cheney, adding, "It's important to put country above party."</p>

<p>Asked if she was ready to face Trump, Harris said simply, "Yes, I am."</p>

<p>Crowds outside cheered as she left the shop, and the Harris campaign released video of the vice president hugging emotional supporters there, including a young girl.</p>

<h3><strong>Police union for Trump</strong></h3>

<p>Trump got a boost Friday when the country's largest police union, the Fraternal Order of Police, endorsed him despite his historic status as a convicted felon.</p>

<p>And he enjoyed a legal victory earlier in the day when a New York judge delayed his sentencing for hush money paid to a porn star until after the November election.</p>

<p>Trump also appeared before reporters to rail against the women who have accused him of sexual impropriety.</p>

<p>Harris, a former California prosecutor, is leaning heavily on her message that she represents law and order in a contest against a convicted criminal who tried to overturn his 2020 election loss -- another unprecedented element in a political season that has the country on edge.</p>

<h3><strong>Harris's policies</strong></h3>

<p>The vice president jumped into the 2024 race at the last minute after Biden abruptly dropped out on July 21, amid fears over his stamina and mental acuity.</p>

<p>Despite a burst of initial enthusiasm from Democrats, Harris has had to race to introduce and define herself.</p>

<p>The debate on Tuesday offers her a prime opportunity to present clear policy proposals -- she has been criticized for a lack of detail -- while sharpening her attack lines against Trump.</p>

<p>The former president, perhaps seeking to set expectations for the debate, said Saturday that the "crooked system" would not acknowledge if he won on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"They'll say, 'Trump suffered a humiliating defeat'," he asserted.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania, where Harris is preparing, is closely divided between Republican and Democratic voters, and may be the deciding piece in the puzzle of the state-by-state Electoral College battle that decides US presidential elections.</p>

<p>The debate will be the first-ever meeting between Harris and Trump. He refused to attend Biden's inauguration -- he would have met her there -- after falsely claiming the 2020 election was stolen from him.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Paris court in May detained and charged a couple on accusations that they were involved in Iranian plots to kill Jews in Germany and France, police sources told AFP.</p>

<p>Authorities charged Abdelkrim S., 34, and his partner Sabrina B., 33, on May 4 with conspiring with a criminal terrorist organisation and placed them in pre-trial detention.</p>

<p>The case, known as "Marco Polo" and revealed Thursday by French news website Mediapart, signals a revival in Iranian state-sponsored terrorism in Europe, according to a report by France's General Directorate for Internal Security (DGSI) consulted by AFP.</p>

<p>"Since 2015, the Iranian (secret) services have resumed a targeted killing policy," the French security agency wrote, adding that "the threat has worsened again in the context of the Israel-Hamas war".</p>

<p>The alleged objective for Iranian intelligence was to target civilians and sow fear in Europe among the country's political opposition as well as among Jews and Israelis.</p>

<p>Iran is accused of recruiting criminals, including drug lords, to conduct such operations.</p>

<p>Abdelkrim S. was previously sentenced to 10 years behind bars over a killing in Marseille and released on probation in July 2023.</p>

<p>He is accused of being the main France-based operative for an Iran-sponsored terrorist cell that planned acts of violence in France and Germany.</p>

<p>A former fellow inmate is believed to have connected the suspect with the cell's coordinator, a major drug trafficker from the Lyon area who likely visited Iran in May, according to the DGSI.</p>

<p>The group intended to attack a Paris-based former employee at an Israeli security firm and three of his colleagues residing in the Paris suburbs.</p>

<p>Three Israeli-German citizens in Munich and Berlin were also among the targets.</p>

<p>Investigators believe that Abdelkrim S. despite his probation made multiple trips to Germany for scouting purposes, including travels to Berlin with his wife.</p>

<p>He denied the accusations and said he simply had purchases to make.</p>

<p>French authorities are also crediting the cell with plots to set fire to four Israeli-owned companies in the south of France between late December 2023 and early January 2024, said a police source.</p>

<p>Abdelkrim S. while in detention rejected the claims, the source added, saying he had acted as a go-between on Telegram for the mastermind and other individuals involved in a planned insurance scam.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bomb threat, which caused a flight operated by India's Vistara Airlines to make an emergency landing in Erzurum, eastern Turkey two days ago has turned out to be false, according to the local governor.</p>

<p>"We have concluded all search and examination activities and have determined that the bomb threat was unfounded," Erzurum Governor Mustafa Ciftci told reporters on Saturday.</p>

<p>As a result, the flight ban at Erzurum's airport has been lifted, he said, noting that an alternate flight from Mumbai, India, has been arranged for the stranded passengers to continue their journey, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>A Vistara spokesperson had said flight UK27 from Mumbai to Frankfurt diverted due to "a security concern". The flight landed at Erzurum at 4.30 p.m. local time.</p>

<p>"As of 23:30, we have completed all search and examination operations. As a result of the work we carried out, we found that the bomb threat was unfounded," Ciftci told reporters at the airport.</p>

<p>"All flights coming or leaving from our province will now be able to fly comfortably," he said.</p>

<p>Vistara said in a post on X that customers, crew and the aircraft were cleared by security agencies and that all necessary checks were conducted.</p>

<p>The airline also said it was sending an alternate aircraft to Turkey by 12:25 p.m. local time on Saturday to take the passengers to Frankfurt.</p>

<p>The plane en route from Mumbai to Frankfurt made an emergency landing in eastern Turkey on Friday following a bomb threat.</p>

<p>Turkish authorities said a note reading "bomb on board" was discovered in a lavatory on the aircraft, prompting the plane, with 247 passengers and crew on board, to make an emergency landing.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[More than 100,000 left-wing demonstrators rallied across France on Saturday to protest against the nomination of the centre-right Michel Barnier as prime minister and denounce President Emmanuel Macron's "power grab".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 100,000 left-wing demonstrators rallied across France on Saturday to protest against the nomination of the centre-right Michel Barnier as prime minister and denounce President Emmanuel Macron's "power grab".</p>

<p>The interior ministry said 110,000 people took to the streets nationwide, including 26,000 in Paris, while one leading left-winger put the turnout across France at 300,000.</p>

<p>Rallies took place in cities across France including Nantes in the west, Nice and Marseille in the south and Strasbourg in the east.</p>

<p>Macron on Thursday appointed Barnier, a 73-year-old former foreign minister who acted as the European Union's Brexit negotiator, as prime minister, seeking to move forward after snap elections in which his centrist alliance came second.</p>

<p>Barnier said on Friday that he was open to naming ministers of all political stripes, including "people from the left".</p>

<p>But a left-wing coalition, which emerged as France's largest political bloc after the June-July elections, although short of an overall majority, has denounced Macron's appointment of Barnier.</p>

<p>The alliance wanted Lucie Castets, a 37-year-old economist, to become prime minister, but Macron quashed that idea, arguing that she would not survive a confidence vote in the hung parliament.</p>

<p>On Saturday, many demonstrators directed their anger at Macron, 46, and some called on him to resign.</p>

<h3><strong>'Old elephant'</strong></h3>

<p>"The Fifth Republic is collapsing," said 21-year-old protester Manon Bonijol, referring to France's current system of government.</p>

<p>"Expressing one's vote will be useless as long as Macron is in power," she added.</p>

<p>Hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, whose France Unbowed party (LFI) and allies belong to the left-wing bloc, had called for people to take to the streets, arguing that the election had been "stolen from the French".</p>

<p>On Saturday, he urged supporters to prepare for battle.</p>

<p>"There will be no pause," he vowed.</p>

<p>"Democracy isn't just the art of accepting that you've won, it's also the humility of accepting that you've lost," Melenchon said at the Paris march.</p>

<p>Project manager Alexandra Germain, 44, accused Macron of riding roughshod over the wishes of voters.</p>

<p>"Demonstrating is my only way of saying that I don't agree, even if I am well aware that it is useless," said Germain.</p>

<p>Abel Couaillier, a 20-year-old student, said he was stunned by the appointment of Barnier whom he called an "old elephant".</p>

<p>"I am still young, I want to believe that we can change things," added Couaillier.</p>

<p>Leading LFI figure Mathilde Panot claimed on X, formerly Twitter, that 160,000 demonstrators had protested in Paris and 300,000 people across France.</p>

<p>Police said five people had been detained in Paris.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Under surveillance'</strong></h3>

<p>Marine Le Pen, who leads far-right National Rally (RN) lawmakers in parliament, has said her party will not be part of the new cabinet, and that she will wait for Barnier's first policy speech in parliament before deciding whether or not to back him.</p>

<p>"Barnier is a prime minister under surveillance," said RN party president Jordan Bardella on Saturday.</p>

<p>"I am under the surveillance of all French people," said Barnier, on the sidelines of a visit to the Necker children's hospital in Paris.</p>

<p>Barnier will be in charge of the budget, security, immigration and healthcare.</p>

<p>He will have to take into account the interests of the National Rally -- the single-largest party in a fragmented legislature -- if he wants to avoid a motion of no-confidence in parliament.</p>

<p>Barnier -- who is likely to have only minority support in the National Assembly -- faces the urgent task of presenting the 2025 budget by early October.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Lebanon's health ministry said three emergency personnel were killed and two wounded in an Israeli attack Saturday on a civil defence team that had been fighting fires in the country's south.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon's health ministry said three emergency personnel were killed and two wounded in an Israeli attack Saturday on a civil defence team that had been fighting fires in the country's south.</p>

<p>"Israeli enemy targeting of a Lebanese civil defence team that was putting out fires sparked by the recent Israeli strikes in the village of Froun led to the martyrdom of three emergency responders," the health ministry said in a statement.</p>

<p>Two others were wounded, one of them critically, the statement said, adding that the toll was provisional.</p>

<p>Lebanon's civil defence said in a statement that three of its employees were killed in "an Israeli strike that targeted a firefighting vehicle after they had finished a firefighting mission".</p>

<p>The health ministry condemned "this blatant Israeli attack that targeted a team from an official body of the Lebanese state", its statement said.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah group has exchanged near daily cross-border fire with Israeli forces in support of ally Hamas since the Palestinian group's October 7 attack on Israel triggered war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati in a statement blasted Saturday's attack, saying "this new aggression against Lebanon is a blatant violation of international laws... and human values".</p>

<p>Hezbollah ally the Amal movement said two of its members were among the dead. It said they were killed "while carrying out their humanitarian and national duty defending Lebanon and the south".</p>

<p>The health ministry said the attack was "the second of its kind against an emergency team in less than 12 hours".</p>

<h3><strong>'Repeated, deliberate'</strong></h3>

<p>Earlier Saturday, the ministry said two emergency personnel from the Hezbollah-affiliated Islamic Health Committee were wounded when "the Israeli enemy deliberately targeted" near a fire they were heading to extinguish in south Lebanon's Qabrikha, causing their vehicle to swerve.</p>

<p>Several fighter groups operate health centres and emergency response operations in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>Hezbollah announced a string of attacks on Israeli troops and positions near the border on Saturday, including with Katyusha rockets and "explosives-laden drones", some in stated response to "Israeli enemy attacks" on south Lebanon.</p>

<p>Lebanon's National News Agency said Israel carried out air strikes and shelling on several areas of the country's south.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it identified "projectiles" crossing from Lebanon, intercepting some of them, and also said "a number of UAVs (drones) were identified crossing from Lebanese territory".</p>

<p>It said the air force struck "Hezbollah military infrastructure and a launcher" in the Qabrikha area, while its artillery struck several other areas of south Lebanon.</p>

<p>The cross-border violence has killed some 614 people in Lebanon, mostly fighters but also including 138 civilians, according to an AFP tally.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, including in the annexed Golan Heights, authorities have announced the deaths of at least 24 soldiers and 26 civilians.</p>

<p>A statement from Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad said that "due to the (Israeli) aggression", 27 emergency personnel and health workers have been killed and 94 others wounded since October.</p>

<p>Two hospitals and 21 health centres have been "targeted" while 32 fire or ambulance vehicles have been "put out of service or partially damaged", the statement said, urging an end to the "repeated and deliberate targeting of health workers and civilians".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British tech tycoon Mike Lynch died of suffocation after running out of oxygen, an investigative source said, citing initial examinations carried out on Saturday after his body was recovered from the family yacht that sank off Sicily's coast last month.</p>

<p>Lynch, his daughter Hannah, 18, an onboard cook and four guests died when the British-flagged superyacht Bayesian sank during a severe and sudden weather event off the port of Porticello, near Palermo, on Aug. 19.</p>

<p>Initial results on Hannah Lynch's body, whose examinations were carried out on Saturday, were inconclusive, the source told Reuters, only ruling out any traumas or wounds as the cause of death and leaving open the possibilities she either ran out of oxygen or drowned.</p>

<p>The bodies of the dead, except for the cook, were found in cabins on the left-hand side of the 56-metre (184-feet) vessel, where the trapped passengers may have tried to search for remaining bubbles of air, the head of Palermo's Fire Brigade said last month.</p>

<p>Preliminary results from autopsies on four other victims - Morgan Stanley International Chairman Jonathan Bloomer, his wife Judith, lawyer Chris Morvillo and his wife Neda - indicated suffocation as the likely cause of death, judicial sources said earlier this week.</p>

<p>Fifteen people survived, including Lynch's wife, whose company owned the Bayesian, and the yacht's captain.</p>

<p>Initial examinations of the Canadian-Antiguan onboard chef Recaldo Thomas indicated he died by drowning, the investigative source said on Saturday.</p>

<p>Further forensic tests have been ordered all the victims, with results expected in the coming weeks, the source said.</p>

<p>The sinking has puzzled naval experts, who said a vessel like the Bayesian, built by high-end yacht manufacturer Perini, which is owned by The Italian Sea Group, should have withstood the storm and not have sunk as quickly as it did.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza entered its 12th month Saturday with little sign of respite for the Palestinian territory or hope for Israeli hostages still held captive.</p>

<p>The chances of a truce that would also swap Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel for hostages held by Hamas appeared slim, with both sides sticking doggedly to their positions.</p>

<p>Hamas, whose October 7 attack on Israel sparked the war, is demanding a complete Israeli withdrawal, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insists troops must remain along the Gaza-Egypt border.</p>

<p>The United States, Qatar and Egypt have all been mediating in an effort to bring about a ceasefire in the war that authorities in the Hamas-run Gaza say has killed at least 40,939 people.</p>

<p>According to the United Nations human rights office, most of the dead are women and children.</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians including some hostages killed in captivity, according to official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Of 251 hostages seized by Palestinian Hamas operatives during the attack, 97 remain in Gaza including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Scores were released during a one-week truce in November.</p>

<p>Israel's announcement last Sunday that the bodies of six hostages including a US-Israeli citizen had been recovered shortly after being killed sparked grief and anger in Israel.</p>

<p>Marking the anniversary, UN Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) chief Philippe Lazzarini posted on X on Saturday: "Eleven months. Enough. No one can take this any longer. Humanity must prevail. Ceasefire now."</p>

<p><strong>American activist killed</strong></p>

<p>International pressure to end the war was further underlined by Friday's shooting dead in the occupied West Bank of Turkish-American activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi demonstrating against Israeli settlements in the occupied territory.</p>

<p>Eygi's family demanded an independent investigation into her death, saying her life "was taken needlessly, unlawfully, and violently by the Israeli military".</p>

<p>The UN rights office said Israeli forces killed Eygi, 26, with a "shot in the head".</p>

<p>Turkey said she was killed by "Israeli occupation soldiers" while the United States called her death "tragic" and pressed Israel to investigate.</p>

<p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan denounced Israel as a "barbaric" state and urged Muslim nations to confront it saying: "It is an Islamic duty for us to stand against Israel's state terror. It is a religious duty."</p>

<p>Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz responded saying that Erdogan "continues to throw the Turkish people into the fire of hatred and violence for the sake of his Hamas friends".</p>

<p>Around 490,000 people live in Israeli settlements -- illegal under international law -- in the West Bank which Israel occupied in 1967, illegal under international law.</p>

<p>Since Hamas's October 7 attack, Israeli troops or settlers have killed more than at least 662 Palestinians in the West Bank, according to the Palestinian health ministry.</p>

<p>Israel says at least 23 Israelis, including members of the security forces, were killed during the same period in Palestinian attacks.</p>

<p>Eygi's death came on the day Israeli forces withdrew from a deadly 10-day raid in the West Bank city of Jenin, where AFP journalists reported residents returning home to widespread destruction.</p>

<p>The pullout came with Israel at loggerheads with the United States over talks to forge a truce in the Gaza war.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said "90 percent is agreed" and urged Israel and Hamas to finalise a deal. Netanyahu denied this, telling Fox News: "It's not close."</p>

<p>Hamas is demanding Israel's complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, saying it agreed months ago to a proposal outlined by US President Joe Biden.</p>

<p><strong>Fresh violence</strong></p>

<p>AFP reporters said air strikes and shelling rocked Gaza on Saturday, killing at least 17 people according to civil defence officials, the Palestinian Red Crescent and witnesses.</p>

<p>Among those who died were a woman and a child in an air strike north of Gaza City, while four people were killed in another strike targeting a flat in Bureij camp.</p>

<p>In the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood of Gaza City, the civil defence said an Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter for displaced people killed at least three people and wounded more than 20.</p>

<p>Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, a Hamas ally, also exchanged fire.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it targeted two Israeli bases with Katyusha rockets. Lebanon's National News Agency said Israel carried out air strikes and shelling of several areas of the country's south.</p>

<p>Israel's army said it intercepted missiles detected crossing from Lebanon and struck a Hezbollah launch site in the south Lebanon.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry said three emergency personnel were killed and two others wounded in an Israeli attack on a civil defence team putting out fires in south Lebanon.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli military strikes across the Palestinian Gaza Strip killed at least 61 people in the space of 48 hours, local medics said on Saturday, as Israeli forces battled Hamas operatives in the territory.</p>

<p>Eleven months into the war, numerous rounds of diplomacy have so far failed to clinch a ceasefire deal to end the conflict and bring the release of Israeli and foreign hostages held in Gaza as well as many Palestinians jailed in Israel.</p>

<p>An Israeli airstrike in on the Halima al-Sa'diyya school compound serving as a shelter for displaced people in the Jabalia urban refugee camp killed at least eight people and wounded 15 others, medics said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said the strike had targeted a Hamas command centre inside the compound. It accused the Hamas group of repeatedly exploiting civilians and civilian infrastructure for military purposes, an allegation Hamas denies.</p>

<p>Five more people were killed in a strike on a house in Gaza City.</p>

<p>Later on Saturday, an Israeli strike killed four people and wounded 25 others at Amr Ibn Ala'as school, which also houses displaced families in the Sheikh Radwan suburb of Gaza City, Palestinian medics said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said the air strike targeted a command center operated by Hamas gunmen in the compound that had previously served as a school.</p>

<p>Palestinian health officials said Israeli military strikes had killed so far 28 people across the Gaza Strip on Saturday.</p>

<p>The armed wings of the Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Fatah groups said they had fought Israeli troops in Gaza City, in central areas and in the south with anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs, and in some incidents detonated bombs to target tanks and other army vehicles.</p>

<p>The two warring sides continued to blame one another for the failure of mediators, including Qatar, Egypt and the United States, to broker a ceasefire. The U.S. is preparing to present a new proposal, but the prospects of a breakthrough appear dim as gaps between the sides remain large.</p>

<p>CIA Director William Burns, the chief U.S. negotiator, told an event in London that a more detailed proposal would be made in the coming days.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>PAUSES IN FIGHTING LET POLIO VACCINATIONS CONTINUE</strong></p>

<p>On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it was incumbent on both Israel and Hamas, which ran Gaza before the war and was responsible for the Oct. 7 killing spree against Jews in Israel that triggered it, to make concessions to reach a deal.</p>

<p>On Saturday, senior Hamas official Hossam Badran said the group had made no new demands and remained committed to a July 2 proposal put forward by the United States, accusing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of attaching new conditions that would not end the war.</p>

<p>Netanyahu says it was Hamas that introduced unacceptable conditions.</p>

<p>Despite the deadlock, the United Nations, in collaboration with local health authorities, has pursued a campaign to vaccinate 640,000 children in Gaza after its first polio case in around 25 years. Limited pauses in the fighting have allowed the campaign to proceed.</p>

<p>U.N. officials said they were making progress, having reached over half of the children needing the drops in the first two stages in the southern and central Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the campaign will move to the northern Gaza Strip. A second round of vaccination will be required four weeks after the first.</p>

<p>The latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on Oct. 7 when group Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent assault on the enclave has killed over 40,900 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry, while also displacing nearly the entire population of 2.3 million, causing a hunger crisis and leading to genocide allegations at the World Court, which Israel denies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 20-year-old Pakistani citizen, residing in Canada, has been arrested and charged by the US for planning a terror attack targeting Jews in New York City around the October 7 anniversary of Hamas' attack on Israel.</p>

<p>Khan, or Shahzeb Jadoon, planned a terrorist attack in New York City (NYC) around October 7 with the "goal of slaughtering, in the name of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), as many Jewish people as possible," Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement on Friday.</p>

<p>Identified as an ISIS supporter, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pakistan-national-arrested-from-canada-for-plotting-isis-terrorist-attack-in-new-york-city-on-israel-hamas-attack-anniversary-6509164">Muhammad Shahzeb Khan was arrested</a> on Wednesday in Ormstown town, about 60 km south of Montreal in Canada, and approximately 20 km from the US-Canada border. He also faces three charges in Canada.</p>

<p>He was arrested in connection with a complaint filed in the Southern District of New York for attempting to provide material support and resources to ISIS.</p>

<p>If convicted, Khan faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.</p>

<p>Hamas based in the Gaza Strip launched an unprecedented attack on Israel by land, air and sea on October 7, 2023.</p>

<p>As per Khan's preparation in connection with the planned attack, Khan attempted to reach the US-Canada border. He used three separate cars to travel across Canada towards the US before being stopped near Ormstown.</p>

<p>Thanks to the investigative work of the American agency, "and the quick action of our Canadian law enforcement partners, the defendant was taken into custody", said Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC News) and added that Khan now faces three charges in Canada.</p>

<p>The charges are, 'Attempting to leave Canada to commit an offence for a terrorist group', 'Participating in the activities of a terrorist group', and 'Conspiracy to commit an offence by violating US immigration law - entering or attempting to enter the US unlawfully', it added.</p>

<p>According to the complaint filed in New York, Khan attempted to travel from Canada to New York City, where he intended to use automatic and semi-automatic weapons to carry out a mass shooting in support of the IS at a Jewish centre in Brooklyn, New York.</p>

<p>Khan began posting on social media and communicating with others on an encrypted messaging application about his support for the IS in or about November last year when, among other things, Khan distributed IS propaganda videos and literature.</p>

<p>"If we succeed with our plan, this would be the largest attack on US soil since 9/11," he said in one of the messages.</p>

<p>Khan began communicating with two undercover law enforcement officers, the statement said, adding, during those conversations, Khan confirmed that he and a US-based IS supporter, identified only as Associate-1 in the complaint, had been planning to carry out an attack in a particular US city, identified as 'City-1.' Among other things, Khan said that he had been actively attempting to create "a real offline cell" of IS supporters to carry out a "coordinated assault" in the city using AR-style rifles to "target Israeli Jewish Chabad... scattered all around" (the city).</p>

<p>During subsequent conversations, Khan repeatedly instructed the undercover officers to obtain AR-style assault rifles, ammunition, and other materials to carry out the attacks and identified the specific locations in the city where the attacks would take place, the complaint said.</p>

<p>Khan also provided details about how he would cross the border from Canada into the US for the attacks.</p>

<p>During these conversations with the undercover officers, Khan emphasised that "October 7 and Oct 11 are the best days for targeting the Jews" stating the community will surely hold some protest demonstrations on the first anniversary and October 11 is 'Yom Kippur,' an important Jewish festival.</p>

<p>Around August 20, Khan changed his target location from City-1 to New York City and decided to target a Jewish centre in Brooklyn. In support of his choice, Khan also boasted that "New York is perfect to target Jews" because it has the "largest Jewish population in America" and therefore, "even if we don't attack a[n] Event[,] we could easily rack up a lot of Jews".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A shocking discovery has been made in a British cemetery. In Royton Cemetery in Oldham, a mass grave containing more than 300 bodies-mostly those of stillborn babies and small children-has been discovered, according to <em>The Metro.</em> The remains of 145 stillborn infants, 128 babies and young children, and 29 adults were discovered within the 12-by-12-foot burial. These people's remains have been buried at the unmarked burial site for a long time.</p>

<p>The person who discovered them was a woman who had spent decades trying to find the graves of her twin brothers, who had passed away in 1962. While the other twin died soon after birth, the first twin was stillborn. After searching, the woman found the mass burial.</p>

<p>"I live near the cemetery, and I used to walk through it with my mother all the time, and we had no idea they were buried there," she told the MailOnline. "I get upset speaking about it because my mother died and is buried in the same cemetery, but she never knew they were there."</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/09/06/bodies-babies-children-found-mass-grave-21558406/"><em>The Metro,</em></a> up until the 1980s, parents of stillborn children were kept in the dark by doctors over the fate of their lost children-many were taken away without the parents ever knowing where they were buried, typically in mass graves. Bereaved parents were instead told their child was buried alongside a 'nice person' that same day.</p>

<p>"My brothers were only a year older, and I have one younger brother, but I saw growing up how the grief affected my parents without any support," Sarah said.</p>

<p>The boys weren't on any official records, so Sarah spent years in a 'merry-go-round' of genealogy companies, council officials, and coroners to find them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Asia's most powerful storm this year made landfall in northern Vietnam on Saturday, the meteorological agency said, killing at least four people after tearing through China's island of Hainan and the Philippines.</p>

<p>Super Typhoon Yagi hit island districts of north Vietnam around 1 p.m. (0600 GMT), generating winds of up to 160 kph (99 mph) near its centre, having lost power from its peak of 234 kph (145 mph) in Hainan a day earlier.</p>

<p>The government said that as of 5 p.m. four people had died and 78 had been injured by the typhoon. At least another dozen were missing at sea, according to state media.</p>

<p>Yagi had already claimed the lives of at least two people in Hainan and 16 people in the Philippines, the first country it hit, having formed east of the archipelago earlier in the week.</p>

<p>Vietnam's coastal city of Haiphong, an industrial hub with a population of 2 million people that hosts factories from foreign multinationals and local carmaker VinFast, was among the hardest-hit by winds with speeds of up to 90 kph.</p>

<p>As the typhoon approached, the city experienced widespread power outages on Saturday, authorities said, as did at least three other northern provinces.</p>

<p>In Haiphong, the strong winds smashed windows and waves were as much as three meters high when they hit the coast, according to a Reuters witness.</p>

<p>Metal roofing sheets were blown away, pictures and footage on local media showed. The government said thousands of trees had fallen and many houses were damaged across northern Vietnam.</p>

<p>Earlier in Hainan, which has a population of more than 10 million, the storm felled trees, flooded roads and cut power to more than 800,000 homes.</p>

<p><strong>AIRPORTS CLOSED</strong></p>

<p>Vietnam evacuated more than 50,000 people from coastal towns and deployed 450,000 military personnel, the government said.</p>

<p>It also suspended operations for several hours at four airports on Saturday, including Hanoi's Noi Bai, the busiest in the north, which cancelled more than 300 flights.</p>

<p>High schools were also closed in 12 northern provinces, including in the capital Hanoi, which has a population of 8.5 million.</p>

<p>Authorities in the capital suspended public transport on buses and its two elevated metro lines on Saturday afternoon, state media reported. The meteorological agency has warned of risks of heavy flooding in the city centre.</p>

<p>Hanoi resident Nguyen Manh Quan, 40, said: "The wind is strong enough to blow a person over," while Dang Van Phuong, also 40, said: "I've never seen a storm like this, you can't drive in these winds."</p>

<p>Typhoons are becoming stronger, fuelled by warmer oceans, amid climate change, scientists say.</p>

<p>Last week, Typhoon Shanshan slammed into southwestern Japan, the strongest storm to hit the country in decades.</p>

<p>Yagi is named after the Japanese word for goat and the constellation of Capricornus.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The head of the CIA, who is also the chief U.S. negotiator seeking an end to the Gaza war and release of hostages held by Hamas, said a more detailed ceasefire proposal would be made in the next several days.</p>

<p>CIA Director William Burns was speaking at a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ft.com/content/56d16869-f9e1-4c82-8022-5f8d2044c5cd" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">Financial Times</a> event in London alongside Richard Moore, head of Britain's MI6 foreign spy agency, the first time they had appeared together publicly.</p>

<p>After 11 months of conflict in Gaza, Burns is working for the United States with Qatar and Egypt to secure a ceasefire, and said there was ongoing work on "texts and creative formulas" for finding a proposal which satisfies both parties.</p>

<p>"We will make this more detailed proposal, I hope in the next several days, and then we'll see," he said. &nbsp;</p>

<p>He added that it was a question of political will and he hoped leaders on both sides recognised "the time has come finally to make some hard choices and some difficult compromises".</p>

<p>Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7 killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies, while Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed nearly 41,000 Palestinians, Gaza's health authorities have said, largely levelling the coastal enclave.</p>

<p>Burns and Moore had written a joint op-ed in the FT newspaper on Saturday before the event which highlighted the pair's joint efforts to help Ukraine in its war against Russia.</p>

<p>They said "staying the course" in backing Ukraine was more important than ever and they vowed to further their cooperation there.</p>

<p>Discussing Ukraine's offensive into the Kursk region of Russia where Kyiv has seized land, Moore called it an "audacious and bold" move to try and change the game.</p>

<p>"It's too early to say how long the Ukrainians will be able to hang on in there (in Kursk)," he added.</p>

<p>While Burns called the offensive a "significant tactical achievement" for the Ukrainians, he added that he did not see any evidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin's grip on power was weakening.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[A person in the state of Missouri has become the first in the United States to test positive for bird flu without a known exposure to infected animals, authorities said on Friday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A person in the state of Missouri has become the first in the United States to test positive for bird flu without a known exposure to infected animals, authorities said on Friday.</p>

<p>The adult patient, who has underlying conditions, was admitted to hospital on August 22, received antiviral medications against influenza, then recovered and was discharged, according to statements from the Centers for Control and Disease Prevention (CDC) and the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.</p>

<p>As the patient's flu type appeared suspicious on an initial test, it was sent for additional testing in state and federal laboratories, which revealed it was H5, also known as avian flu or bird flu.</p>

<p>The CDC said it had not identified any transmission to the patient's close contacts or any other person.</p>

<p>Scientists have voiced concern about the growing number of mammals becoming infected by bird flu, even if cases in humans remain rare.</p>

<p>They fear a high rate of transmission could facilitate a mutation of the virus, which could enable it to be passed from one human to another.</p>

<p>Contacted by AFP, the World Health Organization said on Saturday it was "encouraging that the national disease surveillance system has identified this case, that the patient received antiviral treatment, and that no further cases have been detected among close contacts".</p>

<p>"It is critical that investigations into the patient's exposure are continued, as indicated by national and state authorities, to inform further prevention and response activities," said Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's director of epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention.</p>

<p>"WHO strongly supports US efforts for surveillance of zoonotic influenza across human, environmental and animal sectors," Van Kerkhove continued.</p>

<p>"It is important to understand the circulation of avian influenza in poultry, wild birds and other animals in the state," she said of Missouri.</p>

<p>"Stronger disease surveillance in animals is essential to protect animal and human health."</p>

<p><strong>No animal contact</strong></p>

<p>The person who tested positive for bird flu was the 14th to do so in the US this year, and the first without known contact with animals.</p>

<p>Indeed, "no H5 infection in dairy cattle has been reported in Missouri," said the Missouri health department, though "some H5 cases in commercial or backyard flocks and wild birds have been reported."</p>

<p>All previous bird flu cases in the United States have been among farmworkers, including the very first, in 2022.</p>

<p>Bird flu is most commonly found in wild birds and poultry, but has more recently been detected in mammals, with an outbreak in cattle seen across the country this year.</p>

<p>It can occasionally infect humans through close contact or contaminated environments.</p>

<p>While the CDC continues to assess the risk to the public as low, "circumstances may change quickly as more information is learned", it said.</p>

<p>In the decades since H5 has been found in humans, there have been rare cases where an animal source cannot be identified.</p>

<p>But there has so far not been evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, which would significantly increase the threat level.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Animal abuse has long been a major concern for animal rights activists in the Philippines, which is home to some 23.29 million dogs.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A disturbing finding has surfaced following Typhoon Gaemi, which was one of the most destructive storms to hit Southeast Asia in recent times. The Philippines was devastated by the strong typhoon that struck in July, leaving behind extensive damage. The storm's rage left a path of destruction, with tens of thousands being evacuated and many dozen reported dead.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/09/07/flooding-caused-super-typhoon-leaves-dogs-homeless-dying-21498843/"><em>The Metro,</em></a> in the middle of the mayhem, Ashley Fruono, PETA Asia's director of animal assistance programs, discovered a terrible scene: dogs who had been abandoned and were either held in cages or fastened to lampposts outside the wrecked homes of their owners. These creatures were abandoned and allowed to weather the storm on their own, even in spite of the dire circumstances and the pressing necessity for evacuation.</p>

<p>"I'll never forget seeing the decomposing bodies of dogs in cages or attached to their chains with a look of horror on their faces. They were subjected to an almost unimaginably horrific death-that was completely preventable," Ashley told <em>The Metro.</em></p>

<p>The news portal further reported, citing a report from the worldwide kennel club registry, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.fci.be/en/statistics/ByNco.aspx?iso=PH">Federation Cynologique Internationale</a>, that animal abuse has long been a major concern for animal rights activists in the Philippines, which is home to some 23.29 million dogs. Around 12,000,000 people own a dog. Yet there were at least 3,000 cases of animal maltreatment in 2020 alone, the Philippine animal welfare non-profit, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.caraphil.org/">Compassion and Responsibility for Animals</a> (CARA), found.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">A resident in Marikina City, Philippines, posted a video on Wednesday showing a dog struggling to reach a safer area through the floodwaters caused by Super Typhoon Gaemi (CarinaPH) ?<a href="https://t.co/fsUEE63JLh">pic.twitter.com/fsUEE63JLh</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"Cruelty to animals is a huge concern in the Philippines," Ashley, 38, who is from British Columbia, Canada, but has lived in the Philippines for 17 years, said.</p>

<p>"While we've noticed that, thanks to increased social media use, locals are more aware of animal welfare concerns and more caring than a decade or so ago, the problem is still huge, especially in impoverished areas where it may be more difficult to keep dogs inside due to crowded living conditions," Ashley said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) aim to deepen ties and enhance their Comprehensive Strategic Partnership as the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, arrives in India on an official visit on September 9-10.</p>

<p>Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince is visiting India at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This would be his first visit to New Delhi as the Crown Prince.</p>

<p>He is being accompanied by top ministers from the UAE as well as a business delegation, the Ministry of External Affairs has said.</p>

<p>The Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi - the next King - will meet PM Narendra Modi on Monday. It is the first time India is officially engaging with the next generation of royalty and government from the UAE, highlighting the importance India gives to its ties with the UAE.</p>

<p>Apart from his meeting with PM Modi, the Crown Prince will also call on President Droupadi Murmu.</p>

<p><strong>THE CROWN PRINCE'S SCHEDULE</strong></p>

<p>On September 9, the Crown Prince's day will begin with a visit to Rajghat to pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi.</p>

<p>Later in the day, the Crown Prince will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the two leaders would hold discussions on a wide range of areas concerning bilateral cooperation. This would likely be followed by a joint press conference where several agreements or MoUs will be exchanged.</p>

<p>Besides bilateral issues, the two leaders are also expected to have a detailed discussion on the overall situation arising out of the Israel-Hamas conflict.</p>

<p>The Crown Prince will also call on President Droupadi Murmu at the Rastrapati Bhavan.</p>

<p>On September 10, the Crown Prince will visit Mumbai to participate in a Business Forum, in which top business leaders from both countries will participate.</p>

<p><strong>INDIA-UAE PARTNERSHIP</strong></p>

<p>Since the landmark visit by PM Modi to UAE in August 2015, the first by an Indian Prime Minister in 34 years, bilateral relations between the two countries have elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.</p>

<p>Both countries signed a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement or CEPA in February 2022 and a Local Currency Settlement (LCS) System in July 2023 to promote the use of Indian Rupee and AED (United Arab Emirates Dirham) for cross-border transactions.</p>

<p>India is the UAE's second-largest trading partner, while the UAE is India's largest trading partner in the Arab world. Total trade between India and the UAE is projected to reach USD 100 billion by the end of the decade. The bilateral trade between the two countries in 2022-23 was about USD 85 billion, according to official data.</p>

<p>The UAE is also among the top four investors in India in terms of Foreign Direct Investments or FDI in 2022-23.</p>

<p>"India and UAE share historically close and friendly ties. In recent years, the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between India and UAE has deepened in a wide range of areas, including political, trade, investment, connectivity, energy, technology, education, and culture," the MEA said.</p>

<p>"The Crown Prince's visit will further reinforce strong India-UAE bilateral relations and open avenues for partnership in new and emerging areas," it added.</p>

<p>The Indian community, which numbers over 3.5 million, plays an essential role in the UAE. Their contributions to the economy and cultural landscape of the UAE underscores the deep connections between the nations.</p>

<p>UAE was a special invitee for the G20 Summit in New Delhi during India's Presidency.</p>

<p>With India's active support, the UAE also joined the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation or SCO as dialogue partner in May 2023. The UAE also joined the BRICS forum as a member on January 1 with India's support.</p>

<p>In 2023, the India-UAE-France (UFI) trilateral was also formally launched.</p>

<p>UAE is the fifth-largest supplier of crude oil to India, accounting for around 8% of India's total crude imports. It also ranks first among destinations for India's exports in the West Asia region.</p>

<p>As a significant player in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation or OIC grouping, the UAE's support is crucial for India in navigating regional challenges, particularly concerning its relations with Pakistan.</p>

<p>The Crown Prince, Sheikh Khaled's visit underscores the UAE's commitment to deepening economic and strategic ties with India. It marks the beginning of a new chapter in India-UAE relations, characterised by collaboration and opportunity.</p>

<p><strong>RECENT VISIT, STRENGTHENING TIES</strong></p>

<p>In February this year, PM Modi went for an official visit to the UAE, where he held discussions with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan on the India-UAE bilateral relationship and witnessed the exchange of eight agreements.</p>

<p>Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, 63, is the father of the Crown Prince Sheikh Khaled&nbsp;Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, 42, who is visiting India this week.</p>

<p>PM Modi and President Al Nahyan welcomed the MoU for creation of an inter-governmental framework between India and the UAE on the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, also called IMEEC, which reflected the lead taken by the UAE and India in furthering regional connectivity.</p>

<p>The two leaders further endorsed the efforts from both sides to strengthen the strong economic and commercial cooperation and explore new areas of collaboration. They welcomed the strong growth witnessed in the UAE-India trade relations since the entry into force of the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA)</p>

<p>During his visit, PM Modi inaugurated the majestic Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS) Mandir, the first Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi, UAE.</p>

<p>The temple is located in Abu Dhabi's Abu Mureikhah district. The grand temple, built on a 27-acre campus, the land for which, was gifted by the UAE government.</p>

<p>He also addressed the Indian community at an event titled 'Ahlan Modi', which was attended by over 65,000 people.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Caleb Wu, a passionate soccer player from Hartford, Connecticut, has made headlines by setting a new world record for the most alternating football (soccer) touches with the feet on a treadmill in 30 seconds, according to <em>Guinness World Records.</em> Wu, who scored an amazing 75 touches overall, believes that the activity helped him recover from a serious depressive episode.</p>

<p>The 22-year-old Wu has undergone a major transformation and discovered a fresh purpose in football. His struggle with mental health almost cost him his life, so achieving this milestone is very personal to him. With its demanding skills and rhythmic juggling, football became a source of courage and solace for him in his lowest moments.</p>

<p>Wu shared his motivation behind the record attempt: "I always had a passion for soccer, I did a lot of juggling tricks and soccer/football freestyle.</p>

<p>"My teammates challenged me as they showed me a video of someone trying and failing to do it so I wanted to prove them wrong - and it was a fun challenge. I was inspired because when I was younger I almost took my life and I wanted to make the most of my abilities and prove to myself that I can do awesome things," he told&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2024/9/soccer-player-breaks-record-with-sporting-skills-that-saved-him-from-suicide"><em>Guinness World Records.</em></a></p>

<p>"I also wanted to inspire others to show them that they're capable of overcoming obstacles," he said.</p>

<p>Caleb also had to deal with racism during his formative years, from school classmates who would call him names.</p>

<p>He explained: "There were the common stereotypes and people would say Asians are only good at math. I wanted to show them I could compete as an athlete and was able to play college soccer for four years and was a captain for one year.</p>

<p>"I also became the first sponsored Division 3 Athlete and first sponsored college soccer player."</p>

<p>He added: "I overcame my struggles through finding a passion and wanting to inspire and help others who also struggle.</p><p><div class='table-div suicide'><table class='table'><thead><tr><th colspan='2'>Helplines</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vandrevala Foundation for Mental Health</td><td><a href='tel:+919999666555'>9999666555</a> or <a href='mailto:help@vandrevalafoundation.com'>help@vandrevalafoundation.com</a> </td></tr><tr><td>TISS iCall</td><td><a href='tel:+912225521111'>022-25521111</a> (Monday-Saturday: 8 am to 10 pm)</td></tr> <tr><td colspan='2'>(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A massive Burmese python was rescued from a New York Home last week. The snake was 13 feet 2 inches (4 meters) long, weighed 80 pounds (36 kg) and was getting too big to handle for the owner,<a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/05/us-news/snake-owner-realizes-his-13-foot-burmese-python-was-getting-too-big/"> the New York Post reported</a>. Jeff Hull, an Environment Conservation Police Officer (ECO), recognised the snake as a Burmese python by a feature on its head that resembled an arrow.</p>

<p>According to a Facebook post by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), "On August 28th, 2024, Environment Conservation Police Officer (ECO) Jeff Hull responded to a complaint of a subject with a large snake that the complainant didn't believe to be legal. After seeing a picture of the snake, ECO Hull was able to identify it by the arrowhead-like design on its head as a Burmese python."</p>

<p>It added, "Burmese pythons are illegal to possess in the state of New York without a permit."&nbsp;</p>

<p>When ECO Hull arrived at the residence, the thirteen feet long <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/watch-panic-grips-family-after-9-foot-king-cobra-found-in-karnataka-home-6489201">snake </a>was kept in a four-to-five-foot aquarium. The snake's anonymous owner claimed he "was not prepared for how fast the animal would grow and that he recognized he could no longer care for it."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The owner was given tickets for both keeping wildlife as a pet and having dangerous species in the house without a permit. The snake was then taken out of the house and given to Fort Rickey Discovery Zoo in Rome, New York, which has the permits to house the snake.</p>

<p>Native to Southeast Asia, Burmese pythons are becoming a popular pet choice in the US. In Florida, they are an invasive species that feeds on local fauna.</p>

<p>The maximum length of a Burmese python is 16 feet (5 meters). The albino Burmese python captured in New York was yellow in colour and had a head pattern resembling an arrow.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In what is being seen as a first-of-its kind confession by the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Syed Asim Munir has admitted Pakistani military's direct role in the 1999 Kargil war against India.</p>

<p>During his Defence Day speech on Friday, Munir mentioned Kargil along with the three wars with India while paying homage to what he termed as sacrifices rendered through martyrdom by soldiers of the Pakistan Armed forces.</p>

<p>"Certainly Pakistani nation is a powerful and brave nation, which understands the value of freedom and knows how to sustain it. 1948, 1965, 1971, the Kargil war between Pakistan and India, or the war in Siachen, thousands sacrificed their lives and were martyred for the safety and security of the country," he told the gathering at the GHQ.</p>

<p>Munir's statement is being seen as a first of its kind confession by a sitting Army Chief on direct role of the military in the Kargil war, a position Islamabad has refrained from taking for the past 25 years.</p>

<p>So far, Pakistan had denied its involvement in the 1999 war and claimed that it was an action taken by "freedom fighters" of Kashmir.</p>

<p>Former Army Chief General Pervaiz Musharraf always claimed that the Kargil operation was a successful localized action.</p>

<p>During an interview, Musharraf had stated that then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was not taken into confidence and many decisions taken by the armed forces along the volatile Line of Control (LoC) with India did not even require approval of the army chief.</p>

<p>However, Musharraf had admitted the role of Pakistan Army's 10 core FCNA (Force Command Northern Areas) in the entire operation.</p>

<p>"Initially, there was a mujahideen activity in the area. Later on FCNA decided to man the 150 mile vacant area of the Line of Control (LoC). For this, there is no need to get approval or permission from anyone," said Musharraf.</p>

<p>Mushahid Hussain Syed, who was the Information Secretary under Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif during 1999, also detailed about his government being informed about the Kargil operation through an official communication by the then DGMO (Director General Military Operations).</p>

<p>"When Kargil happened, the formal intimation and briefing that was given to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, was given on 17th May 1999 by the DGMO. Before that, voices from India had started to come and there was a realization that something was happening along the Line of Control," said Syed in an interview.</p>

<p>Experts maintain that the Kargil operation will remain a success story for some and a big blunder and mistake for many others. They maintain that Musharraf's claim of FCNA's involvement, which is part of the 10 Core of Pakistan Army and manages Kashmir and the northern areas of the country, is enough confession to endorse the fact, reiterated by the current army chief.</p>

<p>It also remains a fact that many bodies of Pakistan Army soldiers in Kargil were not brought back, prompting their families to raise questions over the reluctance of the Pakistani government and the army to own them.</p>

<p>"Those officers, who came to meet us, we kept asking them to try and bring the bodies of their loved ones back. I believe that they should have tried harder. But they didn't," said Itrat Abbas, brother of late Captain Farhat Haseeb, the army officer martyred in Kargil, confirming that officers and soldiers of Pakistan Army were deployed in Kargil.</p>

<p>Rehana Mehboob, mother of late Captain Ammar Hussain, admitted that she kept getting calls from the Army Unit and friends of her son during the Kargil war, adding that then Army Chief Pervaiz Musharraf did not even own the operation.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned statements by families and then government officials along with the then army chief are enough evidence to maintain that while then PM Sharif was kept in the dark, the army's chain of command was fully on board about the Kargil operation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

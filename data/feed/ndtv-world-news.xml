       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea vowed to "totally destroy" its enemies in case of war when leader Kim Jong Un gives an order, state media KCNA reported on Sunday.</p>

<p>Senior military officials including Army Colonel Ri Un Ryong and Navy Lieutenant Commander Yu Kyong Song made the comments "out of surging hatred" towards the U.S. and South Korea at a meeting on Saturday attended by Kim to celebrate the 71st Korean War armistice anniversary, according to KCNA.</p>

<p>North Korea and the United States do not have diplomatic ties and talks over reducing tensions and denuclearising North Korea have been stalled since 2019. North Korea's state media recently said it doesn't expect that to change no matter who is next elected in the White House.</p>

<p>While accusing the US and South Korea of "being hell-bent on provoking a nuclear war," the military officials vowed to strengthen war efficiency to stage an "overwhelming attack on the enemy anytime and without delay and totally destroy them once the respected Supreme Commander Kim Jong Un gives an order."</p>

<p>North Korea signed an armistice agreement with the United States and China on July 27, 1953 ending hostilities in the three-year war. US generals signed the agreement representing the United Nations forces that backed South Korea.</p>

<p>North Korea calls July 27 "Victory Day" while South Korea does not mark the day with any major events.</p>

<p>Hostilities ended with a truce, not a treaty, meaning the two sides are still technically at war.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris has been able to cut down Donald Trump's lead in the last few weeks, suggest recent polls. Harris has been able to unite the Democratic voters before the big fight in November. Trump and his team haven't missed her momentum and are gearing up to target her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio calls it the "Harris Honeymoon".</p>

<p>After Joe Biden's exit from the Presidential polls, the Republicans are focusing their attacks on Kamala Harris.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Donald Trump's team is bringing focus to Harris' left-leaning stands during her 2020 presidential campaign. In 2019, in an effort to align with Democratic primary voters, she endorsed policies such as scrapping private health insurance, reforming policing, decriminalising undocumented entry and supporting the Green New Deal. Now, these positions are being used against her by opponents like David McCormick and Donald Trump, who released a video titled "Meet San Francisco Radical Kamala Harris."</p>

<h2><strong>Kamala Harris As Prosecutor</strong></h2>

<p>Harris's background as a prosecutor and California attorney general is under attack too. She has previously used this experience to criticise Trump. Now, Trump's campaign, led by Chris LaCivita, is targeting Harris' years as a prosecutor, citing her tough stance on drug crimes affecting black men and instances where she didn't prosecute or paroled offenders who committed crimes again.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>"Border Czar"</strong></h2>

<p>Another approach Republicans are taking is to tie Kamala Harris to the unpopular decisions and policies of the Joe Biden administration. They are linking her to issues like immigration policies and inflation, making her own record as vice-president a liability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Republicans have labelled her the "border czar" for her past statements on immigration. Taylor Budowich of the Trump campaign has announced a $32 million ad campaign targeting her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tony Fabrizio of the Trump campaign argues that Harris can't escape her past actions and promised that voters will soon see her as Biden's "partner and co-pilot" with a "dangerously liberal record."&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Trump vs Harris: Polls</strong></h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-neck-and-neck-with-donald-trump-show-latest-polls-6201284 ">latest polls</a> indicate a tight race between Trump and Harris. A Wall Street Journal poll shows them neck-and-neck at 49% to 47% in a two-person matchup, within the margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A New York Times/Siena College poll conducted between July 22-24 shows Trump leading Harris 48% to 47% among likely voters in a head-to-head match. According to Bloomberg, an unweighted average of the polls conducted after Biden exited the presidential race shows Harris trailing Trump by 1.6 percentage points.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris is also expected to get 69% of Black registered voters, up from 59% for Biden last month. She has increased her party's share of Hispanic voters from 45% to 57% and under 30 voters from 46% to 56%. These could potentially boost her chances in the election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-on-joe-bidens-speech-after-exiting-us-presidential-polls-barely-understandable-so-bad-6182893">Donald Trump</a> has said incumbent US President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joe-biden-says-us-is-more-powerful-than-any-dictator-or-tyrant-6182537">Joe Biden</a> was forced to exit the presidential race, describing it a "coup" by the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>The former president's remarks came during an election rally in Minnesota on Saturday.</p>

<p>"This was really a coup of and by the Democrats. This was a coup of a man that had 14 million votes. He wanted to run. They wouldn't let him run. They treated him horribly. They said to him, we can do it the nice way, or we can do it the hard way. To Joe, he's president," Trump claimed.</p>

<p>This was a coup with the presidency, he said.</p>

<p>"They threatened him with the 25th Amendment. They said, Joe, we're going to threaten you with the 25th Amendment. You're cognitively and physically a mess. And if you don't get out, we're going to take you out with the 25th Amendment," Trump, 78, alleged.</p>

<p>The 25th Amendment of the US Constitution was passed by Congress to determine the presidential succession after the assassination of former President John F Kennedy.</p>

<p>It also gives power to the vice president as well as the Cabinet to remove a president from office if they are deemed physically incapable.</p>

<p>"And he said, I'll go. And then the fake news said, oh, he was so brave. He was so brave. No, he was forced to leave," Trump claimed.</p>

<p>Biden, 81, on July 20 announced his decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential elections and endorsed Kamala Harris as Democratic Presidential nominee.</p>

<p>This followed a series of fast-moving developments after his disastrous debate performance in Atlanta on June 27 and a failed assassination attempt on Trump. Both the developments resulted in a sharp drop in the popularity rating of Biden, which made the Democrats worried and they started feeling a Trump wave sweeping the nation.</p>

<p>After Biden's exit and his Vice President Harris taking over, the Democrats have regained the momentum and are giving a tough fight to Trump.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics 2024 was a spectacular event that took place on Friday, July 26, along the River Seine. For the first time in Olympic history, the ceremony was held outside a stadium, with 85 boats carrying nearly 7,000 athletes from 205 countries along a 6-km stretch of the Seine. The ceremony also saw two unique figures - a masked torchbearer running across rooftops and a caped rider who rode a metal horse down the Seine, delivering the Olympic flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Who were the two masked figures?</strong></p>

<p>A masked Amazon on a motorised horse participated in the ceremony, galloping down the Seine while wearing a cape with the Olympic rings. She carried the olympic flag&nbsp;from the Pont d'Iena to the Place du Trocadero on the metal horseback. As she passed under bridges, she unfurled dove wings. The rider was <a href="https://olympics.com/en/news/paris-2024-olympic-games-opening-ceremony-flame-cauldron ">Floriane Issert</a>, a non-commissioned officer in the Gendarmerie Nationale. Following her, a group of Games volunteers carried the national flags.</p>

<p>Ms Issert wasn't the only one to make an impact. A mysterious torchbearer also made a splash by leaping across buildings and past monuments with ease. Clad in a black cloak and mask, their identity remained a secret throughout the ceremony. They met Zinedine Zidane at the end of the procession, handing the torch back to the French football legend before disappearing into the night.</p>

<p>The Paris 2024 Olympics opening ceremony began with a performance by Lady Gaga and included a tribute to French culture, history and sport. Athletes from 205 National Olympic Committees (NOC) participated in the parade, which travelled along the Seine and passed by iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame and the Grand Palais.</p>

<p>Apart from Zidane, the Olympic torch was also carried by French sporting heroes Teddy Riner and Marie-Jose Perec, as well as Spanish Tennis legend Rafael Nadal. The cauldron, attached to a hot air balloon, rose into the sky as Celine Dion performed <em>L'hymne à l'amour</em>&nbsp;from the Eiffel Tower balcony.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ceremony was attended by 320,000 spectators along the Seine and watched by millions around the world.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Former President Donald Trump has promised to make the US a "Bitcoin superpower" if returned to the White House and said that he will appoint an advisory council to design transparent regulatory guidance for the benefit of the entire industry.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former President Donald Trump has promised to make the US a “Bitcoin superpower" if returned to the White House and said that he will appoint an advisory council to design transparent regulatory guidance for the benefit of the entire industry.</p>

<p>But Trump, the Republican nominee, stopped short of proposing a formal federal reserve of digital currency.</p>

<p>Trump made a series of cryptocurrency-friendly policy commitments during remarks at a Bitcoin convention Saturday, including promising to fire Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler and creating a “strategic national Bitcoin stockpile.” “I'm laying out my plan to ensure that the United States will be the crypto capital of the planet and the Bitcoin superpower of the world,” Trump, 78, said.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is the world's first widely adopted cryptocurrency — it allows for secure and seamless peer-to-peer transactions on the internet.</p>

<p>He also warned that Bitcoin investors in the audience will be “crushed” if Vice President Kamala Harris is elected as president.</p>

<p>“They (Democrats) want to choke you. They want to choke you out of business. We're not going to let that happen. And no longer will your government sit by and watch as Bitcoin jobs and businesses flee to other countries because America's laws are too unclear and too tough and too angry and too stiff. We will keep each and every Bitcoin job in the United States of America,” Trump said in his address to the Bitcoin2024 Conference, the cryptocurrency industry's largest annual gathering, in Nashville's Music City Center.</p>

<p>Trump is the first major party candidate to address the annual cryptocurrency conference.</p>

<p>Trump also promised to “immediately” establish a “Bitcoin and crypto presidential advisory council,” which he said would provide “transparent regulatory guidance” for the cryptocurrency sector. “I am proud to be the first American president to address a Bitcoin event anywhere in the world. If crypto is going to define the future, I want it to be mined, minted and made in the USA,” he said.</p>

<p>“We will have regulations, but from now on, the rules will be written by people who love your industry, not hate your industry. People who want to make it clear and simple, straightforward and fair. People that want to see your industry thrive, not dive,” he said.</p>

<p>Trump also said he would end efforts by the US government to create a central bank digital currency (CBDC), an initiative that cryptocurrency enthusiasts have long been critical of.</p>

<p>“I will immediately order the treasury department and other federal agencies to cease and desist all steps necessary because there's a thing going on in your industry. They want to move the creation of a central bank digital currency. It's over. Forget it. There will never be a CBDC while I'm President of the United States. I will always defend the right to self-custody. You're going to have a great industry, and we're going to be fuel for your industry,” he said.</p>

<p>As president, Trump has declared Bitcoin “not money” and criticised it as “highly volatile and based on thin air.” But Saturday marked the culmination of a total reversal on the issue during the former president's latest White House bid. Indian-American entrepreneur-turned-politician Vivek Ramaswamy is a key advisor to Trump on cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Trump announced that as part of his effort to provide regulatory clarity, his administration will create a framework to enable the safe and responsible expansion of stable coins allowing them to extend the dominance of the US dollar to new frontiers all around the world.</p>

<p>“America will be richer, the world will be better, and there will be billions and billions of people brought into the crypto economy and storing their savings in Bitcoin. Those who say that Bitcoin is a threat to the dollar have the story backwards. Bitcoin is not threatening the dollar. The behaviour of the current US government is really threatening the dollar,” he said.</p>

<p>“The danger to our financial future does not come from crypto. It comes from trillions of dollars in waste, rampant inflation and open borders while giving welfare and free healthcare to all of the illegal aliens that are pouring into our country by the millions and millions and millions. It comes from printing hundreds of billions of dollars to fund endless wars overseas while our cities are like combat zones here at home,” he alleged.</p>

<p>Trump America under him will become the world's undisputed Bitcoin mining powerhouse.</p>

<p>“You'll be a Bitcoin mining powerhouse. You will not have to move your family to China. You will not be moving to China. As we implement these reforms, Bitcoin and crypto will grow our economy, cement American financial dominance and strengthen our entire country long into the future,” he said.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican nominee Donald Trump has told Christians that if they vote for him in the November presidential elections, he will fix everything so well that they won't have to vote again.</p>

<p>Trump was speaking at a Florida event organized by the conservative group Turning Point Action.</p>

<p>"Christians, you have to get out and vote. You won't have to do it anymore. Four more years, you know what, it will be fixed, it will be fine. You won't have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians. I love you, Christians. I'm a Christian. I love you, get out, you gotta get out and vote. In four years, you don't have to vote again, we'll have it fixed so good you're not going to have to vote," Trump said.</p>

<p>It's not clear what the former president, who faces charges of inciting the 2020 Capitol riots and allegedly trying to overturn his 2022 election loss, meant by these remarks.</p>

<p>The Kamala Harris campaign has not addressed the remarks directly, but spokesperson Jason Singer described his overall speech as "bizarre" and "backward-looking".</p>

<p>Trump had earlier said that he would be a dictator for a day to close the southern border with Mexico if returns to power in November. He later played down his remarks as a joke.</p>

<p>The US presidential race has tightened after President Joe Biden was replaced by his deputy Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee last week. Ms Harris' entry in the race has largely erased Trump's lead, recent opinion polls.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris on Saturday acknowledged the uphill climb to defeating Donald Trump in November, but said her freshly-minted presidential campaign would prevail over the "wild lies" of her Republican rival.</p>

<p>As Trump prepared to address a bitcoin conference in Tennessee, Harris was speaking at a fundraising event in Massachusetts with celebrity guests including singer-songwriter James Taylor and cellist Yoyo Ma.</p>

<p>"We are the underdogs in this race, but this is a people-powered campaign," she told the crowd at the event, which her campaign said would net $1.4 million.</p>

<p>"You may have noticed, Donald Trump has been resorting to some wild lies about my record. And some of what he and his running mate are saying, well, it's just plain weird," she said, the latest quip adopted by Democrats in describing the Republicans' attacks.</p>

<p>The latest among them included Trump's remarks to a religious convention Friday night, where he accused Harris of being an anti-Semite who plans to allow the murder of newborn babies.</p>

<p>"She doesn't like Jewish people. She doesn't like Israel. That's the way it is," he said of the vice president, whose husband is Jewish.</p>

<p>In perhaps his most outrageous statement of the night, he claimed Harris wanted to enshrine in federal law the right to "rip the baby out of the womb in the eighth, ninth month and even after birth -- execute the baby after birth."</p>

<p>Trump, who at age 78 is now the oldest major-party nominee in history, is scrambling to reorient an election against someone two decades his junior, having expected to face an 81-year-old incumbent Joe Biden beset by concerns over infirmity.</p>

<p>Seeking to become the first female president in US history, Harris is tasked with rapidly assembling a campaign against an opponent who has been in near permanent reelection mode since he became president in 2016.</p>

<p>Her late-starting White House bid has enjoyed early momentum. Polls that had shown Biden steadily slipping against Trump now show Harris in a race too close to call.</p>

<p>She's garnered support from Democratic heavyweights, including Biden himself and most recently Barack and Michelle Obama.</p>

<p>Torianna Parrish, 34, was among the crowd greeting Harris upon her arrival Saturday afternoon at the airport in Westfield, Massachusetts.</p>

<p>"I wanted to show there's power in numbers. I wanted to show my support," she said.</p>

<p>"We're rooting for her and we want to see her make this country what it needs to be."</p>

<p>Harris was introduced at the Colonial Theater in Pittsfield by Taylor, who said: "Let us honor the woman and the moment and may our ardent support be the wind in her sails. Our hopes go with her and she stands for us all."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A rocket fired from Lebanon hit a football pitch in an Arab town in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights Saturday, killing 11 youngsters in what the army described as the "deadliest attack on Israeli civilians since October 7".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A rocket fired from Lebanon hit a football pitch in an Arab town in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights Saturday, killing 11 youngsters in what the army described as the "deadliest attack on Israeli civilians since October 7".</p>

<p>The army said Lebanese group Hezbollah fired the deadly rocket that killed the youngsters aged between 10 and 20 years when they were hit on the pitch in the town of Majdal Shams.</p>

<p>Many residents of the town retain Syrian nationality decades after the territory's occupation in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.</p>

<p>The rocket fire came after an Israeli strike killed four Hezbollah fighters in south Lebanon prompting the Iran-backed militant group to announce a flurry of retaliatory rocket attacks against the Golan and northern Israel.</p>

<p>Military spokesman Daniel Hagari said on X that 11 youngsters were killed in the attack, while the emergency service Magen David Adom said 19 others were wounded when the rocket hit Majdal Shams.</p>

<p>"We will prepare for a response against Hezbollah... we will act," Rear Admiral Hagari said in a video statement, adding the rocket fire was the "deadliest attack on Israeli civilians since October 7" when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel sparking war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was returning early from a visit to the United States, vowed that "Israel will not let this murderous attack go unanswered".</p>

<p>"Hezbollah will pay a heavy price for it, a price it has not paid before," he warned in a statement released by his office.</p>

<p>- 'Only crime' playing soccer -</p>

<p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog charged that Hezbollah had "brutally attacked and murdered children today, whose only crime was going out to play soccer".</p>

<p>Hezbollah denied it was responsible for the deadly strike.</p>

<p>"The Islamic Resistance has no connection to this incident," it said, referring to its military wing.</p>

<p>The police and the army said the rocket fired at Majdal Shams was part of a barrage of rockets fired from Lebanon which struck multiple locations in the Golan.</p>

<p>Ambulances, helicopters and mobile intensive care units were deployed to the scene, the army said.</p>

<p>"We arrived at a football pitch and saw destruction and objects on fire. Injured people were lying on the grass," paramedic Idan Avshalom said in a statement issued by Magen David Adom.</p>

<p>An AFP correspondent saw medics carrying away the wounded for treatment.</p>

<p>"Officers and police bomb disposal experts from the northern district police are currently securing the area and searching for additional (rocket) remnants to eliminate any further risk to the public," the police said in a separate statement.</p>

<p>The rocket fire came after a Lebanese security source said an Israeli strike killed four Hezbollah fighters in the southern village of Kfar Kila.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, which has exchanged near-daily cross-border fire with the Israeli army since the Gaza war erupted last October, confirmed the deaths of four of its fighters.</p>

<p>It said it carried out a dozen retaliatory attacks on Israeli targets, nine in the space of two hours.</p>

<p>The violence since October has killed at least 527 people in Lebanon, according to an AFP tally. Most of the dead have been fighters, but they have included at least 104 civilians.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, 18 soldiers and 24 civilians have been killed, according to Israeli authorities.</p>

<p>The war in Gaza broke out after Hamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,258 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, which does not provide details on civilian and militant deaths.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer Saturday brushed off the fascination with a viral image taken at the Paris Olympic Games opening ceremony showing him as the only dignitary not wearing a protective plastic poncho during driving rain.</p>

<p>Starmer was pictured as the only person bare-headed as other VIPs opted to encase themselves in plastic hand-out ponchos to protect themselves from the rain that blighted Friday's opening ceremony on the River Seine.</p>

<p>The image was widely shared on social media, with users seeing the picture as a classic example of a very British stiff upper lip in the face of the inclement weather all to familiar to residents of the famously drizzly country.</p>

<p>"It's British! We are used to the rain," Starmer told French channel LCI in an interview.</p>

<p>"But it (the rain) didn't dampen the spirits," he added, describing the opening ceremony as a "spectacular" and "fantastic" event that made "the whole use of the river (and) of Paris."</p>

<p>Starmer, elected earlier this month in a landslide election victory for the centre-left Labour Party that ended 14 years of right-wing Conservative rule, was making his first official visit to Paris as premier.</p>

<p>"Nothing more British than absolutely refusing to wear one of those plastic poncho things," wrote one user on X, formerly Twitter.</p>

<p>Rain has had considerable symbolism in British politics in recent weeks.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ten people, including children, were killed in a rocket attack on a football ground in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday, Israel's N12 News reported, the worst incident yet in months of violence between Israel and armed groups in Lebanon.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said the rocket was fired by Lebanese group Hezbollah. The Iran-backed group denied any involvement in the attack, which looked likely to draw a fierce response from Israel.</p>

<p>The Israeli emergency service said earlier that nine people were critically wounded by a rocket fired from Lebanon that hit a village football pitch in the Druze village of Majdal Shams. A medic described great destruction and fire at the scene.</p>

<p>"We witnessed great destruction when we arrived at the soccer field, as well as items that were on fire. There were casualties on the grass and the scene was gruesome," said Magen David Adom medic Idan Avshalom.</p>

<p>A witness told Reuters: "It landed in the soccer pitch, all of them are children ... many bodies and remains are in field we don't know who they are." She asked not to be named.</p>

<p>The attack on the soccer pitch followed an Israeli strike in Lebanon that killed four operatives on Saturday. Two security sources in Lebanon said the four fighters killed in the Israeli strike on Kfarkila in southern Lebanon were members of different armed groups, with at least one of them belonging to Hezbollah.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted a military structure belonging to Hezbollah, after identifying a militant cell entering the building.</p>

<p>At least 30 rockets were then fired from Lebanon across the border, the military said.</p>

<p>"According to an IDF situational assessment and the intelligence in our possession, the rocket launch toward Majdal Shams was carried out by the Hezbollah terrorist organization," the military said.</p>

<p>Hezbollah claimed at least four attacks, including with Katyusha rockets, in retaliation for the Kfarkila attacks. However senior Hezbollah media representative Mohammad Afif denied responsibility for the strike on Majdal Shams.</p>

<p>In a written statement, but group said "the Islamic Resistance has absolutely nothing to do with the incident, and categorically denies all false allegations in this regard".</p>

<p>Hezbollah and Israel have been trading fire since October, after Hamas' attack on southern Israel triggered the Gaza war, in their worst escalation since 2006.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK police arrested two men on Saturday following an assault on a participant in an anti-fascism protest, held to counter another nearby demonstration organised by far-right agitator Tommy Robinson.</p>

<p>London's Metropolitan Police said the pair were arrested on suspicion of assaulting a "Stand Up To Racism" protester in Victoria Embankment Gardens in the city centre.</p>

<p>Officers gave the victim first aid after he sustained a head injury in the incident, and he will be taken to hospital to be checked, according to the force.</p>

<p>It noted that, contrary to social media reports, the arrests were not related to the carrying of any flags.</p>

<p>The Met, as the London force is known, said around 1,000 officers were on duty Saturday as part of the policing operation to deal with the two rallies, as well as another protest.</p>

<p>Thousands gathered in the heart of the British capital from late morning for the demonstration organised by Robinson, a far-right firebrand and founder of the now defunct Islamophobic English Defence League organisation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the counter-protest staged by Stand Up To Racism and others also rallied in the heart of London, with the Met imposing so-called conditions on the two marches "with the aim of preventing serious disruption".</p>

<p>They included requiring participants to stick to certain areas and streets and disperse by stipulated times.</p>

<p>"Our first priority is to keep the peace to ensure that those exercising their right to lawful protest can do so safely," Chief Superintendent Colin Wingrove said ahead of the weekend events.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Presidential candidate Donald Trump said Saturday he will return to holding outdoor rallies with additional Secret Service protection, two weeks after he was injured in an assassination attempt at an open-air campaign event.</p>

<p>"I will continue to do outdoor rallies, and the Secret Service has agreed to substantially step up their operation. They are very capable of doing so," Trump said on his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>"No one can ever be allowed to stop or impede free speech or gathering," he added.</p>

<p>His remarks came after the Secret Service reportedly encouraged Trump's campaign to stop scheduling outdoor campaign events following his assassination attempt, opting instead for large indoor arenas.</p>

<p>Trump was wounded when a 20-year-old gunman shot at him during an outdoor rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13, killing one person and injuring two others.</p>

<p>The FBI confirmed on Friday that Trump was hit by a bullet, or a fragment of one -- putting to rest questions over the nature of the injury to his right ear.</p>

<p>Investigators are still working to establish a motive for the attack, which marked another stunning chapter in the US election race and sparked heavy criticism of the Secret Service.</p>

<p>Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned on Tuesday after acknowledging that the agency had failed in its mission of protecting high-profile politicians.</p>

<p>She told a congressional committee that the Secret Service was alerted "two to five times" ahead of the attack about a "suspicious individual" at the rally, but was unable to locate him before he opened fire.</p>

<p>Perched on the roof of a nearby building, he was shot dead by a Secret Service sniper less than 30 seconds after firing the first of eight shots.</p>

<p>Trump has made the shooting a key part of his campaign pitch, telling supporters that he "took a bullet for democracy" and vowing to return to Butler for a "big and beautiful rally."</p>

<p>On Saturday, the Republican and his running mate JD Vance were scheduled to hold a campaign event at an indoor, 6,000-seat hockey arena in the midwestern US state of Minnesota.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris -- who is on track to become the Democratic nominee -- was set to attend a fundraising event in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[On Thursday, Bali officials seized hundreds of kilograms of raw dog meat and numerous skewers from vendors.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent investigation has revealed that Australian tourists were being tricked into eating dog meat skewers during their holidays on an Indonesian island.&nbsp;On Thursday, Bali officials seized hundreds of kilograms of raw dog meat and numerous skewers from vendors, despite a comprehensive ban on the trade of such meat on the popular resort island, the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/southeast-asia/bali-dog-meat-arrests-skewers-illegal-b2586314.html">Independent</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to AFP, public order officers in Bali's Jembrana district seized at least 500 dog meat skewers and 56 kilograms of raw dog meat from various sellers following a series of inspections.&nbsp;Dewa Nyoman Rai Dharmadi, head of the Bali Public Order Agency, said that inspections conducted this week found three vendors still peddling dog meat, defying local regulations that prohibit its sale.</p>

<p>Two of the vendors had previously received warnings from Bali Police regarding their engagement in the trade of dog meat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We won't suddenly take legal action, but we are giving them the chance to know the ban and why it was banned. But we will process recurrent (sellers) for deterrent effect. We're not playing around,'' Mr Dharmadi said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''Dog meat is not food and can also potentially cause disease. Don't believe in the superstitions that dog meat is healthy. That's misleading,'' he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two of the vendors are reportedly set to attend court in August.</p>

<p>Notably, Bali has enacted a stringent ban on the dog meat trade, imposing severe penalties on offenders, including a maximum prison sentence of three months and a hefty fine of up to 50 million rupiah (approximately 2,300 pounds), serving as a strong deterrent to those who would engage in this illicit activity.</p>

<p>Unlike regulated agricultural practices, the dog meat trade often relies on the inhumane seizure of dogs that are not raised for food, including stolen pets, community-owned dogs, and street dogs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Animal welfare organizations, including Animals International, have condemned the sale and consumption of dog and cat meat, citing the inherent cruelty of the trade. They argue that the dog meat trade not only subjects dogs to immense suffering but also poses serious health and safety risks to both tourists and local communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, dog meat is considered a part of traditional cuisine and consumed in certain regions of Southeast and East Asia, including China, Vietnam, and North Korea.&nbsp;<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yan Hongsen, an 11-year-old from Zhejiang, China, has become an online sensation after writing 600 lines of code to build a rocket. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3271669/china-boy-11-writes-600-lines-code-build-rocket-after-mastering-physics-chemistry">South China Morning Post</a></em>, Yan's interest in rockets began when he witnessed the Long March-2 liftoff at the age of four. He has since taken online courses and self-studied physics and chemistry.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">Starting in August 2022, Yan spent 10 months building his first homemade solid-fuel rocket. He launched the rocket named Sen Xing, in June 2023. Although it crashed due to a parachute malfunction, Yan remained calm and analysed the cause of the failure.</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">''The nitrocellulose didn't explode as expected, the spring and lithium battery were also damaged. Maybe there is still an issue with the rocket's body connection,'' Yan said.</p>

<p>He now plans to launch his second rocket and hopes to get into one of China's seven prestigious civilian defence universities. His ultimate dream is to build a real rocket for China to explore the universe.</p>

<p>The young prodigy has been documenting his rocket development journey on social media, gaining over 440,000 followers. His parents also have been supportive, converting their living room into a rocket research studio.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The boy's father shared his pride and excitement with <em>SCMP</em> recalling the maiden launch, ''Although the rocket crashed, I considered its first flight a triumph. I was over the moon with excitement, but my son took it in stride, remaining remarkably calm and composed.''</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">“I don't understand aerospace, but I will always accompany my son As parents, we fully support our child's dreams. If he encounters technical difficulties that he can't solve, he always contacts me, and I try my best to reach out to experts for help,” his father added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His accomplishment has captured the attention of educators, tech enthusiasts, and space aficionados worldwide. His feats have gone viral on mainland Chinese social media as well, captivating the attention of millions and earning him a reputation as a prodigious talent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''His parents are remarkable for unconditionally supporting their child's dreams,'' wrote one user, while another commented, ''This must be the youngest person to build a rocket in China. I'm so proud of him.''</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As a propeller plane on Thursday whirred towards the U.S.-Mexico border to cross illegally, U.S. agents raced to meet it at a small municipal airport near El Paso, Texas, and arrest two men who were part of Mexican drug trafficking royalty.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a propeller plane on Thursday whirred towards the U.S.-Mexico border to cross illegally, U.S. agents raced to meet it at a small municipal airport near El Paso, Texas, and arrest two men who were part of Mexican drug trafficking royalty.</p>

<p>The son of jailed former Sinaloa Cartel kingpin Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman planned to give himself up upon landing. The other passenger - legendary septuagenarian trafficker Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada - did not and was duped into getting on the plane by the younger man, according to two current and two former U.S. officials familiar with the situation.</p>

<p>Zambada's arrest followed lengthy surrender talks between U.S. authorities and El Chapo's son, Joaquin Guzman Lopez, the sources said. But many American officials had given up hope on Joaquin turning himself in, and were caught unaware when he sent a last-minute message that he would arrive with a kingpin U.S. authorities had been chasing for four decades.</p>

<p>"El Mayo was the cherry on top," said one U.S. official, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the arrests. "It wasn't expected at all."</p>

<p>Guzman Lopez had convinced Zambada to board the plane by telling him that they were flying to see real estate in northern Mexico, according to the two current and one former U.S. officials.</p>

<p>Reuters was the first news organization to report the arrests, ahead of a Department of Justice statement on Thursday evening that confirmed the two men had been detained in El Paso. The news agency spoke to current and former officials to piece together a detailed account of the operation.</p>

<p>The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the two agencies who carried out the operation, scrambled agents from their local El Paso offices and barely reached the airport by the time the private plane was landing, according to a fifth source, a U.S. official who declined to give further details on the arrests.</p>

<p>One worker at the Dona Ana County International Jetport, near El Paso, told Reuters he saw a Beechcraft King Air plane land on Thursday afternoon on the runway, where federal agents were already waiting.</p>

<p>"Two individuals got off the plane ... and were calmly taken into custody," said the man, who declined to share his name out of concern for his safety.</p>

<p>The unexpected arrest of El Mayo, in his late 70s, and the way he appears to have been betrayed by Guzman Lopez, who is about 38 years old, has jolted the Mexican drug trafficking world, triggering fears of a bloody fissure in the Sinaloa Cartel between the two families that control the group's biggest power bases.</p>

<p>Zambada is accused of being one of the most consequential traffickers in Mexico's history, having co-founded the Sinaloa Cartel with "El Chapo" Guzman, who was extradited to the U.S. in 2017 and is serving a life sentence in a maximum security prison in Colorado.</p>

<p>Reuters could not determine why Guzman Lopez betrayed his father's long-time partner, though the four current and former sources said it was likely due to his desire to obtain a more favourable plea bargain deal from U.S. authorities and help his brother, Ovidio, who was arrested and extradited to the United States in 2023.</p>

<p>U.S. authorities have made drug bosses key targets, frequently striking plea bargain deals with them in exchange for information that leads to the capture of other high-ranking cartel figures.</p>

<p>The back-channel communication between American officials and Guzman Lopez was carried out through lawyers, the first official said. Jeffrey Lichtman, who represents both Guzman brothers, declined to comment.</p>

<p>Zambada, who was in a wheelchair, pleaded not guilty on Friday in a Texas courtroom to drug charges, including continuing criminal enterprise, narcotics importation conspiracy and money laundering. His lawyer, Frank Perez, said Zambada did not come to the U.S. voluntarily.</p>

<p>Guzman Lopez is due to appear in court next week in Chicago, where he was first indicted on drugs charges around 6 years ago.</p>

<p>Guzman Lopez is one of four sons of El Chapo - known as Los Chapitos, or Little Chapos - who inherited their father's faction of the cartel. Joaquin and Ovidio have the same mother, while the other two siblings - Ivan and Jesus Alfredo - hail from El Chapo's first marriage.</p>

<p>The brothers have in recent years come under ferocious pressure from U.S. authorities, who have made them their main anti-narcotics targets, portraying them and the Sinaloa Cartel as the biggest traffickers of fentanyl into the United States. Fentanyl overdoses have surged to become the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18 and 45.</p>

<p>Ray Donovan, a former high-ranking U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) official, said the defeats suffered by key Sinaloa Cartel bosses in recent past are mainly down to their embrace of fentanyl, which has risen up the political agenda in Washington as the death told has mounted on U.S. streets.</p>

<p>"The number of Americans dying has put a lot more pressure," Donovan said. "Fentanyl brought them down."</p>

<p>On Friday, U.S. President Joe Biden heralded the arrests and vowed to continue combating "the scourge of fentanyl".</p>

<h3><strong>New Generation Of Narcos</strong></h3>

<p>El Chapo's sons are known to be more violent and hot-headed than Zambada, who had a reputation as a shrewd operator that liked to stay in the shadows. Guzman Lopez was also seen as less important than his other three brothers.</p>

<p>The U.S. authorities had a $15 million reward for the capture of Zambada, who co-founded the Sinaloa Cartel in the late 1980s with El Chapo. Guzman Lopez had a $5 million bounty on his head. Both men face multiple indictments in the United States.</p>

<p>The first U.S. official cautioned that there are still many questions unanswered about how or why Zambada, an ultra-cautious and experienced cartel chieftain, found himself on that plane.</p>

<p>Mexican Security Minister Rosa Rodriguez said that Mexico was informed of the detentions by the U.S. government, but that Mexican authorities did not participate in the operation.</p>

<p>Outgoing Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has taken a cautious approach to tackling the powerful cartels, curbing security cooperation with U.S. authorities on fears that the previous U.S.-Mexico strategy of targeting powerful kingpins was triggering more nationwide violence.</p>

<p>In Oct. 2019, Mexico's military arrested Ovidio but were forced to release him after hundreds of Sinaloa Cartel foot soldiers blocked roads and fought running gun battles with soldiers as they to lay siege to the city of Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa. The military arrested Ovidio again in Jan. 2023 and he was extradited in September last year.</p>

<p>Matthew Allen, a former Special Agent in Charge of HSI's Arizona division that built indictments against Guzman Lopez and other Sinaloa Cartel figures, said both Zambada and Guzman Lopez had had periodic conversations with U.S. officials about surrendering over the years.</p>

<p>Allen, who maintains regular contact with former colleagues at HSI, said many traffickers, especially those from the younger generation, realize that giving themselves up, serving some time in jail and then spending their wealth is a better option than risking death from rivals in Mexico or capture by authorities that can lead to lifelong prison terms. Some informants are allowed to enter witness protection programs.</p>

<p>"They're seeing that this way you can do your time and do not have to look over your shoulder for the rest of your life," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump told Christians on Friday that if they vote for him this November, "in four years, you don't have to vote again. We'll have it fixed so good, you're not gonna have to vote."</p>

<p>It was not clear what the former president meant by his remarks, in an election campaign where his Democratic opponents accuse him of being a threat to democracy, and after his attempt to overturn his 2020 defeat to President Joe Biden, an effort that led to the deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for clarification of his comments.</p>

<p>Trump was speaking at an event organized by the conservative group Turning Point Action in West Palm Beach, Florida.</p>

<p>Trump said: "Christians, get out and vote, just this time. "You won't have to do it anymore. Four more years, you know what, it will be fixed, it will be fine, you won't have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians."</p>

<p>He added: "I love you Christians. I'm a Christian. I love you, get out, you gotta get out and vote. In four years, you don't have to vote again, we'll have it fixed so good you're not going to have to vote," Trump said.</p>

<p>In an interview with Fox News in December, Trump said that if he won the Nov. 5 election he would be a dictator, but only on "day one", to close the southern border with Mexico and expand oil drilling.</p>

<p>Democrats have seized on that comment. Trump has since said the remarks were a joke.</p>

<p>If Trump wins a second term in the White House, he can serve only four more years as president. U.S. presidents are limited to two terms, consecutive or not, under the U.S. Constitution.</p>

<p>In May, speaking at a National Rifle Association gathering, Trump quipped about serving more than two terms as president.</p>

<p>He referred to the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat, the only president to serve more than two terms. The two-term limit was added after Roosevelt's presidency.</p>

<p>"You know, FDR, 16 years - almost 16 years - he was four terms. I don't know, are we going to be considered three-term? Or two-term?" Trump asked the NRA crowd.</p>

<p>Trump's remarks on Friday pointed to the need for both parties to energize their base voters ahead of what will likely be a closely fought election. Trump has enjoyed loyal support from evangelicals in the past two elections.</p>

<p>The race has abruptly tightened after the decision by Biden to end his reelection bid and with his vice president, Kamala Harris, becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee.</p>

<p>Recent opinion polls show Trump's significant lead over Biden has been largely erased since the torch was passed to Harris.</p>

<p>Jason Singer, a Harris campaign spokesperson, in a statement did not directly address Trump's remarks about Christians not having to vote again.</p>

<p>Singer described Trump's overall speech as "bizarre" and "backward looking".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaza's civil defence agency said Saturday that Israel's military operation around Khan Yunis has killed about 170 people and wounded hundreds since it started on Monday.</p>

<p>"Since the beginning of the Israeli military operation in the Khan Yunis area, we are talking of approximately 170 martyrs and hundreds of wounded," agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP.</p>

<p>He said many people had been displaced again on Saturday as the Israeli operation continued.</p>

<p>"The questions is where will these residents go?" Basal said.</p>

<p>"Anyone who sees the situation in Khan Yunis will witness thousands of people spread out on the ground, on the roads, in areas that unfortunately are not suitable for living.</p>

<p>"With no other options available, they are exposing themselves to death."</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday the military issued new evacuation orders for residents of the southern city, after retrieving the bodies of five Israelis and warning of new operations.</p>

<p>The United Nations said more than 180,000 Palestinians have fled Khan Yunis since the Israeli operation began on Monday.</p>

<p>The evacuation orders and "intensified hostilities" have "significantly destabilised aid operations", it added, reporting "dire water, hygiene and sanitation conditions" across the Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it launched the operation to halt rocket fire from the area, which already saw heavy fighting earlier this year.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, it said troops had retrieved the bodies of five Israelis from the area.</p>

<p>They had been killed during the Hamas attacks of October 7 and their bodies taken back to Gaza, the military said.</p>

<p>On Saturday, it ordered residents from more parts of Khan Yunis "to temporarily evacuate to the adjusted humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi" -- the second such adjustment made to the safe zone within a week.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

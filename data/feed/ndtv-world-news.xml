       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two survivors of the 2017 bomb attack at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, on Friday won £45,000 ($58,000) in damages from a former TV producer who claimed the attack was a hoax.</p>

<p>Martin Hibbert and his daughter Eve sued Richard Hall over claims made in videos and a book that they were "crisis actors" employed by the state as part of an elaborate deception.</p>

<p>Martin Hibbert sustained a spinal cord injury in the attack, and his daughter suffered severe brain damage.</p>

<p>Richard Hall argued that he was acting in the public interest by filming Martin Hibbert's daughter outside her home, but the High Court in London agreed with Martin Hibbert's claim for harassment.</p>

<p>Judge Karen Steyn called Richard Hall's behaviour "a negligent, indeed reckless, abuse of media freedom" and on Friday ordered him to pay Martin Hibbert and his daughter each £22,500 in damages.</p>

<p>Richard Hall must also pay 90 percent of their legal costs, currently estimated at £260,000.</p>

<p>"The claimants are both vulnerable. The allegations are serious and distressing," said the judge.</p>

<p>Jonathan Price, lawyer for the claimants, said that Richard Hall "insisted that the terrorist attack in which the claimants were catastrophically injured did not happen and that the claimants were participants or 'crisis actors' in a state-orchestrated hoax, who had repeatedly, publicly and egregiously lied to the public for monetary gain."</p>

<p>Martin Hibbert welcomed the ruling, adding: "I want this case to open up the door for change, and for it to protect others from what we have been put through.</p>

<p>"It proves and has highlighted... that there is protection within the law, and it sends out a message to conspiracy theorists that you cannot ignore all acceptable evidence and harass innocent people."</p>

<p>Islamic extremist Salman Abedi, aided by his brother, Hashem Abedi, killed 22 people and injured 1,017 during the suicide bombing at the end of the concert by the US singer.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fresh off a flight home, Israeli football fans back from Amsterdam recalled on Friday clashes and violence they said targeted Jewish people following a Europa League match.</p>

<p>Kobi Eliyahu, 40, said people with their faces covered "waited (on) every single corner... it was very frightening to see that".</p>

<p>Another returning fan, Eliya Cohen, said that after the match between Israel's Maccabi Tel Aviv and Dutch team Ajax on Thursday, he saw "Muslims looking for Jews to beat them up" in central Amsterdam.</p>

<p>"So I left. On the one hand, I wanted to help people out, but on the other hand I didn't want to stay there," Cohen told reporters at Ben Gurion airport near Israel's commercial hub of Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>At the arrivals hall, returning fans -- some wearing Maccabi Tel Aviv scarves and jerseys -- were greeted by a swarm of reporters and embraced by relieved relatives.</p>

<p>The unrest following the match, which the home club won 5-0, left five people hospitalised and was deemed "anti-Semitic" by Dutch and Israeli officials.</p>

<p>Despite a huge police presence, authorities were unable to stop the rapid attacks on fans in several parts of the city.</p>

<p>Nadav Zer, 33, said he and others he was with had to run back to their hotel to escape the violence.</p>

<p>"We heard blasts the whole night" as well as "shouts and screams" in Arabic, said Zer.</p>

<p>"It was unimaginable, the whole night," he added.</p>

<p>"But we never heard the police."</p>

<p>Eliyahu, a photographer who attended the game with his siblings, said: "It was orchestrated. They knew what was going to happen and it was a total surprise for us."</p>

<p>To him, the violence "looked like 1930s in Europe", when anti-Semitic attacks multiplied with the rise of Nazism in Germany, leading up to World War II.</p>

<p>"Everybody should understand what happened last night," said Eliyahu, who called on others to avoid Europe from now on.</p>

<p>"Israeli and Jewish people should never go to Europe again. They don't deserve us," he said.</p>

<p><strong>'Not connected to football'</strong></p>

<p>The violence in Amsterdam took place with anti-Israeli sentiment and reported anti-Semitic acts across the world soaring more than a year into the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, which has spilled over to Lebanon, too.</p>

<p>Tensions were already running high before the match, with Dutch police reporting "incidents on both sides" on Wednesday.</p>

<p>An unverified video on social media purportedly filmed on Thursday appeared to show some Maccabi fans chanting in Hebrew: "Let the IDF (Israeli military) win! We'll fuck the Arabs!"</p>

<p>Many of the Maccabi Tel Aviv players who landed at the airport left without offering any comments, but the club's CEO Ben Mansford spoke to journalists, calling the events "tragic".</p>

<p>"Lots of people went to a football game to support Maccabi Tel Aviv, to support Israel, to support the Star of David," he said.</p>

<p>"And for them to be running into rivers, to be kicked while defenceless on the floor... that's very very sad times for us all."</p>

<p>Mansford said that the violence "was not connected to football".</p>

<p>"There was a superb atmosphere in the stadium... but clearly once our fans started leaving the stadium, turning up in train stations, turning up back in central Amsterdam, that's when they were obviously targeted," he said.</p>

<p>Zer, the returning fan, said that despite tight security before the match, the Israelis were left to fend for themselves as it ended and night fell.</p>

<p>"There were... people with bats and stones looking for Israelis," he recalled, saying he remembered them speaking Arabic.</p>

<p>Attackers, mostly young men, "came from everywhere and we tried to escape from them", he said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas expressed readiness to work towards a "just and comprehensive peace" in Gaza during a phone call with US President-elect Donald Trump on Friday, his office said.</p>

<p>Trump's victory came with the Middle East in turmoil after the outbreak of the Gaza war in October 2023, triggered by the unprecedented attack on Israel by Palestinian group Hamas.</p>

<p>Congratulating Trump on his victory, Abbas expressed "readiness to work with President Trump to achieve a just and comprehensive peace based on international legitimacy," his office said in a statement.</p>

<p>It said that Trump also assured Abbas that he will work to end the war.</p>

<p>"President Trump stressed that he will work to stop the war, and his readiness to work with president Abbas and the concerned parties in the region and the world to make peace in the region."</p>

<p>While Trump struck a note of peace during his campaign, he also touted his status as Israel's strongest ally, even going so far as to promise Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu he would "finish the job" against Hamas in Gaza.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Trump had already hinted at a role for Elon Musk in his administration, but one could only guess the kind of role it might be and just how big or significant. On Wednesday, Trump reportedly gave the world a preview of what Mr Musk's role might be.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk being close to Donald Trump has been well-established over the last many months with the billionaire entrepreneur going all-in over his bet over a Trump presidency. Now that Donald Trump has emerged victorious in his electoral campaign and is President-elect, it is perhaps time for him to firm up a role for his "biggest supporter" in his upcoming administration.</p>

<p>Donald Trump had already hinted at a role for Elon Musk in his administration, but one could only guess the kind of role it might be and just how big or significant. On Wednesday, Donald Trump reportedly gave the world a preview of what Mr Musk's role might be.</p>

<p>Elon Musk was with Donald Trump at the President-elect's residence and luxury resort Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida when Donald Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke on the phone. During the phone call, Donald Trump reportedly handed the phone over to Elon Musk and supposedly asked the SpaceX founder to join the call with President Zelensky.</p>

<p>It is not known yet, if they discussed any change in policy the United States has towards Ukraine.</p>

<p>In his victory speech on US election result day, Donald Trump said he will "not start wars, but will help end them."</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/08/europe/ukraine-trump-elon-musk-zelensky-intl-latam/index.html" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">CNN</a> confirmed the development quoting a source who spoke with the US news agency on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the conversation. CNN further credited American news firm Axios.</p>

<h2><strong>THE PHONE CALL</strong></h2>

<p>According to the news report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.axios.com/2024/11/08/musk-trump-zelensky-ukraine-call" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">Axios</a>, there were two surprises that day - the first being that Elon Musk spoke with Zelensky, and the second, that Zelensky was reportedly "somewhat reassured by what he heard." This shows just how important and influential a role Elon Musk could end up playing the Trump administration 2.0.</p>

<p>The report further stated that the phone call between Trump, Musk, and Zelensky lasted for nearly half-an-hour. After being congratulated by Zelensky, Mr Trump reportedly said he will support Ukraine, but didn't reveal much else.</p>

<h3><strong>THE ASSURANCE</strong></h3>

<p>Elon Musk then reassured President Zelensky that he will continue to help Ukraine via his Starlink satellite constellation. Since the Russian invasion in 2022, Elon Musk's Starlink satellite system has provided Ukraine with significant frontline advantage by allowing its armed forces to share real-time drone coordinates, data and footage between units. It also gave Ukraine's military communications support in areas where mobile phone networks were destroyed.</p>

</div>

<p>Zelensky and Trump had met recently in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly meet in September. The two leaders had discussed ways in which the war with Russia could end and a diplomatic solution be found. "I promise you will be happy with me," Trump had reportedly told Zelensky at that meeting.</p>

<p>"I had an excellent call with President Trump and congratulated him on his historic landslide victory - his tremendous campaign made this result possible," President Zelensky wrote on X after the call between Trump, Musk and him on Wednesday.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[A US judge on Friday set aside pending deadlines in President-elect Donald Trump's 2020 election subversion case after federal prosecutors said they were grappling with the "unprecedented circumstance" of his impending return to the White House.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US judge on Friday set aside pending deadlines in President-elect Donald Trump's 2020 election subversion case after federal prosecutors said they were grappling with the "unprecedented circumstance" of his impending return to the White House.</p>

<p>US District Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington approved a request from Special Counsel Jack Smith, who is prosecuting the criminal case, to set aside the deadlines, according to a court order, while they weigh its future.</p>

<p>Prosecutors wrote the delay was necessary "to afford the Government time to assess this unprecedented circumstance and determine the appropriate course going forward consistent with Department of Justice policy."</p>

<p>Under a Justice Department policy dating back to the 1970s, a sitting president cannot be subject to criminal prosecution.</p>

<p>A source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday that the Justice Department was discussing how to wind down the case as Trump prepares to again assume the presidency.</p>

<p>Trump pleaded not guilty last year to four criminal charges accusing the Republican of conspiring to obstruct the collection and certification of votes following his 2020 defeat to Democrat Joe Biden. The effort by Trump and his allies to reverse Biden's victory culminated in the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol following a fiery speech by the then-president near the White house.</p>

<p>In Tuesday's election, Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, a victory all but certain to end two federal cases against him.</p>

<p>Trump's lawyers had been due to respond by Nov. 21 to Smith's argument that the case can proceed after a US Supreme Court ruling giving former presidents broad immunity from prosecution over official actions taken while in office.</p>

<p>Smith said prosecutors would inform the judge by Dec. 2 how they propose to move forward.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The project, set to start in December, aims to attract tourists and boost revenue, sparking widespread debate on Chinese social media.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A unique tourism experience is being introduced in Heilongjiang province, China, where tourists can walk the back-breaking difficult routes of former exiles while wearing handcuffs and prisoner uniforms, according to <em>South China Morning Post.</em></p>

<p>In an effort to increase tourism and revenue, the project, which is scheduled to begin in December, has generated a lot of discussion on Chinese social media.It is hoped that this creative package will significantly boost tourism numbers and revenues.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3285391/china-city-offers-torturous-exile-routes-visitors-boost-tourism-sparking-debate"><em>SCMP, </em></a>Mudanjiang city, located in the southeast of Heilongjiang, was home to Ningguta, an ancient military town and one of the most renowned locations for exile.Historical records indicate that over 1.5 million people were banished to Ningguta for serious crimes during the Qing dynasty (1644-1911).</p>

<p>Many prisoners faced long, gruelling journeys, with many perishing along the way, while survivors were often enslaved by local officials.Ningguta gained modern notoriety through the hit historical drama Empresses in the Palace, in which Emperor Yongzheng exiles his consort's family there.</p>

<p>On mainland social media, this experience of ancient punishment has received a lot of attention.</p>

<p>"I can't wait to go to Ningguta this winter and do a 'prisoner' hike," one Weibo online observer wrote in anticipation. It sounds like a great way to relieve tension.</p>

<p>"It's a creative way to promote local history and culture that appeals to young people," said another.</p>

<p>There are conflicting views also: "Many intellectuals and patriots were forcibly exiled from Ningguta, which was a tragic location in ancient China." This behaviour is insensitive to that traumatic past.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American comic and talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, who usually shows his audience the funny side of things, could not find his smile on the day Donald Trump was elected President of the US for a second time. The renowned TV host teared and choked up during his opening monologue of his nightly hour-long show 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' on ABC.</p>

<p>Calling it "A terrible night, last night" Mr Kimmel, visibly disturbed and in despair over Donald Trump's electoral win, said he tried a lot, but couldn't see anything positive from the US election result.</p>

<p>"Let's be honest, it was a terrible night last night. It was a terrible night for women, for children, for the hundreds of thousands of hardworking immigrants who make this country great," he said, emotionally choking briefly, as the live audience applauded to help cheer him up.</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="400" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fSiP2v9aqKw?si=QF52eDnHHuyd8ff4" title="YouTube video player" width="650"></iframe></p>

<p><small><strong><em>(Video Courtesy: YouTube - Access Hollywood)</em></strong></small></p>

<p>Mr Kimmel went on to say that "...terrible for healthcare, for our climate, for science, for journalism, for justice, for free speech... a terrible night for poor people, for the middle-class, for senior citizens, for social security.... for our allies in Ukraine," choking up again, but still continuing "For NATO, for the truth... terrible night for democracy, and for decency, and for everyone who voted against him... but guess what, it was a bad night for anyone who voted for him too - you just don't realise it yet..." as the audience applauded him again.</p>

<p>Standing in front of a backdrop that showed a usual American cityscape in total darkness, Mr Kimmel finally found his humour amid the gloom when he said "...and most of all, it was an absolute disaster of a night for Melania," as the audience burst into a fit of laughter.</p>

<p>He then gathered steam to roast President-elect Trump from his stage, before ending his monologue with "the only positive thing I could find".</p>

<p>"Maybe in the long run we, the people will realise that maybe this is what we needed for us all to wake up. Maybe the people who care so much about him need to find out how little he cares about them...maybe the only positive from this is that he will not be able to run for President again in 2028."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, another renowned talk show host and comedian, Stephen Colbert, who hosts the Late Show on CBS, also spoke about Trump's victory. He addressed the remark most journalists face that Donald Trump is good for more news or comic material, with a witty comeback.</p>

</div>

<p>"As a late night host, people often say to me 'C'mon...part of you would want Trump to win, because he gives you so much material to work with'.... well, no," he said, adding that "Noone tells the guy who cleans the bathroom, 'Wow, you must love it when someone has explosive diarrhea coz there is so much material for you to work with'," as the audience laughed and sniggered.</p>

<p>He left the audience in splits when he concluded his monologue by saying, "The first time Donald Trump was elected, he started off as a joke and ended up as a tragedy.... this time he is starting off as a tragedy; who knows how he'll end up... maybe a limerick? 'There once was a man who was orange... damn it!"</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Vietnamese father uncovered a long-buried truth after noticing his daughter's appearance bore no resemblance to either parent, according to<em> the South China Morning Post.</em> A DNA test revealed he was not her biological father. This revelation led to a journey uncovering a hospital mix-up, with the truth emerging when the daughter met another girl born on the same date at a new school.</p>

<p>However, as Lan grew into a teenager and became increasingly beautiful, he noticed she bore no resemblance to either him or his wife. Suspicion prompted him to conduct a DNA test, which confirmed that Lan was not his biological daughter.</p>

<p>The revelation led him to grow distant and cold towards his wife and daughter, and he often came home drunk.One night, after getting drunk, he confronted his wife with the DNA results and accused her of infidelity, reported <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3285560/vietnam-man-suspicious-too-pretty-daughter-not-his-shocked-birth-switch-accident"><em>SCMP.</em></a> However, Hong denied the allegations and eventually moved to the northern capital city of Hanoi with her daughter. The move forced Lan to transfer schools, a move that unexpectedly revealed the truth.</p>

<p>At a birthday party, a mother noticed Lan's striking resemblance to herself, suspecting a hospital mix-up. DNA tests confirmed Lan and her friend were switched at birth. The families now regularly spend time together and plan to reveal the truth to the girls, with legal action remaining undecided.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A section of women in the United States are "swearing off men". Reason? Donald Trump's win as the President.</p>

<p>With Donald Trump becoming the US President, fears have raised over the abortion rights of women, doubting if the Republican would make access to the procedure more uncertain. In 2022, Trump had celebrated the Supreme's Court's ruling that ended a nationwide right to abortion. However, over time, he has also said that he would leave the decision on abortion rights to the states rather than enact a federal ban.</p>

<p>Amid the rising fear, South Korea's '4B' movement has entered the US, with some women on social media saying that they are tired of awaiting what the future holds for their own bodily autonomy.</p>

<p>The '4B' movement - a radical feminism movement against patriarchy - origniated from South Korea around 2017-18, but gained recognition in 2019 on X (formerly known as Twitter). It began in response to high rates of violence against women.</p>

<p>The '4B' stands for four Koreans words beginning with "bi" (which translates to no). The words are: "bihon" means no heterosexual marriage, "bichulsan" (no childbirth), "biyeonae" (no dating), and "bisekseu" (no heterosexual sexual relationships).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The members of the movement refuse to date, marry, have sexual relations, or carry babies with men. By doing this, the women are pressing that if the violence or inequality against them does not stop, they will ensure that the birth rate will drop down.</p>

<p>The movement also functions as an online community where women engage in open discussion about navigating and envisioning a future without men. Women also use the platform to vent their frustrations and concerns about living in a conservative society.</p>

<p>"It's a new lifestyle focused on building safe communities, both online and in-person. What we want is not to be labeled simply as some man's wife or girlfriend, but to have the independence to be free from the societal expectations that often limit women's potential to be fully acknowledged as human beings," Haein Shim, a South Korean activist, told The Guardian.</p>

<h3><strong>What US women are saying on social media</strong></h3>

<p>The internet seems to be divided over the '4B' movement in US.</p>

<p>"Ladies, I'm being so fr when I say this, it's time to close off your wombs to males. This election proves now more than ever that they hate us and hate us proudly. do not reward them," a user wrote on X.</p>

<p>Another said, "Reminder that the 4B movement, and the separatist movement in general, isn't just about avoiding men-it's also about supporting and investing in women. Seek out relationships with women, women-owned businesses, women-made media, etc; surround yourself with women and our culture."</p>

<p>However, some people also claimed that the movement would never work in the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States has charged an Iranian man in connection with an alleged plot ordered by Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards Corps to assassinate President-elect Donald Trump, the Justice Department said on Friday.</p>

<p>In a statement, the department said that Farhad Shakeri had informed law enforcement "that he was tasked on October 7, 2024, with providing a plan to kill" Trump, the department said. Shakeri allegedly told law enforcement he had no plans to formulate a plan to kill Trump within the IRGC's timeline.</p>

<p>The department described Shakeri, 51, as an IRGC asset residing in Tehran. It said he immigrated to the US as a child and was deported in or about 2008 following a robbery conviction. Shakeri is at large and believed to be in Iran, the prosecutors said.</p>

<p>Two New York residents whom Shakeri had met in prison, Carlisle Rivera and Jonathan Loadholt, have also been charged for helping Shakeri plot to kill a US citizen of Iranian origin in New York, described as an outspoken critic of Iran's government who had previously been targeted for murder.</p>

<p>Prosecutors did not identify the target, but it matched the description of Masih Alinejad, a journalist and activist who has criticized Iran's head-covering laws for women. Four Iranians were charged in 2021 in connection with a plot to kidnap her, and in 2022 a man was arrested with a rifle outside her home.</p>

<p>Rivera and Loadholt have both been ordered detained pending trial. Their lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rescuers did not expect to find two-year-old Ali Khalifeh alive after an Israeli strike on southern Lebanon killed his entire family and left him trapped under the rubble for 14 hours.</p>

<p>Amputated, bandaged and hooked to a respirator in a hospital bed that was way too big for him, "Ali is the sole survivor of his family," said Hussein Khalifeh, his father's uncle.</p>

<p>The toddler's parents, sister and two grandmothers all perished in the strike on September 29, days after Israel intensified its attacks on Hezbollah militants.</p>

<p>The strike on Sarafand, some 15 kilometres (nine miles) south of the coastal city of Sidon, flattened an apartment complex and killed 15 people, many of them relatives, according to residents.</p>

<p>"Rescue workers had almost lost hope of finding anyone alive under the rubble," 45-year-old Khalifeh told AFP from the hospital in Sidon where his two-year-old relative was being treated.</p>

<p>But then "Ali appeared among debris in the shovel of the bulldozer, after we all thought he had died," he said.</p>

<p>"He emerged from the rubble, barely breathing, after 14 hours."</p>

<p>Israel has been at war with Hezbollah since late September, when it broadened its war focus from fighting Hamas militants in Gaza to securing its northern border with Lebanon.</p>

<p>An escalating Israeli air campaign, after nearly a year of low intensity cross-border fire, has killed more than 2,600 people across Lebanon since September 23, according to health ministry figures.</p>

<h3><strong>'Psychological scars'</strong></h3>

<p>Signs of the violence were apparent even at the hospital in Sidon where Ali was rushed to following the strike on Sarafand.</p>

<p>The toddler, under a medically induced coma after doctors amputated his right hand, has since been transferred to a medical facility in the capital Beirut where he is due to undergo pre-prosthetic surgery.</p>

<p>"Ali was sleeping on the couch at home when the strike hit. He is still asleep today... were are waiting to complete his surgeries before waking him up," said the relative Hussein Khalifeh.</p>

<p>Other family members were also fighting to stay alive after the Sarafand strike.</p>

<p>One of Khalifeh's nieces, 32-year-old Zainab, was trapped under the rubble for two hours before being rescued and transferred to the nearest hospital, said the man.</p>

<p>It was there that she was later informed that her parents, her husband and three children, aged between three and seven, had all been killed.</p>

<p>The strike left her with only one, severely injured eye.</p>

<p>Zainab said she "did not hear the sounds of the missiles that rained down on her family's home," according to Khalifeh.</p>

<p>"She only saw darkness and heard deafening screams," he said.</p>

<p>Ali Alaa El-Din, a doctor treating her, said that "the psychological scars that Zainab suffered are much greater than her physical injury".</p>

<p>He has also tended Zainab's sister Fatima, 30, who was wounded in the same strike.</p>

<p>Both had injuries "throughout their bodies, with fractures in the feet and damage to the lungs," said the doctor.</p>

<p>Medically, he added, "Zainab and Fatima's cases are not among the most difficult cases we have faced during the war, but they are the most severe from a psychological and human perspective."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The final state calls are coming in for the US presidential election, with President-elect Donald Trump at 301 electoral votes, well past the 270 needed for victory, and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris at 226, US networks said.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump and JD Vance's campaign promise has become a cause of major concern for immigrants, especially Indian-Americans, as it brings uncertainty about their children becoming naturalised US citizens.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump and JD Vance's campaign promise has become a cause of major concern for immigrants, especially Indian-Americans, as it brings uncertainty about their children becoming naturalised US citizens.</p>

<p>A naturalised citizen is a person who becomes a citizens of a country by virtue of being born in that nation, should they wish to exercise that option. Should such a person keep the citizenship of the country of their ethnicity, they can choose to become the citizen of the country of birth any time they want during their lifetime.</p>

<p>Donald Trump had vowed to curb naturalised citizenship. It was a part of his campaign document and a pledge he and Vance promised would be done on "Day 1".</p>

<p>What is expected is that much of the focus on 'Day 1' for Donald Trump and his deputy JD Vance will be over the issue of immigration.</p>

<p>During his election campaign, at almost each of his rallies Mr Trump had said that "On Day 1, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history." Planning big changes to US's immigration policy, Mr Trump doesn't just intend on targeting illegal immigrants, but also go after the legal process.</p>

<p>As per the document available on Donald Trump's campaign website he will sign an executive order on the first day of his presidency to curb immigration. The order will "Direct federal agencies to require that at least one parent be a US citizen or lawful permanent resident for their future children to become automatic US citizens."</p>

<p>This means that in future, children who are born in the US but neither of their parents is a US citizen or permanent resident (PR), may not be eligible for automatic citizenship via naturalisation.</p>

<p>Though the official figures are not known, it is estimated that the employment-based green card backlog from India had crossed the 1 million mark in the first quarter of 2023. The average wait time for a green card (US Citizenship) is more than 50 years.</p>

<p>It suggests that more than half-a-million young immigrants who moved to the US for study or work will likely die before they get their citizenship. It also means that nearly a quarter-million children, awaiting their citizenship, will cross the legal, permissible age of 21, beyond which, they would become illegal immigrants should they stay beyond that without an alternate visa - like a student visa.</p>

<p>Donald Trump's decision to curb naturalised citizenship will certainly invite litigation to his executive order as legal experts believe it is unconstitutional as it violates the 14th Amendment.</p>

<p>Section 1 of the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution states that "All persons born or naturalised in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."</p>

<p>However, the draft of the executive order claims that it has interpreted the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution correctly.</p>

<p>According to Pew Research's analysis of the 2022 US census, there are an estimated 4.8 million Indian-Americans who have made the US their home. Of these, 1.6 million Indian-Americans were born and raised in America, making them naturalised citizens.</p>

<p>Should Donald Trump sign the executive order, the courts will have to decide if the move indeed would be unconstitutional.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[A powerful X-class solar flare erupted, causing shortwave radio blackouts over the Atlantic, South America, and Africa.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Parts of the Atlantic Ocean, South America, and Africa had a shortwave radio blackout yesterday at 8:40 am ET (7:10 pm) on November 6 due to a strong solar flare, according to NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory. High-frequency radio signals were interfered with by this solar flare, demonstrating the effect that such occurrences can have on international communications.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/sdo">NASA's SDO, </a>which watches the Sun constantly, captured an image of the event. Such solar flares have the potential to disrupt global navigation systems, electrical power grids, and radio transmissions. Due to increased radiation exposure, they also pose risks to spacecraft, high-altitude aircraft, and astronauts.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/solarcycle25/2024/11/06/strong-solar-flare-erupts-from-sun-26/"><em>NASA,</em></a> Solar flares are powerful bursts of energy. Flares and solar eruptions can impact radio communications, electric power grids, navigation signals, and pose risks to spacecraft and astronauts. This flare is classified as an X2.3 class flare. X-class denotes the most intense flares, while the number provides more information about its strength.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;day=05&amp;month=11&amp;year=2024"><em>Spaceweather.com, </em></a>the wait is on for scientists to receive data from the coronagraph on the joint NASA/European Space Agency Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft to determine if a coronal mass ejection (CME) will impact Earth. CMEs are made up of magnetic fields and plasma plumes, and if they reach our planet, they can lead to a geomagnetic storm that could possibly result in auroras, also called the aurora borealis or the northern lights.</p>

<p>According to<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.space.com/the-universe/sun/sun-erupts-with-powerful-x2-3-solar-flare-triggers-radio-blackouts-video"><em> Space.com,</em></a> solar flares are ranked on a 4-level classification scale, with each class ten times stronger than the one below it. X-class flares come in as the most powerful, with the class down being M-class. The number that accompanies the letter represents the strength of the individual flare, which in this case was a 2.3.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>World leaders are set to congregate in Baku, Azerbaijan, as it hosts the UN's 29th climate summit, COP29 (Conference of the Parties), from November 11 to 22. The key agenda before the Baku climate summit is to increase the scale of climate finance for developing countries. It is also being referred to as the 'climate finance COP', as its main goal is to decide how much funding should be allocated each year to help developing countries cope with climate-related costs.</p>

<p>This summit comes at a critical moment, as the world continues its multilateral efforts to address climate change. Since its first meeting in Berlin, Germany, in 1995, the goal of COP has been to curb global warming to below 1.5°C (2.7°F) above pre-industrial levels to avoid catastrophic damage to the planet. Sadly, the world continues to ignore this limit. There is an expectation that countries will explore more rigorous methods for emission reduction.</p>

<p>This dialogue is expected to be particularly challenging due to the leadership transition in the US. President-elect Donald Trump has a poor track record on climate action, having pushed for fossil fuel expansion and abandoned the Paris Agreement during his first term. He has promised to continue with the same policies during his election campaign. Let's examine the key themes on which COP29 is scheduled to deliberate at the Baku summit.</p>

<h2><strong>Meeting Financial Targets</strong></h2>

<p>The NCQG (New Collective Quantified Goal) is the main deliverable this year. It refers to the new annual climate financing target, which is intended to replace the current $100 billion pledge made in 2009, set to expire at the end of this year. This funding was provided by wealthy countries to support climate initiatives in poorer nations.</p>

<p>The US and other developed countries want to broaden the contributor base, but developing nations insist this is outside the NCQG's scope. Other issues include determining which countries should receive financial aid—should it be all developing nations, or only the most vulnerable—and what form that aid should take. Developing countries are keen to avoid debt financing, as this exposes them to further climate risks.</p>

<p>At Egypt's COP27, wealthy nations agreed to help poorer countries by bearing the costs of climate-driven disasters like extreme floods, storms, or droughts. About $660 million has been raised for the newly created Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage, based in the Philippines. Climate-vulnerable countries are expecting wealthier nations to contribute more to this fund. “The discussions on the NCQG, still debating who should receive funds, how much, and in what form—with hardly any progress in the lead-up to COP29—will make reaching an agreement a real uphill task. Hopefully, no new funds will be set up at this COP, and discussions will instead focus on mobilising the agreed funds,” says Santhosh Jayaram, Adjunct Professor of Practice at the Amrita School for Sustainable Futures, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.</p>

<p>The level of climate finance will directly impact the ambition reflected in the NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions) that countries are expected to submit early next year, particularly for developing nations. Developing countries are reluctant to commit to more ambitious targets without first securing clear financial support through the NCQG. “At COP28 in Dubai, it was evident that the world was off track from the targets set in Paris. COP29 is intended to secure the finance needed so that at COP30, negotiations can move forward with a new set of NDCs aligned with the agreements,” says Jayaram.</p>

<h2><strong>Reducing Emissions and Increasing Green Energy</strong></h2>

<p>As the host country, Azerbaijan has promised a range of commitments for investing in renewable energy, including a Global Energy Storage and Grids Pledge aimed at augmenting energy infrastructure and storage capabilities worldwide. The country has also made an ambitious Hydrogen Declaration and a Declaration on Reducing Methane Emissions from Organic Waste. Another initiative, the Green Digital Action Declaration, aims to reduce emissions in the information and communications sectors.</p>

<p>However, there is no direct reference in the agenda to a shift away from fossil fuels, which was a key issue in last year's COP28 in Dubai. The dilution of the agenda on fossil fuels is a cause for concern, particularly given Azerbaijan's vast oil resources. Other countries, including the US, Namibia, and Guyana, have also approved new areas for oil and gas production.</p>

<p>This is the second time that Azerbaijan, a major oil-producing nation where the world's first oil fields were developed, is hosting the summit and discussing a future without fossil fuels. Last year, Dubai's COP28 presidency saw another major petrostate host one of the largest climate conferences in the world. COP29 is also expected to formulate rules for international carbon trading, an issue that has been stalled for years. This would allow countries to trade carbon credits to meet their national climate targets. The business community will be looking for the establishment of rules that guarantee transparency and environmental integrity in projects registered under the PACM (Paris Agreement Crediting Mechanism).</p>

<h2><strong>Fallout of a Trump Victory</strong></h2>

<p>Trump has been openly critical of Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which supported the Biden administration's energy policies through tax incentives and investments in renewable energy. A second Trump presidency would likely signal a shift in US energy policy, favouring fossil fuels over renewables.<br />
The re-election of Trump, who has previously dismissed climate change as a ‘hoax', is unlikely to be good news for COP. During his campaign, Trump announced that he might cancel all mitigation measures the US had taken under President Joe Biden after rejoining the Paris Agreement in 2021. A US exit from the 2015 accord would be a major blow to global efforts to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.</p>

<p>Trump has also been vocal about climate finance, calling it a ‘one-sided deal' in which developed nations bear the cost while countries like China contribute little. The fear of the US— the world's second-largest emitter— withdrawing from global climate efforts is a real concern. As the world continues to suffer from the devastating impacts of climate change, the US must reconsider its stance and take a leadership role on climate and environmental issues.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indonesia's Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki erupted several times on Friday, belching volcanic ash that rose up to 10 km (32,800 ft) into the sky, officials said, following a big eruption on Sunday night that killed nine people.</p>

<p>The eruption on the island of Flores in the province of East Nusa Tenggara has damaged more than 2,000 houses and caused thousands to evacuate.</p>

<p>Abdul Muhari, spokesperson for the country's disaster mitigation agency, said the eruptions were "pretty significant" due to ash rains and sand-falls that reached far into the surrounding areas.</p>

<p>Hadi Wijaya, chief of Indonesia's volcanology agency, said one eruption on Friday produced a towering ash column that reached eight km to 10 km high, adding volcanic matter and hot gas travelled across all directions from the volcano.</p>

<p>Friday's eruption produced the highest column since the first eruption on Sunday, Abdul said.</p>

<p>About 6,000 of the more than 16,000 people living in areas nearest the volcano had been evacuated to other villages, said Heronimus Lamawuran, a Flores government official.</p>

<p>Abdul said supplies of food and masks for evacuees in several evacuation spots are enough and the situation is under control.</p>

<p>Indonesia sits on the Pacific "Ring of Fire", an area of high seismic activity atop various tectonic plates.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's dream of transporting humans to Mars will become a bigger national priority under the administration of US President-elect Donald Trump, sources said, signaling big changes for NASA's moon program and a boost for Musk's SpaceX.</p>

<p>NASA's Artemis program, which aims to use SpaceX's Starship rocket to put humans on the moon as a proving ground for later Mars missions, is expected to focus more on the Red Planet under Trump and target uncrewed missions there this decade, according to four people familiar with Trump's burgeoning space policy agenda.</p>

<p>Targeting Mars with spacecraft built for astronauts is not only more ambitious than focusing on the moon, but is also fraught with risk and potentially more expensive.</p>

<p>Musk, who danced onstage at a Trump rally wearing an "Occupy Mars" T-shirt in October, spent $119 million on Trump's White House bid and has successfully elevated space policy at an unusual time in a presidential transition.</p>

<p>In September, weeks after Musk endorsed Trump, the latter told reporters that the moon was a "launching pad" for his ultimate goal to reach Mars.</p>

<p>"At a minimum, we're going to get a more realistic Mars plan, you'll see Mars being set as an objective," said Doug Loverro, a space industry consultant who once led NASA's human exploration unit under Trump, who served as US president from 2017 to 2021.</p>

<p>SpaceX, Musk and the Trump campaign did not immediately return requests for comment. A NASA spokeswoman said it "wouldn't be appropriate to speculate on any changes with the new administration."</p>

<p>Plans could still change, the sources added, as the Trump transition team takes shape in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Trump launched the Artemis program in 2019 during his first term and it was one of the few initiatives maintained under the administration of President Joe Biden. Trump space advisers want to revamp a program they will argue has languished in their absence, the sources said.</p>

<p>Musk, who also owns electric-vehicle maker Tesla and brain-chip startup Neuralink, has made slashing government regulation and trimming down bureaucracy another core basis of his Trump support.</p>

<p>For space, the sources said, Musk's deregulation desires are likely to trigger changes at the Federal Aviation Administration's commercial space office, whose oversight of private rocket launches has frustrated Musk for slowing down SpaceX's Starship development.</p>

<p>The FAA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>NASA under Trump, the sources said, is likely to favor fixed-price space contracts that shift greater responsibility onto private companies and scale back over-budget programs that have strained the Artemis budget.</p>

<p>That could spell trouble for the only rocket NASA owns, the Space Launch System rocket (SLS), whose roughly $24 billion development since 2011 has been led by Boeing and Northrop Grumman. Cancelling the program, some say, would be difficult since it would cost thousands of jobs and leave the US even more dependent on SpaceX.</p>

<p>Boeing and Northrop did not immediately return a request for comment.</p>

<p>Musk, whose predictions have sometimes proven overly ambitious, said in September that SpaceX will land Starship on Mars in 2026 and a crewed mission will follow in four years' time. Trump has said at campaign rallies that he has discussed these ideas with Musk.</p>

<p>Many industry experts see this timeline as improbable.</p>

<p>"Is it possible for Elon to put a Starship on the surface of Mars in a one-way mission by the end of Trump's term? Absolutely, he certainly could do that," said Scott Pace, the top space policy official during Trump's first term.</p>

<p>"Is that a manned mission on Mars? No," Pace added. "You have to walk before you run."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian intelligence services were likely behind a series of parcels that exploded in courier depots across Europe, Polish prosecutors said on Friday, pointing the finger at Moscow in a case officials say could have caused an air disaster.</p>

<p>Western officials have previously said that Russia has tried to destabilise allies of Ukraine with acts of sabotage. The explosions in courier depots in Britain, Germany and Poland in July had the potential to mark a serious escalation by causing an explosion on an aircraft.</p>

<p>Security officials have said that the parcels were part of a plot that ultimately aimed to trigger explosions on cargo flights to the United States and Canada.</p>

<p>"The evidence collected in the case indicates a high probability that the discussed acts of sabotage... were inspired by Russian special services," Polish Prosecutor's Office spokesperson Przemyslaw Nowak said in an emailed statement.</p>

<p>The Russian embassy in Warsaw did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Russia has previously denied involvement.</p>

<p>Nowak said Polish authorities are searching for two Russians and have detained four Ukrainian citizens as part of the investigation.</p>

<p>Polish prosecutors said in October they had detained four people and were searching for two others in relation to the packages, but did not reveal the nationalities of those accused of involvement.</p>

<p>In October prosecutors said they were investigating the role of "foreign intelligence", without explicitly naming Russia.</p>

<p>"Intensive activities are being carried out to identify the remaining individuals involved in the above international group," Nowak said in the statement sent on Friday.</p>

<p>"These actions are undertaken in cooperation with law enforcement agencies of other European Union countries."</p>

<p>He said that the exploding parcels had been sent from the Lithuanian capital Vilnius.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Ministry on Friday termed as fake a 'secretly issued memo' that has surfaced on social media and that falsely attempts to link Indian diplomats abroad with violent crimes.</p>

<p>No such memo has been issued by the Government of India, the External Affairs Ministry said.</p>

<p>"The said GoI communication is fake," the External Publicity and Public Diplomacy Division (XP Division), of the Ministry of External Affairs said.</p>

<p>The April 2023 dated fake memo purportedly from former Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra asks Indian diplomats to "cultivate" Indian diaspora groups in Canada "as a vital force in the street confrontations with Sikh extremists".</p>

<p>It goes on to mention names of various groupings of the diaspora including the Indo-Canada Association (ICA), Indo-Canada Chamber of Commerce (ICCC), TiE Silicon Valley (TiE SV), and USIBC amongst others.</p>

<p>This comes amid the ongoing India-Canada standoff over India's allegations that Canada acts as a safe haven for Khalistani separatists. Last week devotees and other people were attacked at the premises of a Hindu temple in Brampton, Ontario. India has condemned the violence and urged Canada to provide security to Indian diplomats.</p>

<p>Last month, India "strongly" rejected a diplomatic communication from Canada suggesting that the Indian High Commissioner and other diplomats were "persons of interest" in Nijjar's killing and termed it as "preposterous imputations" and part of the political agenda of the Justin Trudeau government.</p>

<p>Following this, then High Commissioner Verma and five other diplomats were recalled by New Delhi.</p>

<p>Ties between India and Canada soured after Mr Trudeau alleged in the Canadian Parliament last year that he has "credible allegations" of India's hand in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.</p>

<p>India denied all the allegations, calling them "absurd" and "motivated" and has accused Canada of giving space to extremist and anti-India elements in their country.</p>

<p>Nijjar, who was designated a terrorist by India's National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed outside a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prince William has described the past year in which his wife Catherine and his father, Britain's head of state King Charles III, each battled cancer as "brutal" and probably the "hardest" of his life.</p>

<p>The heir to the British throne was speaking to reporters on Thursday at the end of a four-day visit to South Africa for his Earthshot prize initiative.</p>

<p>Buckingham Palace in February announced that Charles, 75, had been diagnosed with an undisclosed cancer and would withdraw from public life to undergo treatment.</p>

<p>The following month his daughter-in-law Catherine, Princess of Wales, 42, revealed that she too had been diagnosed with cancer and was undergoing chemotherapy.</p>

<p>"Honestly, it's been dreadful. It's probably been the hardest year in my life," William said.</p>

<p>"So, trying to get through everything else and keep everything on track has been really difficult."</p>

<p>Both Charles and Catherine have since made limited returns to public duties, although Charles is still undergoing treatment.</p>

<p>Catherine said in September that she had completed her chemotherapy and was looking forward to undertaking more engagements "when I can".</p>

<p>"I'm so proud of my wife, I'm proud of my father, for handling the things that they have done," William added.</p>

<p>"But from a personal family point of view, it's been, yeah, it's been brutal," he said.</p>

<p>This year's awards ceremony for William's Earthshot prize was held in Cape Town on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The initiative honours projects seeking novel solutions to the challenges facing the world's nature and climate.</p>

<p>William is also committed to a five-year programme, Homewards, launched by his philanthropic foundation to tackle homelessness in the UK.</p>

<p>When told he appeared relaxed, William said he "couldn't be less relaxed this year".</p>

<p>"It's more a case of just crack on and you've got to keep going," he said.</p>

<p>"I enjoy my work and I enjoy pacing myself, and keeping sure that I have got time for my family too," he added.</p>

<p>In addition to health problems, the royal family has this year faced continuing tensions surrounding William's estranged brother Harry.</p>

<p>Harry's ties with his family have been increasingly fraught since he and wife Meghan quit royal life and moved to California in 2020.</p>

<p>William and Harry used to be close -- a bond that was forged with the death of their mother Princess Diana in 1997. But according to British media reports, they have not spoken to each other in two years.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

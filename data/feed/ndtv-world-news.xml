       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former employees at one of China's best-known comic studios recently exposed the harsh working conditions at the workplace, where they have lived together in a "farm-like" flat for years, facing overwork and sleep deprivation. A-soul is one of China's most renowned manga studios. It is situated in a rural area of southeastern Beijing and it currently employs more than 70 staff members. In recent months, several comic artists have come forward, accusing the studio of poor working conditions, claiming that they were overworked, sleep-deprived and verbally abused, the <em>South China Morning Post</em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In mid-September, a former A-soul employee, known online as Zhenliubao, took to the Chinese social media platform Weibo, accusing the studio of "shattering" his dream. The ex-worker reportedly claimed that since 2008, dozens of comic artists have lived in dormitories converted from a livestock factory, sharing communal spaces and using unisex bathrooms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We were never allowed to open the curtains, forcing us to work in a dark environment for years," he wrote, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3281168/slave-factory-china-comic-artists-expose-farm-working-conditions-famed-studio" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>SCMP</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The former employee added that the boss insisted on being called "brother" and prohibited them from reading books or seeking medical treatment when they were unwell. He also alleged that employees were manually controlled through verbal abuse and indoctrination, keeping them in a state of constant overwork. The salaries were also split equally and no social security benefits were provided, he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his online post, Zhenliubao revealed that the studio head is Liu Zhi. He mentioned seeking legal assistance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another former employee, identified as Laogui, also reported being overworked and sleep-deprived. He reportedly claimed that he was often forced to draw 12 to 14 pages a day instead of the usual four to six pages. "I have gone grey in my twenties and face immense mental pressure daily," he wrote in his online post.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, as soon as the controversy surrounding A-soul studio went viral on social media, current A-soul employee Liu Ke, who was ranked ninth on the 2013 China Comic Artists' Rich List, released a statement supporting the studio.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The artist claimed that the poor working conditions were a result of the studio being "extremely poor" at that time. He also claimed that before the studio was formally registered, he and other employees "voluntarily" pooled their salaries to keep the team afloat. He also denied the accusations of forced labour, per <em>SCMP</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A-soul is a family of ambitious comic artists built from scratch. Creating a utopia requires the spirit of sacrifice," Mr Liu asserted.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on social media, users slammed the company. "A-soul's actions violate human rights! This is a slave factory, not a place where artists can pursue their dreams," one user commented.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"If what Zhenliubao has stated is true, the studio has violated labour laws. Gather the evidence and take them to court. Justice will prevail," another added.</p>

<p>&nbsp;"Current and former employees have conflicting accounts. Let's wait for the authorities to investigate before jumping to conclusions," suggested a third user.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The 2024 U.S. Presidential Election is being keenly watched around the world, both for the outcome and for the consequences. One month out, the polls suggest a virtual tie. Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, had seen an increase in popularity after donning her party's official nomination in August. But over the past two weeks, a series of events - a devastating hurricane in North Carolina, growing tensions in the Middle East, the Vice Presidential debate, and concerns about recurring inflation - appear to be shifting the momentum back toward former President Donald Trump. Much could still happen over the next month, but ultimately, the outcome will be determined by seven 'swing states' - Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, and Wisconsin - and each could be decided by only a few tens of thousands of voters. Although Democrats are likely to win more votes overall (as they have in seven of the last eight presidential elections), their ability to ensure higher voter turnout among their supporters in these swing states may well turn out to be the decisive factor.</p>

<h2><strong>Impressions Over Issues</strong></h2>

<p>This election campaign is being waged less on issues and more on impressions and attitudes. Trump is playing on dissatisfaction with the bureaucratic state, a scepticism of international entanglements, lower taxes for businesses and investors, curbs on immigration, and social conservatism, although he has attempted to dilute the latter to appeal more to moderate voters. Harris has positioned herself as appealing to youth, urban voters, ethnic minorities, responsible governance, and progressive social causes. Their competing worldviews reflect a rigid divide in American society across age and class lines, ethnic groups, and especially urban and rural constituencies, across which Republicans and Democrats have consolidated deeply entrenched if 'big tent' coalitions. Suburban voters, white women, second-generation Hispanics, and union workers are among the constituencies in which Republicans and Democrats are still battling to sway opinion.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The 2024 US presidential election outcome will matter to India, although less directly perhaps than it will to some other countries and regions. For US adversaries (China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea) the election will determine negotiations over future relations. For US allies (NATO members in Europe, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Australia), the election could signal changes to US force posture, assistance, and commitment. For those actively involved in current or prospective conflicts (Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan), the outcome will determine the nature of US military aid. And for major trade partners (Mexico, ASEAN, the UK), the election could have deep ramifications for their economies.</p>

<h2><strong>India Will Be Affected, But Not Directly</strong></h2>

<p>India is less directly affected than many of these countries, not being an adversary, a treaty ally, or a country dependent on military or financial assistance from the United States. To be sure, India is the United States' ninth-largest trade partner and enjoys about a $30 billion trade surplus, but its economy is, at present, less dependent on manufacturing exports than some other large emerging markets, such as Mexico or Vietnam. While the direct implications for India might be less than for others, the 2024 US presidential election will undoubtedly have indirect effects on India.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Should Trump be elected, India will have to confront some difficult negotiations over trade and immigration. Trump and his economic advisors have been clear that they will impose tariffs on countries they believe are engaging in unfair trade practices, especially China. But India, which enjoys a trade surplus, will also be subjected to some, resulting in retaliatory measures by New Delhi. Questions remain about the degree to which a second Trump administration can refashion trade policy without negative repercussions for the US economy - particularly for inflation. Moreover, Trump's advisors have pledged to stem immigration, especially by undocumented individuals, which may affect Indians too. Trump is also likely to impose restrictions on employment and student visas and cut funding for processing, contributing further to backlogs and delays. This will have implications for a variety of Indian businesses in the United States.</p>

<h2><strong>China Is Still The Big Question</strong></h2>

<p>For both Trump and Harris, whose views on foreign policy are still inchoate beyond a broad continuation of incumbent Joe Biden's approach, a primary determinant of their outlook will be their policy towards China. While Trump's national security, foreign policy, and trade advisors are overwhelmingly hawkish on China - suggesting a confrontational and competitive approach - some of his donors and financial associates have advocated for a more cooperative attitude and a cooling of US tensions with Beijing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Harris has to contend both with hardening national security and trade impulses, as also with a progressive agenda among some Democrats that seeks to disassociate the United States from international competition and conflict. Progressives - as well as veterans of the Obama administration who hope to return to influence under Harris - are also more likely to prioritise human rights over a balance of power in foreign policy.</p>

<h2><strong>A Lot Would Depend On The Supporting Casts</strong></h2>

<p>Ultimately, both Trump and Harris's approaches to China - and, by extension, international affairs - will be determined by their selection, as President, of key advisors. The main Cabinet-level positions - U.S. Secretary of State, Defense, and Treasury, National Security Adviser, and U.S. Trade Representative - as well as second- and third-level political appointees will have an opportunity to set the tone for U.S. foreign policy for the next four years. Around Trump, figures such as Robert O'Brien and Robert Lighthizer are expected to play critical roles. The composition of a Harris foreign policy team is more uncertain, but it will likely be drawn from both Biden and Obama-era officials. Both Harris and Trump may also bring into their cabinets senior U.S. Senators, although that will be determined by margins in the Senate after this November's election.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
For all these reasons, developments of the next month - and the transition period between November's election and the next president's inauguration in January - will be observed carefully, in India and around the world.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Turkish Airlines pilot died after collapsing mid-flight, forcing the Turkish national carrier to make an emergency landing in New York, the airline said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The plane had taken off from the western US coastal city of Seattle on Tuesday evening, airline spokesman Yahya Ustun wrote on X, formerly Twitter.</p>

<p>"The pilot of our Airbus 350... flight TK204 from Seattle to Istanbul collapsed during the flight," he wrote.</p>

<p>"After an unsuccessful attempt to give first aid, the flight crew of another pilot and a co-pilot decided to make an emergency landing, but he died before landing."</p>

<p>The 59-year-old pilot, who had worked for Turkish Airlines since 2007, had passed a medical examination in March, which gave no indication of any health problems, Ustun wrote.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple in Malaysia is being praised online for gifting Apple iPhones to their two domestic helpers. According to the <em>South China Morning Post</em>, the couple, identified as Jeff Leong and his wife Inthira Kalanjiam, gifted brand-new iPhones to their two maids to thank them for their dedicated service over the years. The pair, who share their daily life and travel experiences on their YouTube channel Jeff &amp; Inthira, released a video of them surprising their two maids with the new phones.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3280511/malaysia-couple-win-online-praise-gifting-domestic-workers-iphones-years-service" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Post</em></a>, the family employs two Indonesian domestic helpers, Sri and Neneng, who have been with them for two years. They handle household chores, cook, and care for the couple's young children. "We give the latest Iphone 16 as a surprise to the maid at home! Their reaction?!" the couple titled the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Of68eMxyOo">YouTube video</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The couple's daughter Xixi also joined in on the surprise. In the video, both helpers squeal with excitement. "This is unbelievable! Thank you so much, madam and sir," one of the maids exclaims. The couple then express their gratitude saying, "You are no longer just the domestic helpers, you have become a part of our family".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking to <em>SCMP</em>, Ms Kalanjiam said some domestic workers in Malaysia are not allowed to own phones to prevent them from running away. She said that her domestic helpers are free to cook for themselves at home and have plenty of leisure time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Everyone deserves to be treated equally, no matter their job. My helpers are parents too, working hard to support their children, there is no reason to be unkind to them," Ms Kalanjiam told the outlet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Many middle-class employers face a lot of stress from work and may unintentionally take it out on their helpers. Treat them well, and they'll give back, kindness goes both ways," Mr Leong added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on social media, the couple's gesture has been praised. "I was almost moved to tears along with the maids. Thumbs ups for this kind and compassionate couple!" commented one user.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Not everyone is lucky enough to have employers like Leong and Kalanjiam. Most are disrespected and overworked, which is heartbreaking," said another.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[With just four weeks before the November 5 presidential election, the battle for Erie County - a historically must-win county in a must-win state - demonstrates the urgency of identifying and contacting individual voters.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The command center for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign in one of the most hotly contested counties in the most important election battleground state of Pennsylvania sits in a small room of a strip-mall office rented by Erie County's Republican Party.</p>

<p>The otherwise sleepy office comes to life a couple times a week when the two-person staff hosts the volunteer network the campaign calls Trump Force 47.</p>

<p>A few miles away in a bustling office in downtown Erie, paid staff and volunteers on Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign make phone calls, press new campaign buttons and organize watch parties and phone banking. A chalkboard keeps score of door-knocking: 12,000 households so far toward a goal of 20,000, or nearly one of five in the county.</p>

<p>With just four weeks before the November 5 presidential election, the battle for Erie County - a historically must-win county in a must-win state - demonstrates the urgency of identifying and contacting individual voters in a campaign that remains stubbornly close, according to campaign staff and volunteers for both campaigns.</p>

<p>While the Harris campaign is using its sizable cash advantage and newfound enthusiasm to build a towering ground-game operation aimed at mobilizing supporters and identifying new voters, the Trump campaign is focused on infrequent voters and betting on a voter registration drive that has cut into the traditional Democratic advantage.</p>

<p>Harris and the Democratic Party raised $361 million in August compared to Trump and the Republicans' $130 million, and she spent nearly three times as much as her opponent that month, federal financial disclosures show.</p>

<p>Reuters interviewed some 40 supporters, campaign staff, volunteers and voters who said that Harris' ground game advantage could test whether brick and mortar campaigns still prove useful in campaigns that are defined by viral moments, influencers and social media ad wars.</p>

<p>"Trump and his team appear to be banking on the power of his personal pull," said Chris Borick, a pollster and political science professor at Pennsylvania's Muhlenberg College.</p>

<p>"Harris and the Democrats are investing deeply in a more traditional ground game here and thus this election will be a test of dramatically different strategies."</p>

<p>The volunteers and voters also described rising tensions as the campaigns dump millions of dollars on divisive digital and television ads, robo calls, text messages and door-knocking.</p>

<p>"I've been pretty bombarded with mail, phone calls and texts," said Erin Miller, 38, a bartender and mother of six who recently moved to the state from Colorado and has yet to vote locally in a presidential election, making her a prime target for the campaigns.</p>

<p>With 19 electoral votes, Pennsylvania is the biggest prize among the battleground states that will decide the election.</p>

<p>Erie County, a blue-collar region with 177,000 registered voters, has voted with the winning presidential candidate for the last four elections.</p>

<p>Biden won Erie County in 2020 by less than 1,500 votes, or 1.03 percentage points, an even closer margin than his 1.2 percentage point win in Pennsylvania overall. In 2016, Trump won Erie County over Hillary Clinton by fewer than 2,000 votes.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign and the Democratic Party have three offices in Erie County and eight paid staff along with more than 300 volunteers.</p>

<p>"It's the bellwether part of it. It's the mere fact that this particular city, in this particular state, could ultimately decide who's president and they know it," said Marie Troyer, 60, a retired teacher who got a job on the campaign answering phones and managing volunteers.</p>

<p><strong>BOOTS ON THE GROUND</strong></p>

<p>Despite the ground game advantage, the Harris campaign has found it hard work to mobilize Black voters who make up about 16% of the city's population, especially Black men, according to Reuters interviews.</p>

<p>Howard Pratchett, 48, a barber, said he plans to vote for Trump because he is more "factual" than Harris. "We don't care about LBGT rights. We don't care about, you know, abortion rights. We're not worried about that. They don't offer anything to the straight Black male voters," Pratchett said.</p>

<p>Monty Davis, 51, who runs a local youth program, said he appreciates President Joe Biden's efforts to lower costs and plans to vote for Harris. But he warned the energy among the Black community is not as high as it was with Presidents Barack Obama or Biden.</p>

<p>"It's just not that intense," Davis said.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign's two paid staffers in Erie also oversee two other counties, according to Erie County Republican Chairman Tom Eddy.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign and local Republicans declined to say how many volunteers they have in the county, but local officials conceded they have fewer than the Democrats.</p>

<p>As in other battleground states, the Trump camp is relying on deep-pocketed outside groups - like billionaire Elon Musk's America PAC - and a much looser network of supporters and volunteers to mobilize voters.</p>

<p>Since 2015, when Trump emerged as a leader in Republican politics, Republicans and outside groups have significantly narrowed the Democratic advantage in voting registrations in Erie and in Pennsylvania overall.</p>

<p>In 2015, Democrats enjoyed a roughly 33,000 voter registration advantage in Erie County, but that has been whittled down to 10,000, according to current county election records.</p>

<p>Statewide, Democrats have a roughly 338,400 voter registration advantage over Republicans, down from the commanding 892,624 advantage Democrats held in 2016, state voter data shows.</p>

<p>Sam Talerico, the county's Democratic chairman, conceded the Republican surge in registrations is unwelcome news.</p>

<p>"We certainly don't like to see those registration numbers converge, but that's the bad news. The good news is, you know, I still think we have an advantage with independents turning our way, and that's making a difference," he said.</p>

<p>Republicans also are banking on Trump's frequent visits - five rallies over three campaigns in Erie, including two visits this election. The rallies represent mobilizing opportunities as organizers register voters and collect cell phone numbers and email information.</p>

<p>Harris will make her first visit to Erie on October 14. Her running mate Tim Walz visited in September.</p>

<p>And then there's Trump Force 47, the volunteer network that knocks on the doors of infrequent voters to determine whether they plan to vote, and for whom. Volunteers win awards, such as hats and sweaters, for knocking on more doors.</p>

<p>"We are not trying to persuade anyone. It's more just that the campaign is trying to make sure that people who are already inclined to vote for Trump get out and vote," said volunteer Justin Berkheimer, 39, who works at a group home for people with mental disabilities.</p>

<p><strong>A HEATED CAMPAIGN</strong></p>

<p>For both campaigns the intensity of the fight for Erie has spilled over into threats, antagonism and uncomfortable conversations, volunteers said.</p>

<p>A half-dozen die-hard Trump fans told Reuters they are uncomfortable being seen as public supporters of the former president.</p>

<p>That's a departure from 2016 when Erie was flooded with Trump signs, according to local officials and volunteers.</p>

<p>Patrick Fuller, 50, a credit union employee who said he has knocked on more than 2,000 doors for Trump this election, said he leaves his red MAGA hat at home to avoid confrontation.</p>

<p>"A lot of people are afraid to get involved, because they are afraid that somebody will swear at them or threaten them," Fuller said.</p>

<p>Other volunteers said they had their cars spit on for displaying Trump bumper stickers.</p>

<p>County Democrats said they ran into tensions when they pushed into rural areas, opening up a satellite office in a part of the county that Trump won with 72% of the vote in 2020.</p>

<p>Volunteer Kelly Chelton, 62, described a man lunging at a volunteer because he was angry about the large wooden sign reading: "Christians Against Trump."</p>

<p>"He came in looking for a fight," Chelton said. "He asked how do you know that Trump isn't Christian." She added: "He was just screaming and yelling."</p>

<p>The county party later installed video security cameras, Chelton said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia on Wednesday convicted in absentia a former US Marine who fought for Ukraine after spending over two years in a Russian prison before being released in a swap.</p>

<p>Trevor Reed "voluntarily joined the Ukrainian army as a mercenary on July 25, 2023", Russia's investigative committee said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The court has sentenced him to 14 years and six months," it said.</p>

<p>Reed was a Texas university student in 2019 when he travelled to Russia with his Russian girlfriend.</p>

<p>He was arrested for assaulting law enforcement officers after getting drunk, and was sentenced to nine years in prison.</p>

<p>He was released in April 2022 after the White House <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-war-us-marine-in-russia-russia-swaps-ex-us-marine-trevor-reed-for-russian-pilot-jailed-in-us-2925553" target="_blank">negotiated an exchange</a> for Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot and drug smuggler sentenced to 20 years in prison by an American court.</p>

<p>On July 26, 2023, the US State Department said Reed had been wounded during fighting in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Russia's Investigative Committee said he had been fighting in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>On Monday, a Russian court sentenced a 72-year-old US citizen accused of fighting as a mercenary on the side of Ukraine to nearly seven years in prison.</p>

<p>Stephen Hubbard had been in custody for more than two years and was sentenced after a trial held behind closed doors.</p>

<p>Several Westerners, including Americans, are currently imprisoned in Russia.</p>

<p>Among them is <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/guilty-of-high-treason-russia-jails-us-origin-ballet-dancer-for-12-years-6343633" target="_blank">Ksenia Karelina</a>, a US-Russian national sentenced to 12 years in prison in August for donating around $50 to a Ukrainian organisation.</p>

<p>Washington accuses Moscow of imprisoning US nationals to ensure the liberation of Russian agents held abroad in prisoner exchanges.</p>

<p>Russia and the West carried out the biggest such swap since the Cold War on August 1 of this year.</p>

<p>It saw the freeing of US reporter Evan Gershkovich as well as several Russian opposition figures in exchange for Russian agents, including a killer convicted in Germany.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists David Baker, Demis Hassabis and John Jumper won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, the award-giving body said on Wednesday, for their work on the structure of proteins.</p>

<p>The prize, widely regarded as among the most prestigious in the scientific world, is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and is worth 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.1 million).</p>

<p>"One of the discoveries being recognised this year concerns the construction of spectacular proteins. The other is about fulfilling a 50-year-old dream: predicting protein structures from their amino acid sequences," the academy said in a statement.</p>

<p>Half the prize was awarded to Baker "for computational protein design" while the other half was shared by Hassabis and Jumper "for protein structure prediction", the academy said.</p>

<p>The third award to be handed out every year, the chemistry prize follows those for medicine and physics announced earlier this week.</p>

<p>The Nobel prizes were established in the will of dynamite inventor and wealthy businessman Alfred Nobel and are awarded to "those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind".</p>

<p>First handed out in 1901, 15 years after Nobel's death, it is awarded for achievements in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace. Recipients in each category share the prize sum that has been adjusted over the years.</p>

<p>The economics prize is a later addition funded by the Swedish central bank.</p>

<p>Chemistry, close to Alfred Nobel's heart and the discipline most applicable to his own work as an inventor, may not always be the most headline-grabbing of the prizes, but past recipients include scientific greats such as radioactivity pioneers Ernest Rutherford and Marie Curie.</p>

<p>Last year's chemistry award went to Moungi Bawendi, Louis Brus and Aleksey Ekimov for their discovery of tiny clusters of atoms known as quantum dots, widely used today to create colours in flat screens, light emitting diode (LED) lamps and devices that help surgeons see blood vessels in tumours.</p>

<p>Alongside the cash prize, the winners will be presented a medal by the Swedish king on Dec. 10, followed by a lavish banquet in Stockholm city hall.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian developer Peter Todd is Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin. No, we aren't saying it. It's award-winning filmmaker Cullen Hoback, who pieced together old and new evidence and confronted both Todd and Blockstream founder Adam Back, another suspect, with his findings. All this in a new HBO documentary titled "Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery".</p>

<p>In a climactic moment of the documentary, Hoback asks Todd, “It seems like you had these deep insights into Bitcoin at the time?” Todd responds, “Well, yeah, I'm Satoshi Nakamoto.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, in an email to CoinDesk before the documentary's release, Todd claimed, “Of course I'm not Satoshi.” He also told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/08/investing/satoshi-nakamoto-identity/index.html">CNN</a>, “For the record, I'm not Satoshi,” adding the film has been “irresponsible” and could endanger his life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto has long been shrouded in mystery, fuelling countless theories and speculation.</p>

<p>Cullen Hoback remains confident in his theory, citing a 2010 Bitcoin message board post from Todd that he believes was written by Satoshi Nakamoto. The director spent years investigating various theories and suspects before settling on Todd.</p>

<p>Nic Carter, Founding Partner of Castle Island Ventures, said, “I feel certain that Todd is not Nakamoto,” citing the Bitcoin creator's deep knowledge of cryptography and digital cash systems.</p>

<p>Jameson Lopp, co-founder of the Bitcoin company Casa, also responded to the documentary's findings with scepticism. "Wherever Satoshi may be, I like to think they're having a laugh at this latest round of foolishness," he wrote on X.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Peter Todd, a graduate of the Ontario College of Art and Design, was just 23 when the famous Bitcoin white paper was published. He began engaging with key figures in the crypto community as a teenager, making him a credible candidate for some enthusiasts. Hoback explained to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/peter-todd-bitcoin-creator-cullen-hoback-hbo-cryptocurrency-satoshi-nakamoto/ ">Politico</a>, “In investigations like these, digital forensics can only take you so far... Real answers can only be found offline.”</p>

<p>The documentary features a dramatic scene where Hoback confronts Todd about the evidence linking him to Satoshi. Hoback said, “Peter was there that day... He had every opportunity to explain himself.” However, Todd rejected the film's claims, saying, “Cullen is grasping for straws here.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[When the last national census was held in 2021, Antikythera had just 39 inhabitants, down from 120 in 2011.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When winter draws in on Antikythera, the already meagre population of the isolated Greek island shrinks to almost nothing.</p>

<p>"There are 20 to 25 of us, no children, no bakery," said local leader Giorgos Harhalakis, who is fighting an uphill battle to revive the small Aegean island's fortunes.</p>

<p>"I'm not giving up," he told AFP.</p>

<p>A speck of land between the islands of Kythera and Crete, Antikythera, like many rural regions in Greece, has suffered steady depopulation.</p>

<p>When the last national census was held in 2021, it had just 39 inhabitants, down from 120 in 2011.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/jj80ria8_antikythera_625x300_09_October_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>

<p>Harhalakis, 37, still remembers his first years at primary school in the 1990s, before his family, like others, was forced by "financial problems" to move to the mainland.</p>

<p>At the time, the island was home to "farmers, fishermen and cattle breeders" and had around 15 communities, he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, only the port of Potamos is inhabited.</p>

<p>In the rocky heights of Antikythera, the dry-stone walls of terraced fields are still visible between abandoned and collapsed houses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The island's only connection to the outside world is by boat to Kythera and Crete.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Shuttered schools</strong></h3>

<p>The exodus meant that the school closed for two decades before reopening in 2018 for just three pupils -- the children of Despina and Dionysis Andronikos, an Antikythera couple who returned from Athens.</p>

<p>"But in 2021, when my eldest daughter finished primary school, we had to leave so she could go to secondary school in Kythera," Dionysis Andronikos said.</p>

<p>The school was forced to close again -- one of dozens across Greece that faced a similar fate owing to lack of pupils when the school year began last month.</p>

<p>Greece's fertility rate of 1.43 children per woman in 2021 is below the EU average of 1.53 children, according to EU data agency Eurostat.</p>

<p>A recent study by the Greek Institute for Demographic Research (IDEM) found that one in three of the country's municipalities has fewer than 10 births a year.</p>

<p>The institute attributed this to Greece's ageing population, but also to "the extremely uneven distribution of the population".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Athens is home to over a third of the country's 10.5 million inhabitants.</p>

<p>And with over a fifth of its population aged 65 and over, Greece ranks fourth among EU member states with the highest number of elderly.</p>

<p>Only Italy (23.8 percent), Portugal (23.7 percent) and Finland (23.1 percent) rank higher, according to Eurostat.</p>

<p>To make things worse, over half a million young people left the country during the financial meltdown of the last decade.</p>

<p>Some efforts have been made to attract new residents to areas in need.</p>

<p>In the mountain village of Fourna, in central Greece, the local church invited large families to move in to prevent the closure of the local school.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In September, this initiative attracted a family with six children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But a similar attempt, launched three years ago in Antikythera, has so far failed to bear fruit.</p>

<h3><strong>Ancient computer, new hope</strong></h3>

<p>For Harhalakis, the island's community leader, the main problem "is the lack of infrastructure. The state needs to offer incentives" for the construction of houses and shops, he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In winter, the island has only one cafe, which serves both as a tavern and a small store. It is run by a man in his eighties.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">

</div>

<p>"The native population is ageing, and the future of the island is in doubt," said Catherine Dechosal, a retired Frenchwoman who divides her time between the island and her homeland.</p>

<p>This year the government introduced a baby bonus to counter the demographic collapse.</p>

<p>But experts warn that increasing the number of births is not the only answer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Mortality rates and immigration play a decisive role and should not be downplayed," Vyron Kotzamanis, director of IDEM, recently told Greek state news agency ANA.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harhalakis hopes that the planned climate change observatory on the island will create jobs.</p>

<p>Antikythera already enjoys an outsized fame in the scientific world.</p>

<p>A 2nd-century astrological clock believed to be the world's oldest computer was found by sponge divers off its coast in the early 20th century among the remains of a Roman-era shipwreck.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Forecasted to be the worst hurricane Florida is set to witness in a century, Milton is likely to bring a water surge of up to 15 feet to the Tampa Bay area after landfall, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2024-10-08-hurricane-milton-florida-forecast-storm-surge-wind-damage-rainfall">local media reports</a>.</p>

<p>The storm is expected to reach Florida's Gulf coast by late Wednesday or early Thursday, but the location of the landfall site is yet to be ascertained. Apart from a storm surge, Hurricane Milton is expected to bring widespread wind damage, flooding, rainfall and tornadoes to the state. As of 4 am CDT (2.30 pm IST), Hurricane Milton was a Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds close to 160 mph. The storm is in the Gulf of Mexico moving northeast towards Florida at around 14 mph.</p>

<p>Fort Myers, Orlando, Cape Canaveral and Daytona Beach too are forecasted to witness a storm surge.</p>

<p>As the second huge hurricane in as many weeks rumbled toward Florida's west coast, US President Joe Biden said from the White House, urging those under orders to leave to "evacuate now, now, now." In a scene of frantic preparation repeated all over Florida, dozens of cars lined up at a sports facility in Tampa to pick up sandbags to protect their homes from flooding.</p>

<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Tuesday released footage from a specialist plane called "Miss Piggy" as it flew into the hurricane to collect data. Paperwork, equipment and personal items were sent flying as the plane was shaken by wind and rain.</p>

<p>It hit the Florida coastline on September 26 as a major Category 4 hurricane, causing massive flooding in remote inland towns in states further north, including North Carolina and Tennessee. Helene was the deadliest natural disaster to hit the US mainland since 2005's Hurricane Katrina, with the death count still rising.</p>

<p>Hurricane Katrina, which reached Category 5 intensity but made landfall in Louisiana in 2005 as a Category 3 storm, produced a record 27.8-foot storm surge. In 2008, Hurricane Ike pummeled the Texas Gulf Coast as a Category 2 storm and generated a 15-foot storm surge in Galveston Island.</p>

<p>Scientists say global warming has a role in intense storms as warmer ocean surfaces release more water vapor, providing additional energy for storms, which exacerbates their winds.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A teenager who killed nine pupils and a guard in a mass shooting at a Belgrade school last year left a psychiatric institution for the first time Tuesday to testify at his parents' trial.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/parents-on-trial-after-13-year-old-shoots-dead-10-at-serbia-school-4952534">13-year-old boy carried out the killings</a> on May 3 last year using his father's gun. He cannot be prosecuted due to his age but his parents face serious public safety charges.</p>

<p>The hearing was held behind closed doors but Ognjen Bozovic, a legal representative for the victims' families, said: "Today was one of the most harrowing trials I've ever attended in my career... It was extremely difficult."</p>

<p>The defendants lawyer, Irina Borovic, stated that the reasons behind the crime would not be uncovered in any trial.</p>

<p>"Those reasons are clearly somewhere deep in the soul of the boy who, unfortunately, carried all of this out," Borovic said.</p>

<p>The parents of the murdered children also attended the testimony, which took place in a high-security court typically reserved for cases involving organized crime and war crimes.</p>

<p>Most left the court in tears, unable to speak to the media.</p>

<p>The prosecutor's office said it was closely monitoring the media for any leaks of the minor's testimony at the hearing.</p>

<p>The boy's father, who is in custody, is charged with training his son to handle firearms, as well as failing to safely store the weapons and ammunition. The boy hid a handgun and 92 bullets used in the shooting in his backpack.</p>

<p>The boy's mother has been indicted after her DNA was found on one of the bullets. She is not detained however.</p>

<p>Less than 48 hours after the school attack, eight people were murdered in another shooting carried out by a 21-year-old armed with an automatic rifle some 60 kilometres (37 miles) south of Belgrade.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mayor of Chilpancingo, the capital of Mexico's violence-plagued state of Guerrero, traveled alone to an out-of-town meeting before he was killed, Mexico's security minister said on Tuesday about a murder which has shocked the country.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/mexican-mayor-alejandro-arcos-decapitated-days-after-taking-office-head-found-on-truck-6738781">Alejandro Arcos</a>, of Mexico's main opposition alliance, had only taken office six days earlier. Photos circulated on Sunday via WhatsApp and in Mexican media outlets depicting a severed head on top of a pick-up truck, appearing to be that of Arcos.</p>

<p>The gruesome act happened just days before new President Claudia Sheinbaum unveiled her security strategy aimed at combating violent crime.</p>

<p>Security Minister Omar Garcia Harfuch said in a news conference that an investigation had determined Arcos left Chilpancingo in his pickup truck without a driver or escort heading toward the nearby town of Petaquillas.</p>

<p>Arcos had not requested security protection from the federal government, Garcia Harfuch said.</p>

<p>"We know that he was going to a specific meeting, that he was not accompanied by someone. Communication was lost in a community, and... hours later the mayor's body was found," Garcia Harfuch said.</p>

<p>Asked by a reporter whom Arcos was meeting with, the minister declined to give details, saying it was an open investigation.</p>

<p>"There is a lot of information on this subject that we must guard for the sake of the investigation," Harfuch said.</p>

<p>Mexican newspaper Reforma, citing federal government sources, reported that Arcos had met with members of Los Ardillos, a criminal group active in Guerrero state, hours before his death.</p>

<p>A funeral for Arcos was held on Monday, with mourners lining the streets and throwing rose petals as his casket was driven through the town.</p>

<p>Similar grisly murders involving decapitations have plagued Guerrero - including Chilpancingo - in the past as a way cartel members use to send messages of threats and control.</p>

<p>As recently as 2023, violence from warring gang factions paralyzed public transportation and shuttered businesses in Chilpancingo. After Arcos' killing, classes were suspended for local schools.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The announcement comes as Hollywood has been wrestling with how to harness generative AI video technology this year, after Microsoft-backed OpenAI in February first showed off how its product Sora could create feature film-like videos.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook owner Meta announced on Friday it had built a new AI model called Movie Gen that can create realistic-seeming video and audio clips in response to user prompts, claiming it can rival tools from leading media generation startups like OpenAI and ElevenLabs.</p>

<p>Samples of Movie Gen's creations provided by Meta showed videos of animals swimming and surfing, as well as videos using people's real photos to depict them performing actions like painting on a canvas.</p>

<p>Movie Gen also can generate background music and sound effects synced to the content of the videos, Meta said in a blog post, and use the tool to edit existing videos.</p>

<p>In one such video, Meta had the tool insert pom-poms into the hands of a man running by himself in the desert, while in another it changed a parking lot where a man was skateboarding from dry ground into one covered by a splashing puddle.</p>

<p>Videos created by Movie Gen can be up to 16 seconds long, while audio can be up to 45 seconds long, Meta said. It shared data showing blind tests indicating that the model performs favorably compared with offerings from startups including Runway, OpenAI, ElevenLabs and Kling.</p>

<p>The announcement comes as Hollywood has been wrestling with how to harness generative AI video technology this year, after Microsoft-backed OpenAI in February first showed off how its product Sora could create feature film-like videos in response to text prompts.</p>

<p>Technologists in the entertainment industry are eager to use such tools to enhance and expedite filmmaking, while others worry about embracing systems that appear to have been trained on copyright works without permission.</p>

<p>Lawmakers also have highlighted concerns about how AI-generated fakes, or deepfakes, are being used in elections around the world, including in the U.S., Pakistan, India and Indonesia.</p>

<p>Meta spokespeople said the company was unlikely to release Movie Gen for open use by developers, as it has with its Llama series of large-language models, saying it considers the risks individually for each model. They declined to comment on Meta's assessment for Movie Gen specifically.</p>

<p>Instead, they said, Meta was working directly with the entertainment community and other content creators on uses of Movie Gen and would incorporate it into Meta's own products sometime next year.</p>

<p>According to the blog post and a research paper about the tool released by Meta, the company used a mix of licensed and publicly available datasets to build Movie Gen.</p>

<p>OpenAI has been meeting with Hollywood executives and agents this year to discuss possible partnerships involving Sora, although no deals have been reported to have come out of those talks yet. Anxieties over the company's approach increased in May when actor Scarlett Johansson accused the ChatGPT maker of imitating her voice without permission for its chatbot.</p>

<p>Lions Gate Entertainment, the company behind "The Hunger Games" and "Twilight," announced in September that it was giving AI startup Runway access to its film and television library to train an AI model. In return, it said, the studio and its filmmakers can use the model to augment their work.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[By dissolving parliament now, Shigeru Ishiba wants to put his party to the test before his "honeymoon" period ends, a political science professor said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba dissolved parliament on Wednesday ahead of the October 27 snap elections, banking on his political honeymoon and a fragmented opposition to lead his scandal-tainted party to victory.</p>

<p>Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has governed Japan almost uninterrupted for decades -- albeit with frequent leader changes -- and is almost certain to be re-elected.&nbsp;But Ishiba, named prime minister just last week, wants to shore up his mandate to push through policies that include beefing up spending on defence as well as on poorer regions hit hard by Japan's demographic crisis.</p>

<p>"We want to face this election fairly and sincerely, so as for this government to obtain (public) trust," Ishiba told reporters on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Later the speaker of parliament read out a letter from the prime minister with the emperor's seal, formally dissolving parliament as lawmakers shouted the traditional rallying cry of "banzai".</p>

<p>The three-year government of Ishiba's predecessor Fumio Kishida suffered record-low approval ratings due to a slush fund scandal and voter discontent over rising prices.</p>

<p>Polls last week gave Ishiba's cabinet approval ratings of 45-50 percent, compared with 20-30 percent for the Kishida administration's final month.</p>

<p>Ishiba's backers hope the self-confessed defence "geek" and outspoken critic of the LDP establishment will boost the party's popularity, including by persuading young people to vote.</p>

<p>By dissolving parliament now, the 67-year-old wants to put his party to the test before his "honeymoon" period ends, said Yu Uchiyama, a political science professor at the University of Tokyo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It makes sense that he wanted to call a snap election as soon as the 'face' of the party changed, while the momentum is still there", he told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Uchiyama added that Ishiba also wanted to catch opposition forces flat-footed, as the LDP's foes remain undecided about how to coordinate with each other in the election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the prime minister's decision to call a snap election this early was also criticised for contradicting his previous vows to prioritise facing the opposition in parliament.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some voters saw it as a disappointing sign that he had "yielded to the pressure within his party" to dissolve parliament for political gain, Uchiyama said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the weekend, Ishiba announced that the LDP would not endorse some disgraced party members implicated in the political funding scandal in the election.</p>

<p>The announcement reflected his desire to demonstrate to the public that he can be "strict" and "likely regained public trust in him a bit", Uchiyama said.</p>

<h3><strong>Fresh promises</strong></h3>

<p>To counter China, Ishiba has backed the creation of a regional military alliance along the lines of NATO, although he admitted on Monday it would "not happen overnight".</p>

<p>Analyst Yee Kuang Heng of the University of Tokyo's Graduate School of Public Policy, told AFP the idea sounded like a "blast from the past" recalling the now-defunct SEATO (Southeast Asia Treaty Organization).</p>

<p>Ishiba said the security environment in Asia was "the most severe since the end of World War II", and warned in his first policy speech Friday that "today's Ukraine could be tomorrow's East Asia".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Japan is also facing a looming demographic crisis as its population ages and the birth rate stays stubbornly low -- a situation Ishiba called a "quiet emergency" on Friday.</p>

<p>He said his government would promote measures to support families such as flexible working hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ishiba has also pledged to "ensure Japan's economy emerges from deflation", and wants to boost incomes through a new stimulus package as well as support for local governments and low-income households.</p>

<p>The main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, meanwhile, seeks to differentiate itself from the LDP on a range of diversity issues, including vowing to legalise same-sex marriages.</p>

<p>It also pledges to allow married couples to maintain separate surnames.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Kremlin on Wednesday denied reports by American journalist Bob Woodward that former US President Donald Trump spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin as many as seven times after leaving office, the RBC daily reported.</p>

<p>When asked by RBC if <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/trump-sent-covid-kits-to-putin-called-him-7-times-since-2021-claims-book-by-bob-woodward-6746806#pfrom=home-ndtv_topstories">Putin and Trump had spoken on the phone</a>, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: "No, that's not true."</p>

<p>In his book "War", Woodward said Trump ordered an aide away from his office at his Florida residence at Mar-a-Lago in early 2024 so he could conduct a private phone call with Putin, according to The Washington Post's summary of the book.</p>

<p>The Post said on Wednesday the book does not describe what the two men discussed, and it quotes a Trump campaign official casting doubt on the supposed contact.</p>

<p>The book also cited an unnamed Trump aide as indicating that Trump may have spoken to Putin as many as seven times since Trump left the White House in 2021.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign dismissed Woodward's book and said the book's content was "made-up", the New York Times reported.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An 18-year-old Nepali mountaineer on Wednesday broke the record for the youngest person to summit all 14 of the world's 8,000-metre peaks, his team said.</p>

<p>Nima Rinji Sherpa reached the summit of Tibet's 8,027-metre-high (26,335 feet) Shisha Pangma on Wednesday morning, completing his mission to stand on the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/mount-chimborazo-surpasses-mount-everest-as-worlds-highest-peak-in-unusual-way-6749120">world's highest peaks</a>.</p>

<p>"He reached the summit this morning. He had trained well and I was confident he would do it," his father Tashi Sherpa told AFP.</p>

<p>Summiting all 14 "eight-thousanders" is considered the peak of mountaineering aspirations. Climbers cross "death zones" where there is not enough oxygen in the air to sustain human life for long periods.</p>

<p>"This summit is not just the culmination of my personal journey, but a tribute to every Sherpa who has ever dared to dream beyond the traditional boundaries set for us," Sherpa said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Mountaineering is more than labour, it is a testament to our strength, resilience and passion."</p>

<p>Sherpa is no stranger to the mountains, hailing from a family of record-holding mountaineers, who also now run Nepal's largest mountaineering expedition company.</p>

<p>The record was previously held by another Nepali climber, Mingma Gyabu 'David' Sherpa. He achieved it in 2019, at the age of 30.</p>

<p><strong>'Proud moment'</strong></p>

<p>Nima Rinji Sherpa, who already holds multiple records from his ascents of dozens of peaks, started high-altitude climbing at the age of 16, by climbing Mount Manaslu in August 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By June this year, he had climbed his 13th mountain, Kanchenjunga, the world's third highest. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is a proud moment for our country," Nima Nuru Sherpa, president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association, told AFP. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"Nima broke all the stereotypes, and his success has given a message that nothing is impossible if you have a strong determination."</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/5-russian-mountaineers-killed-while-climbing-dhaulagiri-in-nepal-6742934">Nepali climbers</a> -- usually ethnic Sherpas from the valleys around Everest -- are considered the backbone of the climbing industry in the Himalayas.</p>

<p>They carry the majority of equipment and food, fixing ropes and repairing ladders.</p>

<p>Long in the shadows as supporters of foreign climbers, they are slowly being recognised in their own right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2021, a team of Nepali climbers made the first winter ascent of K2, the world's second-highest peak -- the notoriously challenging 8,611-metre (28,251-feet) "savage mountain" of Pakistan.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Climate finance is money spent in a manner "consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development", as per phrasing used in the Paris agreement.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rich countries will be under pressure at next month's UN COP29 conference to increase by hundreds of billions of dollars how much money they give to poorer countries as "climate finance".</p>

<p>But there is deep disagreement over how much is needed, who should pay and what should be covered, ensuring that climate finance will top the agenda at COP29 in Baku.</p>

<p><strong>What is climate finance?</strong></p>

<p>It is the buzzword in this year's negotiations, which run from November 11-22, but there is not one agreed definition of climate finance.</p>

<p>In general terms, it is money spent in a manner "consistent with a pathway towards low <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ocean-heat-behind-hurricane-helene-made-500-times-more-likely-by-climate-change-6750094">greenhouse gas emissions</a> and climate-resilient development", as per phrasing used in the Paris agreement.</p>

<p>That includes government or private money in clean energy like solar and wind, technology like electric vehicles, or adaptation measures like dykes to hold back rising seas.</p>

<p>But could a subsidy for a new water-efficient hotel, for example, be counted? It's not something the annual UN-sponsored climate summits have addressed directly.</p>

<p>At the UN negotiations, climate finance has come to refer to the difficulties the developing world faces getting the money it needs to prepare for <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/this-is-the-second-warmest-september-on-record-says-climate-watchdog-6743182">global warming</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Who pays?</strong></p>

<p>Under a 1992 UN accord, a handful of rich countries most responsible for global warming were obligated to provide finance.</p>

<p>In 2009, the United States, the European Union, Japan, Britain, Canada, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, New Zealand and Australia agreed to pay $100 billion per year by 2020.</p>

<p>They only achieved this for the first time in 2022. The delay eroded trust and fuelled accusations that rich countries were shirking their responsibility.</p>

<p>At COP29, nearly 200 nations are expected to agree on a new finance goal beyond 2025.</p>

<p>India has called for $1 trillion a year and some other proposals go higher, but countries on the hook want other major economies to chip in.</p>

<p>They argue times have changed and the big industrialised nations of the early 1990s represent just 30 percent of historic greenhouse gas emissions today.</p>

<p>In particular, there is a push for China -- the world's largest polluter today -- and the Gulf countries to pay. They do not accept this proposal.</p>

<p><strong>What's being negotiated?</strong></p>

<p>Experts commissioned by the UN estimate that developing countries, excluding China, will need $2.4 trillion per year by 2030.</p>

<p>But the line between climate finance, foreign aid and private capital is often blurred and campaigners are pushing for clearer terms that specify where money comes from, and in what form.</p>

<p>In a letter to governments, seen by AFP, a coalition of dozens of activist, environment and scientific organisations in October called on rich nations to pay developing countries $1 trillion a year into three clear categories.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some $300 billion would be government money for reducing <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/climate-change-causes-issues-in-coastal-areas-during-cyclones-weather-chief-6705242">planet-heating emissions</a>, $300 billion for adaptation measures and $400 billion for disaster relief known as "loss and damage".</p>

<p>The signatories said all the money should be grants, seeking to redress the provision of loans as climate finance that poorer countries say compounds their debt problems.</p>

<p>Developed countries do not want money for "loss and damage" included under any new climate finance pact reached at <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/cop29-leaders-announce-new-climate-funding-and-energy-storage-goals-6583245">COP29</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Where will they find the money?</strong></p>

<p>Today, most climate finance aid goes through development banks or funds co-managed with the countries concerned, such as the Green Climate Fund and the Global Environment Facility.</p>

<p>Campaigners are very critical of the $100 billion pledge because two-thirds of the money was given as loans, not grants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even revised upwards, it is likely any new pledge from governments will fall well short of what is needed.</p>

<p>But this commitment is viewed as highly symbolic nonetheless, and crucial to unlocking other sources of money, namely private capital.</p>

<p>Financial diplomacy also plays out at the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the G20, where hosts Brazil want to craft a global tax on billionaires.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The idea of new global taxes, for example on aviation or maritime transport, is also supported by France, Kenya and Barbados, with the backing of UN chief Antonio Guterres.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Redirecting fossil fuel subsidies towards clean energy or wiping the debt of poor countries in exchange for climate investments are also among the options.&nbsp;</p>

<p>COP29 host Azerbaijan, meanwhile, has asked fossil fuel producers to contribute to a new fund that would channel money to developing countries.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nestled amongst the hills of Kullu in Naggar is a gravestone with these words on it: "Here on December 15, 1947, the body of Maharishi Nicholas Roerich - a great Russian friend of India - was committed to fire. Let there be peace."&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are few instances when the simplest of words convey such meaning. Nicholas Roerich, who was born on this day 150 years ago, was, first and foremost, an Indophile, someone who perhaps can be said to have laid the foundation of Indo-Russian friendship. But, to know Roerich and his work - whether on canvas or paper - one has to encounter India.</p>

<h2><strong>Roerich's Time At Ishwara</strong></h2>

<p>Roerich was a painter, traveller, writer, philosopher, and, as many in his native country consider, a mystic. His extraordinary life is the stuff books and films are made of, but with a touch of the sublime and mystical. Roerich's abiding love for mountains was partly instrumental in his engagement with India and why he later made Naggar his home. Early in life, his family spent time at an estate near St. Petersburg named "Ishwara". The previous owner had hung a picture on the wall of what Roerich later realised was Kanchenjunga. As a child, he loved looking at it. Later, it was his wife Elena who introduced him to Indian thought, especially Buddhism, to which she had been introduced by Elena Blavatskaya, one of the founders of the Theosophical Society. Blavtaskaya had been to India and had converted to Buddhism.</p>

<h2><strong>When Roerichs Met Tagore</strong></h2>

<p>Hailing from an upper-middle-class family, Roerich grew up in a milieu where his family often entertained the city's cultural elites. It was also a time when, fatigued by constant conflict and wars, the Western world was increasingly looking towards the East for spiritual succour to "reorient" itself. At the beginning of the 20th century, Roerich's native Russia plunged into revolution and civil war. Recuperating in Finland when the Bolshevik Revolution gripped Russia, the Roerichs travelled to Europe, never to return. In England, they met Rabindranath Tagore and were greatly influenced by him. They then travelled to the US, where, already engaging with Indian philosophical traditions, they established the Agni Yoga Society in New York and an art institute. As we understand now, the society had less to do with yoga and was more focused on promoting religious harmony and the brotherhood of nations; the art institute went on to become the Nicholas Roerich Museum in 1949.</p>

<p>From the US, they finally landed in India in 1923. They toured India extensively, interacted with its cultural and political elites and civilians, and studied its ancient culture, traditions and religions, all of which found expression in Roerich's paintings and writings. It was from India that Roerich embarked on his famed Central Asian expedition from 1923-1928 through Sikkim, Tibet, Kashmir, Ladakh, Siberia, Altai and Mongolia. But the mountains kept beckoning to him and he finally settled down in Naggar in Kullu. There, he founded the Urusvati Himalayan Research Institute in 1928.</p>

<h2><strong>The Love For Himalayas</strong></h2>

<p>Of the 7,000-odd paintings that he left behind, at least 2,000 are dedicated to the Himalayas, which for Roerich symbolised man's spiritual longing and spiritual transcendence. This is how he described the Himalayas: ".....Here was the Abode of Rishis. Here resounded the sacred Flute of Krishna. Here thundered the Blessed Gautama. Here originated all the Vedas. Here lived Pandavas. Here was Gessar Khan. Here was Aryavarta. Here is Shambala. The Himalayas are the Jewel of India. The Himalayas are the Treasure of the World. The Himalayas are the sacred symbol of Ascent."<br />
Much later, Roerich was declared a National Treasure Artist of India, along with other eight masters like Tagore, Jamini Roy, etc.</p>

<p>Similarly, many of Roerich's writings have an Indian theme. He was greatly influenced by the Hindu concept of the cyclical nature of time, as also by old Slavonic spirituality and Russian Orthodoxy. He tried to promote a synthesis of Indian and Russian spirituality. Many of his writings depict the struggle between the shadow and light, with the latter always emerging triumphant - a search for the pristine "Shambala".</p>

<h2><strong><em>Dhammapada </em>In An Atheist State</strong></h2>

<p>Roerich was not alone in his endeavour to acquaint Russia, or the world for that matter, with Indian spirituality. Along with his wife, his sons also made their individual contributions to furthering Indo-Russian friendship and understanding. The elder son, George (Yuri) can be credited with promoting Indology in the Soviet Union. In 1957, he went to the then-USSR and lived there for three years, before his tragic untimely death. Russian Indologists consider him and his contribution a key to the second flowering of Buddhist and Indian studies in the Soviet Union; the first occurred during the Tsarist period. He was a scholar who championed the publication of the Russian translation of the <em>Dhammapada </em>[Buddhist holy text] by Vladimir Toporov. This was unheard of then. And given that the state then officially denounced religion, this was a revolutionary step. Later, the writings of both Roerich and Elena helped spread Indian mysticism in the Soviet Union and later in the Russian Federation, with a number of Roerich Societies springing up in different parts of the country.</p>

<p>The younger son, Svetoslav, often more famous as the husband of Devika Rani, the First Lady of Indian cinema, also did his bit through his numerous paintings. He remained in India all his life. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
There's another legacy Roerich has left behind: the Roerich Pact, or the Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments. An international legal document, the pact is aimed at ensuring the unconditional protection of cultural property. The pact has never been more significant than today as the world witnesses the wilful destruction of ancient and cultural heritage in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>There Is No Future Without The Past</strong></h2>

<p>For Roerich, knowledge and beauty epitomised life itself. This sentiment is beautifully portrayed in his drama <em>Mercy </em>('Miloserdiye') which this writer has been privileged to have translated from Russian to English.</p>

<p>Roerich passed away on December 15, 1947. In keeping with indic tradition, Nicholas, his wife and later son Svetoslav, were all cremated and samadhis erected over their ashes. His&nbsp;demise put an end to the work of the Urusvati Centre; it is now a museum of the International Roerich Memorial Trust, which houses a number of paintings by both Roerich and son Svetoslav. Yet, his rich legacy remains almost obscure in India, restricted to niche circles. This Russian friend of India deserves far more. As Roerich said: there is no future without the past.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year's warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico helped Milton swiftly become a powerful hurricane, with the US National Hurricane Center calling it the third-fastest intensifying Atlantic storm on record.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hurricane-milton-nears-florida-biden-warns-of-worst-natural-disaster-in-a-century-6749394">Milton's rapid power surge</a> appears to be the latest example of a worrying trend, scientists said, with climate change not only fuelling more powerful storms, but doing so more quickly.</p>

<p>Here is what you need to know:</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT IS BEHIND A STORM'S STRENGTH?</strong></h3>

<p>As storm winds organize into a hurricane, they pull energy from the heat in surface waters. The warmer the water, the more fuel for a hurricane.</p>

<p>Thanks to climate change, water temperatures are rising. In the last four decades, the ocean has absorbed about 90% of the warming from greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>This year has seen especially warm waters due to climate change, with 2024 on track to have the warmest average global air temperature on record.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The past 12 months have seen global warming at 1.62 degrees Celsius (2.92 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service said on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A storm's strength is defined by its sustained wind speeds, with a Category 1 hurricane carrying wind speeds of 74-95 mph (119-153 kph), while a dangerous Category 5 storm has wind speeds of 157 mph (252 kph) or higher.</p>

<h3><strong>HOW IS STRENGTH DIFFERENT FROM INTENSIFICATION?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>When a storm powers up quickly, scientists refer to its "rapid intensification."</p>

<p>When a storm rapidly intensifies, sustained wind speeds increase by at least 35 mph (56 kph) within 24 hours, which can see a storm jump by two categories.</p>

<p>On Monday, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/category-5-hurricane-milton-approaches-florida-2nd-major-storm-in-weeks-6740696">Milton became the third-most rapidly intensifying Atlantic storm</a> as its wind speeds increased by more than double the criteria for rapid intensification, shifting from a tropical storm to a Category 5 storm in less than a day.</p>

<p>The Gulf's warm water, along with air conditions, made Milton's rapid intensification "a near-certainty," said physical oceanographer Gregory Foltz with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>

<p>A study last year suggested that storms originating in the Atlantic Ocean are now more than twice as likely to strengthen from Category 1 to Category 3 in just 36 hours, based on data from 2001-2020 compared with 1971-1990.</p>

<p>That study, published in Scientific Reports, estimated that Atlantic storms overall are 29% more likely to undergo rapid intensification. While the study suggested this effect might be less pronounced for Gulf storms, the lead author told Reuters that unusually warm waters fuel storms wherever conditions are right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gulf of Mexico surface waters reached record-high temperatures around 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) during the past two summers, according to NOAA data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In mid-September, just weeks ahead of Milton's formation, the Gulf was the warmest for that time of year on record.</p>

<p>"Watching Milton's strengthening unfold in real time yesterday was still staggering," said lead author Andra Garner of Rowan University in New Jersey.</p>

<p>Her calculations, shared with Reuters, suggest that Milton's maximum 12-hour and 24-hour intensification rates on Monday ranked in the 99th percentile of all maximum intensification rates observed in the Atlantic.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>WHY IS RAPID INTENSIFICATION A CONCERN?</strong></h3>

<p>Hurricanes can be deadly. They also cause some of the world's costliest disasters, with the 10 costliest for the United States all occurring since 1989.</p>

<p>While Milton's power-up was stunning, it occurred while the storm was still days from making landfall, giving <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/milton-hurricane-update-if-you-stay-you-will-die-us-state-florida-braces-for-hurricane-milton-6745540">Florida</a> communities a chance to evacuate on Tuesday.</p>

<p>When a storm intensifies rapidly close to shore, it can leave communities scrambling to prepare or get out of harm's way.</p>

<p>Mexico was surprised last year when a weak tropical storm in the Pacific suddenly became a powerful Category 5 storm called Hurricane Otis, just hours before it slammed into western Mexico and killed dozens of people in the Acapulco metropolitan area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most rapidly intensifying Atlantic hurricane on record is Wilma, a Category 5 storm when it hit the Yucatan Peninsula in October 2005, followed by Hurricane Felix in 2007.</p>

<p>One 2022 study in Geophysical Research Letters said that the intensification rate of near-shore Atlantic hurricanes had "increased significantly" during the 1979-2018 period. But like the 2023 study, it did not find a significant change in intensification speeds in Gulf storms.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia's vast state-owned Rostec corporation said on Thursday that its weapons export unit had organised the production in India of armour-piercing rounds for Russian-made battle tanks.</p>

<p>Rostec issued its statement ahead of a July 8-9 visit to Russia by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi who will hold talks with President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>The "Mango" projectiles that will be made in India are designed to be fired from the guns of T-72 and T-90 tanks which India's land forces use, Rostec said.</p>

<p>"The rounds allow you to hit modern tanks equipped with combined protection. Various modifications of these combat vehicles are in service with India," it said in its statement.</p>

<p>Rostec said it also had plans to localise the production of gunpowder in India as part of the Indian government's drive to have more foreign goods made in India.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden is "absolutely not" pulling out of the US presidential race, his spokeswoman said Wednesday, as pressure mounted following his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Panic has gripped his Democratic Party in the wake of last week's TV debate, and internal rumblings about finding a replacement candidate before November's election have been amplified by polls showing Trump extending his lead.</p>

<p>The New York Times and CNN reported that Biden, 81, had acknowledged to a key ally that his reelection bid was on the line if he failed to quickly reassure the public that he was still up to the job.</p>

<p>White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre rejected those reports outright, insisting Biden has no intention of withdrawing.</p>

<p>"The president is clear-eyed and he is staying in the race," she told reporters.</p>

<p>Biden told a call with campaign and party staffers that he is going nowhere.</p>

<p>"I'm in this race to the end and we're going to win because when Democrats unite, we will always win. Just as we beat Donald Trump in 2020, we're going to beat him again in 2024," he said, according to a source close to the campaign.</p>

<p>He repeated that message in an emergency meeting with Democratic governors, who pledged their continued support, attendees said afterward.</p>

<p><br />
"As the president continued to tell us, and show us, that he was all in... we said that we would stand with him," Maryland Governor Wes Moore, seen as a rising star and potential future presidential candidate, told reporters alongside Minnesota's Tim Walz and Kathy Hochul of New York.</p>

<p>Walz said Biden was "fit to serve."</p>

<p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who also attended the meeting at the White House and is seen as one of the top picks to replace Biden if he should drop out, said on social media platform X that "he is in it to win it and I support him."</p>

<p>Biden has admitted he performed poorly in the debate, and was blunt in a radio interview recorded Wednesday with Wisconsin's Civic Media.</p>

<p>"I screwed up. I made a mistake. That's 90 minutes on stage. Look at what I've done in 3.5 years," he said.</p>

<p>He echoed that sentiment in an interview with Pennsylvania's WURD radio on Thursday, saying "I had a bad debate."</p>

<h3><strong>Aftermath</strong></h3>

<p>The Biden campaign has been desperate to reassure Democratic donors and voters that the president's performance against Trump was a one-off.</p>

<p>But party figures have voiced bafflement over what they see as deflection and excuses from the president and his aides.</p>

<p>Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, one of the Democratic Party's biggest donors, told the New York Times that Biden should withdraw.</p>

<p>"Biden needs to step aside to allow a vigorous Democratic leader to beat Trump and keep us safe and prosperous," he said in an email to the paper.</p>

<p>The concern was compounded by a New York Times poll conducted after the debate that showed Trump with his biggest lead ever over Biden -- 49 percent to 43 percent of likely voters.</p>

<p>It wasn't until Wednesday -- six days after the debate -- that Biden completed a round of calls with Democratic congressional leaders, and staffers have also voiced consternation over the glacial pace of the outreach.</p>

<p>"We are getting to the point where it may not have been the debate that did him in, but the aftermath of how they've handled it," a senior Democratic operative told Washington political outlet Axios.</p>

<p>Biden may be tested on his ability to think on his feet when he sits with ABC News on Friday for his first television interview since the debate, and he will also hit the swing states of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in the coming days.</p>

<h3><strong>'More worrisome'</strong></h3>

<p>The president has cited fatigue as a new explanation for his poor debate showing, saying that he was unwise to travel "around the world a couple times" before the debate.</p>

<p>But he had been back in the United States for nearly two weeks and spent two days relaxing and six days preparing before the debate.</p>

<p>Democratic lawmakers have begun to go public with their doubts. Arizona congressman Raul Grijalva became the second sitting Democrat to call on Biden to drop out.</p>

<p>"If he's the candidate, I'm going to support him, but I think that this is an opportunity to look elsewhere," Grijalva said, according to the Times.</p>

<p>In the street where the president grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, there was sympathy for Biden -- but no campaign signs for either candidate.</p>

<p>"I was embarrassed for him. I felt he didn't feel well and he probably shouldn't have gone on the stage," said 73-year-old Jamie Hayes.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's campaign and some of his allies have launched a pre-emptive political strike on Vice President Kamala Harris, moving swiftly to try to discredit her amid talk among some of her fellow Democrats that she might replace President Joe Biden atop the party's 2024 presidential ticket.</p>

<p>On social media and in a flurry of statements over the past 48 hours, Trump's campaign and his Republican allies appear to be laying the groundwork for an all-out assault on Harris should the 81-year-old Biden decide to end his re-election bid following his feeble debate performance last week.</p>

<p>While Biden has insisted he is not quitting the race four months before the Nov. 5 election, and Harris has stood firmly behind him, the Trump campaign has little to lose by attacking the vice president now, so if Harris does emerge as the nominee, she might do so in a weakened state.</p>

<p>Republicans have regularly criticized Harris, 59, during Biden's term in office, but the attacks this week represented a sharp and seemingly coordinated escalation that appeared to be linked to increased talk about her possibly replacing Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate.</p>

<p>The National Republican Congressional Committee, which oversees House Republican races, called her Biden's "enabler in chief."</p>

<p>MAGA Inc., a fundraising super PAC supporting Trump, meanwhile released a statement calling her the "invasion czar." In March 2021 Biden said Harris would lead efforts with Mexico and Central American nations to address illegal immigration.</p>

<p>Republicans have since seized on that to accuse her of failing to stem the flow of millions of migrants crossing illegally into the United States, although she was never directly responsible for securing the southern border.</p>

<p>"Kamala Harris is incompetent. She's proven to be the weakest, worst vice president in history, and she has 100% supported Joe Biden in every single disastrous policy that he has implemented over the last four years," said Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign.</p>

<p>The Biden campaign pushed back against the escalating Republican criticism without addressing the question of whether the vice president is waiting in the wings.</p>

<p>"Vice President Harris is proud to be President Biden's running mate," said Rhyan Lake, a campaign spokesperson for Harris. "No matter what false attacks Trump and his extreme allies make, she will continue to defend the Biden-Harris record and prosecute the case against Donald Trump."</p>

<p>The swipes at Harris by Trump's camp were reminiscent of a similar tactic that the Republican Trump, president from 2017-2021, used to successfully undermine Ron DeSantis, his main Republican rival before the Florida governor jumped into their party's 2024 election primary race last year.</p>

<p>Corey Lewandowski, a longtime Trump adviser, told Reuters Harris was politically vulnerable given her role in addressing illegal immigration, among other issues that are part of extensive research the party has gathered on her record.</p>

<h3><strong>TRUMP'S UNUSUAL SILENCE</strong></h3>

<p>A former senior staffer in the Trump White House who is still in contact with the Trump campaign said the newfound emphasis on Harris made sense.</p>

<p>"If Joe Biden stays on top of the ticket, given what we've seen, she takes on even more importance. But if he does step aside, she's the potential candidate. This is about defining her," the staffer said, pointing to her low approval ratings in public opinion polls.</p>

<p>Despite her consistently low approval ratings, a Reuters/Ipsos poll earlier this week showed Harris to be as formidable an opponent to Trump as Biden. In a hypothetical matchup, Trump led Harris by a single percentage point, 43% to 42%.</p>

<p>The clamor by Trump's allies is in stark contrast with the unusual silence from the normally voluble former president. Since Biden's poor debate performance, Trump has laid low, making few public appearances or public statements.</p>

<p>"This shows a maturation of the candidate himself. You can teach an old dog new tricks. He's showing increased discipline and message control," said a senior adviser to the Trump campaign familiar with internal discussions.</p>

<p>Even before the June 27 debate, the Trump campaign was beginning to turn its attention to Harris, releasing an attack ad online that mocked her for repeating lines in her speeches.</p>

<p>An online meme promoted by Republicans showed Harris repeating the same phrase "unburdened by what has been" again and again in remarks.</p>

<p>Harris' defenders say she has become more of a target because of her leading role in attacking Trump over abortion rights and her vigorous defense of Biden on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>If Biden were to exit the race before the Democratic National Convention in August, there is no guarantee Harris would be the nominee. But as vice president, she likely would be first in line. She would benefit from Biden's immense campaign war chest and likely see a large segment of Democrats rally around her in a bid to avoid a bitter intra-party battle.</p>

<p>And as the first Black vice president in U.S. history, she provides a bridge to the party's most dependable voting bloc. Her background and relative youth would make for a sharp contrast with Trump, 78.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India on Thursday asked the international community to "isolate and expose" those countries that harbour terrorists, provide safe havens and condone terrorism, saying that if left unchecked, terrorism can become a major threat to regional and global peace, in a veiled jibe at China and Pakistan.</p>

<p>Delivering Prime Minister Narendra Modi's remarks at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Council of Heads of State Summit in the Kazakhstan capital Astana, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, who was physically present at the meeting, recalled that one of the original goals of the SCO is to combat terrorism.</p>

<p>"Many of us have had our experiences, often originating beyond our borders. Let us be clear that if left unchecked, it can become a major threat to regional and global peace. Terrorism in any form or manifestation cannot be justified or condoned," he told the summit, which was attended by Chinese President Xi Jinping, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and and Russian President Vladimir Putin among others.</p>

<p>He said that the international community "must isolate and expose those countries that harbour terrorists, provide safe havens and condone terrorism", in an apparent reference to Pakistan and its all-weather ally China which has often put on hold on proposals in the United Nations to blacklist the Pakistan-based wanted terrorists.</p>

<p>"Cross-border terrorism requires a decisive response and terrorism financing and recruitment must be resolutely countered. We should also take proactive steps to prevent the spread of radicalisation among our youth," he said, adding that the joint statement issued during India's Presidency last year on this subject underlines New Delhi's shared commitment.</p>

<p>He underlined that the SCO provides a unique platform to unite people, collaborate, grow and prosper together, practising the millenia-old principle of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam which means 'The World is One Family'.</p>

<p>"Delivered India's statement at the Summit of SCO Council of Heads of States on behalf of PM Shri @narendramodi ji. Thank the leaders present for conveying their best wishes to Prime Minister @narendramodi on his re-election for a third successive term," Mr Jaishankar later posted on X.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar described the SCO as a principle-based organisation, whose consensus drives the approach of its member states, and said the grouping occupies a "prominent place in our foreign policy".</p>

<p>He said India shares deep civilizational ties with the people of this region. "Recognising the centrality of Central Asia to SCO, we have prioritized their interests and aspirations. It is reflected in greater exchanges, projects and activities with them," he said.</p>

<p>Cooperation in the SCO, for us, has been people-centric, he said, adding that India organised SCO Millet Food Festival, SCO Film Festival, SCO Surajkund Craft Mela, SCO Think-Tanks Conference, and International Conference on Shared Buddhist Heritage during its presidency. "We will naturally support similar endeavors by others," he said.</p>

<p>He also congratulated the Kazakh side for successfully hosting the summit and also conveyed India's best wishes to China for the next presidency of the SCO.</p>

<p>The minister also expressed "deepest condolences" for the tragic demise of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and others in the helicopter crash.</p>

<p>With nine member states -- India, Iran, Kazakhstan, China, Kyrgyz, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan - the Beijing-based SCO has emerged as an influential economic and security bloc and one of the largest trans-regional international organisations. Belarus joined as the 10th member.</p>

<p>Kazakhstan is hosting the summit in its capacity as the current chair of the grouping.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bodhana Sivanandan, a nine-year-old Indian-origin schoolgirl is set to make chess history after she became the youngest person selected to represent England internationally in any sport.</p>

<p>Bodhana, from Harrow in north-west London, will join the England Women's Team at the Chess Olympiad in Budapest, Hungary, in September. The others in her team are all in their 20s, 30s or 40s.</p>

<p>"I found out yesterday after I came back from school when my dad told me. I was happy. I hope I'll do well and I'll get another title," she told the BBC on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Malcolm Pein, manager of the England chess team, described the schoolgirl as one of the most remarkable British chess prodigies he has ever seen.</p>

<p>"It's exciting - she's on course to be one of the best British players ever," he said.</p>

<p>Her father, Siva Sivanandan, says he remains mystified about where his daughter got her talent.</p>

<p>"I'm an engineering graduate, as is my wife, but I'm not good at chess," he said.</p>

<p>Bodhana first picked up chess during the pandemic lockdown when Siva's friend was going back to India and gave her a few bags which also had a chess board.</p>

<p>"I was interested in the pieces, so I started playing," she recalls.</p>

<p>Last December, Sivanandan won the European Blitz Chess Championship in Zagreb, Croatia, and was dubbed "super talented" at the time.</p>

<p>Soon after, she was among a group of young chess enthusiasts invited by British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to 10 Downing Street to mark the government's major new GBP 1 million investment package for the game.</p>

<p>The package has since been in place to support children attending schools in disadvantaged areas across England to learn and play chess, improve the visibility and availability of the game, and fund elite playing.</p>

<p>As part of the package, the UK's Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said it would invest GBP 500,000 in the English Chess Federation (ECF) over two years to develop the next generation of world-class talent. Funds will support expert coaching, training camps and cutting-edge computer analysis for international events to assist current grandmasters and up-and-coming players.</p>

<p>Alongside the support committed to elite players, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) will provide GBP 250,000 to 85 local authorities across England to install 100 new chess tables in public parks and outdoor green spaces to allow more people to play, connect, tackle loneliness, and develop problem-solving skills.</p>

<p>In addition, the outgoing Sunak-led government set out plans to encourage more primary school children, particularly girls, to learn to play the game.</p>

<p>The UK Department for Education offered grants of up to GBP 2,000 to at least 100 schools in disadvantaged areas across England, subject to interest.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain voted Thursday in a general election widely expected to hand the opposition Labour party a landslide win and end nearly a decade-and-a-half of Conservative rule.</p>

<p>The first national ballot since Boris Johnson won the Tories a decisive victory in 2019 follows Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's surprise call to hold it six months earlier than required.</p>

<p>His gamble looks set to backfire spectacularly, with polls throughout the six-week campaign -- and for the last two years -- pointing to a heavy defeat for his right-wing party.</p>

<p>That would almost certainly put Labour leader Keir Starmer, 61, in Downing Street, as leader of the largest party in parliament.</p>

<p>Centre-left Labour is projected to win its first general election since 2005 by historic proportions, with a flurry of election-eve polls all forecasting its biggest-ever victory.</p>

<p>But Starmer was taking nothing for granted as he urged voters not to stay at home. "Britain's future is on the ballot," he said. "But change will only happen if you vote for it."</p>

<h3><strong>'People are not satisfied'</strong></h3>

<p>Voting began at 7:00 am (0600 GMT) in more than 40,000 polling stations across the country, from church halls, community centres and schools to more unusual venues such as pubs and even a ship.</p>

<p>Sunak was among the early birds, casting his ballot at his Richmond and Northallerton constituency in Yorkshire, northern England. Starmer voted around two hours later in his north London seat.</p>

<p>"I just moved back from Australia and I've got the feeling that everything has turned wrong in this country and a lot of people are not satisfied," said Ianthe Jacob, a 32-year-old writer, after voting in Hackney, east London.</p>

<p>In Saint Albans, north of London, 22-year-old student Judith told AFP: "I don't really trust any of them but will vote. A lot of my friends feel the same."</p>

<p>Voting closes at 10:00 pm (2100 GMT). Broadcasters then announce exit polls, which typically provide an accurate picture of how the main parties have performed.</p>

<p>Results from the UK's 650 constituencies trickle in overnight, with the winning party expected to hit 326 seats -- the threshold for a parliamentary majority -- as dawn breaks Friday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Polls suggest voters will punish the Tories after 14 years of often chaotic rule and could oust a string of government ministers, with talk that even Sunak himself might not be safe.</p>

<p>That would make him the first sitting prime minister not to retain his seat in a general election.</p>

<p>"I appreciate people have frustrations with our party," he conceded on Wednesday. "But tomorrow's vote... is a vote about the future."</p>

<h3><strong>Endorsements</strong></h3>

<p>Sunak, 44, is widely seen as having run a dismal campaign, with anger over his decision to leave D-Day commemorations in France early the standout moment.</p>

<p>In new blows Wednesday, The Sun newspaper switched allegiance to Labour -- a key endorsement given the tabloid has backed the winner at every election for several decades.</p>

<p>It follows the Financial Times, the Economist and The Sunday Times as well as traditionally left-leaning papers The Guardian and The Daily Mirror, also endorsing the party.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, three large-scale surveys indicated Labour was on the brink of a record victory, with the Tories set for their worst-ever result and the centrist Liberal Democrats resurgent in third.</p>

<p>YouGov, Focaldata and More in Common all projected Labour would secure at least 430 seats, topping the 418 under Tony Blair in 1997.</p>

<p>The Conservatives could plunge to a record low of less than 127, the trio predicted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Lib Dems were tipped to scoop dozens of seats -- up from their current tally of 15 -- while Nigel Farage's anti-immigrant Reform UK party was set to win a handful.</p>

<p>YouGov and More in Common both forecast the Brexit figurehead would finally become an MP at the eighth time of asking.</p>

<h3><strong>'Decade of national renewal'</strong></h3>

<p>If the predictions are accurate, Sunak will on Friday visit head of state King Charles III to tender his resignation as prime minister.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Starmer will meet the monarch shortly after to take up his invitation to head the next government -- and become prime minister.</p>

<p>The Labour leader will then travel to Downing Street -- the office and residence of British leaders -- where he would be expected to deliver a speech before making ministerial appointments.</p>

<p>It would cap a remarkable political rise for the former human rights lawyer and chief prosecutor, first elected an MP in 2015.</p>

<p>He has promised a "decade of national renewal" but faces a daunting task revitalising creaking public services and a flatlining economy.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hurricane Beryl powered towards Mexico and the Cayman Islands early Thursday, threatening strong winds and a storm surge after battering Jamaica's southern coast.</p>

<p>Beryl weakened to a Category 3 storm overnight, sustaining winds of 125 miles (200 kilometres) an hour, but is forecast to be "at or near major hurricane intensity" while it passes by the Caymans, according to the US National Hurricane Center (NHC).</p>

<p>"Strong winds, dangerous storm surge and damaging winds" were expected across the Cayman Islands overnight, the NHC said early Thursday.</p>

<p>The storm has left a trail of destruction across the Caribbean, killing at least seven people and bringing with it flash floods and mudslides as it moves towards Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.</p>

<p>The storm is the first since NHC records began to reach the Category 4 level in June and the earliest to reach Category 5 in July.</p>

<p>Mexican officials have scrambled to prepare, with the NHC warning Beryl will remain a hurricane until it makes landfall on the Yucatan Peninsula.</p>

<p>"We will have intense rains and wind gusts" from Thursday, Civil Protection national coordinator Laura Velazquez said, announcing the deployment of hundreds of military personnel, marines and electricity workers in anticipation of damage.</p>

<p>The government has prepared 112 shelters with a capacity for around 20,000 people and suspended school in the state of Quintana Roo, where Beryl will likely hit.</p>

<p>In Jamaica, more than 400,000 people were without power, according to the Jamaica Gleaner newspaper, citing a public service company.</p>

<p>Jamaica Prime Minister Andrew Holness had declared a curfew from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm across the island of 2.8 million and urged Jamaicans to comply with evacuation orders.</p>

<p>Desmon Brown, manager of the National Stadium in Kingston, said his staff had scrambled to be ready.</p>

<p>"We've taped up our windows, covered our equipment -- including computers, printers and that sort of thing. Apart from that, it's mainly concrete so there's not much we can do," Brown told the Jamaica Observer newspaper.</p>

<p>'No communication'</p>

<p>Beryl has already left a trail of death with at least three people killed in Grenada, where the storm made landfall Monday, as well as one in St Vincent and the Grenadines and three in Venezuela.</p>

<p>Ralph Gonsalves, prime minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines, said that it would take a "herculean effort" to rebuild after the substantial destruction and that "90-odd percent of the houses were blown away" on Union Island.</p>

<p>"Most of the country doesn't have electricity, and more than half without water at the moment," he said.</p>

<p>Grenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said the island of Carriacou, which was struck by the eye of the storm, has been all but cut off, with houses, telecommunications and fuel facilities there flattened.</p>

<p>The 13.5-square mile (35-square kilometre) island is home to around 9,000 people. At least two people there died, Mitchell said, with a third killed on the country's main island of Grenada when a tree fell on a house.</p>

<p>In St Vincent and the Grenadines, one person on the island of Bequia was reported dead from the storm, while a man died in Venezuela's northeastern coastal state of Sucre when he was swept away by a flooded river, officials there said.</p>

<p>Climate change</p>

<p>It is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.</p>

<p>Warm ocean temperatures are key for hurricanes, and North Atlantic waters are currently between two and five degrees Fahrenheit (1-3 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).&nbsp;</p>

<p>UN climate chief Simon Stiell, who has family on the island of Carriacou, said climate change was "pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction."</p>

<p>"Disasters on a scale that used to be the stuff of science fiction are becoming meteorological facts, and the climate crisis is the chief culprit," he said Monday, reporting that his parents' property was damaged.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Lebanon's Hezbollah said it launched "more than 200" rockets at Israeli military positions Thursday in response to a strike that killed a senior commander of the Iran-backed group.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon's Hezbollah said it launched more than 200 rockets and explosive drones at Israeli military positions on Thursday as tensions have soared amid the almost nine-months-old war raging in Gaza.</p>

<p>The Iran-backed operative group said its latest attack, which followed the launch of over 100 rockets the previous day, came in response to Israel's killing of a senior Hezbollah commander in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>Israel did not report any deaths in its northern border area, where most communities have been evacuated, but quickly said it had responded with strikes on targets in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>Israel and Hezbollah, an ally of Palestinian group Hamas, have exchanged near daily cross-border fire since the Gaza war erupted on October 7, stoking fears the clashes could escalate into all-out war.</p>

<p>UN chief Antonio Guterres is "very worried about the escalation of the exchange of fire", his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Wednesday, warning of the risk to the wider Middle East "if we were to find ourselves in a full-fledged conflict".</p>

<p>Hezbollah and Hamas are part of an Iran-led "Axis of Resistance" against Israel and the United States, a regional alliance that also includes Yemen's Huthi rebels and groups in Iraq and Syria.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said Thursday its forces were "striking launch posts in southern Lebanon" after "numerous projectiles and suspicious aerial targets crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory".</p>

<p>It said that most were intercepted by air defence systems but that "fires broke out in a number of areas in northern Israel" following the attacks.</p>

<p>Israel on Wednesday killed a senior Hezbollah commander, Mohammed Naameh Nasser, near the Lebanese coastal town of Tyre.</p>

<p>A source close to the group described him as the "Hezbollah commander responsible for one of three sectors in south Lebanon". Another border sector chief was killed in an Israeli strike last month.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said that "as part of the response to the... assassination carried out by the enemy" it had fired "more than 200 rockets" and "a squadron of explosive drones" at Israeli bases.</p>

<p>Air raid sirens blared across northern Israel in the morning, and an AFP correspondent witnessed rockets crossing the frontier that were intercepted.</p>

<h3><strong>Heavy battles rock Gaza</strong></h3>

<p>The Gaza war broke out after Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Hamas also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 the army says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 38,011 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.</p>

<p>The Israel-Hezbollah border clashes have killed at least 496 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 95 civilians, according to an AFP tally.</p>

<p>Israeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed on their side of the UN-patrolled border.</p>

<p>The Gaza war at the heart of the regional tensions has meanwhile raged on, and gun battles, air strikes and artillery shelling rocked Gaza City for an eight day on Thursday.</p>

<p>Israeli troops over the past day had "destroyed tunnel routes in the area and eliminated dozens of terrorists in close-quarters combat with tank fire, and in aerial strikes," said the military.</p>

<p>Gaza's civil defence agency said at least five people were killed in a strike that hit a Gaza City school.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fears of renewed heavy fighting have also surged in Gaza's southern areas near Khan Yunis and Rafah after the military on Monday issued a sweeping evacuation order that the UN said impacted 250,000 people.</p>

<p>Witnesses reported air strikes and intense artillery shelling in western Rafah on Thursday.</p>

<h3><strong>Efforts towards truce</strong></h3>

<p>Israel has faced an international outcry over the soaring civilian death toll, punishing siege and mass destruction in Gaza.</p>

<p>The UN humanitarian coordinator for Gaza, Sigrid Kaag, this week again called for an end to the "maelstrom of human misery".</p>

<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted Israel will destroy Hamas and bring home the remaining hostages.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden, under growing domestic pressure over Washington's support for Israel, in late May outlined a roadmap for a six-week ceasefire and exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.</p>

<p>There has been little progress since, but Hamas said Wednesday it was communicating with officials in Qatar and Egypt as well as Turkey with an eye to ending the conflict.</p>

<p>Hamas said its Qatar-based political chief Ismail Haniyeh had "made contact with the mediator brothers in Qatar and Egypt about the ideas that the movement is discussing with them with the aim of reaching an agreement".</p>

<p>Netanyahu's office and the Mossad intelligence service said "Israel is evaluating the (Hamas) remarks and will convey its reply to the mediators".</p>

<p>The main stumbling block so far has centred on Hamas's demand for a permanent end to the fighting -- a demand Netanyahu and his right-wing nationalist government allies strongly reject.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britons began voting on Thursday in a parliamentary election that is expected to bring Keir Starmer's Labour Party to power, sweeping away Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservatives after 14 often turbulent years.</p>

<p>Opinion polls put Starmer's centre-left party on course for a landslide victory but also suggest many voters simply want change after a period of infighting and turmoil under the Conservatives that led to five prime ministers in eight years.</p>

<p>This means Starmer, a 61-year-old former human rights lawyer, could take office with one of the biggest to-do lists in British history but without a groundswell of support or the financial resources to tackle it.</p>

<p>"Today, Britain can begin a new chapter," Starmer told voters in a statement on Thursday. "We cannot afford five more years under the Conservatives. But change will only happen if you vote Labour."</p>

<p>The country's 40,000 polling stations opened at 0600 GMT.</p>

<p>Sunak, 44, was among those to vote early. He was pictured leaving a polling station in his Richmond constituency in northern England, holding hands with his wife Akshata Murty.</p>

<p>Having called the election months earlier than expected, Sunak has in recent weeks abandoned his call for a fifth consecutive Conservative victory, switching instead to warning of the dangers of an unchallenged Labour Party in parliament.</p>

<p>Sunak issued a fresh rallying cry to voters for election day, saying a Labour government would hike taxes, hamper economic recovery and leave Britain more vulnerable at a time of geopolitical tension, charges Labour deny.</p>

<p>"They will do lasting damage to our country and our economy - just like they did the last time they were in power," Sunak said on Thursday. "Don't let that happen."</p>

<p>Polls were due to close at 10 p.m. (2100 GMT) when an exit poll will give the first sign of the outcome. Detailed official results are expected in the early hours of Friday.</p>

<h3><strong>Punishing Government</strong></h3>

<p>If the opinion polls are correct, Britain will follow other European countries in punishing their governments after a cost of living crisis that stemmed from the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Unlike France it looks set to move to the centre left and not further right.</p>

<p>Labour has held a poll lead of between 15 and 20 points since shortly after Sunak was chosen by his lawmakers in October 2022 to replace Liz Truss who resigned after 44 days, having sparked a bond market meltdown and a collapse in sterling.</p>

<p>Modelling by pollsters predicts Labour is on course for one of the biggest election victories in British history, with a likely majority in parliament that would exceed those achieved by Tony Blair or Margaret Thatcher, although a high number of voters are undecided and turnout could be low.</p>

<p>Such an outcome would have been unthinkable at Britain's last election in 2019 when Boris Johnson won a large victory for the Conservatives, with politicians predicting that the party would be in power for at least 10 years as Labour was finished.</p>

<p>Starmer, the former chief prosecutor of England and Wales, took over Labour from veteran socialist Jeremy Corbyn after it suffered its worst defeat for 84 years in 2019, and dragged it back to the centre.</p>

<p>At the same time, the Conservatives in Westminster have imploded, ripped apart by scandal under Johnson and the rancour that followed the vote to leave the European Union, and a failure to deliver on the demands of its broad 2019 voter base.</p>

<p>While Johnson destroyed the party's reputation for integrity, Truss eroded its long-held economic credibility, leaving Sunak to steady the ship. During his time inflation returned to target from its 41-year high of 11.1% and he resolved some Brexit tensions, but the polls have not budged.</p>

<p>Sunak's election campaign has been hit by a string of gaffes. He announced the vote in driving rain, his early departure from a D-Day event in France angered veterans, and allegations of election gambling among aides reignited talk of scandal.</p>

<p>The unexpected arrival of Nigel Farage to lead the right-wing Reform UK has also eaten into the Conservatives' vote, while the centrist Liberal Democrats are predicted to fare well in the party's affluent heartlands in southern England.</p>

<h3><strong>Promise Of Change</strong></h3>

<p>Starmer could also benefit from a Labour recovery in Scotland after the Scottish National Party embarked on its own self-destructive path following a funding scandal.</p>

<p>But Starmer may find his fortunes more sorely tested in Downing Street.</p>

<p>His campaign was built around a one-word promise of 'Change', tapping into anger at the state of stretched public services and falling living standards. But he will have few levers to pull, with the tax burden set to hit its highest since 1949 and net debt almost equivalent to annual economic output.</p>

<p>Starmer has consistently warned that he will not be able to fix anything quickly, and his party has courted international investors to help address the challenges.</p>

<p>Sunak has argued that his 20 months in charge have set the economy on an upward path and Labour should not be allowed to put that in jeopardy.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine said Thursday its forces had withdrawn from a district in the key eastern town of Chasiv Yar, where Russian forces have recently claimed several advances.</p>

<p>The fall of the small hilltop town is a worrying prospect for Ukraine because it would likely accelerate Russian advances towards large civilian hubs in the wider eastern Donetsk region.</p>

<p>"It became impractical to hold the Kanal district, which the enemy had entered because it threatened the lives and well-being of our soldiers," a Ukrainian military spokesman said on state-run television.</p>

<p>"Our defenders' positions had been destroyed. The command decided to retreat to better protected and prepared positions," Nazar Voloshyn added.</p>

<p>Russia had said earlier this week that its forces had advanced around Chasiv Yar but it was unclear if it was claiming its forces had crossed a canal that runs through the eastern part of the town.</p>

<p>Chasiv Yar -- a prized military hub that was once a sleepy home to some 12,000 people -- lies near the larger towns of Kostyantynivka and Kramatorsk, which are both important military centres, too.</p>

<p>The Kremlin says the industrial Donetsk region is part of Russia and the region has borne the brunt of fighting after Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February 2022.</p>

<p>Kremlin-supported separatist forces have controlled parts of Donetsk since 2014.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak urged voters to choose the Conservative party as polling booths opened across the&nbsp;country for the general election.&nbsp;Sharing a photo with his wife, Akshata Murty, at a polling booth, the UK PM asked voters to stop the Labour "supermajority".</p>

<p>"The polls are open. Vote Conservative to stop the Labour supermajority which would mean higher taxes for a generation," he said in a post on X. The photo showed the couple holding hands and walking to a polling booth.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The polls are open.<br />
<br />
Vote Conservative to stop the Labour supermajority which would mean higher taxes for a generation. <a href="https://t.co/NPH7lSeDFc">pic.twitter.com/NPH7lSeDFc</a></p>
— Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak) <a href="https://twitter.com/RishiSunak/status/1808760847063298126?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>The 44-year-old Indian-origin PM faces voter angst towards the incumbent Conservative Party which has been in power for over 14 years under five prime ministers.</p>

<p>Throughout the six-week campaign that followed Mr Sunak's sudden call for elections, the UK PM has trailed behind 61-year-old Keir Starmer who leads the Labour Party.</p>

<p>“Stop Labour's supermajority” is the central message Mr Sunak was trying to drive home as he wrapped up his campaign, even as most of the incumbent Conservatives all but conceded defeat in the general election.</p>

<p>“Labour will put up your taxes. Again and again and again,” he posted on social media as the catch-all message to wind up the campaign trail.</p>

<p>Around 40,000 polling booths opened across the country at 7am local time as an estimated 46 million registered voters began turning out to mark a cross next to their chosen candidate on a paper ballot.</p>

<p>Once the votes are cast and the booths officially close at 10 pm local time, the focus shifts to the definitive exit poll soon after which gives a fair snapshot of what can be expected&nbsp;UK-wide. Counting commences up and down the country right away, with the first results expected just before midnight local time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris is engaged in a delicate balancing act, playing cheerleader for President Joe Biden while standing by as a leading contender to replace him if he ends his reelection bid.</p>

<p>Biden's dismal performance in last week's debate with Donald Trump has triggered panic in much of the Democratic Party as people question whether Biden is physically and mentally able to beat Trump and serve another four years.</p>

<p>Former congressman Tim Ryan, while professing his admiration for Biden, wrote in a piece for Newsweek that "the Democratic nominee in 2024 should be Kamala Harris."</p>

<p>Jim Clyburn, a senior House Democrat, and Black leader, told MSNBC: "We should do everything we can to bolster her -- whether it's in second place or at the top of the ticket."</p>

<p>Harris herself has not publicly voiced any desire to replace Biden.</p>

<p>"Look, Joe Biden is our nominee," she said in an interview Tuesday with CBS News. "We beat Trump once, and we're going to beat him again, period."</p>

<p>She said she was proud to be on the current ticket with the president.</p>

<p>Shortly after the debate, Harris rushed onto TV to defend Biden, admitting he had started off slowly in the clash with Trump, but saying he ultimately finished strong.</p>

<p>The official schedule for Biden on Wednesday said he had lunch with Harris, which is not a regular event, though it was a weekly fixture for Biden when he was vice president under Barack Obama.</p>

<h3><strong>One heartbeat&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Harris, 59, is the first woman, the first Black person, and the first person of Asian origin -- her mother was from India -- to hold the job that puts her a heartbeat from the presidency, as Americans like to say.</p>

<p>Harris would become president if Biden died in office or became incapacitated.</p>

<p>But she would not necessarily replace Biden if he were to end his candidacy, and Biden has insisted he has no plans to do so.</p>

<p>"For three and half years there has always been this drumbeat that someone other than the VP should be the Democratic candidate," said Ange-Marie Hancock, professor of political science at The Ohio State University.</p>

<p>Hancock said it was possible an "undercurrent of racism and sexism" was at work against Harris.</p>

<p>For years Harris has been less popular among Americans than other Democrats seen as possible candidates, such as California Governor Gavin Newsom or his Michigan counterpart Gretchen Whitmer.</p>

<p>US media have reported extensively on mistakes she made early in this administration, mainly on the diplomatic front, and on tension among her staffers.</p>

<p>But Hancock said things could turn in Harris's favor, because she has spent time out visiting battleground states, in particular, to promote abortion rights as it came under repeated fire from conservative judges and governors.</p>

<p>Flickers of that turn could be seen on social media, where supportive Harris-related memes have begun going viral under the hashtag #KHive.</p>

<p>Harris is sometimes criticized as disappointing as an orator. But she got a warm welcome recently when she made a tour of universities that was focused on schools with high numbers of minority students.</p>

<p>She'll make more stops in July to speak with African American audiences, particularly women, with three trips to Louisiana, Texas, and Indiana.</p>

<h3><strong>Polling&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>A CNN poll released Tuesday had Harris doing better than Biden against Trump, although not beating him.</p>

<p>This poll gave Harris 45 percent of voter intentions against 47 percent for Trump, while Biden scored 43 percent to 49 percent for the Republican former president in a race between the two men.</p>

<p>In the event Biden was to drop out, Harris, thanks to her name recognition, her ties to powerful people in the government, and the prospect for brisk fundraising, would go into the Democratic convention next month in a position of strength.</p>

<p>But the Republicans are ready and waiting.</p>

<p>"Kamala Harris is very much on the GOP's radar," Hancock said, referring to Trump's party.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign on Wednesday broadcast a video montage of Biden suffering falls and other embarrassing moments, and questioned whether he can serve another term.</p>

<p>It concludes with the question, "And you know who is waiting behind him, right?" and footage of Harris laughing.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As residents of Joe Biden's hometown, Scranton prepared to mark that most American of holidays -- July 4 -- many were also voicing alarm about the US president following his disastrous debate last week against Donald Trump.</p>

<p>"I think he should never have done that (debate)," said Dennis Frison, 70, a retired food service worker as he smoked a cigarette outside the Pennsylvania coal mining town's buzzing Whiskey Dick's bar on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Scranton has long been the heart of the political mythology around Biden, recalling his hardscrabble upbringing, repaying his affection with an expressway named for him and a life-size cardboard cutout in Hank's Hoagies sandwich store.</p>

<p>But Pennsylvania remains a key battleground in the 2024 election, and national polls are showing warning signs after Biden's faltering performance against White House challenger Trump sparked widespread panic over his ability to finish a second term.</p>

<p>"I think he can still do what he needs to do as the president, he's just not as cognizant as he used to be," Frison said of the 81-year-old.</p>

<p>As for the alternatives, Frison said he was wary of Biden being replaced by his vice president, Kamala Harris, because of comments she has previously made about not seeking to pass laws to help Black people.</p>

<p>Like others in the town, however, he could not name anyone other than Harris to step up to replace "Scranton Joe" at the top of the Democratic ticket.</p>

<h3><strong>'Placeholder candidate'?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>And the vice president found more support elsewhere -- such as outside the town's Marketplace mall, where Silvera Kosarev, 21, was signing up voters for November's election.</p>

<p>"Of course, I'm not impressed by Biden... he's just kind of like a placeholder candidate to get over (the election) and then get someone else into office if he wants to step aside," they said.</p>

<p>"I'd be fine for Kamala (Harris) if she just stepped in. I'm just absolutely anti-Trump."</p>

<p>Others in the town did support Trump -- and did not mince their words about Biden.</p>

<p>"To me, it was like he has dementia (or) Alzheimer's, the way he speaks. It's just not good at all," said Sheryl Krauter, 33, who relocated to Scranton from Queens in New York.</p>

<p>"When Trump was president, everything was settled a little bit and nobody messed with us. (Now) everything is all over the place," she said as stallholders set up around her on Courthouse Square for Thursday's Independence Day celebrations.</p>

<p>Given Biden's highly-anticipated debate performance, during which he garbled answers and lost his train of thought, allowing Trump to deliver falsehoods and misinformation unchallenged, she questioned Biden's state away from piercing public scrutiny.</p>

<p>A short drive away from the fudge and rice pudding stands is the wooden, three-storey house with a neatly manicured front lawn where Biden grew up.</p>

<p>A small poster invites visitors to photograph the home from the street -- although not one of the neighboring houses displayed a Biden-Harris campaign sign.</p>

<p>A few doors down from Biden's former home, Jamie Hayes said she was "embarrassed" for Biden after his debate performance.</p>

<p>"I felt he didn't feel well, and he probably shouldn't have gone on stage. He probably made the worst of two (choices) -- if he didn't go on, I'm sure they would have felt he was backing down," said the 73-year-old grandmother.</p>

<p>"(But) I do believe that he has surrounded himself with enough people who are like-minded that could step in," she said.</p>

<p>"I've heard more about Kamala Harris, and so I would support her."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britons headed to the polls Thursday in a general election widely expected to emphatically return the opposition Labour party to power and end nearly a decade-and-a-half of Conservative rule.</p>

<p>The country's first national ballot since Boris Johnson won a landslide for the Tories in 2019 follows Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's surprise call to hold it six months earlier than required.</p>

<p>His gamble looks set to backfire spectacularly, with polls throughout the six-week campaign -- and for the last two years -- pointing to a heavy defeat for his right-wing party.</p>

<p>That would almost certainly put Labour leader Keir Starmer, 61, in Downing Street, as leader of the largest party in parliament.</p>

<p>Centre-left Labour is projected to win its first general election since 2005 by historic proportions, with a flurry of election-eve polls all forecasting its biggest-ever victory.</p>

<p>But Starmer was taking nothing for granted as he urged voters not to stay at home. "Britain's future is on the ballot," he said. "But change will only happen if you vote for it."</p>

<p><strong>Long night</strong></p>

<p>Voting began at 7:00 am in more than 40,000 polling stations across the country, from church halls, community centres and schools to more unusual venues such as pubs and even a ship.</p>

<p>At 10:00 pm, broadcasters then announce exit polls, which typically provide an accurate picture of how the main parties have performed.</p>

<p>Results from the UK's 650 constituencies trickle in overnight, with the winning party expected to hit 326 seats -- the threshold for a parliamentary majority -- as dawn breaks Friday.</p>

<p>Polls suggest voters will punish the Tories after 14 years of often chaotic rule and could oust a string of government ministers, with talk that even Sunak himself might not be safe.</p>

<p>That would make him the first sitting prime minister not to retain his seat in a general election.</p>

<p>"I appreciate people have frustrations with our party," he conceded on Wednesday. "But tomorrow's vote... is a vote about the future."</p>

<p><strong>Endorsements</strong></p>

<p>Sunak, 44, is widely seen as having run a dismal campaign, with anger over his decision to leave D-Day commemorations in France early the standout moment.</p>

<p>In new blows Wednesday, The Sun newspaper switched allegiance to Labour -- a key endorsement given the tabloid has backed the winner at every election for several decades.</p>

<p>It follows the Financial Times, the Economist and The Sunday Times as well as traditionally left-leaning papers The Guardian and The Daily Mirror, also endorsing the party.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, three large-scale surveys indicated Labour was on the brink of a record victory, with the Tories set for their worst-ever result and the centrist Liberal Democrats resurgent in third.</p>

<p>YouGov, Focaldata and More in Common all projected Labour would secure at least 430 seats, topping the 418 under Tony Blair in 1997.</p>

<p>The Conservatives could plunge to a record low of less than 127, the trio predicted.</p>

<p>The Lib Dems were tipped to scoop dozens of seats -- up from their current tally of 15 -- while Nigel Farage's anti-immigrant Reform UK party was set to win a handful.</p>

<p>YouGov and More in Common both forecast the Brexit figurehead would finally become an MP at the eighth time of asking.</p>

<p><strong>'National renewal'</strong></p>

<p>If the predictions are accurate, Sunak will on Friday visit head of state King Charles III to tender his resignation as prime minister.</p>

<p>Starmer will meet the monarch shortly after to take up his invitation to head the next government -- and become prime minister.</p>

<p>The Labour leader will then travel to Downing Street -- the office and residence of British leaders -- where he would be expected to deliver a speech before making ministerial appointments.</p>

<p>It would cap a remarkable political rise for the former human rights lawyer and chief prosecutor, first elected an MP in 2015.</p>

<p>He has promised a "decade of national renewal" but faces a daunting task revitalising creaking public services and a flatlining economy.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi will soon embark on a trip to the Russian Federation, where he will hold talks with President Vladimir Putin. This will be Modi's first foreign visit for a bilateral meeting in his third term. While the announcement has already raised eyebrows across the globe, it is emblematic of the fact that India will continue to do a balancing act under Modi 3.0 and reassure Russia of its goodwill and partnership. Meanwhile, Modi will be skipping the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit beginning today in Astana, Kazakhstan, with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar representing India there instead.</p>

<p>Modi last visited Russia in 2019, when he attended the Eastern Economic Forum and the annual bilateral summit, a process instituted in 2000.&nbsp;The last talks between the two leaders were in December 2021, during Putin's visit to India.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Given that this will be the first bilateral summit between India and Russia since the latter began its "special military operations” in Ukraine in February 2022, the Ukraine conflict and trade — which has reached unprecedented levels mainly on account of discounted Russian oil — will obviously be at the top of the agenda. The two countries are also set to upgrade their defence relations with a new agreement that will involve joint deployment of troops, warships, and fighter jets&nbsp;— something India has never done with any other country. An agreement on logistics support is on the cards too.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Russia-China Friendship Is Deepening, But...</strong></h2>

<p>It is widely believed that Modi is skipping the SCO summit to avoid a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping given the fraught relations between the two neighbours since the Galwan clashes in the summer of 2020. Simultaneously, India in recent times has been alarmed by the deepening ties between Russia and China. No doubt, talks will focus on this aspect too.</p>

<p>The Russia-China partnership has evolved since the Ukraine war began. China was the first country that Putin chose for an official visit after his re-election in March this year. As a bigger neighbouring country with far deeper pockets than India's, this is natural. Bilateral trade between the two countries stands at over $240 billion. China is Russia's largest crude importer, while Chinese goods, from automobiles to clothes, have been filling the void left by the flight of Western companies from Russia. The Chinese yuan accounted for 34.5% of Russia's total export payments over the past two years. China has supplied Russia with dual technology, and the two have also been conducting joint military exercises. In fact, Beijing has been accused by the West of both abetting and benefiting from the Ukraine conflict.</p>

<p>Yet, the Russia-China partnership is not foolproof. There are avenues New Delhi and Moscow can explore in order to balance China's influence in the Eurasian region.</p>

<h2><b>There Are Gaps To Fill</b></h2>

<p>Perhaps a big indicator of the gaps in the Russia-China relationship is the lack of movement on the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline, which Russia is keen to get started to prop up its economy. According to Russian analysts, this was the main reason for Putin's Beijing visit. Yet, nothing came of it. Rather, industry experts in China have been talking about the non-feasibility of the pipeline.</p>

<p>Putin followed up his visit to China with trips to Uzbekistan, North Korea, and Vietnam. All three destinations are symbolic of larger geopolitical shifts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Uzbekistan, part of the post-Soviet space in Central Asia, lies in Russia's strategic backyard. China's inroads in the region were restricted to the economic sphere, with Russia retaining its military and strategic influence. This was a key reason for the establishment of the SCO. But Russia's distraction with Ukraine has upended this arrangement.</p>

<p>For instance, a railway line mooted almost two decades ago but which remains in the pipeline because of Moscow's reservations, was recently greenlit by China, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan - another close Russian ally in post-Soviet Central Asia. The route will run from Kashgar in China through Kyrgyzstan and will terminate in Uzbekistan's Andijan province, bypassing Russian territory. Moreover, the Kyrgyz part of the route will be financed by Chinese loans, pushing it deeper into Chinese debt.</p>

<p>For perspective, similar Chinese debt owed by Tajikistan, which houses Russia's largest foreign military base abroad, has resulted in Tajikistan ceding territory to the Chinese to station their own base there.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was to regain this space that Tashkent became Putin's second destination upon assuming office again. Most significant were the deals signed for nuclear cooperation, under which Russia would build a small nuclear power plant — Central Asia's first — and increase gas supplies from Russia to Uzbekistan. Modernisation of the gas transportation system is also part of the deals, signifying long-term plans.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Russia In China's Backyard</strong></h2>

<p>Putin's other two visits were to North Korea and Vietnam in East and Southeast Asia, which China considers its strategic backyard.</p>

<p>In North Korea, the two sides signed a defence treaty, diversifying the former's security partnerships. Thus far, China had been the only country with which North Korea had a defence alliance. China's response to this agreement has been muted, but analysts say that it's actually a headache for Beijing as it fears that the pact may attract unnecessary American attention to the region. The deal also has the potential to cause a power imbalance in Northeast Asia.</p>

<p>With Vietnam, China had strained relations till most recently. Yet, while ties have improved at the party level and in the economic sphere, the Vietnamese military is still wary of Beijing and its expansionist policy in the South China Sea, where Vietnam's Special Economic Zone lies.&nbsp;A slew of agreements were signed between Russia and Vietnam during Putin's visit, including in the energy sector. The Russian president also expressed his desire to increase cooperation with ASEAN.</p>

<p>More recently, last week, Russia finalised an agreement with another Chinese ally, Cambodia, for cooperation between their ground forces. This was a first in bilateral relations between the two countries.</p>

<h2><strong>Putin's Asia Pivot</strong></h2>

<p>Overall, Russia has been pivoting to Asia since at least 2014, when the first sanctions were imposed on it by the West. With his North Korea and Vietnam visits, Putin demonstrated that he has options in the region. And this is something China is not excited about. Beijing sees itself as the natural leader of the global South and is the major power in ASEAN. Russia, it feels, is just a newcomer.</p>

<p>According to Prof. Baladas Ghoshal, former Professor and Chair in Southeast Asian Studies at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, “Southeast Asian countries are more focused on development and economy, for which they depend on China. However, they are not too comfortable with being too close to China." The recent desire of a number of ASEAN countries such as Malaysia and Thailand to join BRICS stems from this intention of hedging against China and seeking a balance with other powers, like Russia.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Sri Lanka Example</strong></h2>

<p>This provides a window of opportunity for cooperation between India and Russia in third countries to balance China's expanding footprint. South Asia, the Indian sphere of influence where China has been making deep inroads, already offers such an example. In April, the Sri Lankan cabinet announced that it was handing over the management of the Chinese-built Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport to India's Shaurya Aeronautics (Pvt) Ltd. and Russia's Airports of Regions Management Company. The $209 million airport had been running losses since 2013. Strategically located close to the China-managed Hambantota port, the joint Indo-Russian presence will help counter Chinese influence close to India's borders.</p>

<p>The two countries are also cooperating in the Roopur nuclear power plant in Bangladesh, where Russia is constructing the power plant while India is assisting with logistics. Another example is the sale of the Brahmos cruise missile system to the Philippines, which is currently engaged in a tussle with China in the South China Sea. The missile was jointly developed by India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Russia's NPOM, and&nbsp;Russian endorsement was needed for its export.</p>

<p>This India-Russia cooperation can be extended to ASEAN and Central Asian countries as well. For instance, India, Vietnam, and Russia can work together in the hydrocarbon sector as ONGC Videsh has a presence in Vietnam. Defence is another area where the two can cooperate. This makes sense because not only are Central Asian countries tied to Russia through the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, but ASEAN members like Vietnam and Indonesia have also traditionally had close defence cooperation with Moscow.</p>

<p>It's true that India and Russia lack China's deep pockets. But where China's calling card is its massive investments and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Russia and India can leverage their position through joint efforts towards invigorating trade and investments in Central Asia, the ASEAN region, and even South Asia. It'll be a win for not just countries in these three regions, but also Russia and India as they counter China's expansionist policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In what was the first major upset of Wimbledon 2024, Emma Navarro defeated Naomi Osaka 6-4, 6-1 on Wednesday. Ms Osaka, a four-time Grand Slam champion, was playing her first Wimbledon tournament in five years. Ms Navarro, currently world 17, defeated the former world number 1, in less than an hour at Centre Court.<br />
<br />
Navarro has yet to lose a set in the tournament. She will face Diana Shnaider in the third round of Wimbledon on Friday.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Here are some facts about the rising tennis star:</strong><br />
<br />
1. Emma Navarro was born in New York City in 2001. Her passion for tennis started in early childhood and she decided to pursue the sport seriously by fourth grade.

Her late grandfather, Frank Navarro, was a college football player and coach.<br />
<br />
2. She is the daughter of Ben Navarro, an American billionaire and founder of Sherman Financial Group, which runs Credit One. According to Forbes, Ben Navarro's net worth is approximately $1.5 billion, surpassing the combined wealth of tennis legends Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal.

<br />
3. The 23-year-old's big breakthrough in tennis came in 2019 when she won the junior French Open doubles title alongside Chloe Beck.

<br />
4. In 2020, Ms Navarro enrolled at the University of Virginia, where she continued to excel in tennis.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Top-secret Australian military intelligence will be stored on a custom cloud server built by US tech giant Amazon, Canberra said Thursday as it unveiled the US$1.3 billion deal.</p>

<p>The Australian government said Amazon Web Services would design a "top secret" cloud for the country's military and intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>It would lead to "greater interoperability and deeper collaboration with the United States", one of Australia's most steadfast military allies, a government statement said.</p>

<p>Australian spy boss Rachel Noble said the cloud would also support the country's "Redspice" intelligence program, which aims to counter the growing risk of cyber attacks.</p>

<p>Amazon would build three data centres across Australia.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The drumbeat of pressure on Joe Biden to drop out of the US presidential race intensified Wednesday with a bombshell report in the New York Times that he had conceded the possibility to a key ally, as well as movement within his own party to demand his withdrawal.</p>

<p>The White House and Biden's campaign quickly denied the Times report suggesting the president had vocalized to a supporter that he could ill-afford another misstep that would irrevocably damage his campaign. Biden himself insisted to campaign staff he intended to remain in the race.</p>

<p>"I'm in this race to the end and we're going to win because when Democrats unite, we will always win," Biden said in a call alongside Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Yet time is running out for the beleaguered president to convince anxious Democratic officials, donors and voters that he remains viable in his effort to keep former President Donald Trump from returning to office. In another blow, dozens of Democratic lawmakers are considering signing a letter demanding Biden withdraw from the race, a senior party official said.</p>

<p>That anxiety has only been fueled by a flood of recent reporting suggesting other Democrats are eyeing possible replacement candidates - and by the Times reporting.</p>

<p>Biden told his ally the race would be in a "different place" if upcoming events went poorly, the Times reported. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre subsequently said Biden had flatly denied making such a comment.</p>

<p>Biden plans to sit for an interview with ABC News on Friday, and hold a rally in Madison, Wisconsin. On Sunday, he'll travel to Philadelphia for another campaign event. He also plans interviews with Black radio stations in Philadelphia and Milwaukee to coincide with his travel.</p>

<p>Biden has been calling senior Democratic lawmakers - including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries - in a bid to shore up support on Capitol Hill, even as members of his party are publicly expressing dismay about his campaign.</p>

<p>So far, only two sitting House Democrats - Lloyd Doggett of Texas and Raul Grijalva of Arizona - have publicly called for Biden to step aside. But the President may not be able to survive a coordinated revolt among Democratic lawmakers worried that his poor performance could cost them seats or a shot at control of the House and Senate in the upcoming election.</p>

<p>Jean-Pierre said Biden had told her the calls with congressional Democrats were "strong."</p>

<p>"He's moving forward as being president. He's moving forward with his campaign," she added.</p>

<p>A Senate Democrat, however, said Wednesday evening that several colleagues had privately indicated they didn't see a way for the president to survive politically. The senator, granted anonymity to speak frankly about discussions among colleagues, said Biden hadn't assuaged concerns about his debate collapse against Trump.</p>

<p>Biden served for 36 years in the Senate, and Democrats there have been largely silent about his candidacy during a week of turmoil.</p>

<p>Later on Wednesday, Biden held a hastily arranged meeting with Democratic governors, many of whom are at the center of speculation about possibly replacing him on the ticket. Several emerged to say that they were firmly behind Biden. "The president was very clear that he is in this to win this," Governor Wes Moore of Maryland told reporters.</p>

<h2><strong>Crisis Meeting</strong></h2>

<p>Moore and other nationally prominent governors with extensive fundraising networks like California's Gavin Newsom, Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer and Illinois's JB Pritzker went to the White House for the crisis meeting in person, while others joined virtually.</p>

<p>"I heard three words from the president - he's all in. And so am I. Joe Biden's had our back. Now it's time to have his," Newsom said.</p>

<p>But other recent reports have spurred speculation among Democratic allies. On Tuesday, the Washington Post said that former President Barack Obama had privately conveyed to allies that Biden's path to reelection was more challenging following his debate performance.</p>

<p>Reuters published a new poll showing Harris - the most likely successor if Biden were to step aside - trailing Trump, the Republican candidate, by a single point. Momentum behind the vice president, who could take over the campaign's sizable war chest, has gathered in recent days. The pair had lunch together on Wednesday afternoon and jointly dialed into their campaign's conference call.</p>

<p>A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll in May showed Harris gaining trust among swing-state voters, 48% of whom say she's ready to assume the duties of the presidency if Biden were unable to continue.</p>

<p>The Leadership Now Project, a group of business leaders who had organized to counter what they saw as threats to democracy during the last Trump administration, called for Biden to cede his place as the Democratic nominee.</p>

<p>"This process will undoubtedly be messy and is not without risk," the group said in a statement. "However, the stakes are too high not to act."</p>

<h2><strong>All-Hands Calls</strong></h2>

<p>In Wilmington, Delaware, staffers at Biden's campaign headquarters received an email from campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez and chair Jen O'Malley Dillon saying the campaign would increase its cadence of all-staff calls and emails to better coordinate.</p>

<p>White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients held a similar all-hands meeting with staffers there on Wednesday, imploring them to keep their heads held high and continue executing their responsibilities while acknowledging Biden "didn't have a great night."</p>

<p>"People are looking for chatter," he said, according to a recording of the call obtained by Bloomberg. "Tune it out."</p>

<p>The campaign's memo asked staffers to emphasize the "full picture" of Biden's support, downplaying recent polls that have shown a noticeable tilt toward Trump.</p>

<p>"Polls are a snapshot in time and we should all expect them to continue to fluctuate - it will take a few weeks, not a few days, to get a full picture of the race," the pair wrote.</p>

<p>Part of that effort included sending a memo to congressional staffers stressing that polls remained within the margin of error, and the campaign's belief that a bad showing in the coming weeks did not actually indicate "a reshaping of the race."</p>

<p>A New York Times/Siena College poll released Wednesday, though, found Trump's lead over Biden had grown to six points, 49% to 43%, with nearly three-quarters of voters saying the Democratic president is too old for the job.</p>

<p>South Carolina Democrat Jim Clyburn, a leading Biden supporter who spoke with the president on Wednesday, told CNN he wants to see the president in "town-hall type" events now and performing there would calm some fears.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

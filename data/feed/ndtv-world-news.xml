       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu wrote to Narendra Modi today condoling the death of industrialist and global icon Ratan Tata. He said many people in his country are mourning Mr Tata's death.</p>

<p>Ratan Tata died on October 9 at Mumbai's Breach Candy Hospital, where he was admitted for a routine health check due to his age.</p>

<p>Mr Netanyahu joined several world leaders in paying a tribute to Mr Tata, who was one of the most respected industrial titans in India. He is credited for his <span jsslot=""><span class="JgzqYd">philanthropic </span></span>work and for expanding the Tata Group to more than 100 countries.</p>

<p>"India and the world have lost a giant with a giant heart," said Eric Garcetti, US Ambassador to India, in his condolence message. He went on to say "When I was nominated to serve as ambassador, the first congratulations from India came from Ratan Tata."</p>

<p>Mr Garcetti also mentioned how Mr Tata "gave so much in service to my hometown, serving on the board of the University of Southern California. He saw a future of greater prosperity and equality for his country and did so much for our world," adding that "May his memory be a blessing."</p>

<p>Remembering Ratan Tata's "visionary contribution", French President Emmanuel Macron said, "France has lost a dear friend from India.

Beyond this, his legacy will be marked by his humanist vision, immense philanthropic achievements and his humility."</p>

<p>Several prominent business leaders also sent their tributes, with Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Microsoft founder Bill Gates being among the first to do so.</p>

<p>Mr Pichai recalled his last meeting with Mr Tata, saying "My last meeting with Ratan Tata at Google, we talked about the progress of Waymo and his vision was inspiring to hear. He leaves an extraordinary business and philanthropic legacy and was instrumental in mentoring and developing the modern business leadership in India."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, released a letter from her doctor today that pronounced her in good health and fit for high office, in an effort to draw a contrast with her counterpart, Donald Trump.</p>

<p>In a memo distributed by the White House, the vice president's physician, Joshua Simmons, said Harris's most recent physical exam in April was "unremarkable," that she maintains an active lifestyle and "very healthy diet" despite a busy schedule, suffers from seasonal allergies and sporadic hives, does not use tobacco and drinks alcohol only in moderation.</p>

<p>"She possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief," the doctor wrote.</p>

<p>Harris, 59, is running against Republican Trump, 78, for the White House. She made her medical information public today in an effort to draw attention to his refusal to do so, a Harris campaign aide said.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign is eager to highlight the former president's age since he became the oldest candidate in the race after President Joe Biden, 81, stepped aside as the Democratic standard bearer following a poor debate performance against Trump.</p>

<p>Locked in a very tight race. Harris' campaign hopes that contrasting her comparative youth and mental acuity with Trump's more advanced age and tendency to meander, along with the differences in transparency between the two, will help convince undecided voters that she is more fit for office than he.</p>

<p>A White House doctor said in 2018 when Trump was in office that he was in overall excellent health then but needed to shed weight and start a daily exercise routine.</p>

<p>Simmons said Harris's allergies had been well-managed with over-the-counter and prescription medications.</p>

<p>Her urticaria or hives were "sporadic and transient and do not seem to be triggered by any particular exposure nor are they associated with other symptoms" and respond well to antihistamine treatment.</p>

<p>Harris has been on allergen immunotherapy for the last three years, dramatically improving her allergy and urticaria symptoms and negating her need for medication other than occasional nasal spray, he said.</p>

<p>Harris wears contact lenses. Her family history includes her mother's colon cancer. Harris was up to date on preventative health procedures including colonoscopy and annual mammograms, he said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN peacekeepers in Lebanon warned Saturday against a "catastrophic" regional conflict as Israeli forces battled Hezbollah and Hamas militants on two fronts, on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar.</p>

<p>Israel has faced a fierce diplomatic backlash over incidents in south Lebanon that saw five Blue Helmets wounded.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the Lebanese health ministry said Israeli air strikes on two villages located near the capital Beirut killed nine people.</p>

<p>Israel had earlier told residents of south Lebanon not to return home, as its troops fought Hezbollah militants in a war that has killed more than 1,200 people since September 23, and forced more than a million others to flee their homes.</p>

<p>"For your own protection, do not return to your homes until further notice... Do not go south; anyone who goes south may put his life at risk," Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee posted on X.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said Saturday it launched missiles across the border into northern Israel, where air raid sirens sounded and the military said it had intercepted a projectile.</p>

<p>In an interview with AFP, UNIFIL spokesman Andrea Tenenti told AFP he feared an Israeli escalation against Hezbollah in south Lebanon could soon spiral out of control "into a regional conflict with catastrophic impact for everyone".</p>

<p>The UN force said five peacekeepers have been wounded by fighting in south Lebanon in just two days, and Tenenti said "a lot of damage" had been caused to its posts there.</p>

<p>Around Israel, markets were closed and public transport halted as observant Jews fasted and prayed on Yom Kippur.</p>

<p>After the holiday, attention is likely to turn again to Israel's expected retaliation against Iran, which launched around 200 missiles at Israel on October 1.</p>

<p>Israel began pounding Gaza shortly after suffering its worst ever attacks from Iran-backed Hamas militants on October 7 last year, and it launched a ground offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon on September 30.</p>

<p><strong>'Deliberately targeted'</strong></p>

<p>On Friday, Israel faced criticism from the UN, its Western allies and others over what it said was a "hit" on a UN peacekeeping position in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Two Sri Lankan peacekeepers were hurt in the second such incident in two days, UNIFIL said Friday.</p>

<p>Israel's military said soldiers had responded to "an immediate threat" around 50 metres (yards) from the UNIFIL base in Naqura, and has pledged to carry out a "thorough review".</p>

<p>The Irish military's chief of staff, Sean Clancy, said it was "not an accidental act", and French President Emmanuel Macron said he believed the peacekeepers had been "deliberately targeted".</p>

<p>Both countries are major contributors to UNIFIL whose peacekeepers are on the front line of the Israel-Hezbollah war.</p>

<p>Efforts to negotiate an end to the fighting have so far failed, but Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said his government would ask the UN Security Council to issue a new resolution calling for a "full and immediate ceasefire".</p>

<p>Lebanon's military said Friday an Israeli strike on one of its positions in south Lebanon killed two soldiers.</p>

<p>In a show of support for Iran's ally Hezbollah, the speaker of the Iranian parliament Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf visited the site Saturday of a deadly Israeli strike earlier this week.</p>

<p>A source close to Hezbollah said the strike had targeted Hezbollah's security chief Wafiq Safa, but neither Hezbollah nor Israel has confirmed he was the target.</p>

<p>Ghalibaf's Lebanon visit, a signal of Tehran's defiance, comes after Israel vowed to respond to Iran's second-ever direct attack.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has vowed that the response will be "deadly, precise and surprising".</p>

<p>The United States is pushing for a "proportionate" response that would not tip the region into a wider war, with President Joe Biden urging Israel to avoid striking Iranian nuclear facilities or energy infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>Gaza deaths</strong></p>

<p>Iran-backed Hezbollah began firing on Israel in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas following the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures, which includes hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Israel's military campaign in Gaza has wrought devastation and, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, killed 42,175 people, a majority civilians.</p>

<p>Israeli operations in Gaza continue, with the army laying siege to an area around Jabalia in the north, causing more suffering for hundreds of thousands of people trapped there, according to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees.</p>

<p>Adraee, the Israeli military spokesman, posted another evacuation warning Saturday for an area near Jabalia.</p>

<p>"The specified area, including the shelters within it, is considered a dangerous combat zone," Adraee said on X, ordering residents to move to the humanitarian zone in southern Gaza.</p>

<p>Some residents said they were not prepared to do so.</p>

<p>"They tell us to go south, but we won't go because of the dangers and the army is shooting at people there," 27-year-old Sami Asliya told AFP.</p>

<p>"There is no safe place, neither in the south nor in the north -- everyone is at risk of death," he said.</p>

<p>On Friday, Gaza's civil defence agency reported 30 people killed in Israeli strikes in the area, including on schools being used as shelter by displaced people.</p>

<p>An AFP journalist in Gaza reported heavy shelling, explosions and gunfire Saturday further south in Gaza City's Zeitoun neighbourhood.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Delta Air Lines passenger caused a major disruption at an airport, jumping behind the check-in counter and evading police while making threats against them.&nbsp; A video, originally posted on TikTok and now spreading across various social media platforms, shows the woman, dressed in a yellow sweater, already standing behind the ticket counter. She loudly declares, "Don't trust cops, only trust firemen."</p>

<p>When an officer approaches, she shouts, "Get away from me!" and runs off, repeatedly telling the police to stay back.</p>

<p>At one point, she threatens the officers, saying, "I will kill you, I will f***ing kill you," while pointing at them.</p>

<p>As another officer moves to arrest her, she quickly dodges him, causing him to stumble and fall in his attempt to catch her.</p>

<p>The woman then ducks under a barrier and returns behind the counter before finally being restrained by officers at the end of the 30-second clip.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been written about fondly by former British PM Boris Johnson in his memoir 'Unleashed' which will be available in bookstores in the UK in a few days.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been written about fondly by former British PM Boris Johnson in his memoir 'Unleashed' which will be available in bookstores in the UK in a few days.</p>

<p>The book, which journeys through Mr Johnson's very eventful, noteworthy and lively political career mentions about his meetings with Prime Minister Modi, calling him the "change-maker" we need. Writing about his very first meeting with the prime minister, Mr Johnson recalls "a curious astral energy" he had felt.</p>

<p>The former British prime minister has written an entire chapter dedicated to India and described ties between the two nations as "a relationship as good as it has ever been."</p>

<p>Calling Prime Minister Modi "exactly the partner of friend" he needed, Mr Johnson credited himself and PM Modi for laying the foundation for a free-trade pact between India and the UK.</p>

<p>The significance of India-UK ties could be seen in the former prime minister's book as he repeatedly mentions the "friendship" shared between the two countries, especially in the context of the Indo-Pacific region and its vision.</p>

<p>"For some reason, we went down to stand in the dark in the plaza by Tower Bridge, in front of a crowd of his supporters," Mr Johnson writes in the chapter titled 'Britain and India', referencing his first meeting with PM Modi during a visit to his City Hall office by the river Thames when he was Mayor of London.</p>

<p>"He raised my arm and chanted something or other in Hindi, and though I couldn't follow it I felt his curious astral energy. I have enjoyed his company ever since – because I reckon he is the change-maker our relationship needs. With Modi, I felt sure, we could not only do a great free-trade deal but also build a long-term partnership, as friends and equals," he writes.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson reveals how a "distinctly sniffy" UK Foreign Office had dissuaded him from meeting Mr Modi during an earlier mayoral trade delegation to India in 2012, a problem, he writes, which was "soon dropped" to pave the way for a relationship that "hit an all-time high".</p>

<p>In the book he also mentions how much he loves India, calling himself a "veteran" of many Indian weddings because his children with Sikh heritage ex-wife Marina Wheeler trace their roots to India.</p>

<p>While he writes with pride of a similar "Anglo-Indian syncretism" in politics with his diverse Cabinet as PM including many British Indians such as Rishi Sunak and Priti Patel, Mr Johnson laments the slow-paced growth of bilateral trade due to unnecessary trade barriers that leave UK visitors "clinking in with duty-free booze" for Indians starved of Scotch whisky at decent prices.</p>

<p>The "tremendous success" of his visit to India as PM in January 2022 he recalls as a much-needed "morale boost" and "balm for the soul" away from an increasingly belligerent domestic politics that would eventually end in his unceremonious exit from 10 Downing Street just a few months later.</p>

<p>He claims he had also wanted to use the visit to make a "gentle point to Narendra" on the issue of relations with Russia at a "global inflection point" with its conflict with Ukraine.</p>

<p>He writes: "I knew all the history and the sensitivities, the reasons for India's post-war non-alignment with the West, the seemingly unbreakable relationship with Moscow. I understand the Indian dependence – like China's – on Russian hydrocarbons."</p>

<p>"But I wondered if it was not time for a modulation, a rethink... As I was to put it to the Indians, Russian missiles were turning out to be less accurate, statistically, than my first serve at tennis. Did they really want to keep Russia as their main supplier of military hardware?" It is in this context that in another section of the book, where he showers the late Queen Elizabeth II with effusive praise for her deep personal knowledge of history and history-makers, he references his efforts to get India to take a "tougher line" with Russians.</p>

<p>"She remembered something the former Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru had told her in the 1950s. 'He told me that India will always side with Russia and that some things will never change. They just are.' I cite that as an illustration of her amazing ability to reassure and to contextualise," he shares, with reference to his customary weekly audiences with the late monarch as prime minister.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson goes on to credit himself with injecting a broader vision for the India-UK partnership to go beyond trade and climate change and educational partnerships and embark on a whole programme of military and technological collaboration.</p>

<p>"Overcoming the qualms of the MoD (Ministry of Defence), who are always worried about India's closeness to Russia, we agreed to work together on all kinds of military technology, from submarines to helicopters to marine propulsion units," he proudly declares.</p>

<p>With 'Unleashed', Mr Johnson seems to be keen to stress a lack of bitterness over his undignified removal as PM in the wake of the partygate scandal of Covid law-breaking parties but is clear that it was Rishi Sunak, his eventual successor at 10 Downing Street, who precipitated the problems by resigning as chancellor from his Cabinet in June 2022.</p>

<p>"It was worse than a crime, I thought, it was a mistake – both for Rishi and for the party, never mind the country. So it proved," he writes, alluding to the recent disastrous general election result for the Tories.</p>

<p>"I don't blame Rishi for prematurely wanting to be PM; in fact I don't blame any of them, really, for trying to turf me out. It's just what Tory MPs do...It goes without saying that if we had all stuck together I have no doubt that we would have gone on to win in 2024, and a lot more of my friends would now have their seats," he claims.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Star Health, India's biggest health insurer, on Saturday said it had received a ransom demand of $68,000 from a cyberhacker in connection with a leak of customer data and medical records.</p>

<p>Star, which has a roughly $4 billion market cap, is battling a reputational and business crisis since Reuters reported on September 20 that a hacker had used Telegram chatbots and a website to leak customers' sensitive data, including tax details and medical claim papers.</p>

<p>The company, whose shares have declined 11%, has launched internal investigations and has taken legal action against Telegram and the hacker, whose website continues to share samples of Star customers' data.</p>

<p>Star, which has previously said it is a "victim of a targeted malicious cyberattack", on Saturday revealed for the first time that in August "the threat actor demanded a ransom of $68,000 in an email" addressed to the company's managing director and its chief executive.</p>

<p>The statement came after Indian stocks exchanges sought clarifications from Star on a Friday over a Reuters report that the company was investigating allegations that its chief security officer was involved in the data leak.</p>

<p>Star reiterated on Saturday it has found no wrongdoing by the official, Amarjeet Khanuja, though the internal investigation is ongoing.</p>

<p>Telegram has declined to share the account details or permanently ban accounts linked to the hacker - an individual dubbed xenZen - "despite multiple notices issued in this regard," Star said on Saturday.</p>

<p>Star said it has "sought the assistance" of Indian cyber security authorities to "help us identify" the hacker.</p>

<p>Telegram did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>The Dubai-based messenger app has previously said it removed the chatbots when Reuters flagged them to the platform.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[While Columbus is traditionally believed to have been from Genoa, Italy, alternative theories suggest he may have been a Spanish Jew, Greek, Basque, or Portuguese.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A centuries-old mystery surrounding the origins of Christopher Columbus may soon be solved. Spanish scientists have confirmed through DNA analysis that Columbus's remains are indeed interred in a tomb at Seville Cathedral in Spain. This finding settles the long-standing debate about his final resting place, previously contested by other claims, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/11/world-news/dna-confirms-christopher-columbus-final-official-resting-place/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>New York Post </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The controversy doesn't end there; questions about Columbus's nationality are also on the verge of resolution. While Columbus is traditionally believed to have been from Genoa, Italy, alternative theories suggest he may have been a Spanish Jew, Greek, Basque, or Portuguese.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Led by forensic expert Miguel Lorente, researchers have analyzed tiny samples of the remains from Seville, comparing them with those of Columbus's known relatives. The conclusions of their study will be revealed in a documentary titled "Columbus DNA: The True Origin," airing on Spain's national broadcaster TVE.</p>

<p>Although Lorente didn't disclose the final results during a recent briefing, he stated that modern technology has definitively confirmed that the remains in Seville belong to Columbus. He acknowledged the challenges in researching Columbus's nationality due to the extensive data involved but noted that the findings are "almost absolutely reliable."</p>

<p>Columbus's remains have a complex history of relocation. He died in Valladolid, Spain, in 1506, but wished to be buried on Hispaniola, now the Dominican Republic and Haiti. His remains were moved to Cuba in 1795 and later thought to have been transferred to Seville in 1898. However, some evidence suggests that parts of his remains could still be in the Caribbean, as bone fragments believed to belong to Columbus were found in a lead casket in Santo Domingo in 1877.</p>

<p>This ongoing debate takes place amid growing criticism of Columbus's legacy. Nick Tilsen, president of the indigenous-led advocacy group NDN Collective, argues that celebrating Columbus Day is "absolutely disrespectful," pointing out the devastation Columbus's expeditions caused to indigenous populations through colonization and disease.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India has written to Bangladesh's interim government today expressing "serious concern" over multiple attacks on temples, shrines and puja mandaps or pandals. The attacks include incidents of desecration, vandalism, robbery and defacement.</p>

<p>New Delhi, which has been keenly observing the way events are unfolding across Bangladesh since the political crisis in the neighbouring country, said that there has been a systemic pattern in these attack.</p>

<p>Calling the recent attacks "deplorable", the Ministry of External Affairs today said, "We have noted with serious concern, the attacks on a puja mandap in Tantibazar, Dhaka and the theft at the revered Jeshoreshwari Kali Temple at Satkhira."</p>

<p>These attacks "follow a systematic pattern of desecration and damage to temples and deities that we have witnessed over several days now," the foreign ministry stated.</p>

<p>Urging Dhaka, New Delhi said, "We call upon the Government of Bangladesh to ensure the safety and security of Hindus and all minorities and their places of worship, especially during this auspicious festival time."</p>

<p>Prothom Alo, a Bangladeshi newspaper, reported that a "crude bomb was thrown" at a Durga Puja pandal in Tantibazar area in Dhaka's old city. The report further stated that the incident happened on Friday and though there was a fire after the crude bomb was thrown, there have been no injuries.</p>

<p>In another incident of theft at the renowned Jeshoreshwari Kali Temple, a hand-made 'mukut' (crown) made of silver with gold plating, that was placed on goddess Maa Kali's idol by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to the temple in 2021 was stolen.</p>

<p>Durga Puja is predominantly celebrated by Bengali Hindus and coincides with the Hindu festival of Navratri. The festival lasts 9 days-and-nights hence the name "nav ratri'. It culminates in the festival of Dussehra or Vijaya Dashami on the tenth day.</p>

<p>Religious freedom has come under attack in Bangladesh under Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus's stewardship of the country after former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster due to politically-motivated protests. Mr Yunus is currently the Chief Adviser to Bangladesh's interim government.</p>

<p>Mr Yunus however, has in recent times called these attacks "politically-motivated", and not "communal". In an interview to Press Trust of India last month, Mr Yunus had claimed the attacks were not communal, but a fallout of a political upheaval as there is a perception that most Hindus supported the now-deposed Awami League regime, which was led by Sheikh Hasina, daughter of Bangladesh;s founder Sheikh Mujib-ur-Rehman.</p>

<p>"I have said this to (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi also that this is exaggerated. This issue has several dimensions. When the country went through an upheaval following the atrocities by (Sheikh) Hasina and the Awami League, those who were with them also faced attacks," the Nobel peace prize winner had said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran has banned pagers and walkie-talkies on all flights, local media reported Saturday, weeks after deadly sabotage attacks in Lebanon which were blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>"The entry of any electronic communication device, except mobile phones, in flight cabins or in non-accompanied cargo, has been banned," ISNA news agency reported, citing the spokesman for Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation Jafar Yazerlo.</p>

<p>The decision came over three weeks since sabotage attacks targeting members of the Iran-allied Hezbollah group in Lebanon that saw pagers and walkie-talkies explode, killing at least 39 people.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hezbollah-israel-war-soon-32-killed-as-walkie-talkies-pagers-explode-across-lebanon-6598300" target="_blank">Nearly 3,000 others were wounded in the attack</a>, which Iran and Hezbollah blamed on Israel, including Tehran's ambassador to Lebanon Mojtaba Amani.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Dubai-based airline Emirates banned pagers and walkie-talkies onboard its planes.</p>

<p>Regional tensions have soared since the outbreak of the Gaza war in October last year, drawing in Iran-aligned groups from Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen.</p>

<p>Multiple airlines have in recent weeks suspended flights to Iran following Tehran's missile attack on Israel on October 1.</p>

<p>Iran fired some 200 missiles at Israel to retaliate against the killing of Tehran-aligned leaders in the region and a general in Iran's Revolutionary Guards.</p>

<p>Israel has since vowed to retaliate, with defence minister Yoav Gallant saying the response will be "deadly, precise, and surprising".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While most of us think of flights as long-haul journeys, there's a tiny Scottish flight that takes just one and a half minutes to complete its journey. Operated by Loganair, the flight connects the Orkney islands of Westray and Papa Westray.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This quick hop is so short that the actual flying time is often less than a minute! It's faster than many flights take to reach cruising altitude. In fact, the record for the fastest flight is 53 seconds, set by pilot Stuart Linklater, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/uk-ireland/uk-home-worlds-fastest-flight-33863996" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>the Mirror</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The flight covers a distance of about 1.7 miles across the water, which is roughly the same length as the runway at Edinburgh Airport, the capital of Scotland. The flights are combined with routes to Kirkwall, forming a small triangle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The airline uses Britten-Norman BN2B-26 Islander aircraft, which have 10 passenger seats. Passengers in the front row can even watch the pilot in action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Papa Westray, with its 70 inhabitants, relies on this flight for essential connections to the mainland. In recent years, it has become a popular destination for tourists seeking a unique and brief travel experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beyond its brevity, this flight offers a glimpse into a slower pace of life. The Orkney Islands, with their rugged landscapes and rich history, provide a stark contrast to the bustling metropolises of the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The flight's passengers, whether locals or tourists are likely to be struck by the beauty of the islands and the simplicity of their lives. The journey may be short, but the memories it creates can last a lifetime.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli military strikes on Gaza overnight killed at least 19 Palestinians, medics said on Saturday, while forces continued to push deeper into the Jabalia area, where international relief agencies say thousands of people are trapped.</p>

<p>Residents said Israeli forces continued to pound Jabalia, which is in the north of the enclave and is the largest of the enclave's historic refugee camps, from the air and ground.</p>

<p>There has been no fresh Israeli comment but the military said in past days that forces operating in Jabalia and nearby areas killed dozens of militants, located weapons and dismantled military infrastructure.</p>

<p>The operation in this area began a week ago and the military said then it aimed to fight against Hamas militants waging attacks and to prevent Hamas from regrouping.</p>

<p>Palestinian health officials put the number of people killed in Jabalia over the past week at around 150.</p>

<p>On Friday, Israeli strikes hit four houses in Jabalia, killing around 20 people and wounding dozens, medics said. The Israeli military has sent troops into the nearby towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya as well as Jabalia and ordered residents to evacuate their homes and head to safe areas south of the enclave.</p>

<p>Palestinian and United Nations officials say there are no safe areas in Gaza. They have also voiced concerns over severe shortages of food, fuel, and medical supplies in northern Gaza, and said there is a risk of famine there.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Health said Israel's threats to evacuate three hospitals operating there by force put the safety of patients and medical staff at risk.</p>

<p>Israel's military campaign in Gaza, aimed at eliminating the operator group Hamas, has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians since it began a year ago, according to Gaza's health ministry, and has laid waste to the enclave.</p>

<p>The war began after a Hamas-led assault on October 7, 2023, on southern Israeli communities in which 1,200 people were killed and about 250 were taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>In a statement on Saturday, Hamas said Israel's "massacre against the civilians" aimed to punish the residents of Jabalia for refusing to leave their homes. It also said it was a sign of Israel's military failure to defeat the group.</p>

<p>Israel has denied it targets civilians.</p>

<p>The armed wings of Hamas, the Islamic Jihad, and smaller other factions said their fighters attacked Israeli forces in Jabalia and nearby areas with anti-tank rockets, and mortar fire.</p>

<p><strong>POLIO VACCINATIONS</strong></p>

<p>United Nations officials said on Friday an Israeli offensive and evacuation orders in northern Gaza might affect the second phase of its polio vaccination campaign set to start next week.</p>

<p>The territory's health ministry announced on Saturday that the campaign would begin on Monday in central Gaza Strip areas and would last three days before moving to other territories.</p>

<p>Aid groups carried out an initial round of vaccinations last month after a baby was partially paralysed by the type 2 poliovirus in August, the first such case in the territory in 25 years.</p>

<p>As in the first phase, humanitarian pauses in the fighting in Gaza are planned, in order to reach hundreds of thousands of children.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US forces have conducted air strikes against multiple Islamic State group sites in Syria, the military said Saturday.</p>

<p>US forces "conducted a series of airstrikes against multiple known ISIS camps in Syria in the early morning of Oct. 11," the US Central Command said in a statement on X, using an acronym for the Islamist militant group.</p>

<p>"The strikes will disrupt the ability of ISIS to plan, organize, and conduct attacks against the United States, its allies and partners, and civilians throughout the region and beyond."</p>

<p>The US military has around 900 troops in Syria as part of the international coalition against the Islamic State (IS) group.</p>

<p>The coalition was established in 2014 to help combat the armed group, which had taken over vast swaths of Iraq and Syria.</p>

<p>Anti-IS coalition forces have been targeted dozens of times with drones and rocket fire in both Iraq and Syria, as violence related to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza since last year has drawn in militants across the Middle East, including Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

<p>US forces have carried out multiple retaliatory strikes against militant factions in both Iraq and Syria.</p>

<p>In September, US forces conducted two separate strikes in Syria, killing 37 "terrorist operatives" including members of IS and Al-Qaeda affiliate Hurras al-Din.</p>

<p>US Central Command said Saturday that its damage assessments were underway and "do not indicate civilian casualties."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Republican President Donald Trump has an edge over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris on who would better navigate the country through the Ukraine and Middle East wars, a Wall Street Journal opinion poll of seven battleground states showed.</p>

<p>In overall support, the poll published on Friday showed Harris and Trump tied across the seven states that could decide the November presidential election.</p>

<p>The poll showed Harris with marginal 2 percentage point leads in Arizona, Georgia and Michigan, Trump up 6 points in Nevada and 1 in Pennsylvania, and the two tied in North Carolina and Wisconsin. The poll of 600 registered voters in each state conducted on Sept. 28-Oct. 8 had a margin of error of 4 percentage points in each state.</p>

<p>The neck-and-neck results echo other polls reflecting a tight race before the Nov. 5 election as Americans grapple with concerns about the economy, immigration, women's rights and the nation's democratic values in picking between the two candidates.</p>

<p>A Reuters/Ipsos poll this week also found Trump and Harris locked in a close race nationally, with Harris marginally ahead 46% to 43%.</p>

<p>Surveys of swing state voters can be an important indicator given that state-by-state results of the Electoral College will determine the winner, with the seven battleground states likely being decisive.</p>

<p>Harris would win a narrow majority in the Electoral College if she captures the states where she holds an edge in the WSJ's poll.</p>

<p>According to the WSJ poll, Trump leads Harris in the seven swing states 50% to 39% on who is best able to handle Russia's war in Ukraine. Trump also has a 48% to 33% lead over Harris on who is better suited to handle the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

<p>More voters said they backed Trump on the economy and immigration while more said Harris would do a better job when it comes to housing, healthcare and caring about people like them, the WSJ poll found.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea accused South Korea on Friday of sending drones to scatter a "huge number" of anti-North leaflets over its capital Pyongyang, in what it called a political and military provocation that could lead to armed conflict.</p>

<p>South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it could not confirm the North's accusations but also referred in its statement to Pyongyang's practice of sending into South Korean airspace balloons with bags of trash attached.</p>

<p>North Korea's foreign ministry said the drones were flown over Pyongyang at night this week and last and that the intrusion demanded retaliatory action, the state news agency KCNA reported.</p>

<p>"The ROK (South Korea) should immediately stop such irresponsible and dangerous provocation that may cause an armed conflict and lead to a war between the two sides," the ministry was quoted as saying.</p>

<p>In its statement, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it "cannot confirm the truth of North Korea's claims", adding: "All responsibility for the recent series of events" lies with Pyongyang.</p>

<p>It cited "despicable, low-grade and internationally embarrassing acts of filth and garbage balloons and other provocations." More balloons were being sent on Friday, it said.</p>

<p>North Korea has been floating thousands of balloons with trash attached into the South since May, exacerbating tensions between the two countries.</p>

<p>Pyongyang says they are a response to some activists and North Korean defectors in South Korea who fly balloons into the North carrying aid parcels and leaflets criticising leader Kim Jong Un.</p>

<p><strong>BLURRY IMAGES</strong></p>

<p>KCNA distributed photos, including ones showing a blurry, triangular object labelled as a "drone" dropping another object labelled as "bundle of leaflets". One image also showed a cloud of small objects that was labelled as "scattered leaflets."</p>

<p>Another photo showed black, yellow and white leaflets comparing the economic situation in the South to the impoverished North and criticizing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un by name.</p>

<p>South Korea's Yonhap news agency cited an official at the Joint Chiefs of Staff as saying it needs to look into whether a private group had sent leaflets into the North.</p>

<p>In December five North Korean drones crossed into South Korea, prompting Seoul to scramble fighter jets and attack helicopters, and try to shoot them down, in the first such intrusion since 2017.</p>

<p>The two Koreas are still technically at war after their 1950-53 war ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty, and the North has long denounced defectors as "human scum".</p>

<p>There will be no more warnings and the North will immediately take action in the event of another drone being sent by the South into its territory, North Korea's foreign ministry said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel warned residents of south Lebanon "not to return" to their homes on Saturday as Hezbollah said it launched missiles across the border on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.</p>

<p>In cities around Israel, markets were closed and public transport halted as observant Jews fasted and prayed.</p>

<p>But with the country at war, troops remained engaged in combat in Hamas-run Gaza and in southern Lebanon, a traditional Hezbollah stronghold, amid a firestorm of criticism over the wounding of four UN peacekeepers.</p>

<p>In a message addressed to south Lebanese, Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee wrote on X: "For your own protection, do not return to your homes until further notice... Do not go south; anyone who goes south may put his life at risk."</p>

<p>The war between Israel and Hezbollah has since September 23 killed more than 1,200 people in Lebanon, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures, and forced more than a million to flee their homes.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Hezbollah said it had launched missiles at an Israeli army base near the northern city of Haifa.</p>

<p>In a statement the group said its fighters were "targeting the explosives factory there with a salvo of... missiles".</p>

<p>Air raid sirens sounded in northern Israel, with the Israeli military saying it had intercepted a projectile launched from Lebanon.</p>

<p>Israel began pounding Gaza shortly after suffering its worst ever attacks from Iran-backed Hamas militants on October 7 last year, and it launched a ground offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon on September 30.</p>

<p>After the Yom Kippur holiday, attention is likely to turn again to Israel's expected retaliation against Iran, which launched around 200 missiles at Israel on October 1.</p>

<p><strong>'Deliberately targeted'</strong></p>

<p>on Friday, Israel faced severe diplomatic backlash over what it said was a "hit" on a United Nations peacekeeping position in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Two Sri Lankan peacekeepers were hurt in the second such incident in two days, the UNIFIL mission said Friday.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said its soldiers had responded with fire to "an immediate threat" around 50 metres (yards) from the UNIFIL base in Naqura.</p>

<p>But the Irish military's chief of staff, Sean Clancy, said it was "not an accidental act" while French President Emmanuel Macron said he believed the UN peacekeepers had been "deliberately targeted".</p>

<p>Both Ireland and France are major contributors to UNIFIL.</p>

<p>As Israel faced a chorus of condemnation by UN chief Antonio Guterres, Western allies and others, its military pledged to carry out a "thorough review".</p>

<p>UNIFIL peacekeepers in Lebanon are on the frontline of the Israel-Hezbollah war, which has killed more than 1,200 people in Lebanon since September 23, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures.</p>

<p>Four peacekeepers have been injured including two Indonesians who were hurt on Thursday when a tank shot at their watchtower, according to UNIFIL.</p>

<p>Diplomatic efforts to negotiate an end to the fighting have so far failed, but Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said his government would ask the UN Security Council to issue a new resolution calling for a "full and immediate ceasefire".</p>

<p>Lebanon's military said on Friday that an Israeli strike on one of its positions in south Lebanon killed two soldiers.</p>

<p>In a show of support for Iran's ally Hezbollah, the speaker of the Iranian parliament Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf visited on Saturday the site of a deadly Israeli strike earlier this week that, according to a source close to Hezbollah, targeted Hezbollah's security chief Wafiq Safa.</p>

<p>Neither Hezbollah nor Israel has confirmed whether Safa was indeed the target of the strike, but according to the Lebanese health ministry, the raid killed 22 people.</p>

<p>The visit to Lebanon, a signal of defiance, comes after Israel vowed to respond to Iran's second-ever direct attack.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant vowed this week that his country's response would be "deadly, precise and surprising".</p>

<p>The United States is pushing for a "proportionate" response that would not tip the region into a wider war, with President Jore Biden urging Israel to avoid striking Iranian nuclear facilities or energy infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>Gaza deaths</strong></p>

<p>Iran-backed Hezbollah began firing on Israel in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas following the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures, which includes hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Israel's military campaign in Gaza has wrought devastation and, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, killed 42,175 people, a majority civilians.</p>

<p>Israeli operations in Gaza continue, with the army laying siege to an area around Jabalia in the north, causing more suffering for hundreds of thousands of people trapped there, according to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees.</p>

<p>"The bombardment has not stopped. Every minute there are shells, rockets and fire on the buildings and everything that moves", Areej Nasr, 35, told AFP after fleeing from Jabalia to Gaza City Thursday.</p>

<p>On Friday, Gaza's civil defence agency reported 30 people killed in Israeli strikes in the area, including on schools being used as shelter by displaced people.</p>

<p>An AFP journalist in Gaza reported heavy artillery shelling, explosions and gunfire Saturday further south in Gaza City's Zeitoun neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Adraee, the Israeli military spokesman, on Saturday posted another evacuation warning for an area near Jabalia.</p>

<p>"The specified area, including the shelters within it, is considered a dangerous combat zone," Adraee said on X, ordering residents to move to the humanitarian zone in the southern part of the strip.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's government said on Friday that employees of Taiwan's Foxconn, the world's largest iPhone assembler, are being investigated for suspected taking of bribes and embezzlement, after Taiwan reported their detention.</p>

<p>Taiwan's government said this week that four Foxconn employees had been detained in China under "quite strange" circumstances in Zhengzhou, home to a major Foxconn plant assembling Apple's iPhones, on suspicion of the equivalent of "breach of trust".</p>

<p>China's Taiwan Affairs Office, in a statement to Reuters, said the Foxconn employees are suspected of crimes including taking bribes and embezzlement and the investigation is ongoing. It did not state how many employees were being investigated.</p>

<p>"The relevant departments are handling the case strictly in accordance with the law and are protecting their legal rights in accordance with the law," it added, without elaborating.</p>

<p>Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, declined to comment.</p>

<p>Taiwan's China policymaking Mainland Affairs Council said this week that Foxconn had stated the company had "suffered no losses and that the four employees had done nothing to harm the company's interests".</p>

<p>The case may be connected to corruption and abuse of power by a small number of Chinese security officials, the council added, without giving details.</p>

<p>Democratically governed Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, has repeatedly warned its citizens to be aware of the potential dangers of visiting the country.</p>

<p>In June, Taiwan's government raised its travel warning for China, telling its citizens not to go unless absolutely necessary, following a threat from Beijing to execute those deemed "diehard" Taiwan independence supporters.</p>

<p>Taiwanese businesses have invested billions of dollars in China since the country began landmark economic reforms four decades ago, drawn by a common culture and language and much lower costs.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said on Friday it had approved the return to flight of the SpaceX Falcon 9 vehicle after it reviewed and accepted the SpaceX-led investigation findings and corrective actions for the mishap that occurred September 28.</p>

<p>The FAA on Sept. 30 said SpaceX had to investigate why the second stage of its Falcon 9 malfunctioned after a NASA astronaut mission, grounding the launch vehicle for the third time in three months.</p>

<p>The malfunction caused the booster to fall into a region of the Pacific Ocean outside of the designated safety zone the FAA approved.</p>

<p>The FAA also said Friday it closed the SpaceX-led investigations for the Falcon 9 mishaps that occurred with Starlink missions in July and August.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the FAA said SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket could return to flight solely for a mission on Monday for the European Space Agency's Hera spacecraft from Florida.</p>

<p>Separately, Reuters reported this week the FAA could approve a license for the launch of SpaceX's Starship 5 as soon as this month. Starship 5 is the fifth test launch of the company's rocket which it calls Starship.</p>

<p>The Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket are a fully reusable system designed to carry crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon and beyond.</p>

<p>Last month, the FAA said it did not expect a determination on a license before late November. SpaceX said Monday Starship's fifth flight test could launch as soon as Sunday, pending regulatory approval.</p>

<p>The FAA has repeatedly said it did not expect to decide on a license until late November. On Tuesday it said only that it was still reviewing the proposed mission and would make a decision "once SpaceX has met all licensing requirements."</p>

<p>SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has harshly criticized the FAA, including for proposing a $633,000 fine against SpaceX over launch issues and for the delay in approving the license for Starship 5, which the company says has been ready to launch since August. Musk has called for the resignation of FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker and threatened to sue the agency.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia's Vladimir Putin held talks with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Friday in Turkmenistan, where the two leaders hailed their countries growing economic ties and similar views on world affairs, an entente viewed with concern by the United States.</p>

<p>At odds with Washington and the European Union over Russia's war in Ukraine, something he casts as part of a wider existential struggle against an arrogant and self-interested West - Putin is keen to deepen ties with what he calls the Global East and Global South.</p>

<p>Putin, whose country is hosting a summit of the BRICS nations in Kazan on October 22-24, invited Pezeshkian to come to Russia on an official visit, a proposal the Iranian leader accepted according to Russia's state RIA news agency.</p>

<p>"Economically and culturally, our communications are being strengthened day by day and becoming more robust," Pezeshkian was cited as telling Putin by Iran's official IRNA news agency.</p>

<p>"The growing trend of cooperation between Iran and Russia, considering the will of the top leaders of both countries, must be accelerated to strengthen these ties," he said.</p>

<p>In a later report from Dubai, Russia's TASS news agency quoted the Iranian president, in a video issued by his office, as saying the two sides had agreed to boost cooperation in a number of areas.</p>

<p>"Our talks with the Russian president lasted about an hour. And we talked again about agreements that we have concluded," the report quoted him as saying.</p>

<p>"We have constructive interaction. We agreed to speed up the completion of projects in the gas sectors, in road and rail construction, desalination and other projects linked to energy, petrochemicals and electricity."</p>

<p>Pezeshkian last month committed his country to deeper ties with Russia to counter Western sanctions. The two countries say they are close to signing a strategic partnership agreement, something Pezeshkian said on Friday he hoped could be finalised at the BRICS summit in Russia later this month.</p>

<p>The United States regards Moscow's growing relationship with Tehran with concern. It has accused Iran of supplying Russia with ballistic missiles for use in the conflict in Ukraine, something Tehran has denied.</p>

<p><strong>NEW WORLD ORDER EMERGING, SAYS PUTIN</strong></p>

<p>Russia says cooperation with Iran is expanding in all areas.</p>

<p>"We actively work together in the international arena, and our assessments of current events in the world are often very close," TASS cited Putin as telling Pezeshkian on the sidelines of the conference in the Turkmen capital of Ashgabat.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian, according to IRNA, noted that Iran and Russia had significant complementary capacities and could assist each other. "Our positions in the world are much closer to each other than to others," he was quoted as telling the Russian leader.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian said earlier that Israel should "stop killing innocent people", and its actions in the Middle East were backed by the U.S. and EU. Russia has also criticised Israel, which says it is protecting its own security, for bombing civilian areas.</p>

<p>Putin was cited by TASS as telling Pezeshkian that economic ties between Moscow and Tehran were on the up.</p>

<p>In comments released by the Kremlin earlier on Friday, Putin told the conference in the Central Asian country that a new world order was being formed and that new centres of economic growth and financial and political influence were emerging.</p>

<p>Russia supported "the broadest possible international discussion" on the emerging multipolar world and was open to discussing it within various fora, including the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Eurasian Economic Union, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and BRICS, said Putin.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla's reveal of a robotaxi designed as a low-slung, two-seater, sporty coupe - quite the opposite of a typical taxi with room for several passengers and luggage - flummoxed investors and analysts.</p>

<p>CEO Elon Musk served up the cool design for the prototype of the Tesla robotaxi, dubbed Cybercab, at a much-hyped event near Los Angeles late on Thursday. These will go into production some time in 2026 and cost less than $30,000 a pop, he said.</p>

<p>But in true Musk style, he skipped over expectations of how a two-seater robotaxi would serve the needs of families headed to a restaurant or to the airport, or if he expected these to appeal only to a niche clientele.</p>

<p>Investors jeered the design and the lack of financial detail, with Tesla stocks tumbling 9% on Wall Street on Friday.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/2b99vcv4_tesla-robotaxi-reuters_625x300_12_October_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>"When you think of a cab, you think of something that's going to carry more than two people," said Jonathan Elfalan, vehicle testing director for the automotive website Edmunds.com. "Making this a two-seat-only car is very perplexing."</p>

<p>Tesla did not respond to an email seeking comment.</p>

<p>Experts said robotaxis would best emulate regular taxis with plenty of room, a tall design and sliding doors. Musk did showcase a futuristic robovan that could seat up to 20 people but did not say when that would be available.</p>

<p>The market for two-door robotaxis would be very limited, said Sandeep Rao, a senior researcher at Leverage Shares, an investment management company with assets of about $1 billion, including in Tesla.</p>

<p>Two-door vehicles account for just 2% of car sales in the U.S., excluding SUVs and pickups, according to data from analytics firm J.D. Power.</p>

<p>Musk said he wanted to make robotaxis cheaper than mass transit to operate and predicted an operating cost of 20 cents per mile over time for the Cybercab.</p>

<p>But he did not say how quickly Tesla could mass-produce Cybercabs and secure regulatory approvals, or how it could beat Alphabet's Waymo, which already operates robotaxis in some U.S. cities.</p>

<p>Waymo has a fleet of about 700 Jaguar Land Rover cars that fit four passengers, same as the seating capacity in Amazon's Zoox robotaxis.</p>

<p>Waymo's former CEO John Krafcik said Tesla's design looked "more playful than serious," and that the two-door configuration posed challenges for older passengers and those with disabilities.</p>

<h2><strong>'MORE PLAYFUL THAN SERIOUS'</strong></h2>

<p>Delivering the robotaxi and capturing a still nascent and tightly regulated market will be critical for Tesla.</p>

<p>Musk this year scrapped plans to build a smaller, cheaper vehicle amid slowing EV demand and shifted focus to the advancing Tesla's autonomy ambitions. The robotaxi business could catapult Tesla's valuation to $5 trillion, he has said, from about $700 billion now.</p>

<p>"Two-seaters have been proposed for decades as commuter vehicles. They just haven't taken off," said Sam Fiorani, vice president at research firm AutoForecast Solutions. Tesla will eventually need to build larger robotaxis, he said.</p>

<p>Blake Anderson, senior investment analyst at Carson Group, a Tesla investor, said that if the Cybercab is supposed to be a lower-cost, mass-market model to widen Tesla's appeal, the two-seat design doesn't make sense.</p>

<p>"It's probably a way that they can introduce something quick to market," he said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has ordered the "mass production" of attack drones, state media reported Friday, as concerns mount over the country's deepening military cooperation with Russia.</p>

<p>Pyongyang first unveiled its attack drones in August, with experts saying the capability may be attributable to the country's budding alliance with Russia.</p>

<p>The nuclear-armed country has ratified a landmark defence pact with Moscow and is accused of deploying thousands of troops to Russia to support its war in Ukraine, prompting South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol to warn about the potential transfer of sensitive Russian military technology to North Korea.</p>

<p>Kim on Thursday oversaw the tests of drones designed to hit both land and sea targets, produced by North Korea's Unmanned Aerial Technology Complex, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.</p>

<p>"He underscored the need to build a serial production system as early as possible and go into full-scale mass production," KCNA said.</p>

<p>The unmanned drones are designed to carry explosives and be deliberately crashed into enemy targets, effectively acting as guided missiles.</p>

<p>Thursday's test saw the drones "precisely" hit targets after flying along predetermined paths, KCNA reported.</p>

<p>"The suicide attack drones to be used within different striking ranges are to perform a mission to precisely attack any enemy targets on the ground and in the sea," the agency said.</p>

<p>Kim said the drones were an "easy to use... component of striking power" due to their relatively low production cost and expansive range of applications, according to KCNA.</p>

<p>He said the North had "recently attached importance" to developing unmanned hardware systems and to integrating them with the country's overall military strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Russian tech?</strong></p>

<p>Experts said the drones -- in images released by state media in August -- looked similar to the Israeli-made "HAROP" drone, Russian-made "Lancet-3" and Israeli "HERO 30".</p>

<p>North Korea may have acquired these technologies from Russia, which in turn likely obtained them from Iran -- with Tehran itself suspected of accessing them through hacking or theft from Israel.</p>

<p>In 2022, Pyongyang sent drones across the border that Seoul's military was unable to shoot down, saying they were too small.</p>

<p>This year, North Korea has been bombarding the South with trash-carrying balloons, in what it calls retaliation for activists in the South floating anti-regime propaganda missives northwards.</p>

<p>The North has also accused Seoul of violating its sovereignty by flying drones over its capital Pyongyang to drop propaganda leaflets.</p>

<p>By mentioning the "production and practical deployment of various drones", North Korea may be hinting it could follow suit, Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, told AFP.</p>

<p>Pyongyang could be "suggesting the possibility of using balloons to disseminate leaflets to the South with such drones," Yang said.</p>

<p>"Considering the effectiveness of drone attacks observed in the war in Ukraine, they could also be effectively utilised in the ongoing conflict there," he added.</p>

<p>South Korea launched a drone operation command last year to better address the growing threat.</p>

<p>In October, the North amended its constitution to define South Korea as a "hostile" state, an illustration of a sharp deterioration in ties since Kim in January declared Seoul his country's "principal enemy".</p>

<p>The North has continued to carry out UN sanctions-defying ballistic missile tests, and last month blew up its roads and railways linking it to the South.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump has appointed Robert F Kennedy Jr, an environmental advocate and vaccine sceptic, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Mr Kennedy, who dropped his independent presidential campaign in August and endorsed Trump, has expressed his commitment to prioritising the fight against chronic diseases. His stance on vaccines, however, sets him apart from previous HHS leaders. Mr Kennedy has frequently challenged vaccine mandates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Kennedy will restore these agencies to the traditions of gold standard scientific research, and beacons of transparency, to end the chronic disease epidemic, and to Make America Great and Healthy Again!" <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/trump-tracker-robert-f-kennedy-jr-anti-vaccine-activist-named-head-to-us-health-department-7022811Â ">Trump said</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Who is Robert F Kennedy Jr?</strong></p>

<p>Robert F Kennedy Jr. was born on January 17, 1954, in Washington, D.C. He is the third of eleven children of former US Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Skakel Kennedy, and the nephew of former President John F. Kennedy. Both his father and uncle were assassinated in the 1960s.</p>

<p>He studied at Harvard University, attended the London School of Economics, and earned a law degree from the University of Virginia. Later, he completed a Master's Degree in Environmental Law from Pace University School of Law, where he co-founded the Environmental Litigation Clinic and served on the faculty for over 30 years.</p>

<p>In the 1980s, Mr Kennedy founded the Waterkeeper Alliance, an organisation focused on clean water advocacy, where he worked as chairman and attorney. His work to restore New York's Hudson River earned him the title "Hero for the Planet" from TIME Magazine and helped create over 300 similar Waterkeeper groups worldwide. He also played a key role in the New York City watershed agreement, now viewed as a global example of sustainable development.</p>

<p>Mr Kennedy founded Children's Health Defense to address their health issues and harmful exposures, serving as chairman and lead counsel. While claiming to support vaccine safety, he has also been found spreading false theories, such as vaccines causing autism and COVID-19 being targeted at specific ethnic groups. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr Kennedy was already leading campaigns against vaccines and collaborating with anti-vaccine groups. His organisation has also filed lawsuits against news outlets, accusing them of bias against anti-vaccine views. Studies show his Twitter account was a major source of vaccine misinformation. Mr Kennedy has also met with anti-vaccine activists and supported anti-vaccine literature, despite evidence that vaccines are safe and necessary for public health.</p>

<p>Some of Mr Kennedy's legal wins include cases against Monsanto in 2018 and DuPont in 2019 for contamination, which inspired the movie Dark Waters. He has also advocated for Indigenous groups in North and South America.</p>

<p>Mr Kennedy has authored several books, including bestsellers Crimes Against Nature (2005) and The Real Anthony Fauci (2021). He has also written children's books on American history and Saint Francis of Assisi.</p>

<p>Robert F Kennedy Jr is married to actress Cheryl Hines and has seven children from three marriages.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Actor Eva Longoria, who endorsed Kamala Harris in the election, revealed that her family no longer lives in the United States, and is splitting time between Mexico and Spain.</p>

<p>"I had my whole adult life here," Longoria told Marie Claire of the US, as per The Hollywood Reporter.</p>

<p>"But even before [the pandemic], it was changing. The vibe was different. And then COVID happened, and it pushed it over the edge. Whether it's the homelessness or the taxes, not that I want to shit on California -- it just feels like this chapter in my life is done now."</p>

<p>The 'Desperate Housewives' actress mentioned the election as one reason for the finality of her conviction.</p>

<p>"The shocking part is not that he won...It's that a convicted criminal who spews so much hate could hold the highest office. If he keeps his promises, it's going to be a scary place," she said.</p>

<p>Longoria went on to acknowledge that she is "privileged" to be able to make the decision to move away. "I get to escape and go somewhere," she said. "Most Americans aren't so lucky. They're going to be stuck in this dystopian country, and my anxiety and sadness is for them."</p>

<p>Eva Longoria, 49, currently lives with her husband, Jose Baston, and their son, 6-year-old Santiago, in Mexico and Spain. She often ends up elsewhere in Europe and South America for work but doesn't frequently return to Los Angeles, according to The Hollywood Reporter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Trump announced several key apppointments, including former Congresswoman and Governor from South Dakota, Kristi Noem, as the Secretary of the US Department of Homeland Security, Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and 'X' along with Indian-origin Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Pete Hegseth as the Secretary of Defense, William Joseph McGinley as White House Counsel, among others.</p>

<p>In a historic political comeback, Trump won a second term as President of the United States after securing 295 electoral votes in the 2024 presidential election, defeating Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, who garnered 226 votes.</p>

<p>Trump's return to the White House marks only the second time in US history that a president has served two non-consecutive terms. The first such instance was Grover Cleveland, who served as president in 1884 and 1892. Trump had earlier served as US President from 2016 to 2020.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump on Thursday tapped anti-vaccine activist and conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his secretary of health in the latest provocative nomination from the incoming Republican president.</p>

<p>"We want you to come up with things and ideas and what you've been talking about for a long time and I think you're going to do some unbelievable things," Trump told Kennedy Jr. during an event at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Thursday evening.</p>

<p>Moving quickly since his election last week, Trump has embarked on a campaign of political shock and awe as he rolls out an administration designed to upend -- and in some cases literally dismantle -- the US government.</p>

<p>Several of Trump's choices for top jobs -- including a TV news anchor at the helm of the Pentagon and an ally embroiled in sexual misconduct allegations for attorney general -- have unnerved the Washington establishment.</p>

<p>Trump also announced Thursday that his personal attorneys Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who defended him at trial this year over hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, would serve as deputy attorneys general.</p>

<p>Kennedy, a scion of the famous political family who is popularly known as RFK Jr., is a longtime environmental campaigner who abandoned a fringe bid for the presidency to endorse Trump against Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Trump had said previously he wanted Kennedy to "go wild" in changing health care and the two campaigned together promising to "Make America Healthy Again."</p>

<p><strong>Vaccine scepticism</strong></p>

<p>If approved by the Senate, which Trump's Republican Party controls, 70-year-old Kennedy will take over the Health and Human Services Department, a mammoth institution with a budget of close to $2 trillion.</p>

<p>In a statement explaining his choice, Trump echoed many of Kennedy's talking points, saying "Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation."</p>

<p>The nomination could meet opposition, given Kennedy's history of promoting medical conspiracy theories -- including the disproven claim that childhood vaccines cause autism -- and saying that the Covid-19 vaccine was deadly.</p>

<p>He is also burdened by a string of colorful and even bizarre stories from his personal life.</p>

<p>These include his statement that a parasitic worm once entered his "brain and ate a portion of it and then died."</p>

<p>An admission this year that he was behind the long unsolved mystery of a dead bear dumped in New York's Central Park a decade ago raised eyebrows.</p>

<p><strong>Energy</strong></p>

<p>Trump has yet to select treasury and commerce chiefs, or an education secretary, whose department he wants to abolish.</p>

<p>During the event in Mar-a-Lago on Thursday evening, he said that wealthy North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum would be appointed secretary of the interior, putting him in charge of national parks which could be opened to more oil exploration.</p>

<p>"We're going to slash energy costs," Trump told the event organized by the America First Policy Institute, where he was introduced by libertarian Argentinian President Javier Milei and Hollywood A-lister Sylvester Stallone.</p>

<p>"Rocky" star Stallone told the audience, which included ever-present Tesla CEO Elon Musk, that Trump was a "mythical character."</p>

<p>Trump joked that he couldn't get Musk out of his Mar-a-Lago resort.</p>

<p>"He likes this place, I can't get him out of here," he said. "I like having him here as well. He's done a fantastic job, an incredible mind."</p>

<p>Trump's first recruitments -- including secretary of state pick Marco Rubio, a traditional conservative on foreign policy -- were seen as relatively mainstream choices.</p>

<p>But then he caused concern even among some in the Republican Party as he appeared to put preference for personal loyalty above expertise or suitability.</p>

<p><strong>Personal lawyers</strong></p>

<p>A major shock was naming Matt Gaetz -- a firebrand Republican far-right figure in Congress who was drawn into a years-long criminal probe into sex trafficking -- as future attorney general.</p>

<p>Gaetz denies wrongdoing and has never faced charges but was still being investigated by the House Ethics Committee.</p>

<p>That decision followed Trump's nomination of former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard -- who met Syria's president Bashar al-Assad and echoes Russian President Vladimir Putin's talking points -- to take charge of the nation's most sensitive secrets as director of national intelligence.</p>

<p>Trump recruited Pete Hegseth -- a combat veteran who has no experience running large organizations but is a host on Trump's favorite Fox News network -- as defense secretary.</p>

<p>Trump and his aides have vowed that much of his second term will be about clearing the deck of federal officials who acted as a restraining influence on his populist, right-wing agenda during his first term.</p>

<p>Gaetz's appointment would hand Trump, whose election likely means being freed from a string of serious criminal investigations, the advantage of a fierce partisan at the top of the Justice Department.</p>

<p>He intends to place a third personal attorney at the department by nominating John Sauer as solicitor general, which represents the US government at the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Trump has repeatedly threatened to go after a variety of political opponents.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have warned that the fight against malaria in Africa may have got tougher after a new study found that a lifesaving drug was becoming less effective among children with serious infections. The study published in the<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2826317" rel="noindex, nofollow"> <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em></a> (JAMA) stated that children had developed resistance to artemisinin - a key malaria drug that rapidly eliminates most malaria parasites in the body. Artemisinin resistance was first identified in southeast Asia in the 2000s but it is the first time it has been identified specifically in children with severe malaria in Africa.</p>

<p>Malaria is caused by a parasite called Plasmodium falciparum, which spreads through the bite of a mosquito. The World Health Organization's (WHO) 'gold standard' treatment involves the use of a course of pills containing an artemisinin derivative combined with a 'partner' drug that circulates in the body for longer and kills the remaining parasites. These regimens are called artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs).</p>

<h3><strong>Study methodology</strong></h3>

<p>The study was conducted in Uganda, involving 100 children hospitalised with severe malaria. The test findings showed that 11 of these children had developed partial resistance to artemisinin -- meaning that the parasites were evolving to evade the 'gold standard' malaria treatment. All the children with resistant malaria carried genetic mutations linked to drug resistance.</p>

<p>"If this is verified by other studies, it could change guidelines for treatment of severe malaria in African children, and they are the biggest target group by far," Chandy John, a specialist in paediatric infectious diseases at Indiana University in Indianapolis and co-author of the study told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://Scientists have warned that the fight against malaria in Africa may have got tougher after a new study found that a lifesaving drug was becoming less effective among children with serious infections.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was well past midnight on November 5, 2024, the election day in the United States. The results were still coming, but a jubilant Republican crowd in Florida was certain of Donald Trump's return to the White House. They gave him and his entire entourage a hero's welcome. Among those on stage were his wife, Melania, and his youngest son, Barron Trump, who remained anonymous for much of his father's campaign trail.</p>

<p>Standing well over 6 feet and 9 inches tall, Barron, an imposing figure, flashed a smile at the sea of supporters. While Barron's four older half-siblings â Donald Trump Jr, Ivanka Trump, Eric Trump and Tiffany Trump â&nbsp; have all taken on roles as political advisors and business figures, he remained more of a backroom guy.</p>

<p>Barron has reportedly been advising Trump on connecting with the Gen Z voters who are crucial to modern political campaigns. The President-elect credited his youngest son for persuading him to appear on Joe Rogan's podcast, a major success nearing 50 million views.</p>

<p>The election was special for the 18-year-old, who also cast his first vote this year. Photographed at the voting booth, he proudly supported his father in the presidential race.</p>

<p>Let's take a closer look at this young man and his journey so far.</p>

<p><strong>Early life</strong></p>

<p>Born on March 20, 2006, Barron Trump is the only child of Donald and Melania. Trump named him Barron, a name he always liked but never had the opportunity to use for his other sons, reported People.</p>

<p>His early years were spent mostly away from the spotlight, which followed the lives of his older siblings and parents.</p>

<p>During Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2016, Barron, though young, became a subject of public curiosity. When his father won the presidency and moved into the White House, Barron stayed behind in New York City for several months to finish the school year. This move was initially seen as an attempt to give Barron some semblance of a normal childhood, despite his father's sudden and meteoric rise to the highest office in the United States.</p>

<p><strong>Schooling and education</strong></p>

<p>Barron Trump has attended a series of prestigious schools. During his early years in New York City, he was enrolled at the Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School on Manhattan's Upper West Side. In May 2017, it was announced that Barron would move to St. Andrew's Episcopal School in Potomac, Maryland. Unlike every other presidential child over the past 35 years, who attended Sidwell Friends, Barron made history as the first to attend St. Andrew's. In a statement, Melania Trump expressed her admiration for the school's âdiverse community and commitment to academic excellence.â</p>

<p>In 2024, Barron Trump began his freshman year at New York University's prestigious Stern School of Business, a departure from the tradition set by his older siblings and father. Unlike Donald Trump and Barron's siblings â Donald Trump Jr, Ivanka Trump, Eric Trump and Tiffany Trump â who attended or graduated from institutions such as the University of Pennsylvania and Georgetown University, with strong connections to the family, Barron charted his path.</p>

<p><strong>Moving to the White House</strong></p>

<p>When Trump first won the presidency, he said that Barron was initially nervous about the move from New York City to the White House. At the time, Barron was just nine years old and strongly attached to his life in New York, school and friends. The prospect of leaving everything behind for a new chapter in Washington D.C. was a significant change for the young boy.</p>

<p>âHe does love New York and he loves his school. Not so much living in the White House. He does like what he's got right now. That would be a whole change of life. But when he hears I'm going to help people that solves the problem,â Trump told People magazine.</p>

<p>Finally, at 11, Barron moved into the White House, where he lived with his parents until 2019. That year, the Trump family permanently relocated to Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump's private club in Palm Beach, Florida.</p>

<p><strong>Barron Trump's hobbies</strong></p>

<p>Despite keeping a low profile, Barron's interests and activities have occasionally come to the media's notice. He is known for his love for sports, something his mother Melania confirmed in 2018. One of the sports he enjoys is football, but his father, Donald Trump, has expressed some reservations about the dangers in the game. He has also been involved in other activities such as golf and basketball, reflecting a well-rounded personality with a strong interest in athletics.</p>

<p><strong>Command of English and Slovenian</strong></p>

<p>Barron Trump is bilingual and can speak English and Slovenian, the native language of his mother. As a child, Barron would often call his grandmother and speak with her solely in Slovenian, Melania told People magazine. When it comes to the language Barron should use in public, she and her husband, Donald Trump, are in agreement. English remains his primary language.</p>

<p><strong>The tallest Trump</strong></p>

<p>Barron Trump's height is something you just cannot ignore. Standing at a reported 6 feet 9 inches, he is the tallest member of the Trump family. This towering figure surpasses his father, Donald Trump, who is 6 feet 3 inches tall. Compared to his half-brothers, Barron stands out. Donald Trump Jr. is 6 feet 1 inch and Eric Trump is 6 feet 5 inches.</p>

<p>While Google lists Barron's height as 6 feet 9 inches, Donald Trump mentioned in a January 2024 speech that Barron is âalready 6 feet 7 inchesâ â still a remarkable height, regardless of the exact measurement. Donald jokingly attributed his son's height to the home-cooked meals prepared by Melania's late mother, Amalija Knavs.</p>

<p>Barron's height often draws attention, especially during public appearances.</p>

<p>After Trump's victory in elections, his campaign's senior adviser Jason Miller said Barron was involved in recommending several podcasts his father must do ahead of the November 5 voting. âHats off to the young man. Every single recommendation he's had has broken the internet,â Miller told Politico's Playbook Deep Dive podcast.</p>

<p>With Donald Trump already making important appointments to his cabinet ahead of the January 20th inauguration for his second term, many wonder if the 18-year-old will be more actively involved in the next four years.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Elon Musk, a close ally of US President-elect Donald Trump, had a "positive" meeting with Iran's ambassador to the UN on defusing tensions between Tehran and Washington, as per a report.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk, the tech billionaire closely allied with US President-elect Donald Trump, met Iran's ambassador to the United Nations in a bid to defuse tensions between Tehran and Washington, The New York Times reported Thursday.</p>

<p>The newspaper quoted anonymous Iranian sources as describing the meeting between the world's richest person and Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani as "positive."</p>

<p>The two met for more than an hour at a secret location on Monday, the newspaper said.</p>

<p>Neither the Trump transition team nor Iran's mission to the United Nations immediately confirmed the encounter, with the Iranian mission saying it had no comment.</p>

<p>The meeting, if confirmed, could offer an early indication that Trump is serious about diplomacy with Iran and not choosing the more hawkish approach favored by many conservatives in his Republican Party as well as Israel.</p>

<p>It would also show again the extraordinary influence of Musk, the owner of Tesla and X who has been a near constant presence at Trump's side, reportedly joining him on telephone calls with world leaders.</p>

<p>Trump in his last term in office tore up a deal on Iran's nuclear program negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama, instead pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" that included working to force other nations not to buy Iran's oil.</p>

<p>But Trump has cast himself as a great dealmaker and during his latest campaign has voiced an openness to diplomacy, despite his avowed support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has ordered military strikes on Iran in tandem with Israel's war on Hamas.</p>

<p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, considered a moderate within the clerical state, on Thursday told the visiting head of the UN nuclear watchdog that Tehran wanted to clear up doubts about the country's "peaceful" nuclear program.</p>

<p>Iran's ambassador also urged Musk in their meeting to seek US sanctions exemptions and conduct business in Tehran, the Times said, citing an Iranian Foreign Ministry official.</p>

<p>Along with foreign policy, Trump has put Musk and another wealthy entrepreneur, former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, in charge of a new "Department of Government Efficiency" tasked with overhauling the federal bureaucracy.</p>

<p>The new initiative has raised questions about conflicts of interest given the extensive interactions between Musk's businesses and the government.</p>

<p>An account for the program has been created on X, formerly Twitter, where it asked applicants to apply through a direct message.</p>

<p>"We need super high-IQ small-government revolutionaries willing to work 80+ hours per week on unglamorous cost-cutting," said a post on X, adding that "Elon &amp; Vivek will review the top 1% of applicants."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump, who is set to return to the White House after his victory over Kamala Harris in the November 5 US presidential elections, has appointed anti-vaccine activist Robert F Kennedy Jr as his secretary of the health department. "Kennedy will restore these agencies to the traditions of gold standard scientific research, and beacons of transparency, to end the chronic disease epidemic, and to Make America Great and Healthy Again!â Trump said.</p>

<p>Moving quickly since his election last week, Trump has begun rolling out his administration - some of whom include&nbsp;a TV news anchor at the helm of the Pentagon.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake's party was set for a landslide victory in snap legislative elections, initial results showed Friday.</p>

<p>With more than half the ballots in Thursday's parliamentary elections counted, Dissanayake's National People's Power (NPP) coalition party had taken an unassailable lead with 63 percent of votes, Election Commission results showed.</p>

<p>Friday's results showed the NPP, which had only three seats in the outgoing parliament, comfortably leading in almost every constituency in the 225-member house.</p>

<p>Anura Kumara Dissanayake took power in September's presidential elections on a promise to combat graft and recover the country's stolen assets, two years after an unprecedented economic meltdown, when then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa was ousted.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the 55-year-old said he expected "a strong majority" in parliament to press ahead with his platform.</p>

<p>"We believe that this is a crucial election that will mark a turning point in Sri Lanka," Dissanayake told reporters after casting his ballot at a polling station in the capital.</p>

<p>"At this election, the NPP expects a mandate for a very strong majority in parliament," he said referring to the coalition party in which his JVP, or People's Liberation Front, (JVP) is the main constituent.</p>

<p>Police said the nine-hour voting period passed without any incidents of violence, unlike most ballots of recent years, but three election workers including a police constable had died due to illness while on duty.</p>

<p>Voter turnout was estimated at under 70 percent, less than in the September presidential polls when nearly 80 percent of Sri Lanka's eligible voters cast a ballot.</p>

<p>"I expect a new country, a new government that is friendly towards the people," 70-year-old pensioner Milton Gankandage, among the first to vote in Colombo's Wellawatte district, told AFP.</p>

<p>"Previous rulers deceived us. We need a new set of rulers who will develop the country."</p>

<p>Dissanayake had been an MP for nearly 25 years and was briefly an agriculture minister but his NPP coalition held just three seats in the outgoing assembly.</p>

<p>He rushed into the presidency after successfully distancing himself from establishment politicians blamed for steering the country to its worst economic crisis in 2022.</p>

<p><strong>Read |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/the-rise-of-anura-kumara-dissanayake-sri-lankas-new-president-6628769">The Rise Of Lanka's Anura Kumara Dissanayake From Grassroots To President</a></p>

<p>His JVP party led two insurrections in 1971 and 1987, leading to at least 80,000 deaths, but Dissanayake was sworn in after an election described as one of the island nation's most peaceful.</p>

<p>University academic Sivalogadasan, who goes by one name, said Dissanayake needed more time to deliver his promises.</p>

<p>"Some things have started to change... but you can't expect immediately," the 52-year-old told AFP.</p>

<p><strong>'Investor confidence'</strong></p>

<p>There were 8,880 candidates vying for the parliament's 225 seats. Voting closed after nine hours on Thursday.</p>

<p>Despite previous promises to renegotiate a controversial $2.9 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout secured by his predecessor Ranil Wickremesinghe, Dissanayake has chosen to maintain the agreement with the international lender.</p>

<p>The country's main private sector lobby, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, is tacitly supporting Dissanayake and his programme.</p>

<p>"Continuing reforms... could encourage both investor confidence and fiscal discipline, setting a foundation for sustainable growth," CCC secretary Bhuwanekabahu Perera told AFP.</p>

<p>An IMF delegation is due in Colombo on Thursday to review economic progress before releasing the next $330 million tranche of the bailout loan.</p>

<p>Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, who had campaigned to take part in a coalition government, vowed in his final campaign rally to "put pressure" on Dissanayake to honour promised tax cuts.</p>

<p><strong>'Foregone conclusion'</strong></p>

<p>Poll monitors and analysts said Thursday's election had failed to generate the level of enthusiasm -- or violence -- seen at previous polls.</p>

<p>"The opposition is dead," political analyst Kusal Perera said. "The result of the election is a foregone conclusion."</p>

<p>The outgoing parliament was dominated by the party of former Mahinda and Gotabaya Rajapaksa, two brothers from a powerful political clan who have both served as president, but it has since splintered.</p>

<p>Neither Rajapaksa is contesting, but Mahinda's son Namal, a former sports minister, is seeking re-election.</p>

<p>Private sector executive Damayantha Perera, 49, said he knew the outcome of Thursday's election would favour Dissanayake's NPP and he voted for a party that was not tipped to win.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Donald Trump on Thursday tapped anti-vaccine activist and conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy as his secretary of health in the latest provocative nomination from the incoming Republican president.</p>

<p>Donald Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that he was "thrilled" to name Robert F. Kennedy.</p>

<p>Moving quickly since his election last week, Trump has embarked on a campaign of political shock and awe as he rolls out an administration designed to upend -- and in some cases literally dismantle -- the US government.</p>

<p>Several of Trump's choices for top jobs -- including a TV news anchor at the helm of the Pentagon and an ally embroiled in sexual misconduct allegations for attorney general -- have unnerved Washington.</p>

<p>Robert F. Kennedy, a scion of the famous political family who is popularly known as RFK Jr., is a longtime environmental campaigner who abandoned a fringe bid for the presidency to endorse Trump against Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Donald Trump has said he wants Robert F. Kennedy to "go wild" in changing healthcare.</p>

<p>Kennedy, 70, who has posted shirtless photos to boast of his weight-lifting prowess, argues that fundamental change is needed to the way Americans eat, exercise and use medicines.</p>

<p>If approved by the Senate, which Trump's Republican Party controls, he will take over the Health and Human Services Department, a mammoth institution with a budget of close to $2 trillion.</p>

<p>In his statement, Trump said Kennedy will "Make America Great and Healthy Again!"</p>

<p>The 78-year-old president-elect echoed many of Kennedy's talking points, saying "Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation."</p>

<p>"Mr Kennedy will restore these Agencies to the traditions of Gold Standard Scientific Research, and beacons of Transparency, to end the Chronic Disease epidemic," Trump said.</p>

<p>The nomination will meet serious opposition, given Kennedy's history of promoting medical conspiracy theories -- including the disproven claim that childhood vaccines cause autism -- and saying that the Covid-19 vaccine was deadly.</p>

<p><strong>Brain Worm</strong></p>

<p>He is also burdened by a string of colorful and even bizarre stories about his personal life.</p>

<p>These include his statement that a worm once entered his "brain and ate a portion of it and then died."</p>

<p>An admission this year that he was behind the long unsolved mystery of a dead bear dumped in New York's Central Park a decade ago raised eyebrows, as did subsequent revelations that the married politician was in a sexting relationship with a well-known journalist.</p>

<p>Trump has yet to select treasury and commerce chiefs to enact tax and trade policy. He has also not revealed his pick for education -- a department he wants to abolish.</p>

<p>Trump's first recruitments -- including secretary of state for Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a traditional conservative on foreign policy -- drew praise.</p>

<p>But then Trump dismayed Democrats and even some in the ultra-loyal Republican Party as he appeared to put preference for personal loyalty above expertise or suitability.</p>

<p>A major shock was naming Matt Gaetz -- a flamethrower on the Republican far right in Congress who was drawn into a years-long criminal probe into sex trafficking -- as future attorney general.</p>

<p>Gaetz denies wrongdoing and has never faced charges but was still being investigated by the House Ethics Committee.</p>

<p>That decision followed Trump's nomination of former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard -- who met Syria's president Bashar al-Assad and echoes Russian President Vladimir Putin's talking points -- to take charge of the nation's most sensitive secrets as director of national intelligence.</p>

<p>Trump recruited Pete Hegseth -- a combat veteran who has no experience running large organizations but is a host on Trump's favorite Fox News network -- as defense secretary.</p>

<p><strong>Clearing The Deck</strong></p>

<p>Trump and his aides have vowed that much of his second term will be about clearing the deck of federal officials who acted as a restraining influence on his populist, right-wing agenda during his first term.</p>

<p>Gaetz's appointment would hand Trump, whose election likely means being freed from a string of serious criminal investigations, the advantage of a fierce partisan at the top of the Justice Department.</p>

<p>Trump has repeatedly threatened to go after a variety of political opponents.</p>

<p>Although Republicans expect to have a three-seat majority in the incoming Senate, Gaetz is widely disliked and will struggle to win confirmation.</p>

<p>The naming of Gabbard has also sparked uproar, given her statements favorable to US adversary Russia, including her suggestion that Moscow's invasion of Ukraine was the result of "legitimate security concerns."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A US appeals court on Thursday granted a request by Special Counsel Jack Smith to pause the case against Donald Trump for mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US appeals court on Thursday granted a request by Special Counsel Jack Smith to pause the case against Donald Trump for mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House.</p>

<p>District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, had dismissed the case against the former president in July on the grounds that Smith was unlawfully appointed.</p>

<p>Smith appealed Cannon's ruling to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals but he asked the court on Wednesday to pause the proceedings following Trump's victory in the November 5 presidential election.</p>

<p>The special counsel asked the appeals court to give him until December 2 so the government can "assess this unprecedented circumstance and determine the appropriate course going forward consistent with Department of Justice policy."</p>

<p>The Justice Department has a long-standing policy of not prosecuting a sitting president.</p>

<p>A federal judge last week granted a request by Smith to pause the case against Trump for conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.</p>

<p>Trump is accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding -- the session of Congress called to certify Joe Biden's win, which was violently attacked on January 6, 2021, by a mob of the former president's supporters.</p>

<p>Smith also charged Trump with mishandling top secret documents after leaving the White House.</p>

<p>Trump was facing 31 counts of "willful retention of national defense information," each punishable by up to 10 years in prison. He also faced charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements.</p>

<p>The president-elect also faces two state cases -- in New York and Georgia.</p>

<p>He was convicted in New York in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels on the eve of the 2016 election to stop her from revealing an alleged 2006 sexual encounter.</p>

<p>Trump was scheduled to be sentenced in July, but his lawyers asked that his conviction be tossed in light of the Supreme Court ruling that an ex-president has broad immunity from criminal prosecution.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has ordered the "mass production" of suicide attack drones, state media reported on Friday, after he witnessed a test of the weapons system a day earlier.</p>

<p>Kim Jong Un oversaw the tests of drones designed to hit both land and sea targets, produced by North Korea's Unmanned Aerial Technology Complex (UATC).</p>

<p>"He underscored the need to build a serial production system as early as possible and go into full-scale mass production," Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.</p>

<p>"Suicide drones" are explosive-carrying unmanned drones designed to be deliberately crashed into enemy targets, effectively acting as guided missiles.</p>

<p>Pyongyang unveiled its suicide drones for the first time in August, with experts saying the capability may be attributable to the country's deepening alliance with Russia.</p>

<p>Thursday's test saw the drones "precisely" hit targets after flying along predetermined paths, KCNA reported.</p>

<p>"The suicide attack drones to be used within different striking ranges are to perform a mission to precisely attack any enemy targets on the ground and in the sea," the agency said.</p>

<p>Kim&nbsp;Jong Un said the drones were an "easy to use... component of striking power" due to their relatively low production cost and expansive range of applications, as per KCNA.</p>

<p>He said the North had "recently attached importance" to developing unmanned hardware systems and to integrating them with the country's overall military strategy.</p>

<p>Experts said the drones -- in images released by state media in August -- looked similar to the Israeli-made "HAROP" suicide drone, Russian-made "Lancet-3" and Israeli "HERO 30".</p>

<p>North Korea may have acquired these technologies from Russia, which in turn likely obtained them from Iran -- with Tehran itself suspected of accessing them through hacking or theft from Israel.</p>

<p>In 2022, Pyongyang sent drones across the border that Seoul's military was unable to shoot down, saying they were too small.</p>

<p>South Korea launched a drone operation command last year to better address the growing threat.</p>

<p>And earlier this year, Pyongyang accused Seoul of violating its sovereignty by flying drones over its territory to drop propaganda leaflets.</p>

<p>South Korea's military has denied the allegation.</p>

<p>In October, the North amended its constitution to define South Korea as a "hostile" state, an illustration of a sharp deterioration in ties since Kim in January declared Seoul his country's "principal enemy".</p>

<p>The North has continued to carry out UN sanctions-defying ballistic missile tests, and in October blew up roads and railways linking it to the South.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Center for Countering Digital Hate said on Thursday it would leave Elon Musk-owned social media site X, citing concerns that upcoming changes to the platform's terms of service could hinder the nonprofit's ability to prevail in court battles.</p>

<p>The exit marks the latest development in an ongoing tussle between Musk and CCDH, which has faulted him for letting hate speech spread on the platform formerly known as Twitter. British news publisher the Guardian also said earlier this week it would no longer post on X due to "disturbing content" on the platform.</p>

<p>CCDH said the updated terms for X set to roll out on Friday will steer future legal battles toward judges Musk believes "will be on his side".</p>

<p>Under the updated terms, all legal disputes related to X will be brought exclusively in the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas or state courts in Tarrant County, Texas.</p>

<p>"Now, the billionaire will be able to bring lawsuits to friendly courts against whoever disagrees with him on his platform," CCDH said.</p>

<p>"We made the decision to leave X because the platform has declined further."</p>

<p>Musk and X did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, a US judge dismissed Musk's lawsuit accusing the nonprofit of cherry-picking data to create false and misleading reports that the billionaire turned X into a haven for hate speech, extremism and misinformation.</p>

<p>X is also embroiled in other lawsuits with nonprofits.</p>

<p>The US District Court for the Northern District of Texas is presiding over X's lawsuit against Media Matters, accusing the group of defamation over a report about ads next to extremist posts.</p>

<p>The court is also presiding over X's lawsuit against Global Alliance for Responsible Media, accusing the group of unlawfully conspiring to boycott the site and causing it to lose revenue.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Europe's medicines watchdog on Thursday partially approved a marketing request for a long-awaited new treatment for Alzheimer's disease, reversing an earlier decision not to give it the green light.</p>

<p>"After re-examining its initial opinion, the EMA... has recommended granting marketing authorisation to Leqembi (lecanemab) for treating mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease," the European Medicines Agency said, adding treatment would only apply to a certain group of patients.</p>

<p>Leqembi, developed by US multinational Biogen and Japanese-based Eisai, is the brand name of an active substance called lecanemab that is used to treat adults with mild memory and cognitive problems resulting from the early stages of the common type of dementia.</p>

<p>The EMA in July rejected a marketing request, saying the side effects, including potential brain bleeding, outweighed the benefits.</p>

<p>The EMA now endorsed the treatment, but only for patients with a lower risk of potential brain bleeding -- those who had "only one copy or no copy of ApoE4", a type of gene know as an important risk factor for Alzheimer's.</p>

<p>Such patients are less likely to experience certain serious health problems than people with two copies of the gene, the Amsterdam-based EMA said.</p>

<p>The health problems in question, known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), include fluid on the brain and brain bleeding.</p>

<p>"The benefits of Leqembi outweigh the risks in patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease with one or no copy of ApoE4."</p>

<p>This was "provided that risk minimisation measures are in place to reduce the risk of severe and symptomatic ARIA and monitor its consequences in the long term," it stressed.</p>

<p>Bringing down the risks included providing Leqembi through a "controlled access programme to ensure that the medicine is only used in the recommended patient population" and through MRI scans before and during treatment.</p>

<p>The Amsterdam-based EMA's approval will now be sent to the European Commission for a final decision to roll it out on the continent.</p>

<p>Pricing and reimbursement will be left up to member states, the EMA said.</p>

<p>Lecanemab has been hailed by Alzheimer's researchers and charities for being the first approved treatment which tackles the early stages of the disease, rather than managing the symptoms.</p>

<p>It works by using antibodies which bind to and clear the proteins that normally build up in the brains of people with Alzheimer's, the most common type of dementia.</p>

<p>The treatment has been shown to decrease cognitive decline by a quarter in people in the early stages of the disease.</p>

<p>Britiain's medicines regulator approved lecanemab in August, making it the country's first such licensed treatment.</p>

<p>Leqembi, together with another Alzheimer's drug called Aduhelm, received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration early last year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People with diplomatic immunity in the UK allegedly committed offences including sexual assault, indecent exposure and child cruelty last year, a British government minister said on Thursday.</p>

<p>A total of nine "serious and significant offences" by suspects with diplomatic protection were recorded with the foreign ministry in 2023, junior foreign minister Catherine West told parliament in a written statement.</p>

<p>They included a Libyan accused of sexual assault, an Iraqi accused of possession or distribution of indecent images of children, a Portuguese person accused of indecent exposure and someone from Singapore facing an accusation of child cruelty or neglect.</p>

<p>"The vast majority of diplomats and dependants abide by UK law," said West, referring to the 26,500 people in Britain who have diplomatic or international organisation-related immunity from prosecution.</p>

<p>She said that when alleged criminal conduct is brought to the ministry's attention "we ask the relevant foreign government or international organisation to waive immunity, where appropriate, to facilitate further investigation.</p>

<p>"For the most serious offences, and when a relevant waiver has not been granted, we request the immediate withdrawal of the diplomat or dependant," West added.</p>

<p>She also revealed that diplomatic missions owe more than Â£152 million ($193 million) in unpaid congestion charge fees in London, from its introduction in 2003 to last month.</p>

<p>The US embassy owes more than Â£15 million alone. It refuses to pay the Â£15 daily charge to enter central London because it views it as a tax from which diplomatic missions should be exempt.</p>

<p>Japan owes Â£10.4 million while China owes Â£9.3 million.</p>

<p>West also disclosed that diplomats owed almost Â£1.5 million in unpaid parking fines at the end of June. Saudi Arabia owed the most at Â£196,000, she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alphabet's Google on Thursday released a smartphone app for its artificial intelligence chatbot on Apple's App Store that introduced the latest generation of its voice assistant to the popular mobile operating system.</p>

<p>The new Gemini app will include Gemini Live, a voice-based feature that allows users to have natural conversations with the chatbot. Apple has already said it will incorporate OpenAI's ChatGPT into a refreshed version of its voice assistant, Siri.</p>

<p>"It's great for when you want to practice for an upcoming interview, ask for advice on things to do in a new city, or brainstorm and develop creative ideas," Brian Marquardt, a senior director of product management at Google, said in a statement.</p>

<p>Gemini is Google's answer to ChatGPT, the popular application developed by Microsoft-backed OpenAI. Google initially launched it in February 2023 under the name Bard, and has since added more capabilities while weathering controversies.</p>

<p>Google announced the voice feature during an August event and first added it to phones powered by its own mobile operating system, Android.</p>

<p>Technical advances in AI spurred by the rise of large language models have fostered the emergence of a new generation of voice assistants far more capable than Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri and Google Assistant.</p>

<p>Google's Gemini Live is a replacement of Assistant, an eight-year-old product built using older AI technology.</p>

<p>Hundreds of employees on the Voice Assistant team were laid off in January as part of a reorganization to "become more efficient," a company spokesperson said at the time.</p>

<p>Google has since consolidated further. Last month it folded the Gemini app team into DeepMind, its AI research lab, in a move that CEO Sundar Pichai also attributed to increasing efficiency.</p>

<p>DeepMind is among the research organizations implementing new techniques to improve AI models as the traditional approach of building ever-bigger models has run in to unexpected delays and challenges, Reuters reported this week.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Bangladesh's top legal official has proposed to remove the words "secularism" and "socialism" from the Constitution apart from a provision prescribing capital punishment for regime change through extra-constitutional means.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's top legal official has proposed to remove the words "secularism" and "socialism" from the Constitution apart from a provision prescribing capital punishment for regime change through extra-constitutional means.</p>

<p>In his statement in the High Court during a hearing on a writ petition filed by a group of citizens, Attorney General Mohammad Asazzaman on Wednesday sought to remove "secularism" and "socialism" as two of the four principles of the Constitution alongside the designation of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as the Father of the Nation.</p>

<p>Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was the undisputed leader of Bangladesh but the Awami League politicised him in the party's interest, he said, referring to the founding leader of Bangladesh who is popularly known as Bangabandhu.</p>

<p>The writ petition challenged the validity of the Constitution's 15th amendment made by the now-ousted Awami League regime of deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina in 2011 while a two-judge High Court bench issued a rule asking the interim government to come up with its stance on the matter.</p>

<p>"As a whole, we do not want that (HC) rule to be scrapped," the attorney general said, clarifying the government's stance on the writ petition while talking to newsmen at his office.</p>

<p>Several people, mostly lawyers, emerged as interveners in the writ petition, some supporting the plea and some opposing it.</p>

<p>The 15th amendment was passed in parliament with the strength of a brute majority of the Awami League, restoring, inserting and scrapping several provisions in the Constitution.</p>

<p>The amendments included the restoration of secularism as a state principle, the scrapping of the caretaker government system for election oversight, assuming state power through extra-constitutional means and the designating of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as the Father of the Nation.</p>

<p>In his concluding arguments, Asaduzzaman told the court that the interim government wanted to declare the 15th amendment to the Constitution largely unconstitutional, retaining only select provisions.</p>

<p>He particularly demanded the restoration of the caretaker government system and the provision of the referendum in the Constitution.</p>

<p>The Awami League regime was toppled on August 5 in the face of a mass upsurge originating from a quota reform campaign by the Anti-Discrimination Students Movement. Three days later Nobel laureate Muhammad assumed office as the chief adviser of the interim government.</p>

<p>The attorney general criticised Article 7A inserted under the 15th amendment that criminalises any attempt to repeal, suspend, or subvert the Constitution through force or unconstitutional means, calling such acts as sedition, which are punishable with the death penalty.</p>

<p>He argued that this restriction limits democratic change and disregards the recent mass uprising that deposed the Awami League government and demanded the restoration of the caretaker government system.</p>

<p>"The (provisions of the 15th) amendment betrays the sacrifices of martyrs like Abu Sayed and Mugdho," said Asaduzzaman, referring to two students who were shot dead during the July-August mass protests.</p>

<p>Asaduzzaman was appointed as the attorney general days after the ouster of the past regime and the resignation of his predecessor.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Iranian state is planning to open a treatment clinic for women who flout the mandatory hijab laws that require them to cover their heads in public. Announcing the opening of a "hijab removal treatment clinic", Mehri Talebi Darestani, the head of the Women and Family Department of the Tehran Headquarters for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice said the establishment will offer "scientific and psychological treatment for hijab removal".</p>

<p>"The establishment of this center will be for the scientific and psychological treatment of removing the hijab, specifically for the teenage generation, young adults, and women seeking social and Islamic identity and visiting this center is optional," a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.iranintl.com/en/202411128960" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Iran International</a> quoted Talebi as saying.</p>

<p>Notably, the Women and Family Department of the Tehran Headquarters for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice falls under the direct authority of Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei. The body is reportedly responsible for defining and enforcing strict religious standards in Iran, particularly those related to women's dress.</p>

<h2><strong>Move Sparks Outrage</strong></h2>

<p>The announcement came weeks after a university student, who stripped down to her underwear on a Tehran campus in an apparent protest at harsh treatment by dress code enforcers, was detained and sent to a psychiatric hospital for mental health treatment.</p>

<p>The news of the new clinic has spread among the "Woman, Life, Freedom" protest groups and women, sparking fear and outrage.</p>

<p>Speaking with The Guardian on the condition of anonymity, a young woman from Iran said, "It won't be a clinic, it will be a prison."</p>

<p>"We are struggling to make ends meet and have power outages, but a piece of cloth is what this state is worried about. If there was a time for all of us to come back to the streets, it's now or they'll lock us all up," she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Iranian human rights lawyer, Hossein Raeesi, the idea of a clinic to treat women who did not comply with hijab laws is "neither Islamic nor aligned with Iranian law".&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Use Of Psychiatric Facilities To Curb Dissent</strong></h3>

<p>Iranian authorities have been widely accused of using mental health institutions to curb the dissent against the strict hijab law. The method has been condemned by human rights advocates as psychologically abusive and manipulative.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/nov/14/iran-announces-treatment-clinic-for-women-who-defy-strict-hijab-laws" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>, Sima Sabet, a UK-based Iranian journalist who was a target of an Iranian assassination attempt last year, said the move is âshamefulâ.</p>

<p>âThe idea of establishing clinics to âcure' unveiled women is chilling, where people are separated from society simply for not conforming to the ruling ideology," she said.</p>

<p>Since the "Woman, Life, Freedom" movement began, hardliners have increased efforts to enforce strict dress codes for women. Artists, including actresses Afsaneh Bayegan, Azadeh Samadi, and Leila Bolukat, who posted images of themselves without a hijab, reportedly received court-ordered mandates for weekly visits to psychological centers for mental health certificates in response to their conduct.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;"Woman, Life, Freedom" movement began in Iran after the death of young woman Mahsa Amini in police custody over hijab violations in September 2022.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Satirical news outlet The Onion said Thursday it had acquired Infowars, a conspiracy-laden website whose owner made money by running stories that called one of America's most notorious school shootings a hoax.</p>

<p>The Onion said it prevailed in a bankruptcy auction to buy Alex Jones' Infowars site with the support of families of victims of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.</p>

<p>The new Infowars, starting in January, will operate as a parody of its former self, The Onion said, with a anti-gun violence nonprofit founded after the 2012 shooting advertising on the site that once claimed the bloody attack was staged.</p>

<p>The massacre left 20 small children and six educators dead in a particularly gruesome chapter of America's gun violence epidemic.</p>

<p>Families sued Jones in 2018 after he spread the claim that the shooting rampage was staged with actors.</p>

<p>Four years later they won a $1.4 billion defamation settlement against Jones, who declared bankruptcy, and his company Free Speech Systems.</p>

<p>In September a judge in Texas said Infowars and other assets owned by Free Speech Systems could be auctioned to raise money for creditors who include Sandy Hook families.</p>

<p>The Onion declined to say how much it paid for Infowars, including its production studio and a dietary supplement business.</p>

<p>Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit created after the Sandy Hook shooting, will advertise on an overhauled version of Infowars.</p>

<p>The nonprofit said it and the Onion share the goal of ending gun violence.</p>

<p>A famous headline that The Onion runs after mass shootings is, "'No Way To Prevent This,' Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens."</p>

<p>The Onion's parent company, Global Tetrahedron, said bidding to buy Infowars was an easy decision to make, calling it an "invaluable tool for brainwashing and controlling the masses."</p>

<p>"InfoWars has shown an unswerving commitment to manufacturing anger and radicalizing the most vulnerable members of society -- values that resonate deeply with all of us at Global Tetrahedron," the company wrote Thursday on its website.</p>

<p>Ben Collins, the chief executive of Global Tetrahedron, said the new Infowars would make fun of internet personalities like Jones who traffic in misinformation.</p>

<p>"We thought this would be a hilarious joke," Collins told The New York Times.</p>

<p>"This is going to be our answer to this no-guardrails world where there are no gatekeepers and everything's kind of insane."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

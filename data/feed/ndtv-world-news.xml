       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sarco Pod, a futuristic capsule designed for assisted suicide, has sparked a massive controversy in Switzerland, especially after a 64-year-old American woman used one recently. Despite assisted suicide being legal in Switzerland, the incident has led to several arrests and scrutiny from authorities.</p>

<p><strong>What happened?</strong></p>

<p>On Monday, the Sarco Pod was used by a woman suffering from severe health issues at a woodland retreat in Merishausen, near the German border. Reports said she underwent a psychiatric assessment and wished to die due to years of suffering from a serious condition related to immune compromise. Her death was described as <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/if-you-want-to-die-chilling-message-us-woman-got-in-suicide-pod-6644385 ">“peaceful, fast, and dignified”</a> by Florian Willet, co-president of The Last Resort, the organisation behind the capsule.<br />
<br />
Following the incident, <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/swiss-police-make-arrests-after-suicide-capsule-is-used-for-first-time-6651845 ]">Swiss police arrested several people</a>, including Willet, and opened criminal proceedings for “inducing and aiding and abetting suicide.” Authorities said that they previously warned the organisation that using Sarco could have legal consequences.<br />
<br />
<strong>Is assisted suicide legal in Switzerland?</strong></p>

<p>In Switzerland, assisted suicide is permitted if the individual acts voluntarily and without coercion. However, active euthanasia – where a medical professional administers a lethal injection – is illegal. The legal framework says that those assisting in suicide must not do so for self-serving motives.<br />
<br />
<strong>Why the arrests?</strong></p>

<p>The arrests, following the incident, stem from concerns that the operators of the Sarco may have violated Swiss laws regarding assisted suicide. The authorities have opened an investigation to determine whether any criminal acts occurred in relation to the woman's death.</p>

<p>Swiss Interior Minister Elisabeth Baume-Schneider said on Monday that the Sarco capsule does not comply with existing product safety laws and it was “not legal”, AFP reported.</p>

<p><strong>How the Sarco pod works</strong></p>

<p>Invented by Philip Nitschke, a known figure in right-to-die advocacy, the Sarco Pod operates by filling a sealed chamber with nitrogen gas. This process reduces the oxygen levels significantly, leading to death by hypoxia. Once inside the pod, the user presses a button, triggering the release of nitrogen. According to Nitschke, the user loses consciousness within two minutes and dies within five minutes.</p>

<p>The use of this suicide pod has also led to some ethical debates about the nature of assisted dying. Some argue it provides a peaceful and self-directed option for those suffering, while critics worry about the implications of such devices and the potential for misuse or coercion.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The United States and its allies have called for a 21-day ceasefire on the Israel-Lebanon border, effective immediately.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States and its allies have called for a 21-day ceasefire on the Israel-Lebanon border, effective immediately. The proposed pause, endorsed by a 12-nation bloc, including the UK, EU and several Arab states, comes amid intense fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Israeli airstrikes have killed nearly 600 people and displaced roughly 5 lakh people in Lebanon since Monday.</p>

<p>The joint statement, issued by President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, stressed the need for safety and security, urging both Israel and Lebanon to agree to a temporary halt in hostilities. “The exchange of fire since October 7th, and in particular over the past two weeks, threatens a much broader conflict, and harm to civilians,” the leaders said. They said the proposed ceasefire would allow diplomatic efforts to succeed and “enable civilians to return to their homes.”</p>

<p>The call comes after Israel's military chief, Lt Gen <a href="http:// https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hints-at-lebanon-hezbollah-ground-invasion-as-joe-biden-warns-of-all-out-war-in-middle-east-6651437 ">Herzi Halevi, signalled that extensive airstrikes</a> on Hezbollah in Lebanon could lead to Israeli forces entering enemy territory. The joint statement by the US and its allies noted that the hostilities were presenting the risk of broader regional “escalations” across the border.</p>

<p>Despite the international push, official responses from the Israeli and Lebanese governments are still pending. According to a senior US official, negotiations with Lebanon are underway, expecting the government, and not Hezbollah, to take the lead in handling non-state actors within its borders, the BBC reported.</p>

<p>Earlier, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also called for an immediate ceasefire in Lebanon, cautioning that “hell is breaking loose.”</p>

<p>Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the airstrikes, calling them a violation of Lebanese sovereignty. He hoped for a resolution that pressured Israel into agreeing to the ceasefire, adding, “We are facing blatant violations of our sovereignty and human rights.”</p>

<p>In response, Israel's UN envoy, Danny Danon, maintained that Israel does not seek a full-scale war but is committed to using “all means at our disposal” to protect its citizens, in line with international laws.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, cross-border attacks continue, with Hezbollah targeting Israeli military and intelligence installations.</p>

<p>Iran, Hezbollah's primary backer, condemned Israel's airstrikes, warning that the Middle East is facing a “full-scale catastrophe.” Tehran also vowed it would support Lebanon by “all means necessary” should Israel intensify its military offensive.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 64-year-old woman from the US recently died by suicide using the Sarco suicide pod at a woodland retreat in Switzerland. The device delivered a haunting message in her final moments: “If you want to die, press this button,” reported AFP. The Sarco pod, with its futuristic design, operates by filling with nitrogen, leading to death through hypoxia. This self-operated, human-sized capsule has raised legal and ethical questions in Switzerland, where active euthanasia is illegal, yet assisted dying has been permitted for decades.</p>

<p>On the day the pod was used, Switzerland's Interior Minister, Elisabeth Baume-Schneider, told lawmakers that the Sarco remained “not legal,” leading to a fresh debate around its use.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at what the Sarco suicide pod is, how it works, and the controversies.<br />
<br />
<strong>What is the Sarco Pod?</strong><br />
<br />
The <a href="https://www.exitinternational.net/sarco/">Sarco pod</a>, short for sarcophagus, is a controversial euthanasia device that has attracted significant attention due to its innovative design and intended use. This 3D-printed, detachable capsule is mounted on a stand and contains a canister of liquid nitrogen, allowing individuals to end their lives through inert gas asphyxiation. First introduced in Switzerland in 2019, the capsule offers a means for people to die without the need for medical supervision. It releases nitrogen gas inside and reduces the oxygen levels to lethal amounts.<br />
<br />
The Sarco pod is the brainchild of Philip Nitschke, an Australian physician known for his advocacy of assisted suicide since the 1990s. His work has played a significant role in the ongoing discussions around the ethics and legality of euthanasia, according to CNN.<br />
<br />
The 3D-printable Sarco capsule cost over 6,50,000 euros (around Rs 6.06 crore) to research and develop in the Netherlands over 12 years, according to AFP.<br />
<br />
<strong>How does the Sarco pod work?</strong><br />
<br />
The Sarco pod replaces the oxygen inside with nitrogen, resulting in death by hypoxia. To operate the Sarco pod, the individual wishing to die must follow some steps:</p>

<ul>
	<li>To use the Sarco, individuals must first pass a psychiatric assessment.</li>
	<li>Users climb into the capsule, close the lid, and answer automated questions about their identity and understanding of the process.</li>
	<li>Once the button is pressed, the oxygen level in the capsule drops from 21% to 0.05% in less than 30 seconds.</li>
	<li>Individuals quickly lose consciousness and die within approximately five minutes.</li>
	<li>An emergency exit button is also located inside the pod, providing a potential escape route if needed.</li>
	<li>Once the hypoxia process is complete, the biodegradable capsule can be detached from the machine's base, allowing it to serve as the deceased individual's coffin.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nitschke's Exit International, which owns the Sarco, is a non-profit organisation funded by donations, with users only paying 18 Swiss francs (around Rs 1,769) for the nitrogen.<br />
<br />
<strong>Its legality in Switzerland</strong><br />
<br />
Switzerland has permitted assisted suicide since the 1940s, saying the ones assisting must have no direct interest in the individual's death. This legal framework has established Switzerland as a notable "death tourism" destination, attracting individuals from around the globe seeking the right to end their lives on their terms, Reuters reported. The use of the Sarco suicide pod has led to a renewed debate on the ethics and legality of euthanasia not just in Switzerland but across the world.</p><p><div class='table-div suicide'><table class='table'><thead><tr><th colspan='2'>Helplines</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vandrevala Foundation for Mental Health</td><td><a href='tel:+919999666555'>9999666555</a> or <a href='mailto:help@vandrevalafoundation.com'>help@vandrevalafoundation.com</a> </td></tr><tr><td>TISS iCall</td><td><a href='tel:+912225521111'>022-25521111</a> (Monday-Saturday: 8 am to 10 pm)</td></tr> <tr><td colspan='2'>(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Frano Selak, a Croatian man, miraculously cheated death seven times before eventually winning the lottery.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Frane Selak, an elderly Croatian man, is known around the world for being the luckiest man alive. What has happened with him has been more like movie scripts, which are larger than life but mostly unbelievable. However, Selak believes that reality is much stranger than anything the film industry can offer. Let's explore this intriguing story of a man whose life has been filled with a remarkable string of incredibly awful events.</p>

<p>This modest man was born in 1929 in Croatia. As a music teacher, which is hardly a thrilling job out there, he had a quite ordinary life. That is, until a tragic bus and train ride that started an absurdly long chain of events</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-27414609.amp"><em>the BBC,</em></a> Frano Selak is an octogenarian music teacher from Croatia. His run of near escapes began back, he says, in 1957, when he plunged into the river on a bus. Six more brushes with death followed. His train derailed and hurtled into a river; he walked away from not one but two exploding cars and survived a plane crash by landing on a haystack after being thrown clear. A protruding tree saved him when he drove off a cliff, and he bounced back from being hit by a bus. Then, as if to prove that he was the luckiest-rather than the unluckiest-man in the world, Selak won around $1 million (Rs 8,36,77,100) in a lottery, giving most of it away to friends and family.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ripleys.com/stories/unluckiest-man"><em>Ripley's,</em></a> in the mid-2000s, as though to make up for the horrible, horrible deal Lady Luck had given him, Selak won the lottery in Croatia. His jackpot was worth around $1 million (Rs 8,36,77,100). With this, he bought a luxurious home, only to have a change of heart and sell it in 2010. He returned to a humble life with his fifth wife.</p>

<p>Whatever happened along the way, Frane's story has a happy ending. He spent the last of his winnings on a hip operation and on a shrine to the Virgin Mary in thanks for his good fortune.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mira Murati quit as the Chief Technology Officer of OpenAI on Wednesday. She's the latest to join a growing list of high-profile exits from the company. Ms Murati's decision comes after six years with the artificial intelligence pioneer behind ChatGPT.</p>

<p>In a post on X, Ms Murati described her time at OpenAI as “an extraordinary privilege” and her decision to leave as “difficult.” “There's never an ideal time to walk away from a place one cherishes, but the moment feels right. I want to create the time and space to do my exploration,” she said.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded with a touching tribute to X, thanking her for her contributions and conveying his support.&nbsp;“It's hard to overstate how much Mira has meant to OpenAI, our mission, and to us all personally,” the CEO wrote. “I feel tremendous gratitude towards her for what she has helped us build and accomplish.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>He said he was "excited for what she'll do next."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Mira Murati, 35, played a major role in developing ChatGPT and overseeing releases of image generator Dall-E and AI code generator Codex. Her exit comes after her brief tenure as interim CEO following Mr Altman's ousting last November.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sam Altman announced Mark Chen as senior VP of research and Josh Achiam as head of mission alignment to ensure a smooth transition.</p>

<p>Mira Murati's departure follows those of co-founders Greg Brockman (on extended leave) and John Schulman (joined rival Anthropic), as well as a product team leader and former Meta employee. Earlier this year, co-founder Ilya Sutskever exited OpenAI after a boardroom dispute. Ms Murati's exit now leaves only two of its 11 founders remaining.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The shakeup comes as OpenAI releases its new Strawberry AI model, designed to improve "thinking" in generative AI chatbots. The company aims to address "hallucinations" - persuasive but incorrect content - and provide more accurate responses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A Japanese court on Thursday acquitted Iwao Hakamada, the world's longest-serving death row prisoner, closing a nearly six decades-long chapter.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Japanese court on Thursday acquitted Iwao Hakamada, the world's longest-serving death row prisoner, closing a nearly six decades-long chapter. After spending nearly half a century in solitary confinement, Hakamada was finally declared innocent of the 1968 murders that led to his conviction.</p>

<p>At 88, the former professional boxer was not present in the courtroom due to fragile health, but his 91-year-old sister, Hideko Hakamada, stood in his place, bowing deeply to the judge as the verdict was read. “The court finds the defendant innocent,” declared Judge Koshi Kunii at the Shizuoka District Court, as per AFP.</p>

<p>In 1968, Iwao Hakamada was convicted for the brutal murders of his boss, his boss's wife, and their two teenage children. The family was found stabbed to death in their home, which was subsequently set on fire. Hakamada, who worked at a soybean processing plant owned by the victim, confessed to the crime after 20 days of police interrogation, only to later retract his confession, saying it was forced through violence and intimidation.</p>

<p>Human rights activists have long decried Japan's so-called "hostage justice" system, where suspects are subjected to long periods of detention and aggressive questioning, often leading to forced confessions.</p>

<p>For nearly half a century, Iwao Hakamada lived in solitary confinement, waiting for the hangman's noose. Japan, unlike many industrialised nations, still retains the death penalty. Executions are carried out by hanging, and inmates are notified only hours before their execution.</p>

<p>Hakamada's lengthy detention took a significant toll on his mental health. According to his lawyers, he often appears disoriented, living in what they describe as a "world of fantasy."&nbsp;</p>

<p>His sister, Hideko Hakamada, who has campaigned tirelessly for his release, said her brother struggled to recognise reality. "We have not even discussed the trial with Iwao because of his inability to recognize reality," Ms Hideko, now 91, told AFP. "Sometimes he smiles happily, but that's when he's in his delusion."</p>

<p>Despite his mental state, Hakamada's brief taste of freedom over the past decade has provided some solace. According to Ms Hideko, small acts, such as taking care of two cats he adopted in February, have helped him reconnect with life outside prison walls. He also enjoys daily drives with his supporters, during which he indulges in his favourite pastries and juice.</p>

<p>Supporters of Hakamada gathered outside the court on Thursday with many holding banners and flags demanding his acquittal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"For so long, we have fought a battle that has felt endless," Hideko Hakamada said during a press conference earlier this year. "But this time, I believe it will be settled."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Iwao Hakamada's legal team, led by Hideyo Ogawa, is hopeful that the court will deliver a not-guilty verdict, bringing an end to this decades-long ordeal. "We told prosecutors that the onus is on them to put an end to this 58-year-old case," Mr Ogawa told reporters. However, prosecutors remain adamant that the initial conviction was just and that Hakamada should face the death penalty.<br />

<p>According to a report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1952573/prince-kate-prince-harry-call-birthday-worrying" rel="nofollow,noindex">Daily Express</a>, an insider said that Kate, who worried about the Duke of Sussex feeling “homesick”, was behind this kind gesture.</p>

<p>This public acknowledgement didn't go unnoticed among royal observers, given the ongoing tensions between the brothers. The Daily Express, citing a source, reported that Kate was the “driving force” behind reaching out to Harry, “as she slowly makes good on her vow to restore some kind of peace and forgiveness between the estranged royal and his family before it's too late.”</p>

<p>Despite the geography separating them, she ensured Harry received a birthday call and a thoughtful gift to celebrate the occasion.</p>

<p>“She (Kate) told William in no uncertain terms that this is not the time for resentment, they needed to show the world that love and family are front and centre of their values, but more importantly she wanted Harry to have this message on his big day,” The Daily Express quoted the insider as saying.</p>

<p>The source also added the outreach meant a great deal to Harry.<br />
<br />
Living in California with the Duchess of Sussex and their children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, Harry celebrated his special day with family before reportedly heading out for a gathering with friends.</p>

<p>The birthday messages marked the first public acknowledgement from the royal family since 2021, following Harry's controversial claims about the family in his interview with Oprah Winfrey and in his memoir, <em>Spare.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Plenty Richmond Farm is engineered to produce over four million pounds (1.8 million kg) of strawberries annually.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An innovative new agricultural project has started in Richmond, Virginia, United States, representing an impressive step forward in sustainable food production. The Plenty Richmond Farm is the world's first indoor, vertically farmed berries facility at a scale where they are harvested and preserved.</p>

<p>This new technique, backed by a worldwide team of scientists, which promises to make it possible to produce ample food supplies without badly impacting the environment. The farm-based approach uses towering structures in controlled conditions to grow strawberries, dramatically less land compared with traditional agriculture.</p>

<p>The strawberries, developed in collaboration with the multinational corporation Driscoll's, are anticipated to hit grocery store shelves in early 2025. This invention marks a significant expansion of vertical farming capabilities, which have previously been centred on leafy greens such as lettuce.</p>

<p>"With agriculture serving as the Commonwealth's largest private sector industry, Plenty choosing Virginia for the world's first farm to grow indoor, vertically farmed berries at scale reinforces Virginia's leading role in the controlled environment agriculture industry," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/plenty-opens-worlds-first-farm-to-grow-indoor-vertically-farmed-berries-at-scale-302255372.html">said Governor Glenn Youngkin.</a> "Plenty's farm will boost local agriculture production and drive economic development, all while diversifying against risks and protecting the environment. We look forward to supporting their innovative approaches to revolutionizing the industry, and know that Plenty's success will be Virginia's success."&nbsp;</p>

<p>By managing temperature, light, and humidity, the farm can improve plant growth and pollination, resulting in more consistent and high-quality product. This fresh approach is projected to reduce waste while increasing overall efficiency in the agriculture industry.</p>

<p>"This farm is a model for the positive impact climate-agnostic agriculture can have, and proof that vertical farming can deliver the crop diversity, scaled and local production needed to future-proof the global food system," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/plenty-opens-worlds-first-farm-to-grow-indoor-vertically-farmed-berries-at-scale-302255372.html">said Arama Kukutai</a>, Plenty CEO. "The Plenty Richmond Farm is the culmination of 200 research trials over the past six years to perfect growing strawberries with consistent peak-season flavor indoors year-round. Driscoll's sets an incredibly high bar for the quality of its berries and we're excited to join forces to consistently deliver an ultra-premium Driscoll's strawberry year-round."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati on Wednesday said she is leaving the company behind ChatGPT.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati on Wednesday said she is leaving the company behind ChatGPT, adding to a growing list of high-level departures. Murati called her more than six years at the San Francisco-based company "an extraordinary privilege" and described her decision to leave as difficult in a post on X, formerly Twitter.</p>

<p>"There's never an ideal time to walk away from a place one cherishes, but the moment feels right," Murati said in the post.</p>

<p>"I want to create the time and space to do my own exploration."</p>

<p>OpenAI chief Sam Altman replied to Murati's post with his thanks for what Murati has helped the company build, and promised details on a transition plan soon.</p>

<p>Murati is the latest influential member of the OpenAI team to step away from their position.</p>

<p>Co-founder Greg Brockman is on an extended leave of absence and fellow OpenAI founder John Schulman left for AI sector rival Anthropic, according to a report in The Information.</p>

<p>A product team leader who OpenAI had lured over from Meta also left, the report said.</p>

<p>OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever exited OpenAI early this year in the wake of a boardroom battle that saw Altman temporarily ousted from the company.</p>

<p>OpenAI earlier this month released a new series of artificial intelligence models designed to spend more time thinking -- in hopes that generative AI chatbots provide more accurate and beneficial responses.</p>

<p>The new model, nicknamed Strawberry, is designed to tackle complex tasks and solve more challenging problems in science, coding and mathematics -- something that earlier models have been criticized for failing to provide consistently.</p>

<p>Unlike their predecessors, these models have been trained to refine their thinking processes, try different methods and recognize mistakes before they deploy a final answer.</p>

<p>OpenAI's push to improve "thinking" in its model is a response to the persistent problem of "hallucinations" in AI chatbots.</p>

<p>This refers to their tendency to generate persuasive but incorrect content that has somewhat cooled the excitement over ChatGPT-style AI features among business customers.</p>

<p>The new release came as OpenAI was raising funds that could see it valued around $150 billion, which would make it one of the world's most valuable private companies, according to US media.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Former staffers alleged that the 42-year-old royal mistreated employees and often made them feel "like s**t."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following accusations labelling her as "just terrible," "a dictator," and "absolutely relentless," Meghan Markle is now facing fresh claims regarding her conduct as a boss. In a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/former-employees-of-demon-meghan-markle-share-their-truth-on-her-psycho-moments" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>Daily Beast </em></a>report, a former staff member described the Duchess of Sussex as a "demon" prone to "psycho moments." Former staffers alleged that the 42-year-old royal mistreated employees and often made them feel "like s**t."</p>

<p>One ex-staffer, who claimed to have worked for Meghan and Prince Harry during their time at the palace, was particularly critical.</p>

<p>"There were definitely bad, even psycho moments," the source told the Daily Beast. "I saw people being berated in person and over the phone, made to feel like s-t."</p>

<p>The source admitted it was a stressful period and gave the royal the benefit of the doubt, referencing her admission of suicidal thoughts.</p>

<p>Another source, who reportedly worked with Meghan leading up to her 2018 wedding, labelled her a "narcissist."</p>

<p>"I always thought she was a classic narcissist, and getting her staff to praise her in magazines only confirmed it," the insider said, adding, "She's lovely when things go her way but a demon when they don't."</p>

<p>A different insider alleged a florist was "screamed at" for over half an hour for posting a minor detail about a bouquet online.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"They vowed never to work with her again, despite the prestige," the insider noted, claiming staff were often treated "like tradesmen who could be treated like s-t."</p>

<p>While The Daily Beast's report paints Markle in a negative light, Us Weekly released a more favourable account, featuring positive remarks from Ben Browning, who worked on Meghan and Harry's 2022 Netflix documentary, and former chief of staff Catherine St-Laurent, both describing their time with the couple as meaningful and supportive.</p>

<p>However, the Hollywood Reporter presented a contrasting narrative, with sources accusing Markle of belittling her staff and acting as a "dictator in high heels." One source claimed to have witnessed her reduce "grown men to tears."</p>

<p>Throughout the years, Markle and Prince Harry have faced a high turnover of staff. In 2018, Buckingham Palace investigated claims of Meghan's bullying behavior, but the findings were never made public, with Markle dismissing the allegations as part of a "calculated smear campaign."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Hindu College in Delhi has expressed its "immense pride" in its alumna, Harini Amarasuriya, becoming the 16th Prime Minister of Sri Lanka.</p>

<p>"Hindu College proudly celebrates the remarkable achievement of its alumna, Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, who has made history by becoming the 16th Prime Minister of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and the third woman to hold this prestigious office. Dr. Harini's journey from the classrooms of Hindu College to the highest office in her country is a moment of immense pride for her alma mater," the college said in a statement.</p>

<p>Amarasuriya of the National People's Power (NPP) party is an academic, rights activist, and university lecturer and is known for her work in education and social justice. Her appointment marks a significant milestone in Sri Lankan politics.</p>

<p>Reflecting on this extraordinary milestone, Hindu College's principal, Prof. Anju Srivastava, shared, "Dr. Harini Amarasuriya was a student of the Sociology Department during her academic years at Hindu College from 1991 to 1994. We are incredibly proud of her success and her rise to such a significant leadership role. We are sure that her time at Hindu College played a part in shaping her path to becoming a transformative leader."</p>

<p>Hindu College has long fostered leadership skills through its unique student-led parliamentary system, where students elect a prime minister and leader of the opposition each year.</p>

<p>"This system broadens students' horizons and helps cultivate the leaders of tomorrow. Dr. Harini Amarasuriya is a shining example of how this experience can inspire and empower students to make a lasting impact on society and their nation," Srivastava said .</p>

<p>"We are confident that Dr. Harini Amarasuriya's leadership, vision, and unwavering commitment to public service will serve as a beacon of hope for Sri Lanka, guiding the nation towards greater progress and prosperity," she added.</p>

<p>Amarasuriya becomes Sri Lanka's third woman Prime Minister after Sirimavo Bandaranaike and Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. The new Sri Lankan PM is the first academic-turned-politician to assume office. Harini Amarasuriya entered Parliament through the NPP national list in 2020.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Julianne Moore, Sarah Paulson, and James McAvoy are among the celebrities who have shared the post so far, which first gained traction earlier this month.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In early September, a viral message spread throughout social networking sites like Threads, Facebook, and Instagram, claiming to prevent Meta from freely accessing users' personal information. The tweet, which was apparently shared by over 600,000 people, including several well-known celebrities, began with the phrase, "Goodbye Meta AI."</p>

<p>According to<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4d5jjqg2qo"><em> the BBC</em></a>, film stars Julianne Moore, James McAvoy, and Ashley Tisdale, as well as former NFL player Tom Brady, are among those who re-shared the fake "Goodbye Meta AI" message on Instagram stories.</p>

<p>The message reads, "Goodbye Meta AI. Please note an attorney has advised us to put this on; failure to do so may result in legal consequences. As Meta is now a public entity, all members must post a similar statement."</p>

<p>"If you do not post at least once, it will be assumed you are okay with them using your information and photos. I do not give Meta or anyone else permission to use any of my personal data, profile information, or photos."</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4d5jjqg2qo"><em>the BBC</em></a>, many of these messages have now been labelled "false information" by Lead Stories, one of Meta's third-party fact-checking sites.</p>

<p>The post appears to have been created in opposition to Meta's announcement in June that it will use public posts to train its AI model, but the company has confirmed to the BBC that posting the message has no impact on any user's privacy settings.</p>

<p>"Does posting a statement ensure that users of Meta services will not have their data used in Meta's artificial intelligence training? No, that's not true: Posting the viral statement, or any other statement, doesn't mean that Meta will not use that data for AI training, but users in Europe can object via a form in their account settings," Lead Stories, aka Facebook's fact-checking partner since 2019, said on its <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2024/09/fact-check-legal-statement-does-not-protect-user-data-from-metas-generative-ai-its-made-up.html">official website.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pulitzer Prize winning author Jhumpa Lahiri declined to accept an award from New York City's Noguchi Museum after it fired three employees for wearing keffiyeh head scarves, an emblem of Palestinian solidarity, following an updated dress code.</p>

<p>"Jhumpa Lahiri has chosen to withdraw her acceptance of the 2024 Isamu Noguchi Award in response to our updated dress code policy," the museum said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"We respect her perspective and understand that this policy may or may not align with everyone's views." Lahiri received the Pulitzer Prize in 2000 for her book "Interpreter of Maladies."</p>

<p>Across the world, protesters demanding an end to Israel's war in Gaza have worn the black-and-white keffiyeh head scarf, a symbol of Palestinian self-determination.</p>

<p>Anti-apartheid South African leader Nelson Mandela was also seen wearing the scarf on many occasions.</p>

<p>Israel's supporters, on the other hand, say it signals backing extremism.</p>

<p>In November, three students of Palestinian descent in Vermont were shot in an attack. Two were wearing the keffiyeh.</p>

<p>Israel's ongoing assault on Gaza has killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly everyone there. It followed a deadly attack by Palestinian Hamas militants on Israel on Oct. 7.</p>

<p>Last month, the art museum - founded by Japanese American sculptor Isamu Noguchi - announced a policy prohibiting employees from wearing anything that expressed "political messages, slogans or symbols." Three employees were sacked.</p>

<p>Other people in the United States have also lost their jobs due to their stance on the Israel-Gaza war.</p>

<p>A New York City hospital fired a Palestinian American nurse in May after she called Israel's actions in Gaza a "genocide" during an acceptance speech for an award. Israel denies genocide charges brought by South Africa at the World Court.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Swiss police have arrested several people after a controversial futuristic-looking capsule designed to allow its occupant to commit suicide was used for the first time, authorities said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Police in the northern canton of Schaffhausen bordering Germany said the so-called "Sarco" capsule <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-woman-64-dies-in-controversial-suicide-capsule-in-switzerland-6641812">had been deployed</a> in a wood in the municipality of Merishausen on Monday.</p>

<p>Prosecutors in Schaffhausen have opened criminal proceedings against several people for "inducing and aiding and abetting suicide", a police statement said, adding several people were detained, without giving details about them or the deceased.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the group behind the capsule, The Last Resort, said the deceased was a 64-year-old American woman who had been suffering from a severely compromised immune system.</p>

<p>Florian Willet, co-president of The Last Resort, was among the four detainees, along with a Dutch journalist and two Swiss people, the spokesperson said. Willet was the only other person present when the woman ended her life, the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>In a statement issued by The Last Resort, Willet had described the death as "peaceful, fast and dignified."</p>

<p>The Last Resort spokesperson said the woman had passed psychiatric evaluations prior to ending her life.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for prosecutors in Schaffhausen declined to give details or confirm there were four detainees.</p>

<p>Cast along sleek, aerodynamic lines, the "Sarco" causes death when its occupant releases nitrogen gas inside, lowering the amount of oxygen to lethal levels. It is the brainchild of Philip Nitschke, an Australian physician famous for his work on assisted suicide since the 1990s.</p>

<p>Switzerland has been a magnet for advocates of assisted suicide due to laws that make it legal there, and The Last Resort says its legal advice was that it could be deployed.</p>

<p>The capsule has generated considerable media attention and discussion among authorities on whether they would allow it.</p>

<p>Elisabeth Baume-Schneider, the Swiss minister responsible for health, said on Monday that the capsule does not meet the requirements of product safety law, and that its use of nitrogen is not legally compliant.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p><p><div class='table-div suicide'><table class='table'><thead><tr><th colspan='2'>Helplines</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vandrevala Foundation for Mental Health</td><td><a href='tel:+919999666555'>9999666555</a> or <a href='mailto:help@vandrevalafoundation.com'>help@vandrevalafoundation.com</a> </td></tr><tr><td>TISS iCall</td><td><a href='tel:+912225521111'>022-25521111</a> (Monday-Saturday: 8 am to 10 pm)</td></tr> <tr><td colspan='2'>(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA astronaut Tracy Dyson safely returned to Earth in Kazakhstan on Monday, September 23, after travelling 78 million miles in space aboard a Soyuz capsule. Alongside her were Russian cosmonauts Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub, who also landed after spending 374 days on the International Space Station (ISS), marking the longest continuous stay at the station.</p>

<p>Dyson spent 184 days in space, completing 2,944 orbits around Earth. There are still eight astronauts aboard the ISS, including Americans Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, whose return to Earth has been delayed.</p>

<p><em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-astronaut-tracy-c-dyson-crewmates-return-from-space-station/" rel="nofollow, noindex">NASA </a></em>reported that the trio departed the ISS aboard the Soyuz MS-25 spacecraft at 4:36 a.m. EDT on Monday, September 23, and made a safe, parachute-assisted landing at 7:59 a.m. (4:59 p.m. Kazakhstan time) southeast of Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan.</p>

<p>During her time aboard the ISS, Dyson participated in various scientific and technological activities. Notably, she operated a 3D bioprinter to print cardiac tissue samples, which could pave the way for advancements in creating replacement organs and tissues for transplants. She also worked on crystallizing model proteins to test hardware for potential pharmaceutical applications and oversaw a program where student-designed software controlled the station's free-flying robots, inspiring future innovators.</p>

<p>Dyson had launched on March 23 and arrived at the station two days later with Roscosmos cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy and spaceflight participant Marina Vasilevskaya from Belarus. Novitskiy and Vasilevskaya stayed on the station for 12 days before returning to Earth on April 6 with NASA astronaut Loral O'Hara.</p>

<p>In total, Dyson's third spaceflight lasted 184 days, during which she orbited the Earth 2,944 times and travelled 78 million miles as part of the Expedition 70/71 mission. She also conducted one spacewalk, lasting 31 minutes, bringing her total spacewalk time to 23 hours and 20 minutes across four spacewalks.</p>

<p>Kononenko and Chub, who launched with O'Hara on the Soyuz MS-24 spacecraft last September, spent 374 days in space, travelling 158.6 million miles over 5,984 orbits. Kononenko, on his fifth spaceflight, has now spent a record 1,111 days in orbit, while Chub completed his first spaceflight.</p>

<p>After post-landing medical checks, the crew will return to Karaganda, Kazakhstan, before Dyson boards a NASA plane bound for the Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Secret Service is investigating one of its agents after an incident involving someone in Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris' office, her office said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>

<p>A US Secret Service (USSS) spokesperson said separately that the employee was placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation into "a misconduct allegation involving an employee," without providing further details.</p>

<p>Harris' office has "zero tolerance for sexual misconduct," its statement said. Senior officials "were alerted by the USSS about an incident involving an agent and informed that USSS initiated an investigation," it read.</p>

<p>Neither the Secret Service agent nor the person in Harris' office were named in the statement by Harris' office. The office said it would not provide further information.</p>

<p>A Secret Service agent allegedly forced himself onto a Harris staffer in a hotel room in Wisconsin this week, Real Clear Politics reported, as the group scouted future campaign stops.</p>

<p>Harris faces Republican former President Donald Trump in what polls show to be a tight race for the Nov. 5 U.S. elections.</p>

<p>The Secret Service, which protects U.S. political leaders and their families, has been under scrutiny in recent weeks over the security of Trump, who survived an assassination attempt on July 13 during a rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The agency's former boss resigned in the aftermath and a probe found lack of diligence ahead of that shooting.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It looks like any other 3D printer - except it's the size of a crane and is, layer by layer, building a hotel in the Texan desert. El Cosmico, an existing hotel and campground on the outskirts of the city of Marfa, is expanding. It is building 43 new hotel units and 18 residential homes over 40 acres (16 hectares) - all with a 3D printer.</p>

<p>It is the world's first 3D-printed hotel, says El Cosmico owner Liz Lambert and the partners behind the project - Austin, Texas-based 3D printing company ICON and architects Bjarke Ingels Group.</p>

<p>Lambert said the technology allows for unprecedented creativity.</p>

<p>"Most hotels are contained within four walls and a lot of times you are building the same unit over and over and over again," Lambert said. "I've never been able to build with such little constraint and such fluidity ... just the curves, and the domes, and the parabolas. It's a crazy way to build."</p>

<p>The units can include architectural features that would normally be too expensive to replicate on a large scale with traditional construction, according to Lambert.</p>

<p>The single-story, 12-foot (3.7-meter) high walls of the first two units under construction are a three-bedroom residential space and a single-room hotel unit.</p>

<p>The curvy, beige-colored walls are being piped out by ICON's Vulcan, a 46.5-foot (14.2 m) wide 3D printer standing 15.5 feet (4.7 m) and weighing 4.75 tons.</p>

<p>A print technician monitors Vulcan as its robotic arm and nozzle glide through the work site on a gantry.</p>

<p>The "ink" of this 3D printer is a special cement-based material called Lavacrete, a proprietary mixture designed for strength, affordable scale, and printability. ICON CEO and founder Jason Ballard said workers adjust and blend the ingredients based on weather conditions.</p>

<p>"The magic happens in the admixtures that allow us to continue printing," Ballard said, adding that humidity, temperature, and irradiance affect the material's behavior and even the final color.</p>

<p>ICON is also working on a 3D-printed neighborhood of homes near Austin.</p>

<p>In the long term, 3D-printed construction could displace some skilled laboring jobs, said Milad Bazli, a science and technology lecturer at Charles Darwin University in Australia.</p>

<p>"I think from the social point of view and the effect on the economy in terms of the local jobs, especially in remote areas, that will be one of the challenges that we need to consider when we're going to the 3D printing method," Bazli said.</p>

<p>The expansion of El Cosmico is set to be completed by 2026. The hotel units will range between $200 and $450 per night.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[New York City Mayor Eric Adams has been indicted after a federal corruption investigation, but the indictment is sealed and it is unclear what charges he will face, the New York Times reported on Wednesday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams said on Wednesday he expected to be charged with federal crimes and declared he was innocent, after the New York Times reported he had already been indicted following a long-running federal corruption investigation.</p>

<p>Adams, a Democrat who would become the first of the city's 110 mayors to be criminally charged while in office, said in a video statement that if charges were filed they would be "entirely false, based on lies." He vowed to remain in office while fighting them.</p>

<p>"If I'm charged, I know I'm innocent. I will request an immediate trial so New Yorkers can hear the truth," Adams said.</p>

<p>Defying calls from Democratic politicians for him to resign, he said: "You elected me to lead this city, and lead it I will."</p>

<p>The indictment was likely to be unsealed on Thursday when Adams may appear in court, the Times reported. In the meantime, the exact charges remained uncertain. It also remained unclear whether Adams would be arrested or voluntarily surrender.</p>

<p>Other media later reported that a federal grand jury had indicted Adams, citing unnamed sources.</p>

<p>The charges come after the FBI last November searched Adams' electronic devices, and in the wake of a slew of resignations by top city officials in recent weeks as multiple federal corruption investigations entangle his administration.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, which brought the charges, declined to comment. Adams' lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment except to send a transcript of his video statement.</p>

<p>One of his lawyers has said that the mayor was cooperating with an investigation but did not say what it was about.</p>

<p>Adams said the charges "would not be surprising" based on the "leaks and rumors" that he said were aimed at undermining his credibility.</p>

<p>If he were forced out of office, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams would become mayor of the United States' largest city with a population of about 8.3 million.</p>

<p>The case is likely to complicate any Adams bid for re-election in 2025. Other Democratic politicians, including New York City comptroller Brad Lander, plan to challenge Adams - once a key ally of Democratic President Joe Biden - for the party's nomination.</p>

<p>"The most appropriate path forward is for him to step down so that New York City can get the full focus its leadership demands," Lander said on X, joining a growing list of politicians to call for his resignation.</p>

<p>Before the news broke, U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, also a Democrat, became the first member of congress to urge him to step down, saying it would be "for the good of the city."</p>

<p>Shortly before the announcement, Adams appeared at a reception in New York at the Metropolitan Museum of Art attended by President Joe Biden and Jill Biden, both of whom made remarks. Adams did not address the gathering.</p>

<p>The Times, citing a search warrant, reported in early November 2023 that federal authorities were investigating the possible acceptance by Adams' 2021 campaign of illegal donations, including by the Turkish government.</p>

<p>The probe, conducted by the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, focused on whether Adams' 2021 mayoral campaign conspired with a Brooklyn construction company to funnel foreign money into the campaign through a straw-donor scheme, the Times said.</p>

<p>Authorities have also sought information about Adams' interactions with Israel, China, Qatar, South Korea and Uzbekistan, according to the Times.</p>

<p>Adams, 64, a former police officer who rose to the rank of captain, has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and said he is cooperating with the probe. His lawyers said in a statement on Aug. 15 they had conducted their own investigation into the matters prosecutors were probing and had not found evidence of illegal conduct by Adams.</p>

<p>"To the contrary, we have identified extensive evidence undermining the reported theories of federal prosecution as to the Mayor, which we have voluntarily shared with the U.S. Attorney," said the lawyers, Brendan McGuire and Boyd Johnson.</p>

<p>New York has been in a state of political upheaval for the past month. Police Commissioner Edward Caban resigned on Sept. 12, a week after FBI agents seized his phone. Days later, Adams' chief legal adviser resigned, saying she could "no longer effectively serve" in the position.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the city's public schools chancellor David Banks said he would retire at the end of the year, weeks after the Times reported his phones were seized by federal agents.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Keir Starmer has insisted that the UK-US special relationship will "prosper" under Donald Trump but the British prime minister's Labour government has multiple reasons to fear the Republican's presidential comeback.</p>

<p>Possible trade wars, Labour ministers' unflattering comments about Trump, and any role for Starmer critic Elon Musk in Trump's administration would make for a bumpy ride between the allies.</p>

<p>The UK's "iron-clad" support for Ukraine in its war against Russia's invasion and "unwavering commitment" to the NATO military alliance are also likely to become major bones of contention, experts said.</p>

<p>Starmer made a first move late on Wednesday, phoning Trump to offer his congratulations, telling reporters at a European summit in Budapest Thursday that the call was "very positive, very constructive".</p>

<p>But Richard Whitman, an international relations professor at the University of Kent, said the centre-left government in London will be feeling "nervous" about Trump's return to the White House.</p>

<p>"Most of the broad parameters of British foreign policy are set by responding to what are the major preoccupations of the United States," he told AFP, noting doubts over Trump's commitment to Ukraine and NATO.</p>

<p>Britain has been one of Ukraine's biggest financial and military backers since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 and any shift in policy by Trump would leave the country in an unenviable position.</p>

<p>"(The UK) can't do a 180-degree shift on Ukraine because it's invested too much," said Whitman.</p>

<p>Simon Fraser, formerly the top civil servant in the UK's foreign ministry, added that the UK-US relationship could be complicated by Trump's approach to the European Union -- and whether that includes tariffs on allies.</p>

<p>Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of up to 20 percent on all US imports and 60 percent on Chinese goods.</p>

<p><strong>Economic unpredictability</strong></p>

<p>A trade war between Trump and the EU could see the UK stuck in the middle.</p>

<p>Global economic volatility would hamper Starmer's pledge to fire up Britain's flagging economy.</p>

<p>The National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a leading think tank, has warned that Trump's tariff plans could halve UK economic growth in the next two years, pushing up prices and interest rates.</p>

<p>Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors, said a Trump presidency makes it "unlikely that any (UK-US) trade deal negotiations will be resurrected".</p>

<p>"The UK holds no obvious bargaining chip," she added.</p>

<p>Labour is historically close to the Democratic Party, and several senior figures attended its convention in Chicago in July when Kamala Harris was anointed its presidential candidate.</p>

<p>Last month, Trump accused Starmer's government of "blatant foreign interference" in the US election over the visit and Labour staffers campaigning for Harris.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, Labour has spent recent months trying to build bridges with Trump's team, and Starmer dined for two hours with Trump in September.</p>

<p>Previous comments by senior Labour figures have the potential to make dealings awkward, however, none more so than for Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who in 2018 called Trump a "woman-hating, neo-Nazi sympathising sociopath" and a "tyrant in a toupee".</p>

<p>Senior minister Pat McFadden on Thursday said Trump was a "fan of the United Kingdom" and Starmer's face-to-face meeting with him had been "productive".</p>

<p>"I think in the end, those shared values and interests are more important than some tweet from however many years ago," he said. "You can move past these things."</p>

<p><strong>No plan B</strong></p>

<p>Starmer's political spokesperson on Wednesday insisted Lammy would stay in his post for the entire five-year parliamentary term.</p>

<p>But trouble could also come from Trump supporter and tech billionaire Musk, who earned a rebuke from ministers this summer after claiming that far-right riots across England would lead to "civil war".</p>

<p>Britain and the United States are also likely to disagree on climate, with Trump a self-proclaimed climate change sceptic and Labour determined to make Britain a "clean energy superpower".</p>

<p>Analysts point out the special relationship, forged during World War II, has endured for 80 years despite multiple governments of different persuasions on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>"Political differences at the top don't mean that the whole relationship is vulnerable. There are checks and balances," said Fraser, citing "institutional structures".</p>

<p>Whitman agreed that it would endure but added: "If it doesn't, then a great thick pillar of British foreign and security policy crumbles.</p>

<p>"And if you set that against what's already happened with (leaving) the EU, (then) the UK is really adrift.</p>

<p>"The UK doesn't have a hedging strategy. It doesn't have a plan B for its relationship with the US."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[What will Donald Trump's second stint in the White House mean for a US tech industry in the throes of an artificial intelligence frenzy? For sure Elon Musk will play a central role in Trump's Silicon Valley policies after backing his campaign.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What will Donald Trump's second stint in the White House mean for a US tech industry in the throes of an artificial intelligence frenzy?</p>

<p>For sure Elon Musk, the world's richest person, will play a central role in Trump's Silicon Valley policies after backing the Republican's presidential campaign.</p>

<p>"A star is born: Elon!" Trump said in a lengthy shoutout to the Tesla and SpaceX boss during his victory speech after Tuesday's election.</p>

<p>Musk is slated to take a significant role in the White House, where he will likely have influence over the regulation of tech, including in matters related to his companies Tesla, SpaceX and the X platform (formerly Twitter).</p>

<p>At Musk's side, will likely be a group of tech "accelerationists", members of Silicon Valley's more libertarian right-wing, who want innovation to thrive unfettered by the government.</p>

<p>Unlike their early caution during Trump's first term, tech titans were swift to laud the president-elect on his victory.</p>

<p>"Big congratulations to our 45th and now 47th President on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory," wrote Amazon founder Jeff Bezos on X.</p>

<p>Bezos had already signaled his shifting position by directing The Washington Post, which he owns, to refrain from endorsing Kamala Harris - a move widely interpreted as an attempt to avoid potential friction with a returning Trump administration.</p>

<p>Apple boss Tim Cook sent his congratulations, as did Mark Cuban, a tech billionaire backer of Harris, who said Trump won the election "fair and square."</p>

<p>Meta supremo Mark Zuckerberg congratulated Trump too and has spent the past months, carefully trying to rebuild a relationship with the president-elect, who often singles out the Facebook founder for his vitriol.</p>

<p>Policy-wise the tech titans will be united in wanting to see the departure of Lina Khan, the head of the Federal Trade Commission, who has pursued a policy of slowing the unrestricted spread of their tech empires.</p>

<p>An early target of Trump's attention could be the executive order from President Joe Biden on regulating artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>The order sets voluntary standards for AI safety, emphasizing privacy protection, fighting bias and offers guidelines on how AI can be deployed by the government.</p>

<p>It also established the US AI Safety Institute (AISI), a body to study risks in AI systems.</p>

<p>The order could be overhauled or rubbished, with Trump sympathetic to arguments that innovation should not be constrained by rules.</p>

<p><strong>Crypto craze</strong></p>

<p>Trump will almost certainly make it easier for cryptocurrencies to thrive after tech moguls closely linked to the industry donated generously to his campaign.</p>

<p>Crypto markets surged higher after his win, with bitcoin hitting a new all-time-high above $75,000.</p>

<p>During his presidency Trump referred to cryptocurrencies as a scam, but has since radically changed his position, even launching his own crypto product.</p>

<p>He will try to remove Gary Gensler, the crypto-skeptic head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who has become a loathed bogeyman for the sector.</p>

<p>The troubled fate of TikTok could change, with Trump having voiced opposition to a Biden-backed law, ordering that the popular app divest from Bytedance, its Chinese owner.</p>

<p>TikTok has until January to find a buyer or face the ban, but Trump opposes it, saying it would only boost Instagram and Facebook, which he believes treat him unfairly.</p>

<p>Trump has also expressed intentions to dismantle the CHIPS Act, replacing Biden's manufacturing subsidies with aggressive tariffs designed to force companies to build in the US.</p>

<p>Industry analyst Jack Gold cautioned against this approach, noting that "tariffs alone will not work to bring back US chip production.... Tariffs are a penalty, while the CHIPS act is an incentive."</p>

<p>A looming trade war with China also looms.</p>

<p>The share price in Apple didn't see the share price jumps seen on Wall Street more broadly after the Trump win with questions over its dependence on Chinese factories to build iPhones.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump is already working on filling key cabinet jobs as well as thousands of federal positions, with the first selections expected in the "days and weeks ahead," his transition team said Thursday.</p>

<p>Linda McMahon, a former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, and Howard Lutnick, the founder of the brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald, are leading the process.</p>

<p>"There are some people that will be returning (from Trump's first term)," senior Trump aide Jason Miller told Fox Business on Wednesday. "And they'll be some new people joining the mix."</p>

<p>AFP looks at some of the Trump allies in the running:</p>

<p><strong>Chief of staff</strong></p>

<p>Trump churned through chiefs of staff during his first term in office. The longest serving figure, former general John Kelly, even recently described his former boss as a fascist.</p>

<p>Susie Wiles, his most senior election campaign aide, is seen as a likely fit.</p>

<p>She was called on to stage by Trump during his victory speech and has been tipped as the top candidate for Oval Office gatekeeper.</p>

<p>"We call her the 'ice baby'... Susie likes to stay in the background," Trump said of the steely 67-year-old Florida native.</p>

<p><strong>Attorney General</strong></p>

<p>Given Trump's radical agenda for mass deportations of illegal immigrants and his ongoing legal problems, the person named as attorney general will hold one of the most sensitive and challenging jobs.</p>

<p>Republican Senators Mike Lee, Eric Schmitt and John Ratcliffe, Trump's former director of national intelligence, were reported by The Washington Post on Wednesday to be under consideration.</p>

<p><strong>Secretary of State</strong></p>

<p>The next top US diplomat will play a key role in implementing Trump's "America first" foreign policy, likely to see major shifts in US alliances and forcing Ukraine into negotiations with Russia.</p>

<p>Ric Grenell, an abrasive former ambassador to Germany who also served as acting director of national intelligence under Trump, is seen as a contender.</p>

<p>"If you want to avoid war, you better have a son of a bitch as the secretary of state," he said in a March episode of the "Self Centered" podcast.</p>

<p>The openly gay arch-loyalist, who sought to overturn Trump's 2020 election loss, appeared with Trump during a meeting with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in September.</p>

<p>He could also slot into the crucial National Security Advisor role, with Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a finalist to become Trump's running mate, being mentioned by many as potentially secretary of state.</p>

<p>"I always am interested in serving this country," Rubio told CNN on Wednesday.</p>

<p><strong>Defense Secretary and CIA director</strong></p>

<p>America's foreign allies will be closely following the nominations for these two vital positions.</p>

<p>Kash Patel, the son of Indian immigrants and author of a book about the so-called "deep state", has been mentioned as a future CIA chief, as has ultra-conservative Texas Senator Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, who called for troops to be used against Black Lives Matters protesters in 2020, has ruled himself out as defense secretary, Axios reported on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Former secretary of state and CIA director Mike Pompeo was namechecked by Trump at one of his final rallies on Monday.</p>

<p><strong>Treasury Secretary</strong></p>

<p>Billionaire hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, a key donor and advisor, is viewed as a top candidate to be the next treasury secretary in charge of pushing through Trump's agenda of low taxes, low regulation and high tariffs.</p>

<p>John Paulson, another billionaire hedge fund manager and advisor, is also in the running for a top economic portfolio, as is Trump transition co-chair Lutnick.</p>

<p><strong>"DOGE"</strong></p>

<p>Trump surrogate and Tesla boss Elon Musk is expected to lead a new "Department of Government Efficiency," targeting $2 trillion in cuts from the federal government's $7 trillion budget -- although no one has explained how such drastic cuts would be made.</p>

<p>The world's richest man has pledged to bring his "hardcore" management style to Washington, while promising "fair and humane" transitions for sacked federal workers.</p>

<p><strong>Others</strong></p>

<p>Robert Kennedy Jr., nephew of former president John F. Kennedy and a longtime conspiracy theorist, has been promised a "big role" by Trump after ending his own candidacy to endorse the Republican.</p>

<p>Trump has teased wide-ranging roles for RFK, including allowing the vaccine skeptic to "go wild on health."</p>

<p>It is not yet known if Trump will promote family members into roles as a aides and advisors, but first-term stalwarts Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner have stepped back from politics for family and business reasons.</p>

<p>Former Democratic Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard will be expecting a reward for lining up behind Trump, while former Fox News host and Trump confidante Tucker Carlson might also be eying a spot.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Plea agreements with 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two other defendants are valid and binding, a US military judge said in a ruling published Thursday, three months after the deals were scrapped by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.</p>

<p>The agreements -- which are understood to take the death penalty off the table -- had triggered anger among some relatives of victims of the 2001 attacks, and Austin has said that both they and the American public deserved to see the defendants stand trial.</p>

<p>Colonel Matthew McCall granted defense motions to schedule a hearing for the entry of pleas in keeping with the agreements made with the three defendants, the ruling said.</p>

<p>They are "enforceable contracts," which "transformed into binding agreements when signed by the Convening Authority, who had authority to sign them when she did so," it said, referring to the official behind the deals, Susan Escallier.</p>

<p>The prosecution has the opportunity to appeal the Wednesday ruling, but it was not immediately clear if they would do so.</p>

<p>Pentagon spokesman Major General Pat Ryder said in a statement that "we are reviewing the decision and don't have anything further at this time."</p>

<p>The plea deals with Mohammed and two alleged accomplices -- Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi -- were announced in late July.</p>

<p>The decision appeared to have moved their long-running cases toward resolution after years of being bogged down in pre-trial maneuverings while the defendants remained held at the Guantanamo Bay military base in Cuba.</p>

<p>But Austin withdrew the agreements two days after they were announced, saying the decision should be up to him, given its significance.</p>

<p>He subsequently told journalists that "the families of the victims, our service members and the American public deserve the opportunity to see military commission trials carried out in this case."</p>

<p><strong>Torture</strong></p>

<p>Much of the legal jousting surrounding the men's cases has focused on whether they could be tried fairly after having undergone torture at the hands of the CIA in the years after 9/11 -- a thorny issue that the plea agreements would have avoided.</p>

<p>"For too long, the US has repeatedly defended its use of torture and unconstitutional military tribunals at Guantanamo Bay," Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said Thursday.</p>

<p>Romero described the plea agreements as "the only practical solution" and said Austin "stepped out of bounds" by scrapping them.</p>

<p>"As a nation, we must move forward with the plea process and a sentencing hearing that is intended to give victim family members answers to their questions," he said in a statement.</p>

<p>Mohammed was regarded as one of Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden's most trusted and intelligent lieutenants before his March 2003 capture in Pakistan. He then spent three years in secret CIA prisons before arriving at Guantanamo in 2006.</p>

<p>The trained engineer -- who has said he masterminded the 9/11 attacks "from A to Z" -- was involved in a string of major plots against the United States, where he attended university.</p>

<p>Bin Attash, a Saudi of Yemeni origin, allegedly trained two of the hijackers who carried out the September 11 attacks, and his US interrogators also said he confessed to buying the explosives and recruiting members of the team that killed 17 sailors in an attack on the USS Cole in 2000.</p>

<p>After the US invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, he took refuge in neighboring Pakistan and was captured there in 2003. He was then held in a network of secret CIA prisons.</p>

<p>Hawsawi is suspected of managing the financing for the 9/11 attacks. He was arrested in Pakistan on March 1, 2003, and was also held in secret prisons before being transferred to Guantanamo in 2006.</p>

<p>The United States used Guantanamo, an isolated naval base, to hold militants captured during the "War on Terror" that followed the September 11 attacks in a bid to keep the defendants from claiming rights under US law.</p>

<p>The facility held roughly 800 prisoners at its peak, but they have since slowly been repatriated to other countries. A small fraction of that number remain.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden pledged before his election to try to shut down Guantanamo, but it remains open.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel has informed the United States that it will open an additional crossing for aid into Gaza, the State Department said Thursday, as a US-imposed deadline looms next week.</p>

<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin have given Israel until November 13 to improve the humanitarian situation in the war-besieged Gaza Strip or risk the withholding of some military assistance from the United States, Israel's biggest supporter.</p>

<p>They made the demands in a letter before Tuesday's election of President-elect Donald Trump, who has promised to give freer rein to Israel.</p>

<p>State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that Israel, after recently reopening the Erez crossing, has informed the United States that they "hope to open an additional new crossing at Kissufim" in "the next few days."</p>

<p>"We have continued to press them, and we have seen them, including in the past few days since the election, take additional steps," Miller told reporters.</p>

<p>He stopped short of saying how the United States would assess Israel's compliance with the aid demands.</p>

<p>In the letter, Blinken and Austin had urged Israel to "consistently" let aid through four major crossings and to open a fifth crossing.</p>

<p>Kissufim, near a kibbutz across from southern Gaza that was attacked in the October 7, 2023 Hamas assault that sparked the war, has mostly been in disuse except by the military since Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005.</p>

<p>The letter called for a minimum of 350 trucks per day to be allowed into Gaza. Miller said 229 trucks entered on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Outgoing President Joe Biden has repeatedly pressed Israel to improve humanitarian aid and protect civilians, while mostly stopping short of using leverage such as cutting off weapons.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since learning that Donald Trump will return to the White House, undocumented immigrant Angel Palazuelos has struggled to sleep.</p>

<p>The 22-year-old, a graduate student in biomedical engineering who lives in Phoenix, Arizona, is haunted by the incoming president's promises of mass deportations.</p>

<p>"I was terrified," said Palazuelos, reflecting on the moment he heard the news.</p>

<p>"I am in fear of being deported, of losing everything that I've worked so hard for, and, most importantly, being separated from my family."</p>

<p>Born in Mexico, he has lived in the United States since he was four years old. He is one of the country's so-called "Dreamers," a term for migrants who were brought into the country as children and never obtained US citizenship.</p>

<p>Throughout the election campaign, Palazuelos heard Trump repeatedly rail against illegal immigrants, employing violent rhetoric about those who "poison the blood" of the United States.</p>

<p>Trump has never specified how he intends to go about his plan for mass deportation, which experts warn would be extremely complicated and expensive.</p>

<p>"What do mass deportations mean? Who does that include?" Palazuelos asked.</p>

<p>"Does it include people like me, Dreamers, people that came here from a very young age, that had no say?"</p>

<p><strong>'Suspected'</strong></p>

<p>Compounding the stress, the southwestern state of Arizona has just approved by referendum a law allowing state police to arrest illegal immigrants. That power was previously reserved for federal border police.</p>

<p>If the proposition is deemed constitutional by courts, Palazuelos fears becoming the target of heightened racial profiling.</p>

<p>"What makes someone a suspect of being here illegally, whether they don't speak English?" he asked.</p>

<p>"My grandma, she's a United States citizen, however, she doesn't speak English very well. Meanwhile, I speak English, but is it because of the color of my skin that I would possibly be suspected or detained?"</p>

<p>Jose Patino, 35, also feels a sense of "dread" and "sadness." His situation feels more fragile than ever.</p>

<p>Born in Mexico and brought to the United States aged six, he now works for Aliento, a community organization helping undocumented immigrants.</p>

<p>He personally benefited from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigrant policy brought in by Barack Obama, offering protections and work permits for those in his situation.</p>

<p>But for Patino, those safeguards will expire next year, and Trump has promised to end the DACA program.</p>

<p>Indeed, Trump already tried to dismantle it during his previous term, but his decree was scuppered by a US Supreme Court decision, largely on procedural grounds.</p>

<p>Faced with this uncertainty, Patino is considering moving to a state that would refuse to report him to federal authorities, such as Colorado or California.</p>

<p><strong>'Frustrating and hurtful'</strong></p>

<p>He remembers well the struggle of being undocumented in his twenties -- a time when he could not obtain a basic job like flipping burgers in McDonald's, and could not apply for a driver's license or travel for fear of being deported.</p>

<p>"I don't personally want to go back to that kind of life," Patino said.</p>

<p>For him, Trump's electoral win is not just scary, but an insult.</p>

<p>"We're contributing to this country. So that's the hard part: me following the rules, working, paying my taxes, helping this country grow, that's not enough," he said.</p>

<p>"So it's frustrating, and it's hurtful."</p>

<p>Patino understands why so many Hispanic voters, often faced with economic difficulties, ended up voting for Trump.</p>

<p>Those who are here legally "believe that they're not going to be targeted," he said.</p>

<p>"A lot of Latinos associate wealth and success with whiteness, and they want to be part of that group and to be included, rather than be outside of it and be marginalized and be considered 'the other,'" he said.</p>

<p>Still, he is angry with his own uncles and cousins who, having once been undocumented themselves, voted for Trump.</p>

<p>"We cannot have a conversation together, because it's going to get into argument and probably into a fight," he said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One Direction star Liam Payne consumed cocaine, alcohol and a prescription antidepressant before falling to his death from a Buenos Aires hotel balcony last month, Argentine prosecutors said Thursday.</p>

<p>The prosecutor's office added that three people were charged with supplying him with drugs and one of them was also charged with abandoning a person in a vulnerable state.</p>

<p>"The results of the toxicological studies, which have been communicated to his family, revealed that, in the moments prior to his death and over a period covering at least his last 72 hours, Payne had traces of polydrug use of alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant in his body," the prosecutors said.</p>

<p>Payne was found dead on October 16 after plunging from the balcony of his third-floor room at the CasaSur Hotel in the Argentine capital.</p>

<p>An autopsy found he died after sustaining "multiple traumas" and "internal and external hemorrhaging" from the fall.</p>

<p>One of the highest-grossing live acts in the world in the 2010s, One Direction went on indefinite hiatus in 2016.</p>

<p>Payne went on to enjoy a degree of solo success but his career had languished recently.</p>

<p>His death at age 31 prompted a global outpouring of grief and condolences from family, former bandmates, fans and others.</p>

<p><strong>Three charged with drugs supply</strong></p>

<p>Prosecutors said one of the three people charged in the case had accompanied him on a daily basis during his stay in Buenos Aires and was charged with abandoning a person who later died as well as supplying him with narcotics.</p>

<p>The second suspect is a hotel employee accused of twice supplying Payne with cocaine while he was staying at the CasaSur. A third person is also accused of supplying him with the drug on October 14, two days before his death.</p>

<p>The prosecution ruled out self-harm and the "physical intervention of third parties" as the cause of Payne's death, saying that the injuries he sustained were compatible with those caused by a fall.</p>

<p>"Payne was either not fully conscious or was in a state of markedly diminished or absent consciousness at the time of the fall," the report said.</p>

<p>He was found dead after hotel staff called emergency services to report "a guest who is overwhelmed by drugs and alcohol, and destroying his room."</p>

<p><strong>Body flown home</strong></p>

<p>The toxicological report was published a day after the singer's father Geoff Payne repatriated his body to Britain aboard a flight from Buenos Aires to London.</p>

<p>Payne's death has prompted a debate about whether the music industry has a duty of care for the mental health of stars who find fame at a young age.</p>

<p>The singer from Wolverhampton in central England had spoken publicly about struggles with substance abuse and the pressures of teenage stardom.</p>

<p>He first auditioned for the hugely popular television talent show "The X Factor" at the age of 14 but was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Two years later he hit gold on the program, which teamed him up with Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik to form One Direction.</p>

<p>Over the next six years, the group enjoyed global fame and legions of screaming fans, selling more than 70 million copies of their five albums. They went on four world tours and won nearly 200 awards.</p>

<p>Payne is survived by a seven-year-old boy, Bear, with Girls Aloud star Cheryl Tweedy.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Thursday that he would not resign if asked to leave early by President-elect Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Speaking at a press conference after unveiling a quarter point interest rate cut, Powell -- whose term as Fed chair ends in 2026 -- added that firing any of the Fed's seven governors was also "not permitted under the law."</p>

<p>His comments underscore the delicate balancing act policymakers may have to play in the next Trump administration, given the US president-elect's recent criticism of the Fed.</p>

<p>On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly accused Powell -- whom he first appointed to run the US central bank -- of working to favor the Democrats, and has suggested he would look to replace him once his term as Fed Chair ends.</p>

<p>The president-elect has also said he would like "at least" a say over setting Fed interest rates, something not currently allowed under the bank's dual mandate from Congress to act independently to tackle both inflation and unemployment.</p>

<p>Fed governors are nominated by the president, and appointed by the Senate to serve a 14-year term.</p>

<p>They can also be appointed to serve out the remainder of a 14-year term if a Fed governor retires, and must then be reconfirmed.</p>

<p>If he wanted to, Powell could stay on as a governor after he steps down as Fed chair, and serve out the remainder of his term, which expires in early 2028.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 40 monkeys were on the loose Thursday in a small US town after escaping a research facility, with authorities warning residents to keep their doors and windows closed.</p>

<p>The rhesus macaques -- described as "skittish" by police in Yemassee, South Carolina -- were reported to have fled their enclosures a day earlier at a facility run by Alpha Genesis, which specializes in primate-based biomedical research.</p>

<p>Search teams were deployed to help locate the monkeys and were "working to entice them with food," the local police department said on social media.</p>

<p>"Residents are urged to keep their doors and windows securely closed and to report any sighting immediately by dialing 911. Please do not attempt to approach these animals under any circumstances," it said.</p>

<p>The police force added that all the 43 primates were young females weighing up to seven pounds (three kilograms), and that they had not been used for testing.</p>

<p>"A spokesman from Alpha Genesis can confirm that these animals are too young to carry disease," it said.</p>

<p>Greg Westergaard, CEO of Alpha Genesis, said the escape was "frustrating," telling CBS News he is "hoping for a happy ending" with the primates returning of their own volition.</p>

<p>He said that the primates were able to roam free after a caretaker failed to secure a door at an enclosure.</p>

<p>"It's really like follow-the-leader. You see one go and the others go," Westergaard said.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday he was "ready" to hold discussions with Donald Trump, as he congratulated him on his victory in the US presidential election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump indicated Thursday that they were ready to hold talks after the Republican tycoon emerged as the victor in the race for the White House.</p>

<p>"I take this opportunity to congratulate him," Putin said in remarks to the Valdai forum in the southern city of Sochi after Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in Tuesday's election.</p>

<p>Asked whether he was open to holding talks with Trump, the Russian leader said: "Ready".</p>

<p>Trump revealed he was also prepared for some kind of conversation, telling NBC News in an interview that "I think we'll speak" as the topic turned to his contacts with world leaders since his victory was announced.</p>

<p>Trump said he had spoken to "probably" 70 world leaders since Wednesday morning but revealed that he had not talked to Putin, who had claimed with a wry smile that he wanted Harris to win.</p>

<p>The endorsement was not taken at face value as Moscow has long been seen as welcoming Trump's anti-establishment credentials, and the chaos he has injected into American and global politics.</p>

<p>A new book by American investigative reporter Bob Woodward asserts that Trump and Putin may have spoken as many as seven times during Joe Biden's presidency, and that Trump while in office secretly sent the Russian leader then-scarce Covid tests.</p>

<p>Moscow was widely accused of interfering in the 2016 presidential election to boost Trump's campaign against Hilary Clinton, although the Kremlin has repeatedly rejected those charges.</p>

<p>Putin said he was impressed by how Trump handled himself during an assassination attempt at a rally earlier this year.</p>

<p>"He turned out to be a courageous person," Putin said.</p>

<p>"People show who they are in extraordinary circumstances. This is where a person reveals himself. And he showed himself, in my opinion, in a very correct manner, courageously. Like a man," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Donald Trump was set to become President of the US for the second time, a temple built by a man in a Telangana village in 2019 came into focus once again, with villagers celebrating the leader's victory by garlanding his statue.</p>

<p>Relatives of Bussa Krishna, who had installed the statue at his house in Konne village in Jangaon district and was regularly worshipping him, and some other villagers cleaned the statue and garlanded it.</p>

<p>Bussa Krishna died of cardiac arrest in October 2020 at the age of 33.</p>

<p>He had turned his puja room into a temple for Donald Trump in 2018.</p>

<p>Like an ardent devotee, he had installed the photograph of Donald&nbsp; Trump, then US President, in his room and worshipped it daily.</p>

<p>In 2019, he built a six-foot statue of Donald Trump in front of his house and conducted regular pujas and bathed it with milk. He claimed to have spent Rs 2 lakh on installing the statue.</p>

<p>Bussa Krishna, who had earned the nickname Donald Trump Krishna in his village, also pasted posters and stickers of Trump all over his house and had written graffiti praising Donald Trump on the walls.</p>

<p>When Donald Trump was tested positive for Covid-19, Bussa Krishna had released a one-minute video in which he was seen crying and praying for his speedy recovery. He had also prayed for his re-election in 2020.</p>

<p>Bussa Krishna, who was taking care of agriculture in his two-acre land in the village, had stated that he started worshipping Donald Trump after he saw him in his dream and predicted India's victory against Pakistan in the 2019 Cricket World Cup match. After India won the match, Bussa Krishna's faith strengthened in Donald&nbsp; Trump.</p>

<p>On another occasion, he cited the killing of a techie from Telangana in the US which prompted him to build a temple for Donald&nbsp;Trump.</p>

<p>Srinivas Kuchibhotla was killed by a US Navy veteran in an alleged act of hate crime in 2017.</p>

<p>Bussa Krishna believed that he could make the US president and his people understand the greatness of Indians by displaying love and affection towards them and hence started worshipping Donald Trump.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The bodies of 11 people, including two women and two minors, were found abandoned in a pickup truck in a southern Mexican city plagued by criminal violence, authorities said Thursday.</p>

<p>The state prosecutor's office said it had opened a murder investigation after the grisly discovery in Chilpancingo, whose mayor was beheaded last month less than a week after taking office.</p>

<p>The city is the capital of the southern state of Guerrero, which has endured years of bloodshed linked to turf wars between drug cartels.</p>

<p>Authorities said last week that they were investigating the disappearance of 17 people, including five minors, in the same region, but it was not immediately clear if the two cases were linked.</p>

<p>The truck containing the bodies was found on a highway to Acapulco, the former beachside playground of the rich and famous now blighted by criminal violence.</p>

<p>It comes days after gunmen killed five members of the same family in a suburb of Acapulco.</p>

<p>Spiraling violence, much of it linked to drug trafficking and gangs, has seen more than 450,000 people murdered in Mexico since 2006.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that Donald Trump and the GOP have claimed their fame to the White House, there is a chain of blame game happening that seems like a futile attempt of clutching at straws.</p>

<p>The United States is still waiting for its first female president, with Kamala Harris's loss extending the country's 248-year streak of male leadership.</p>

<p>In her concession speech, Harris urged Americans to remain hopeful and empowered, saying, "Don't ever stop trying to make the world a better place, you have power... Don't you ever listen when anyone tells you something is impossible because it has never been done before."</p>

<p>Post-election analysis points to various factors contributing to Harris's defeat. Some Democrats blame the decision to replace Joe Biden with Harris, while others criticise Biden's delayed withdrawal from the race.</p>

<p>Progressives argue that the Biden administration's stance on Israel and Harris's attempts to appeal to moderates and anti-Trump Republicans alienated key voter groups.</p>

<p>Harris' perceived closeness to the Biden administration's Israel policy, which some see as inadequate in addressing Palestinian concerns.</p>

<p>Progressive Senator Bernie Sanders suggests that the Democratic Party's neglect of working-class issues, exacerbated by inflation, cost them votes. Sanders posted this on his X account, “It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them.”</p>

<p>Harris was appointed, not elected, as the Democratic presidential candidate, potentially impacting her legitimacy. Analysts argue that Trump's stances on immigration, economy, and foreign wars, though sometimes controversial, resonated with many Americans.</p>

<p>During this time, Trump's support among Black voters increased from 8% in 2020 to 13% in 2024 and 32% in 2020 to 45% in 2024 among Hispanic voters.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris' loss in the election wasn't just about policy differences or Trump's strength as an opponent. It's about a deeper story of identity, strategy and timing.</p>

<p>It is arguable that Harris never fully embraced the historic nature of her candidacy. She has downplayed her race and gender, not leaning into the powerful symbolism of being the first black woman with a shot at this presidency. She avoided making identity a central theme hence she missed the chance to turn it into a cry for change.</p>

<p>As the country reflects on this election, it's clear that complex factors contributed to Harris's loss. The search for answers will likely continue, with many questions remaining about the future of American politics.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Like Earth and our solar system's other planets, Mars formed about 4.5 billion years ago. At the time the ocean apparently existed, it might already have begun its transition away from being a hospitable planet.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the assistance of China's Zhurong rover, scientists have gathered fresh evidence that Mars was home to an ocean billions of years ago - a far cry from the dry and desolate world it is today.</p>

<p>Scientists said on Thursday that data obtained by Zhurong, which landed in the northern lowlands of Mars in 2021, and by orbiting spacecraft indicated the presence of geological features indicative of an ancient coastline. The rover analyzed rock on the Martian surface in a location called Utopia Planitia, a large plain in the planet's northern hemisphere.</p>

<p>The researchers said data from China's Tianwen-1 Orbiter, NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and the robotic six-wheeled rover indicated the existence of a water ocean during a period when Mars might already have become cold and dry and lost much of its atmosphere.</p>

<p>They described surface features such as troughs, sediment channels, and mud volcano formations indicative of a coastline, with evidence of both shallow and deeper marine environments.</p>

<p>"We estimate the flooding of the Utopia Planitia on Mars was approximately 3.68 billion years ago. The ocean surface was likely frozen in a geologically short period," said Hong Kong Polytechnic University planetary scientist Bo Wu, lead author of the study published in the journal Scientific Reports.</p>

<p>The ocean appears to have disappeared by approximately 3.42 billion years ago, the researchers said.</p>

<p>"The water was heavily silted, forming the layering structure of the deposits," Hong Kong Polytechnic University planetary scientist and study co-author Sergey Krasilnikov added.</p>

<p>Like Earth and our solar system's other planets, Mars formed about 4.5 billion years ago. At the time the ocean apparently existed, it might already have begun its transition away from being a hospitable planet.</p>

<p>"The presence of an ancient ocean on Mars has been proposed and studied for several decades, yet significant uncertainty remains," Wu said. "These findings not only provide further evidence to support the theory of a Martian ocean but also present, for the first time, a discussion on its probable evolutionary scenario."</p>

<p>Water is seen as a key ingredient for life, and the past presence of an ocean raises the prospect that Mars at least at one time was capable of harboring microbial life.</p>

<p>"At the beginning of Mars' history, when it probably had a thick, warm atmosphere, microbial life was much more likely," Krasilnikov said.</p>

<p>The solar-powered Zhurong, named after a mythical Chinese god of fire, began its work using six scientific instruments on the Martian surface in May 2021 and went into hibernation in May 2022, likely met with excessive accumulation of sand and dust, according to its mission designer. It exceeded its original mission time span of three months.</p>

<p>Researchers have sought to better understand what happened to all the water that once was present on the Martian surface. Another study, published in August and based on seismic data obtained by NASA's robotic InSight lander, indicated that an immense reservoir of liquid water may reside deep under the surface within fractured igneous rocks.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden spoke today for the first time since the US election result was known and Donald Trump's victory was certain.</p>

<p>Addressing the nation from the White House lawns, President Biden, in his trademark blue suit and white striped tie, said "The people have voted and have chosen their President and have done so peacefully. And in a democracy, the will of the people always prevails."</p>

<p>"Yesterday, I spoke with President-elect Trump to congratulate him on his victory, and I assured him that I would direct my entire administration to work with his team to ensure a peaceful and orderly transition. That is what the American people deserve," he said.</p>

<p>He went on to say that, "Yesterday, I also spoke with Vice President Kamala Harris. She has been a partner and a public servant. She ran an inspiring campaign and everyone got to see what I had seeing early on and which I respect so much - her character. She gave her whole-hearted effort, and she and her entire team needs to be proud of the campaign they ran."</p>

<p>Speaking about the mood of the nation, the US President said, "I know for some people, this is a time for victory and celebration, while for others it may be a time of loss and despair. Campaigns are a contest of competing visions The country chooses one or the other. And we all must accept the choice that the country made."</p>

<p>Reaching out to fellow Americans, the President had a piece of advice - "I have said this many times - that you cannot love your country only when you win. You can't love your neighbour only when you agree,"</p>

<p>The President went on to make a request to all Americans. "There's something I hope you all can do, no matter who you voted for... to see each other not as adversaries, but as fellow Americans. Bring down the temperature."</p>

<p>Speaking further to the American people, President Biden had words of advice for Donald Trump, though he did not name him directly. He said, "I hope that we can later lay to rest the question about the integrity of the American electoral system. It is honest, it is fair, it is transparent, and it can be trusted - whether we win or lose. I also hope we can restore the respect for all our election workers, who have busted their necks and took risks at the outset. We should thank them."</p>

<p>Assuring the nation of a peaceful transition of power at the White House, President Biden said, "The people have done their duty as citizens. Now I will do my duty as President. I will fulfill my oath and honour the Constitution. On January 20, 2025, we will have a peaceful transfer of power in America."</p>

<p>"To all our incredible staff, supporters, cabinet members... to all the people who have been hanging out with me for the last 40 years, God knows I love you. Thank you so very much. You have put in so much over the past 4 years. I understand that this is a difficult time, you're hurting... I hear you and I see you. But don't forget all of what we have achieved and accomplished. This has been a historic presidency. Not because I was President, but because of all that you all have done. This has been a presidency for all Americans," President Biden said concluding his speech.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Vatican's secretary of state congratulated US president-elect Donald Trump Thursday, while expressing doubt that the Republican had a "magic wand" to end conflicts quickly as promised during the campaign.</p>

<p>"We wish him a lot of wisdom because that is the main virtue of leaders according to the Bible," Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin told reporters on the sidelines of a conference in Rome.</p>

<p>Asked about Trump's promise to end the war in Ukraine "within 24 hours", Parolin replied: "Let's hope, let's hope. I believe that not even he has a magic wand."</p>

<p>"To end wars, a lot of humility is needed, a lot of willingness is needed, it really is necessary to seek the general interests of humanity rather than concentrate on particular interests," he said.</p>

<p>To overcome divisions in American society, Parolin said he hoped Trump would be "the president of the whole country".</p>

<p>He also hoped he would be "a factor that reduces tension... in the current conflicts that are bloodying the world."</p>

<p>Parolin's comments were the first diplomatic reaction from the Holy See to Trump's win for the White House against Democrat Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Pope Francis has not reacted.</p>

<p>In September, the Argentine pope criticised both candidates, accusing them of being "against life" in different ways: for Harris' support of abortion, and for Trump's anti-migrant policies.</p>

<p>During his first term in the White House, in May 2017, Trump was received by the Pope at the Vatican for a half-hour meeting.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The rare 1975 No S Proof Dime set a new auction record, selling for $506,250 at GreatCollections, with bidders from around the world vying for the coin.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A remarkable US coin, the '1975 No S Proof Dime', has set a new auction record, selling for $506,250&nbsp;(Rs 4,26,74,091) last night, according to GreatCollections auction house. The coin, known for its rarity, was released in error without the "S" mint mark, making it one of the most sought-after modern US coin rarities.</p>

<p>After being in private possession for over half a century, the 1975 dime was verified by the Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS) and assigned the grade Proof-67. Additionally, the Certified Acceptance Corporation (CAC) approved it, according to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.greatcollections.com/kb/1975-No-S-Proof-Dime-Realizes-506250-at-GreatCollections-t652-4.html">news release.</a></p>

<p>According to Scott Schechter and Jeff Garrett's The 100 Greatest US Modern Coins, numismatic experts regularly rank the 1975 No S Proof Dime as the best modern US coin.</p>

<p>The coin was consigned to GreatCollections just two months ago after being acquired for $18,200 in 1978 by an Ohio collector and his mother from the famous Chicago dealer FJ Vollmer &amp; Co. The coin's status as a highly sought-after numismatic treasure has been cemented by the remarkable auction price, which represents over 30 times the amount paid for it 46 years ago.</p>

<p>"We received interest in this modern rarity from all over the world-serious collectors from Germany, Japan, and the UK, as well as collectors from the US-over 400 unique bidders were actively tracking the auction," GreatCollections President Ian Russell <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.greatcollections.com/kb/1975-No-S-Proof-Dime-Realizes-506250-at-GreatCollections-t652-4.html">said in a news release.</a></p>

<p>The dime is notable for its missing "S" mint mark, which would signify it was minted in San Francisco. It is only one of two examples known to still exist.</p>

<p>"This is the Grail of modern coins, one that is missing from the Smithsonian, ANS, and ANA institutional collections. After spirited bidding, it was ultimately won by a long-time client of ours who appreciates rarities that infrequently appear on the market. His goal is for his family to own it for the next 46 years, similar to the seller's family who consigned it to GreatCollections," Russell said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday rejected offering the Kremlin any concessions in Ukraine, saying such moves would be detrimental to his country and Europe more broadly.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday said it would be "unacceptable" for Europe to offer the Kremlin concessions to halt its invasion of Ukraine, after Moscow demanded the West enter direct talks on ending the war.</p>

<p>Kyiv is scrambling to up the pressure on its allies for more support in its fight against Moscow following Donald Trump's victory in this week's US presidential election.</p>

<p>Trump has boasted he could end the conflict within hours and repeatedly criticised American aid to Kyiv.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded Ukraine cede swathes more territory in its east and south as a precondition to peace talks, while Kyiv has repeatedly ruled out giving up land in exchange for peace.</p>

<p>Ukraine and many in the West fear any settlement that rewards Putin would only embolden the Kremlin leader and lead to more aggression.</p>

<p>Speaking to European leaders at a summit in Hungary, Zelensky blasted those who were pressuring him to give in to some of Putin's hardline demands.</p>

<p>"There has been much talk about the need to yield to Putin, to back down, to make some concessions," Zelensky said, according to a copy of the address provided to AFP by the Ukrainian presidency.</p>

<p>"It's unacceptable for Ukraine and unacceptable for all Europe," he added.</p>

<p>He also accused some European leaders, without specifying which ones, of "strongly" pushing Ukraine to compromise.</p>

<p>"We need sufficient weapons, not support in talks. Hugs with Putin won't help. Some of you have been hugging him for 20 years, and things are only getting worse," Zelensky said.</p>

<h3><strong>'Choice'</strong></h3>

<p>The comments came as Russian strikes on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, including on a hospital and residential buildings, killed at least four people.</p>

<p>Another 18, including at least two children, were wounded, Ukraine's emergency services said.</p>

<p>"There may still be people under the rubble," the agency said in a post on Telegram.</p>

<p>The industrial hub, which Russia has attacked more in recent days, had a pre-war population of more than 700,000 people and lies around 35 kilometres (22 miles) from the nearest Russian positions.</p>

<p>Footage published by officials showed emergency workers pulling victims from the debris, as they held back locals from trying to get to the remnants of one building, reduced to a pile of rubble.</p>

<p>Hours before the strikes, Russia demanded that Kyiv's allies enter into negotiations with Moscow if they want to halt the brutish attacks on Ukrainians.</p>

<p>The head of Russia's Security Council Sergei Shoigu said the West faced a choice between opening direct talks with Moscow or the continuing "destruction" of Ukraine's population.</p>

<p>"Now, when the situation in the theatre of combat is not in Kyiv's favour, the West is faced with a choice," Shoigu said at a meeting with defence officials of other former Soviet states.</p>

<p>"To continue financing (Kyiv) and the destruction of the Ukrainian population or recognise the current realities and start negotiating," the former defence minister said.</p>

<p>They were among the first comments from a Russian official since Trump was confirmed to have been elected president of the United States.</p>

<h3><strong>Russian advances</strong></h3>

<p>Zelensky has previously said that without US aid, Ukraine would lose the war.</p>

<p>His outmanned and outgunned army is already on the back foot in the eastern Donbas region, where Russian forces have been slowly advancing for months.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moscow on Thursday said its forces had wrested control of Kreminna Balka, a village that had a pre-war population of fewer than 50 people in the industrial Donetsk region where Ukrainian defences have been pushed back again and again.</p>

<p>Ukrainian media reported that Donetsk region authorities were preparing to announce mandatory evacuations from seven more villages in a region that the Kremlin claimed in 2022 was part of Russia.</p>

<p>Two were killed in shelling there on Thursday, the local governor reported.</p>

<p>Russia had overnight launched 106 drones at Ukraine, the air force said, adding that 74 were shot down over 11 regions.</p>

<p>Two people were killed in the overnight aerial attacks in the frontline Kherson and Sumy regions, the local governors reported.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In various states, Democratic Senate candidates outperformed Kamala Harris, despite her loss in the presidential election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In various states, Democratic Senate candidates outperformed Kamala Harris, despite her loss in the presidential election.</p>

<p>Notably, Dan Osborn in Nebraska and Jon Tester in Montana had vote shares 7 points higher than Harris's, but still lost their respective races. In Arizona, Ruben Gallego's vote share was 4 points higher than Harris's and is currently leading. Colin Allred in Texas secured a 3-point higher vote share than Harris but failed to unseat Ted Cruz. Other notable performances include Jacky Rosen in Nevada, with a 2-point higher vote share, though the race remains too close to call, and Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, who won with a vote share less than 1 point higher than Harris's. Additionally, Elissa Slotkin in Michigan and Bob Casey in Pennsylvania had vote shares about 1 point higher than Harris' as of Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>According to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383197/kamala-harris-results-underperformed-democratic-senate-candidates" rel="No follow, no index">Vox</a>, these results suggest that voters are distinguishing between the presidential contest and statewide races, with some Democratic Senate candidates performing better than expected.</p>

<p>This distinction raises questions about the nature of the backlash against Democrats. Was it targeted at Harris specifically or reflective of a broader anti-Democratic sentiment?</p>

<p>In U.S. politics, it's common for candidates to hope that a popular presidential nominee will bring success to statewide races. This trickle-down effect can give their party a boost in other contests.</p>

<p>However, the phenomenon of ticket-splitting can sometimes ruin these plans. Ticket-splitting occurs when voters cast ballots for candidates from opposing parties in the same election.</p>

<p>Despite being rare in today's hyper-partisan climate, ticket-splitting still happens. Interestingly, even with a Republican White House victory, some state Democrats are managing to come out on top. This suggests that voters are making deliberate choices, rather than blindly voting along party lines.</p>

<p>In 2012, six states split their tickets in eight races. For example, Montana and Missouri elected Democrats to the governor's office and the Senate but voted for Republican Mitt Romney for president.</p>

<p>In 2016, five states split their tickets, voting for either a Republican governor or a Democratic governor alongside their presidential choice and only three states exhibited split-ticket voting in 2020.</p>

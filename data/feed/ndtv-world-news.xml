       <description><![CDATA[During their six-year relationship, Zhang portrayed himself as an obstetrician-gynaecologist at a prestigious Shanghai hospital.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">A man in China was convicted of fraud for swindling 2.6 million yuan (about Rs 3 crore) from his girlfriend by pretending to be a doctor at a prestigious hospital.&nbsp;Zhang, originally employed at a hotel, received an 11-year, six-month prison sentence and a 250,000 yuan (Rs 29,22,396) fine for his actions.</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">The court made the details of the case public in May without specifying the exact dates of the incidents. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3265279/chinese-man-poses-doctor-dupes-girlfriend-out-us360000-pair-often-meet-hospital-grounds">South China Morning Post,</a></em> Zhang initiated the deception in 2016 after meeting his girlfriend Huang, who was employed at a shopping mall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During their six-year relationship, Zhang portrayed himself as an obstetrician-gynaecologist at a prestigious Shanghai hospital. He also claimed that he had graduated from a renowned medical school in China. He crafted a compelling image of a "successful professional," and Huang never questioned his narrative. They started dating three months after their initial meeting.</p>

<p>However, one potential warning sign was Zhang's habit of postponing Huang's requests to visit him at the hospital attributing it to a hectic schedule filled with clinical checkups or surgeries. As their relationship deepened, they frequently met for dates on the hospital lawn.</p>

<p>By November 2016, however, Zhang developed a gambling addiction and accrued significant debts. He started taking money from Huang in the name of home investment and spent it on gambling and paying off his debts.&nbsp;During their relationship, Huang transferred more than 2.6 million yuan to Zhang.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Huang's family grew concerned as Zhang began avoiding repayment of the money. Eventually, Huang, frustrated with the situation, verified Zhang's employment with the hospital, only to find out that he was not employed there.</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">During the trial, the prosecutor said: ''While love is beautiful, one must also be wary of sweet traps''.</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">Many social media users sympathised with Huang after details of the case went viral on social media. One user wrote, ''She was too blinded by love.''</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Britain will hold a parliamentary election on July 4 which opinion polls indicate will hand power to Keir Starmer's Labour Party and end 14 years of Conservative Party-led government.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain will hold a parliamentary election on July 4 which opinion polls indicate will hand power to Keir Starmer's Labour Party and end 14 years of Conservative Party-led government.</p>

<p><strong>HOW IS THE WINNER DECIDED?</strong></p>

<p>To win outright, one party needs to win at least 326 out of the 650 parliamentary seats. The leader of that party becomes prime minister.</p>

<p>In each of the 650 constituencies, voters elect a local candidate who is usually affiliated with a larger political party. Voters choose one candidate and the candidate with the most votes wins the seat.</p>

<p>A hung parliament occurs if no single party wins a majority. In this case the incumbent prime minister remains in power and is given the first chance to form a government either by building a coalition or governing with a minority.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT IS A SUPERMAJORITY?</strong></p>

<p>During the Conservative Party's campaign, it warned that Labour could win a 'supermajority' that would embolden it to make more radical reforms than those set out in its manifesto.</p>

<p>In some democracies, a supermajority is a legally defined threshold, higher than a simple majority, required to make major changes such as to a constitution.</p>

<p>In Britain, however, there is no definition of a supermajority that gives governments any special powers and the term has no clear meaning in its political lexicon.</p>

<p><strong>WHEN WILL THE RESULTS BE ANNOUNCED?</strong></p>

<p>An exit poll is released by broadcasters immediately after voting ends at 10 p.m. (2100 GMT).</p>

<p>Vote counting begins immediately and first results come within hours. Most are declared overnight and the outcome is usually clear between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m.</p>

<p><strong>WHEN WILL THE NEW PRIME MINISTER TAKE OFFICE?</strong></p>

<p>Once the overall result is clear, and if the governing party has lost, the prime minister would be expected to tender his resignation to the king on Friday.</p>

<p>The leader of the winning party will then meet the king, who will request he or she form a government. They will then head to Downing Street to make a speech to the British public as the new prime minister.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT HAPPENS ONCE A NEW PRIME MINISTER IS IN PLACE?</strong></p>

<p>The new prime minister will begin appointing ministers, starting with senior positions.</p>

<p>Parliament is scheduled to return on July 9. The Speaker of the House of Commons - parliament's lower chamber - will be elected from among members of parliament (MPs).</p>

<p>Each MP will then in turn swear the oath of allegiance to the king or make a solemn affirmation. This usually takes a few days.</p>

<p>The State Opening of Parliament and King's Speech, setting out a government's programme of legislation for the parliamentary session, is due to take place on July 17, although this date could be changed by a new government.</p>

<p><strong>WHO CAN VOTE AND HOW?</strong></p>

<p>Voters must be aged 18 or over on polling day, and be either a British citizen, Irish citizen or qualifying Commonwealth citizen.</p>

<p>Close to 50 million people are registered to vote. Polling stations open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. (0600-2100 GMT). Votes can be cast in person, by post, or through a proxy.</p>

<p>Voters must take photo I.D. with them to vote, the first national election at which that has been required.</p>

<p>Overseas British citizens will also get to vote regardless of how long they have been living outside the country.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Stop Labour's "supermajority" is the final message UK PM Rishi Sunak is trying to drive home on Wednesday, the final day of campaigning ahead of polling day on Thursday]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stop Labour's "supermajority" is the final message British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is trying to drive home on Wednesday, the final day of campaigning ahead of polling day on Thursday, as most of the incumbent Conservatives seem to have all but conceded defeat in the general election.</p>

<p>"This is what unites us. We need to stop the Labour supermajority that will put up your taxes. The only way to do that is to vote Conservative tomorrow," said 44-year-old Rishi Sunak on social media, as he focused on drumming up support in the last few hours of the campaign trail.</p>

<p>With his party trailing far behind the Keir Starmer-led Labour Party, the British Indian leader and his team's strategy seems to be to canvas their traditional voters to ensure a strong enough turnout in the polls on Thursday and narrow the gap of their widely expected defeat after Tory victories in the last three elections.</p>

<p>"I totally accept where the polls are at the moment means that tomorrow is likely to see the largest Labour landslide majority - the largest majority that this country has ever seen. Much bigger than 1997," Rishi Sunak's Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride told the BBC.</p>

<p>"I have accepted that where the polls are at the moment... that we are therefore tomorrow highly likely to be in a situation where [Labour has] the largest majority that any party has ever achieved," he said, effectively conceding his party's defeat.</p>

<p>It is being seen as a fear tactic to jolt Tory voters into action, with the hope of keeping the Labour majority under that won by former prime minister Tony Blair led Labour Party in 1997 of 179 seats.</p>

<p>"Thursday's vote is now all about forming a strong enough Opposition. One needs to read the writing on the wall: it's over, and we need to prepare for the reality and frustration of the Opposition," Suella Braverman, sacked as home secretary by Rishi Sunak, told 'The Telegraph'.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, former prime minister Boris Johnson - not exactly a close ally of Rishi Sunak ever since the partygate scandal of COVID pandemic law-breaking parties - was also rolled out by the party at a campaign event in London to warn against a "sledgehammer majority" being handed to the Keir Starmer led Labour Party.</p>

<p>"When Rishi asked me to come and help, of course I couldn't say no. We're all here because we love our country," Boris Johnson told a cheering Tory crowd.</p>

<p>"They can achieve nothing in this election except to usher in the most left-wing Labour government since the war with a huge majority, and we must not let it happen," he warned.</p>

<p>The Labour Party, meanwhile, is keen to override this message of victory as a foregone conclusion a day before the polls to fight against any complacency within the ranks and among its own voter base.</p>

<p>"People are saying the polls predict the future - they don't predict the future, every single vote counts, every single vote has to be earned... It isn't 'job done'," said Keir Starmer.</p>

<p>Polling experts have forecast a low turnout, which stood at 67 per cent in the last general election in December 2019 when Boris Johnson won a solid majority on his "get Brexit done" message.</p>

<p>On Thursday, polling booths will open across the country at 7am local time and close at 10pm local time as voters elect their MPs for the UK Parliament's 650 constituencies - with 326 required for a majority and to avert a hung Parliament.</p>

<p>All eyes will then be on the election night exit poll at 10pm, which gives a fair snapshot of what can be expected nationally as the counting commences and centres up and down the UK. If opinion polls are to be believed, the incumbent Tories are in line to win anywhere between 53 and 150 seats, with Labour projected to win a landslide.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The main opposition Labour party is widely predicted to win and has been determined not to take any risks, making for a lacklustre election campaign.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are some key issues at stake in the UK general election on Thursday:</p>

<p><strong>- Will jaded voters turn out? -</strong></p>

<p>The main opposition Labour party is widely predicted to win and has been determined not to take any risks, making for a lacklustre election campaign.</p>

<p>For the past two years, polling has suggested that Labour is 20 points ahead of the Conservatives, and no amount of campaigning has managed to shift the dial.</p>

<p>But if that indicates a desire for change after 14 years of Tory government, there does not appear to be much enthusiasm for Labour's plans.</p>

<p>Indeed, Labour has repeatedly warned that it does not have a "magic wand" to change the country overnight.</p>

<p>The apathy extends to both leaders, with 72 percent having an unfavourable opinion of Tory leader Rishi Sunak and 51 percent of Labour's Keir Starmer, according to a YouGov poll this month.</p>

<p>That has prompted questions about whether voters will turn out in large numbers spurred on by the promise of change or remain at home jaded by years of chaos and no great love for party leaders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Labour figures have made no secret of their concerns surrounding voter apathy, with dozens of seats closely contested and up for grabs.</p>

<p>Turnout (67.3 percent in 2019) will provide an indicator of voters' distrust of their political class, and a challenge for the next government.</p>

<p><strong>- Lucky number eight for Farage? -</strong></p>

<p>An unexpected addition to the campaign, Nigel Farage -- the Brexit figurehead who has now become the spokesperson of hard-right, anti-immigration views -- entered the race as the leader of Reform UK.</p>

<p>Despite a surge in the polls, the UK's first-past-the-post system makes outright victory for the 60-year-old former European parliamentarian and his party unlikely.</p>

<p>If he succeeds at his eighth attempt to get a seat in parliament as the MP for Clacton-on-Sea in east England, Farage -- a Donald Trump ally -- will have even more visibility.</p>

<p>If he fails, his startup Reform UK party, currently polling around 19 percent, would still play a decisive role in the race between the Tories and Labour in several constituencies.</p>

<p><strong>- Tory wipeout? -</strong></p>

<p>Several polls suggest the party of Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher and Boris Johnson will win fewer seats than the 141 it secured in 1906, in what would be the worst result since its creation in 1834.</p>

<p>Speculation has already started about who would succeed Rishi Sunak to lead the fragmented party.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It remains to be seen how many big names will save their seats and what direction the party, which was centrist under David Cameron (2010-2015) and then drifted to the right, can take.</p>

<p>In the event of Reform's success, some Tories would not object to an alliance.</p>

<p><strong>- Weakened Scottish nationalists? -</strong></p>

<p>Nothing seems to be going right for the Scottish National Party (SNP), which has dominated the devolved nation's politics for the last 15 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The surprise resignation of charismatic first minister Nicola Sturgeon in 2023 destabilised the party. Her successor Humza Yousaf only lasted a year.</p>

<p>The left-wing party is still the target of a probe into its finances in which Sturgeon's husband was implicated and does not have a viable strategy to deliver independence, a fight that was revived by Brexit but blocked by London.</p>

<p>First Minister John Swinney insists that winning in a majority of Scotland's 59 UK parliamentary constituencies would be a green light for him to launch fresh negotiations on another referendum with the new government in London.</p>

<p>The SNP currently holds 43 seats. But Labour looks set to use its national momentum to reassert its dominance in Scotland. July 4 promises to be the first electoral test for the pro-independent movement's difficulties.</p>

<p><strong>- Return of the Lib Dems? -</strong></p>

<p>Ed Davey has run an offbeat campaign, gliding down a waterslide, falling off a paddleboard, roasting marshmallows, building sandcastles, bungee jumping and even Zumba dancing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His stunts and policies alike have set out to carve a niche for his Liberal Democrat party while Sunak and Starmer duel, Farage returns and Labour moves back to the centre ground.</p>

<p>The Lib Dems' rise to around 12 percent in polls and their strong presence in southern England could win them up to 67 seats, according to one YouGov poll, up from 11 in 2019.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Such a victory would be comparable to the party's breakthrough in 2010, when it governed with the Conservatives, and would give strength to its pro-European and climate-centred policies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 20-year-old Indiana man has been charged with strangling his mother to death after she asked him to clean his room and find a full-time job. Connor Kobold, a student at the United States Merchant Marine Academy, called 911 five times on February 5, reporting a dead person in his home in Valparaiso, as per court documents, according to Fox News.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When police arrived, Kobold surrendered himself, asking to be handcuffed and placed in the squad car. He allegedly confessed to the crime, stating, "There is a dead person inside of the house on the corner" and "I killed somebody in that house," reported WGNTV.<br />
<br />
Officers also noticed superficial scratches on his face.<br />
<br />
When police entered the house, they found his mother, Shanelle Burns, 43, unconscious with “no pulse” and “severe injuries”, including ligature marks on her neck.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Ms Burns, an assistant vice president in advancement at Loyola University in Chicago, was hospitalised but died two days later.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
According to court documents, she died of "asphyxiation” and her death was ruled a homicide by “manual strangulation”. Doctors reported the woman had suffered significant brain damage before her death.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The 20-year-old has now been charged with her murder. He has pleaded not guilty and is being held without bond at Porter County Jail, with a court appearance scheduled for next month.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Earlier, during a February hearing, Kobold, who has a history of mental health issues, told a judge that he had been admitted to two facilities and had seen at least five therapists. He attempted to represent himself in court, stating that only he could explain the circumstances surrounding the incident; no one else could. However, a public defender was appointed to represent him despite his efforts to self-represent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to an analysis by the British Future think tank, the Labour Party is set to have by far the largest number of ethnic minority MPs if the party wins an overall majority and even more in a landslide scenario.</p>

<p>With around 14 per cent of MPs coming from an ethnic minority background this time, the analysis finds that the new Parliament will be closer than ever to reflecting the diversity of the British electorate.</p>

<p>"This election will see the biggest rise in ethnic minority representation and the most diverse Parliament ever," said Sunder Katwala, Director of British Future.</p>

<p>"In the space of 40 years, we'll have gone from zero to one in seven MPs being from an ethnic minority background. Britain is closing the gap between the diversity of Parliament and the electorate much faster than anyone thought possible," he said.</p>

<p>The last general election in 2019 resulted in 15 MPs of Indian heritage crossing over the line, many of whom are contesting again alongside several first-timers.</p>

<p>Conservative Party MP Alok Sharma and Labour veteran Virendra Sharma are among the most high-profile British Indians not seeking re-election this time, from Reading West and Ealing Southall, respectively.</p>

<p>The latter constituency, with a large Punjabi electorate, has two British Sikh candidates contesting as Independents - Sangeet Kaur Bhail and Jaginder Singh.</p>

<p>Some of the key British Indian candidates to watch in Thursday's polls include Praful Nargund, who is contesting for the Labour Party in Islington North – the seat of the party's now-suspended former leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is contesting as an Independent candidate.</p>

<p>Jas Athwal is contesting in another Labour stronghold of Iford South, while Baggy Shanker in Derby South, Satvir Kaur in Southampton Test, and Harpreet Uppal in Huddersfield are contesting more marginal seats for the party.</p>

<p>Rajesh Agrawal, the Indore-born former Deputy Mayor of London for Business, is fighting to become a first-time MP from Leicester East and is up against a fellow British Indian Conservative candidate, Shivani Raja.</p>

<p>This constituency, representing a large Indian heritage electorate, will be keenly watched as its former long-term Goan-origin MP, Keith Vaz, is also in the race as an Independent candidate.</p>

<p>British-Indian Sikhs, including solicitor Warinder Juss from Wolverhampton West in central England and Gurinder Singh Josan from Smethwick, will be hoping to make gains for Labour, as will Bihar-born Kanishka Narayan contesting in Vale of Glamorgan - hoping to be elected as the first Indian-origin MP from Wales, and Sonia Kumar hoping to overturn a Tory majority in Dudley.</p>

<p>For the Conservative Party, Chandra Kanneganti in Stoke-on-Trent Central and Ameet Jogia in Hendon are facing a tough fight in a race consistently forecast in favour of the Opposition Labour Party.</p>

<p>"A diverse parliament brings different perspectives to its work, which can lead to more effective policy-making. MPs who come from different backgrounds can be role models for their communities, inspiring young people to vote and get involved in politics," says Jill Rutter, British Future Associate Fellow who led the think tank's analysis.</p>

<p>Of the sitting MPs, the British Indians most vulnerable to a Labour swing in the election include Tory MPs Shailesh Vara from North West Cambridgeshire, Gagan Mohindra from South West Hertfordshire and Claire Coutinho from East Surrey.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is expected to hold on to his seat of Richmond and Northallerton in northern England, as are former Cabinet colleagues Priti Patel in Witham in Essex and Suella Braverman in Fareham and Waterlooville.</p>

<p>With a series of retirements and exits, largely from the incumbent Tories, the new Parliament elected on Friday will see around 158 new MPs in the House of Commons.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After finishing a half-marathon, a fit and healthy social media professional and marathoner received a cancer diagnosis. He has now disclosed the three significant warning signs he missed, according to <em>News.com.au.</em></p>

<p>Bondi-based 38-year-old Govind Sandhu, who oversees Global Music Partnerships at TikTok Australia, was diagnosed with stage four non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in early May after experiencing severe complications after the Sydney Half Marathon, as per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/tiktok-australias-head-of-global-music-partnerships-shared-shock-cancer-diagnosis/news-story/a45621c5f117280142af21ef9a685c96">news outlet.</a></p>

<p>The 38-year-old runner took to Instagram to share his story and the warning signs that led to his eventual examination.</p>

<p>"The day after that I just went downhill (with a) swollen knee, although I thought that was because my knee was injured from a stack when I was in Hobart running some trails," he said in an emotional Instagram video posted on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"(I had) really bad body aches and sweat, and everything that would make you think it was the flu, or Covid. And after a four week period I just deteriorated."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan's top court ruled on Wednesday that a defunct eugenics law under which thousands of people were forcibly sterilised between 1948 and 1996 was unconstitutional, local media reported.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court also ruled that a 20-year statute of limitations on compensation claims could not be applied, a major victory for victims who have endured decades of suffering.</p>

<p>Japan's government acknowledges that around 16,500 people were forcibly sterilised under the eugenics law that was in place between 1948 and 1996.</p>

<p>The law allowed doctors to sterilise people with inheritable intellectual disabilities to "prevent the generation of poor quality descendants".</p>

<p>Another 8,500 people were sterilised with their consent, according to authorities, although lawyers say even those cases were likely "de facto forced" because of the pressure individuals faced.</p>

<p>A 1953 government notice said physical restraint, anaesthesia, and even "deception" could be used for the operations.</p>

<p>"I've spent an agonising 66 years because of the government surgery. I want my life back that I was robbed of," victim Saburo Kita, who uses a pseudonym, said before Wednesday's ruling.</p>

<p>Kita was convinced to undergo a vasectomy when he was 14 at a facility housing troubled children. He only confided what had happened to his wife shortly before she died in 2013.</p>

<p>"Only when the government faces up to what it did and takes responsibility will I be able to accept my life, even just a little," Kita, now 81, told a news conference last year.</p>

<h3><strong>Apology&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The number of operations in Japan slowed to a trickle in the 1980s and 1990s before the law was scrapped in 1996.</p>

<p>That dark history was thrust back under the spotlight in 2018 when a woman in her 60s sued the government over a procedure she had undergone at age 15, opening the floodgates for similar lawsuits.</p>

<p>The government, for its part, "wholeheartedly" apologised after legislation was passed in 2019 stipulating a lump-sum payment of 3.2 million yen (around $20,000 today) per victim.</p>

<p>However, survivors say that was too little to match the severity of their suffering and took their fight to court.</p>

<p>Regional courts have mostly agreed in recent years that the eugenics law constituted a violation of Japan's constitution.</p>

<p>However, judges have been divided on whether claims are valid beyond the 20-year statute of limitations.</p>

<p>Some have said that applying such limitations was extremely cruel and unfair, ordering the state to pay damages. But others dismissed cases, saying the window for pursuing damages had closed.</p>

<p>"The ruling will hopefully pave the way for active steps to be taken by the government to eliminate the kind of eugenic mentality that it created," Kita's lawyer, Naoto Sekiya, told AFP before Wednesday's ruling.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman was found dead inside the belly of a snake after it swallowed her whole in central Indonesia, police said Wednesday, the second python killing in the province in a month.</p>

<p>Siriati, 36, had gone missing after she left her house Tuesday morning to buy medicine for her sick child, police said, prompting relatives to launch a search.</p>

<p>Her husband Adiansa, 30, found her slippers and pants on the ground about 500 metres (yards) from their house in Siteba village, South Sulawesi province.</p>

<p>"Shortly after that, he spotted a snake, about 10 metres from the path. The snake was still alive," local police chief Idul, who like many Indonesians has one name, told AFP.</p>

<p>Village secretary Iyang told AFP that Adiansa became suspicious after he noticed the python's "very large" belly. He called the villagers to help cut open its stomach, where they found her body.</p>

<p>Such incidents are considered extremely rare, but several people have been swallowed by pythons in recent years.</p>

<p>A woman was found dead last month inside the belly of a reticulated python in another district of South Sulawesi.</p>

<p>Last year residents in the province killed an eight-metre python, which was found strangling and eating one of the farmers in a village.</p>

<p>A 54-year-old woman was found dead in 2018 inside a seven-metre python in Southeast Sulawesi's Muna town.</p>

<p>The year before, a farmer in West Sulawesi went missing before being found being swallowed by a four-metre python at a palm oil plantation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The US economy faces recession risks with potential for a 30% stock market drop, according to BCA Research.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Great Recession of 2008-2009 left its scars unhealed, and the Covid-19 economic downturn dealt the US one more blow. Concerns regarding the instability of the financial markets are now resurfacing. BCA Research, a Canadian investment research organisation, predicts volatility in the US stock market going forward.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/stocks-could-fall-30-us-heads-painful-recession-analyst-warns"><em>Fox Business</em></a>, in a note to clients last week, BCA Research chief global strategist Peter Berezin warned that, contrary to popular belief, the economy will fall into a recession either this year or in early 2025. Should that happen, the S&amp;P 500 could tumble to 3,750, which marks a 30% drop from current levels.</p>

<p>Berezin's prediction hinges on the belief that the labour market will slow notably in the coming months, which will weigh heavily on consumer spending, a major driver of economic growth. The relationship between inflation and unemployment is measured by something called the "Phillips curve."</p>

<p>"The reason the U.S. avoided a recession in 2022 and 2023 was because the economy was operating along the steep side of the Phillips curve," he wrote. "When the labour supply curve is nearly vertical, weaker labour demand will mainly lead to lower wage growth and falling job openings. In other words, an immaculate disinflation."</p>

<p>Berezin also predicts broad economic challenges, including notable slowdowns in growth in China and Europe. This could contribute to the weakening of the global economy and increase pressure on international stock markets.</p>

<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average broke through 40,000 for the first time in mid-May, setting a new record high. It has now dropped from those peaks, though.</p>

<p>This prediction, which might rank among the most pessimistic on Wall Street, comes after a turbulent year for the market.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When either Rishi Sunak or Keir Starmer take to the stage to hail victory in the British election on Friday, they will be joined at their moment of triumph by either a man with a trash can on his head or someone dressed as "Elmo" from the Muppets.</p>

<p>Among the more than 4,500 candidates standing for election to parliament's 650 seats are those from fringe parties, single-issue campaigners, and, in a peculiarly British tradition, those who are simply making fun of the whole thing.</p>

<p>The best-known figure in the latter category is Count Binface, "an intergalactic space warrior, leader of the Recyclons from planet sigma IX", who will be challenging Prime Minister Sunak in his constituency in northern England.</p>

<p>Dressed in a silver outfit with a matching cape and wearing a silver trash can as a helmet, Binface says he wants to make the July 4 election "Bindependence Day" and that he is the "sane" choice for the electorate.</p>

<p>"That's right, under the British system I get to stand against Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, it's brilliant," Binface, aka comedian Jonathan Harvey, told Reuters outside parliament where he was mobbed by passers-by asking to have their photograph taken with him.</p>

<p>Binface is now a familiar face - or helmet - at British elections, having stood against two ex-prime ministers, Theresa May in 2017 - albeit then in his former guise as Lord Buckethead - and Boris Johnson in 2019. He also contested the London mayor elections in 2021 and in May this year when he won 24,000 votes.</p>

<p>Among his eye-catching policies are pledges to price-cap croissants at 1.10 pounds ($1.39), national service for all former prime ministers and that he should represent the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest.</p>

<p>"It might be true that on Thursday night or Friday morning, I haven't beaten Rishi Sunak numerically," said Binface, who has been endorsed by one national newspaper, the irreverent Daily Star tabloid. "But I would argue the moral victory will be mine."</p>

<h3><strong>LOONIES</strong></h3>

<p>The veterans of the UK comedy candidate genre belong to the Official Monster Raving Loony Party which was formed in 1982 and has regularly contested elections ever since.</p>

<p>This year it is fielding 22 candidates, including Howling 'Laud' Hope, the party leader, Baron Von Thunderclap, and Earl Elvis of East Anglia.</p>

<p>Elsewhere "AI Steve" is hoping to become the world's first artificial intelligence lawmaker, while the Psychedelic Movement Party candidate in Southend is standing on pledges to ignore the law and open 24-hour cannabis cafes.</p>

<p>Some candidates make no secret of using the election for publicity such as Chris French who is standing having entered his pub "The Mitre" in Richmond, west London, as a political party.</p>

<p>Polls say Labour leader Starmer will be Britain's next leader. "Elmo" from the Muppets will be competing for his seat.</p>

<p>Like Count Binface, Elmo has stood in numerous elections although Bobby Smith, the man in the furry red outfit, is seeking to make an earnest political point and wants to change the law on fathers' rights.</p>

<p>Binface himself had a serious message behind the jokes, saying it was important to protect democracy in a year when "over half the eligible humans on your planet" would go to the polls.</p>

<p>"I'm here to cherish it, to defend it, to celebrate the fact that anyone in the UK can not just vote but you all stand for election whatever your platform or however idiotic you look," he said. "I urge everyone ... do go out to vote, and most importantly, make your vote, count."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Voting for the first time in a British election, Prathesh Paulraj and other immigrant voters are excited to take part in the July 4 ballot, hoping they can influence change in the country that they have chosen to call home.</p>

<p>The opposition Labour Party is widely expected to win by a landslide, replacing Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservative Party which has been in power for 14 years.</p>

<p>Refugees and immigrants from Commonwealth countries, mainly former territories of the British Empire such as Nigeria, India, and Malaysia, are eligible to vote in British elections.</p>

<p>Paulraj, 27, who came to Britain in February last year, said he was excited to cast his vote after missing the election in his native India.</p>

<p>"In my country, they don't allow people from other countries to vote ... I came here on a student visa, but they are giving us an opportunity, like British citizens," said Panjak who works part-time as an ambassador at his university in Manchester, northwest England.</p>

<p>Teh Wen Sun, a 33-year-old Malaysian student from Salford, not far from Manchester, said she did not see much difference between the two main parties, but she was keen to vote for a party that is more receptive to immigrants.</p>

<p>Immigration is an electoral battleground in Britain, with Sunak promising to cut net migration levels if the Conservatives win, amid concern from many British voters that it was too high and put excessive pressure on the state-run National Health Service, housing and education.</p>

<p>Sunak has since tightened visa rules and made international headlines for a policy to send asylum seekers to Rwanda.</p>

<p>Oyinkansola Dirisu, 31, a support worker from Manchester who came to Britain in 2022, said she was looking forward to voting for Labour, and said she wanted whoever won power to make it easier for people like her to move to Britain.</p>

<p>Others, like Esther Offem, 26, who came from Nigeria last September, are still undecided: "None (of the parties) have done much in the areas that I'm most interested in. But at the moment, I would probably go for the Conservatives ... I'm not sure yet."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trapped in a Catholic mission sheltering dozens of women and children from the war raging on the streets of Khartoum, Father Jacob Thelekkadan punched new holes in his belt as the supplies of food dwindled and he grew thinner.</p>

<p>Around 80 people are taking refuge inside the Dar Mariam mission, a Catholic church and school compound in Khartoum's al-Shajara district, caught in the crossfire between Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), according to accounts by the priest and seven other people at the mission.</p>

<p>The roof of the main building has been damaged by shells, and parts of the nuns' quarters have been set ablaze. Holes caused by stray bullets mark the mission's walls.</p>

<p>As food has grown scarce, the nuns have boiled tree leaves for the children to eat and many of the adults have skipped meals.</p>

<p>A Red Cross effort to rescue them in December ended with two dead and seven others wounded, including three of the charity's staff, after gunmen opened fire on the convoy, forcing it to turn back before it could reach the mission. The warring sides traded blame for the attack.</p>

<p>Thelekkadan said he and the nuns had refused offers from the army to ferry them out across the river permanently, leaving the families behind.</p>

<p>"When the road is safe, we will be the first to leave, but with the people," said Thelekkadan, a 69-year-old Indian national.</p>

<p>Many of the inhabitants of Sudan's capital fled after the conflict erupted in April last year, enveloping Khartoum and its sister cities of Bahri and Omdurman along the Nile, and quickly spreading to other parts of the country.</p>

<p>At the start of the war, the RSF occupied strategic sites and residential neighbourhoods in Khartoum, positioning snipers on high-rise buildings. The army, lacking effective ground forces, responded with heavy artillery and air strikes.</p>

<p>The Dar Mariam mission became a safe haven for those lacking the money to flee or without anywhere to go.</p>

<p>Photos shared with Reuters by Thelekkadan show parts of the mission's buildings littered with debris, walls heavily damaged by bullets or shelling, and rooms and corridors blackened by smoke.</p>

<p>"Our food situation became very bad," said Thelekkadan. "We're all very weak."</p>

<p>Extreme hunger has spread across Sudan in areas worst affected by the conflict, prompting famine warnings for areas including Khartoum.</p>

<h3><strong>10 MILLION DISPLACED</strong></h3>

<p>Some families took shelter at the mission in June last year, hoping for protection from its concrete roof. But the area soon became cut off as the RSF pressed to capture the strategic Armoured Corps camp about 2 km away, one of several military bases it was targeting, Thelekkadan said.</p>

<p>Al-Shajara district has come under heavy attack by the RSF. Those living nearby with the money to do so have registered with the military to be taken across the Nile; some have been waiting for months.</p>

<p>But a nighttime evacuation by boat across the White Nile is considered too risky for the children at the mission, Thelekkadan said.</p>

<p>Sudan's war has created the world's biggest internal displacement crisis and has driven nearly 10 million people to seek shelter inside or outside the country, according to the International Organization for Migration.</p>

<p>Reuters has documented how the fighting has triggered ethnically-charged killings in the western region of Darfur and led to the spread of deadly hunger.</p>

<p>The war has also caused unprecedented destruction in the capital, which was sheltered from modern Sudan's previous conflicts. Both warring factions have impeded the delivery of humanitarian relief, aid workers say, leaving civilians dependent on charity provided by groups of neighbourhood volunteers, among others.</p>

<p>An RSF media official said the paramilitary had tried to allow for the evacuation of the families by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), but the army had thwarted the effort and was using them as human shields.</p>

<p>An army spokesman said the families had been trapped by the war, and that troops from the Armoured Corps had done their duty by protecting and helping them, in line with army practice in other conflict-hit areas.</p>

<p>Numbers have fluctuated, but since March about 30 women along with 50 children aged 2-15 have stayed at the mission, according to Thelekkadan. His account was confirmed by two of the nuns, an administrator and four women sheltering at the mission, two other priests who have kept in touch with Dar Mariam, and an army intelligence officer responsible for churches in Khartoum.</p>

<p>Those staying at the mission are mostly Christian refugees from South Sudan and Ethiopia, who set up tents made from plastic sheeting around the compound's buildings, which include a church, a school and a residence.</p>

<p>When fighting starts nearby, they take cover inside the residence. Some poor Sudanese Muslim families have also sought temporary shelter at the mission.</p>

<h3><strong>WAITING FOR EVACUATION</strong></h3>

<p>The bombardments in November shredded an image of the Virgin Mary at the compound's entrance, ripped through the second floor of the main building, and set the roof on fire. Several people were lightly injured.</p>

<p>RSF snipers had the entrance to Dar Mariam in their sights. A boy from the neighbourhood was killed when mortar shrapnel sliced into his head after he had helped carve out an exit at the back of the compound to avoid sniper fire, Thelekkadan said.</p>

<p>The mission's residents had been trying to survive "a lot of shooting and bombing," sister Miriam, one of the nuns, told Reuters in a video call.</p>

<p>"We got used to it and we are not afraid. God is protecting us, but we are waiting for evacuation," she said.</p>

<p>Thelekkadan and the nuns turned their most secure room into a shelter to try to protect the children from the crossfire. They attempted to distract the children from the violence raging around them, creating a space to use bicycles in the yard and encouraging them to play video games.</p>

<p>"We tried not to make them feel like they are in a prison," Thelekkadan said.</p>

<p>In early January, the mission was caught in the crossfire again and rooms in the nuns' residence were set ablaze.</p>

<p>Food has been a challenge. By September, cash was running low, and collecting supplies from local markets became nearly impossible due to clashes.</p>

<p>The children have often received meagre servings of porridge, lentils and beans. But stocks dwindled.</p>

<p>Since February, troops stationed at the Armoured Corps camp have delivered some airdropped provisions to Dar Mariam, including sugar and fuel for generators used to draw water from wells, Thelekkadan said.</p>

<p>The army also provided a Starlink connection, allowing those at the mission to use their phones again. They flew the priest and an administrator twice to Port Sudan, a Red Sea city to which army and government offices have relocated, to meet church officials and collect some cash and supplies.</p>

<p>Sister Celestine, another of the nuns, said she is still gripped by fear each time bombardments shake the area.</p>

<p>"I would like to be out of here," she said. "I want to get out and write a book about everything that happened."</p>

<p>The fighting has shown little sign of abating.</p>

<p>"These past four days have become very trying for all of us in Dar Mariam and people around as explosions, bombings, gunfire etc have become more intense and frequent!" Thelekkadan said in a message on June 19. "Please do continue to pray for us."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican nominee Donald Trump is immune from prosecution for actions taken within his constitutional powers while in office, ruled the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) on Monday.<br />
<br />
The decision delays the criminal case against the former US President, who was indicted on charges related to his alleged involvement in attempting to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss and inciting the US Capitol riots on January 6, 2021.<br />
<br />
<strong>Context&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
In August 2023, federal prosecutors charged Donald Trump with four felonies related to his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results. The indictment accused Trump of spreading false claims of widespread fraud and attempting to block the election certification on January 6, 2021.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Trump has consistently challenged the prosecution, calling it unfair and politically motivated. He has sought to delay the trial until after the 2024 presidential election and argued that presidents are immune from criminal liability for their actions in office.<br />
<br />
After two lower courts rejected Trump's claim of presidential immunity, he appealed to the Supreme Court. The high court's ruling on Trump's immunity claim has significant implications for the case and potentially sets a precedent for future presidential accountability.<br />
<br />
<strong>What the ruling says</strong><br />
<br />
The Supreme Court has ruled in Trump v United States that a president is immune from criminal prosecution for actions taken within their official capacity, but not for personal actions. This means that a president cannot be prosecuted for performing their official duties, such as issuing pardons or signing bills, but can still be held accountable for personal actions unrelated to their official duties.<br />
<br />
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion that "the President therefore may not be prosecuted for exercising his core constitutional powers, and he is entitled, at a minimum, to a presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts."&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The court's three liberal justices disagreed with the decision, arguing that making a president immune from prosecution makes them "a king above the law." Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that the ruling sends a message that a president can "violate the law, exploit the trappings of his office for personal gain, use his official power for evil ends" without fear of accountability.<br />
<br />
<strong>Official vs unofficial acts</strong><br />
<br />
The SCOTUS defines a President's actions as either official or unofficial. Official actions are those that use the President's core powers, such as issuing pardons or signing bills. These actions are fully protected and immune from prosecution. Other official actions are those that are related to the President's official duties, but may not be directly tied to core constitutional powers. These actions fall within the "outer perimeter of official responsibility" and have presumed immunity.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, unofficial actions include personal business dealings or criminal activities. These actions have no immunity and can be prosecuted.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The Court examines the President's role and relationship to determine the category an action fits into, which is important in determining the limits of presidential immunity.<br />
<br />
<strong>What the immunity means for Trump's criminal cases</strong><br />
<br />
The Counsel will have to wait for the lower district court to determine which of Trump's actions are considered official or unofficial, a process that will take time. This means that the likelihood of the case going to trial before the November elections is slim.<br />
<br />
The ruling also has broader implications for the presidency and future cases. According to Steve Vladeck, an expert in constitutional law, the decision "tilts even more power toward the office of the presidency, whether the president is a Democrat or a Republican." This means that the presidency will have more immunity and power, making it harder for Congress, the courts and the people to hold presidents accountable for wrongdoing.<br />
<br />
Impeachment becomes the only option for accountability, a process that is already weak and may not be effective in a president's second term. Mr Vladeck noted that the ruling essentially gives the presidency a "get-out-of-jail-free" pass, which makes it harder to investigate and prosecute presidents for wrongdoing, setting a dangerous precedent for future cases.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Predictions of the world's end have been made for centuries, from floods to fires to comets. But none have come true.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember the hysteria surrounding December 21, 2012? The world was supposedly ending, and many believed it. This belief was based on a misinterpretation of the Mayan calendar, which some thought hinted at an impending global catastrophe on the said date. However, December 21, 2012, arrived, and nothing happened. The world continued to spin and life went on as usual.</p>

<p>Predictions of the world's end have been made for centuries, from floods to fires to comets. But none have come true.</p>

<p>Here is a list of some of the major failed doomsday predictions:</p>

<h3><strong>Maya Apocalypse</strong></h3>

<p>On December 21, 2012, the Maya Long Count calendar completed its first cycle. Despite the calendar's continuous time tracking, many misinterpreted this event as a harbinger of doom. Fanciful predictions emerged, including a collision with a fictional planet, solar flares, and axis realignment. Some even built arks and sold survival kits. But the predicted apocalypse never came.</p>

<h3><strong>Harold Camping</strong></h3>

<p>Harold Camping has made a dozen apocalyptic predictions based on his biblical numerology interpretations. In 1992, he wrote "1994?", forecasting the world's end around that year. His most significant prediction was May 21, 2011, calculated as 7,000 years after the Biblical flood. When nothing happened, he recalculated and pushed the doomsday date to October 21, 2011, when, again, nothing happened.</p>

<h3><strong>True Way</strong></h3>

<p>Leader of the True Way movement, Hon-Ming Chen predicted God would appear on TV in 1988, followed by his physical manifestation. In 1989, he foretold massive flooding, devil spirits and even human extinction and said his followers could escape by buying spots on "cloud" spaceships. His bizarre prophecies ultimately proved false.</p>

<h3><strong>Halley's Comet</strong></h3>

<p>In 1910, as Halley's Comet approached Earth, fears of destruction and poisonous gases spread globally. Media headlines like "Comet May Kill All Earth Life, Says Scientist" fueled the panic. Some believed the comet's tail would wipe out all humanity. A group in Oklahoma attempted to sacrifice a virgin to appease the comet, while others stockpiled bottled air. Ultimately, the Earth passed through the comet's tail with no apparent effects.</p>

<h3><strong>Millerism</strong></h3>

<p>William Miller's apocalyptic preaching attracted many followers who believed Jesus would come for the second time in 1843. When the prediction failed, William Miller recalculated, setting a new date for 1844. His devoted followers anxiously waited, only to face crushing disappointment.</p>

<h3><strong>Joanna Southcott</strong></h3>

<p>Joanna Southcott began hearing voices at 42, predicting future events like crop failures and famines. In 1813, she proclaimed she would give birth to the second messiah at 65, despite being a virgin. Her followers eagerly awaited the arrival, however, Joanna Southcott died before the predicted birth could happen.</p>

<h3><strong>Prophet Hen</strong></h3>

<p>In 1806, a hen in Leeds, England, seemed to lay eggs with "Christ is coming" written on them. People flocked to see the hen, fearing Judgment Day. But it was a trick - the owner had been writing on the eggs with ink and reinserting them into the hen's body.</p>

<h3><strong>Great Fire Of London</strong></h3>

<p>In 1666, many Europeans feared the end of the world, linking the year to the "number of the Beast" (666). The Great Fire of London, which razed much of the city, seemed to confirm these fears. The blaze destroyed 87 churches and 13,000 houses, but surprisingly, only 10 people died.</p>

<h3><strong>Global Flood</strong></h3>

<p>In 1524, German mathematician and astrologer Johannes Stoffler predicted a global flood on February 25, saying the planets had aligned under Pisces. But despite light rain, the flood never came.</p>

<h3><strong>Montanism</strong></h3>

<p>In the 2nd century, Montanus' visions led to a Christian split. He predicted Jesus would return and convinced many to leave their homes and wait for Jesus in Phrygia (modern Turkey). They expected the heavenly Jerusalem to descend, but the deity failed to materialise. The movement caused disruption, with many Christian communities left almost deserted.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Activists have continued to agitate online against President William Ruto, despite his decision last week to withdraw a controversial bill that triggered what he has branded "treasonous" protests by Gen-Z Kenyans.</p>

<p>The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) on Monday said that 39 people had been killed and 361 injured during two weeks of protests -- with the worst violence occurring in Nairobi last Tuesday -- and condemned the use of force against demonstrators as "excessive and disproportionate".</p>

<p>It is the most serious crisis to confront Ruto since he took office in September 2022 in a nation often considered a beacon of stability in a turbulent region.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After last week's bloody chaos, young Kenyans, whose protest movement has no official leaders, called for a new day of peaceful action on Tuesday, with leaflets posted online using the hashtag "RutoMustGo".</p>

<p>But Nairobi's central business district -- the focus of previous rallies -- saw sporadic confrontations on Tuesday afternoon. Police fired tear gas and used water cannon against groups of stone-throwing men, some of whom lit bonfires on deserted roads.</p>

<p>"Goons have infiltrated," prominent Gen-Z protester Hanifa Adan posted on X.</p>

<p>AFP journalists reported seeing a number of arrests and injuries, although there are no official figures.</p>

<p>Several coffins, some covered with the national flag, were placed on roads by protesters, images on Kenyan television showed, before they were removed by officers.</p>

<p>Local politician John Kwenya told AFP that business owners shuttering their shops were "scared" of the "goons".</p>

<p>"This is economic sabotage," said Kwenya, a member of the Nairobi city county assembly.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the country, local television broadcast images of larger marches in the coastal opposition stronghold of Mombasa, where a number of cars were torched, and Kenyan media shared video of at least one shop being vandalised.</p>

<p>Interior Minister Kithure Kindiki denounced what he described as an "orgy of violence", warning that the government would take action against anyone engaging in "anarchic chaos and cruel plunder".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This reign of terror against the people of Kenya and the impunity of dangerous criminal gangs must end at whatever cost," he said.</p>

<p>On Tuesday last week, largely peaceful anti-tax rallies descended into deadly chaos when lawmakers passed the finance bill -- a deeply unpopular move among Kenyans already suffering from a cost of living crisis.</p>

<p>After the announcement of the vote, crowds ransacked the partly ablaze parliament complex in central Nairobi as police fired live bullets at protesters.</p>

<p>Although Ruto scrapped the legislation and appealed for dialogue with young Kenyans, his actions appear not to have appeased his critics.</p>

<p>In a television interview on Sunday he defended his decision to call in the military to tackle unrest and insisted he did not have "blood on my hands".&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Rift Valley town of Nakuru on Tuesday, protesters marched peacefully, with some carrying pictures of three people killed in last week's demonstrations.</p>

<p>"We want justice for innocent Kenyans killed by police during the protests that were peaceful," Mary Lynn Wangui told AFP.</p>

<p>"Ruto has not offered an apology," said the 24-year-old, as she waved a placard declaring: "RutoMustGo".</p>

<p>At a peaceful march in the lakeside city of Kisumu in western Kenya, demonstrator Allan Odhiambo, 26, told AFP he had lost hope in Ruto.</p>

<p>"We promised a peaceful protest and that is what we have done, but Ruto must go," he said.</p>

<p>The state-funded KNCHR on Monday said that in the previous protests there had been 32 cases of "enforced or involuntary disappearances" and 627 arrests of protesters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kenya's cash-strapped government said previously that the tax increases were necessary to fill its coffers and service a huge public debt of some 10 trillion shillings ($78 billion), or about 70 percent of GDP.</p>

<p>In Sunday's interview, Ruto warned that the government would have to borrow another $7.7 billion because of the decision to drop the finance bill.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden's support for Israel during its nearly nine-month war in Gaza has spurred at least nine U.S. administration officials to quit, with some accusing the US president of turning a blind eye to Israeli atrocities in the Palestinian enclave.</p>

<p>The Biden administration denies this, pointing to its criticism of civilian casualties in Gaza and its efforts to boost humanitarian aid to the enclave, where health officials say nearly 38,000 have been killed in Israel's assault.</p>

<p>Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages, according to Israeli figures.</p>

<h3><strong>Here are the US officials who have resigned:</strong></h3>

<p>Maryam Hassanein, who was a special assistant at the Department of Interior, quit her job on Tuesday. She slammed Biden's foreign policy, describing it as "genocide-enabling" and dehumanizing Arabs and Muslims.</p>

<p>Stacy Gilbert, who served in the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, left in late May. She said she resigned over an administration report to Congress that she said falsely stated Israel was not blocking humanitarian aid to Gaza.</p>

<p>Alexander Smith, a contractor for USAID, quit in late May, alleging censorship after the U.S. foreign aid agency canceled publication of his presentation on maternal and child mortality among Palestinians. The agency said it had not gone through proper review and approval.</p>

<p>In May, Lily Greenberg Call became the first Jewish political appointee to resign, having served as a special assistant to the chief of staff in the Interior Department. &nbsp;"As a Jew, I cannot endorse the Gaza catastrophe," she wrote in the Guardian.</p>

<p>Hala Rharrit, an Arabic language spokesperson for the State Department, departed her post in April in opposition to the United States' Gaza policy, she wrote on her LinkedIn page.</p>

<p>Annelle Sheline resigned from the State Department's human rights bureau in late March, writing in a CNN article that she was unable to serve a government that "enables such atrocities."</p>

<p>Tariq Habash, a Palestinian American, quit as special assistant in the Education Department's office of planning in January. He said the Biden administration was turning a "blind eye" to atrocities in Gaza.</p>

<p>Harrison Mann, a U.S. Army major and Defense Intelligence Agency official, resigned in November over Gaza policy and went public with his reasons in May.</p>

<p>Josh Paul, director of the State Department's bureau of political military affairs, left in October in the first publicly known resignation, citing what he described as Washington's "blind support" for Israel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Britain's election campaign enters its final stretch, the work of opinion pollsters is back in the spotlight with several recent projections of a record victory for the opposition Labour Party grabbing the headlines.</p>

<p>Labour's ample 20-point opinion poll lead has hardly budged since Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced the July 4 election last month, shifting the focus to the question of how big Keir Starmer's win will be rather than whether it will happen.</p>

<p>But Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system means the number of seats each party wins does not closely reflect the national share of votes they receive, so pollsters use so-called MRP modelling in a bid to more accurately estimate the result.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT IS MRP?</strong></h3>

<p>MRP stands for Multilevel Regression and Post-stratification and it is used by pollsters to estimate public opinion at a local level from large national samples. Pollsters describe it as a model that uses polling data, rather than a poll itself.</p>

<h3><strong>HOW DOES IT WORK?</strong></h3>

<p>Pollsters construct a statistical model which summarises how voting intention differs depending on the characteristics of survey respondents and where they live. This will take into account factors such as age, income, educational background and past voting behaviour.</p>

<p>This model is then used to produce estimates of the voting intentions among different types of people living in different areas of the country.</p>

<p>Pollsters combine that with official data on the numbers of people of each type living in each area to generate an estimate of overall voting intention for the constituency.</p>

<p>The exact model used to predict voter behaviour varies from pollster to pollster.</p>

<h3><strong>HOW DOES IT DIFFER FROM OTHER POLLING METHODS?</strong></h3>

<p>Conventional polling methods often apply a uniform national swing to predict how many seats a party will win.</p>

<p>This assumes there will be the same change in vote share for each party throughout the country, which is rarely the case, meaning it can overestimate the performance of a party in some areas and underestimate it in others.</p>

<p>MRP sample size is also much higher. Typical political polls rely on between 1,000 and 2,000 responses, while MRP modelling uses data from tens of thousands of voters.</p>

<h3><strong>HAVE THEY BEEN RIGHT IN THE PAST?</strong></h3>

<p>MRP is a relatively new technique.</p>

<p>After polling companies miscalled an election in 2015 and underestimated support for Brexit in the 2016 referendum, many looked to use more sophisticated data analysis to come up with seat-by-seat results.</p>

<p>MRP was used by YouGov in 2017 to accurately predict Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May would fall short of an overall majority. YouGov said its model called 93% of seats correctly that year.</p>

<p>The method had some success in 2019, with YouGov's MRP predicting a clear majority for the Conservatives although underestimating the scale of it.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT ARE THE LIMITATIONS?</strong></h3>

<p>British voters have become more unpredictable, with Brexit scrambling traditional political allegiances.</p>

<p>More voters switched between the two main parties in a 2017 election than in any ballot dating back to 1966, according to research by the British Election Study. The more people change their minds, the harder it is to draw a representative sample.</p>

<p>"MRP only works when there is a strong link between, on the one hand, the characteristics of individuals and areas and, on the other, the opinion being modelled," the British Polling Council says on their website.</p>

<p>Pollsters describe MRP as an estimate of the range of possible results.</p>

<p>Savanta's MRP published on June 19 projected Labour could win a whopping 516 seats in the 650-strong House of Commons, with the Conservatives on 53. But it also noted nearly 200 seats had less than 7.5 percentage points between the parties in first and second place, deeming them as 'too close to call' and meaning the end result could be very different.</p>

<p>YouGov's MRP published on the same day gave Labour 425 seats and the Conservatives 108, but classified 109 constituencies as "tossups" with fewer than five points between the parties in first and second place.</p>

<p>There may also be specific issues at play in individual seats which MRP modelling is unable to capture.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

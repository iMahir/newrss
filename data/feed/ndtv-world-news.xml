       <description><![CDATA[Using a simple breath test to measure methane, patients with intestinal methanogen overgrowth (IMO) may benefit from antibiotics and specialized diets, offering hope beyond conventional laxatives.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Constipation is more common in those whose guts contain larger concentrations of archaea, a kind of methane-producing microbe, according to a study published in the journal <em>Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology. </em>This finding may result in more focused therapies for this prevalent gastrointestinal problem. After analysing data from more than 1,500 people, researchers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre discovered that people with intestinal methanogen overgrowth (IMO) were more likely to have symptoms like bloating, stomach pain, and trouble passing gas.</p>

<p>"<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565(24)00716-X/abstract">Our study</a> found that patients with IMO are more likely to have constipation, particularly severe constipation, and less likely to have unyielding diarrhoea," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/gut-microorganism-may-play-a-role-in-constipation/">said the study's corresponding author,</a> Ali Rezaie, MD, medical director of the Cedars-Sinai GI Motility Program and director of Bioinformatics at the Medically Associated Science and Technology (MAST) program at Cedars-Sinai. "Patients, however, also reported several other gut-related symptoms, including bloating, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and flatulence."</p>

<p>As per a release by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/gut-microorganism-may-play-a-role-in-constipation/"><em>Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre,</em></a> constipation is one of the most common gut-related issues in the United States. About 16% of adults experience bloating, abdominal pain, and difficulty having bowel movements; the numbers nearly double for people over 60. While many things, like medication side effects or lack of dietary fibre, can cause constipation, historically, there has been a shortage of research on the gut microbiome's role in constipation and other digestive issues.</p>

<p>A simple breath test can be used to diagnose IMO. Patients with excessive methane levels in their breath may benefit from a combination of antibiotics and a specialised diet to suppress the growth of archaea in the gut.</p>

<p>"When there is an excessive amount of archaea in your gut, they produce more methane, and some of that methane makes its way to your bloodstream, then to your lungs, and you breathe it out, where it can be measured as a diagnostic test," Rezaie said. "Essentially, people who have excessive amounts of methane have a lot of GI symptoms, including constipation, flatulence, bloating, and diarrhoea."</p>

<p>This research offers hope for people struggling with constipation and paves the way for research exploring the connection between the gut microbiome and digestive health.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 14-year-old boy arrested following the fatal assault on 80-year-old Bhim Kohli while he was out walking his dog in a park near the eastern England city of Leicester appeared in court on Thursday charged with his murder.</p>

<p>The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons as he is a minor, appeared at Leicester Youth Court sitting at Leicester Magistrates' Court. He was among five children aged between 12 and 14 years to be arrested following the death of Mr Kohli in hospital on Monday night by Leicestershire Police, with the other four released earlier with no further action.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kohli's family released a statement via the police to say they were heartbroken and struggling to cope with the loss of a loving and caring person.</p>

<p>"Bhim was a loving husband, dad and granddad. He was also a son, brother and uncle. He adored his grandkids with all his heart and loved spending time with them. He really was such a loving, caring person whose life was centred around his family," the statement said.</p>

<p>"He has always been a very hardworking man and even at the age of 80 he was still very active. One of his great passions was his allotment, he would go everyday to tend to his plots and was so proud of them. He also enjoyed walking the family dog Rocky in the park many times a day," the statement said.</p>

<p>The family shared how Kohli "loved to laugh" and was always very happy and talkative, the "joker of the family" who always loved to outsmart us with a smile.</p>

<p>"Our family has lived in the same house in Braunstone for 40 years, so he was very well known in the community - we have been overwhelmed by the messages and support from many who knew him. Our hearts have been completely broken. We are now pulling together as a family to try and support each other through the most difficult time imaginable and would ask for privacy while we do this," the statement concludes.</p>

<p>A post-mortem examination carried out following the attack at Franklin Park in Braunstone Town on Sunday evening confirmed the cause of death as a neck injury, while further tests will be carried out.</p>

<p>"The circumstances surrounding Mr Kohli's death are extremely tragic and upsetting not only for his family and friends but also the wider community," Detective Inspector Emma Matts, Senior Investigating Officer at Leicestershire Police, said earlier this week.</p>

<p>"We continue to offer support to the family through our family liaison officers and the local policing teams are in the area to provide reassurance and discuss any issues or concerns," she added.</p>

<p>Now that a suspect has been charged in the case, further details will be restricted to prevent any interventions that may prejudice a murder trial.</p>

<p>Earlier, Leicestershire Police had admitted "prior police contact with the victim", which initially led to a voluntary referral to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) before being escalated to a mandatory referral after further contact with the watchdog.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French President Emmanuel Macron appointed Michel Barnier, the European Union's former Brexit negotiator, as his new prime minister on Thursday, after weeks of drawn out talks following an inconclusive snap election.</p>

<p>Michel Barnier, aged 73, led the EU's talks with Britain over its exit from the bloc from 2016-2021. Prior to that, the conservative politician held roles in various French governments and was also EU Commissioner.</p>

<p>Macron had considered a string of potential prime ministers in recent weeks, none of which mustered enough support to guarantee a stable government, and there is no guarantee Barnier's government will manage to get reforms adopted by a hung parliament.</p>

<p>But at least the far-right National Rally (RN), whose party is one of the biggest in parliament after the early July election, signalled earlier on Thursday it would not immediately reject Barnier, if he met certain conditions.</p>

<p>Barnier is a staunch pro-European and a moderate career politician, but he toughened his discourse considerably during his failed 2021 bid to get his conservative party's ticket for the presidential election, saying immigration was out of control - a view shared by the RN.</p>

<p>Macron's gamble to call the snap parliamentary election in June backfired, with his centrist coalition losing dozens of seats and no party winning an absolute majority.</p>

<p>The left's New Popular Front alliance came first but Macron ruled out asking them to form a government after other parties said they would immediately vote it down.</p>

<p>Instead, he waited weeks to make his choice.</p>

<p>Even if the political paralysis were to continue despite the appointment of a new government, Macron could not call a new snap election until July next year.</p>

<p>RN lawmaker Sebastien Chenu told BFM TV that the far-right party would wait to see what Barnier has to say on immigration, and on changing France's voting system.</p>

<p>Lawmaker Laurent Jacobelli, also from the RN, said a condition was that parliament be dissolved as soon as possible - which would be early July.</p>

<p>"The RN wants a prime minister who is committed to dissolving as soon as possible and establishing proportional representation (for parliamentary elections)," Jacobelli told TF1.</p>

<p>Still, the RN was not particularly enthusiastic about Barnier.</p>

<p>"They are taking out of mothballs those who have governed France for 40 years," Jacobelli said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple went on trial on Thursday accused of locking their 10-year-old foster daughter in an electrified cage and throwing her downstairs, in a harrowing case that has shocked the Netherlands.</p>

<p>The girl was taken to hospital in May, unconscious, in a filthy state, with several broken bones and badly malnourished, reportedly weighing just 22 kilogrammes (50 pounds).</p>

<p>She emerged from her coma in July but is unable to sit up independently or communicate, prosecutors said as the trial opened in Rotterdam.</p>

<p>They said she would probably need intensive medical care for the rest of her life.</p>

<p>The couple, named only as Daisy and John, both 37, stand charged of attempted manslaughter for throwing or pushing her down the stairs, among other charges.</p>

<p>They held their foster daughter captive in the house and abused her for months, prosecutors alleged.</p>

<p>"They locked her in her room, handcuffed her arms and legs and covered her mouth with tape. They placed her in a homemade cage with electrical wires attached to it," the public prosecutor told the court.</p>

<p>Neither suspect was present in court to hear the accusations.</p>

<p>A lawyer for the couple said they denied pushing her down the stairs, arguing that she jumped down the stairs herself.</p>

<p>The case of the "Foster Girl From Vlaardingen", the harbour town just outside Rotterdam where she lived, has been headline news in the Netherlands, with question over how authorities could have missed the alleged abuse.</p>

<p>Dutch media said the girl had reported the alleged abuse several times.</p>

<p>She was forcibly removed from her biological parents after suffering abuse at their hands.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Today marks the anniversary of the 1972 Munich massacre, where eight members of Black September took 11 Israeli athletes hostage at the Olympics. Two were killed initially, and a failed rescue led to the deaths of all hostages, a German officer.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>After the horrific 1972 Munich Olympics massacre that shook the whole world, Israel implemented a program of sending covert agents abroad to kill enemies, an approach that is still active today.</li>
	<li>The national intelligence agency of Israel Mossad launched Operation "Wrath of God" to hunt down Black September members, targeting the group's leadership with covert assassinations overseas.</li>
	<li>Ehud Barak, former Israeli prime minister, who at the time served as a commando leading an elite military unit, recalls the Munich massacre as a shock that ignited public outrage and a drive for revenge.</li>
	<li>Under Prime Minister Golda Meir, Israel devised a strategy to "smash the head of the serpent" by targeting Black September's leadership in Europe and the Middle East.</li>
	<li>In 1973, Israeli operatives, disguised as women, assassinated three senior Palestinian leaders in Beirut in a daring mission involving speedboats and military deception.</li>
	<li>Ehud Barak himself, disguised as a woman during the Beirut mission, led the team that killed Mohammed Youssef al-Najjar, Kamal Adwan, and Kamal Nasser.</li>
	<li>Mossad's overconfidence led to a failure in Norway, where agents mistakenly killed a Moroccan waiter, Ahmed Bouchikhi, instead of Black September leader Ali Hassan Salameh.</li>
	<li>After years of tracking Salameh, Mossad finally assassinated him in 1979 in Beirut, using a car bomb, after infiltrating his social circle.</li>
	<li>Israel continued targeted assassinations against its enemies, including Palestinian militants during the Intifada, and later expanded operations to Iranian targets.</li>
	<li>Mossad's assassination of Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh highlights the ongoing "shadow war" with Iran, aimed at preventing its nuclear capability development.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday named India among the three countries he is constantly in touch with over the Ukraine conflict and said they are sincerely making efforts to resolve it, state-owned TASS news agency reported.</p>

<p>Reporting on his remarks at the plenary session of the Eastern Economic Forum (EEF) in Vladivostok, US media outlet Politico reported him as also saying, "If there is a desire of Ukraine to carry on with the negotiations, I can do that." Putin's remarks came within two weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's historic visit to Ukraine where he held talks with President President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>

<p>"We respect our friends and partners, who, I believe, sincerely seek to resolve all issues surrounding this conflict, primarily China, Brazil and India. I constantly keep in touch with our colleagues on this issue," Putin was quoted as saying by the Russian news agency.</p>

<p>Separately, Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the Izvestia daily that India could help in establishing a dialogue on Ukraine.</p>

<p>Underlining the existing "highly constructive, even friendly relations" between PM Modi and Putin, he said the Indian Prime Minister can "lead the line on getting first-hand information from the participants in this conflict," as he "freely communicates with Putin, with Zelenskyy, and with the Americans." "This gives a great opportunity for India to throw its weight in world affairs, to use its influence that would drive the Americans and Ukrainians towards using a greater political will and entering the peaceful settlement track," Peskov said.</p>

<p>He, however, said there are "no specific plans" on PM Modi mediating on the issue.</p>

<p>"At this time they can hardly exist, as we do not see any preconditions for talks for now," the Kremlin spokesman said.</p>

<p>PM Modi on August 23 visited Ukraine where he conveyed to President Zelenskyy that both Ukraine and Russia should sit together without wasting time to end the ongoing war and that India was ready to play an "active role" to restore peace in the region.</p>

<p>His nearly nine-hour visit to Ukraine, the first by an Indian prime minister since its independence in 1991, came six weeks after he held summit talks with President Putin that triggered anguish in some Western countries.</p>

<p>In his talks with Zelenskyy in Kyiv, PM Modi said India was on the side of peace since the beginning of the conflict and he would even like to contribute personally for a peaceful resolution of the crisis.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's X Corp. agreed to stop processing the personal information of European users to train its artificial intelligence chatbot Grok, bowing to demands from European Union regulators.</p>

<p>Ireland's Data Protection Commission on Wednesday announced the company's commitment to delete EU users' personal data contained in public posts on its X social-media platform that were collected between May 7 and Aug. 1, 2024.</p>

<p>The spat began in August, when the DPC filed a request with Ireland's High Court to stop X from processing the data for use in the company's AI model, citing EU data protection restrictions and alleging that X's action risked jeopardizing users' rights.</p>

<p>Ireland's data protection office serves as the chief EU regulator for X, which has its European headquarters in the country. The DPC said it was the first time a lead EU agency has taken such an action against an online platform.</p>

<p>Following the DPC's original notification, X agreed to temporarily suspend the use of the data to train Grok - a commitment that became permanent Wednesday, leading the DPC to conclude the court proceedings.</p>

<p>The DPC also asked the EU-level European Data Protection Board to kick-start a discussion on the interplay between data protection and AI model training - an issue that has in recent months given rise to disputes between data watchdogs and tech companies, including X and Meta Platforms, Inc.</p>

<p>"The DPC hopes that the resulting opinion will enable proactive, effective and consistent Europe-wide regulation of this area more broadly," DPC commissioner Dale Sunderland said in a news release. "It will also support the handling of a number of complaints that have been lodged with/transmitted to the DPC" about this matter.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The woman, identified by police as 28-year-old Ricki Smith was arrested following reports of a disturbance.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman from Louisville was arrested in Evansville, Indiana, after attempting to steal cars outside a business, claiming that musician Kanye West had instructed her through 'telepathy' to commit the theft. The incident occurred on Friday and caused a stir when the woman tried to enter several vehicles, one of which had a child inside, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nbc4i.com/news/u-s-world/woman-claims-kanye-west-telegraphically-told-her-to-steal-car-with-child-inside/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>NBC </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The woman, identified by police as 28-year-old Ricki Smith was arrested following reports of a disturbance. Witnesses at the scene reported seeing Smith attempting to open random car doors in a nearby parking lot.</p>

<p>According to an eyewitness, Smith managed to find an unlocked vehicle and sat in the driver's seat. Bystanders asked her to leave, but she refused. Moments later, she entered another car, which belonged to a woman who had stepped away briefly, leaving her car unlocked with her child in the back seat.</p>

<p>The situation escalated when the car owner returned to find Smith inside her vehicle. Fearing for her child's safety, the woman reportedly grabbed Smith by the hair and forcibly removed her from the car. Local reports confirmed that the woman plans to press charges.</p>

<p>Smith, however, gave a different version of events to the police, claiming she had been travelling from Louisville to Evansville when her car broke down. She said she hitchhiked to Evansville and, in a bizarre twist, claimed that she was instructed to steal a vehicle because "Kanye West speaks to me telegraphically." She likely meant to say telepathically.</p>

<p>Further investigation revealed that Smith had crashed her vehicle into a tree line off Highway 64 before abandoning it, which led to her alleged attempts to steal another car. She was subsequently arrested and is currently being held at the Vanderburgh County Jail.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A spacecraft carrying European and Japanese probes passed closer to Mercury than originally planned overnight after thruster problems delayed the mission to study the little-known, Sun-scorched planet.</p>

<p>The BepiColombo mission launched in 2018 on a winding path that had been intended to enter the orbit of the planet closest to the Sun in December 2025.</p>

<p>But in April, a glitch with the spacecraft's thrusters sapped some of its power supply, forcing teams on the ground to change its trajectory and delaying its arrival until November 2026.</p>

<p>The new path meant the spacecraft needed to fly 35 kilometres (22 miles) closer to the planet than initially planned -- passing just 165 kilometres above the surface -- during its latest flyby.</p>

<p>The European Space Agency's operations team confirmed that "all went well" with the flyby overnight, the mission's account on X said on Thursday.</p>

<p>It also posted a new image taken by the probe of the planet, whose pockmarked surface resembles the Moon.</p>

<p>It was the fourth of six planned flybys of Mercury on the mission's nine-billion-kilometre journey before it can finally settle into the planet's orbit.</p>

<p>Most of the time Mercury is closer to Earth than Mars -- but the red planet can be reached by missions from Earth in just seven months.</p>

<p>Mercury is "the most difficult" planet for probes to reach, explained Paris Observatory astronomer Alain Doressoundiram.</p>

<p>The planet's relatively tiny mass -- it is only slightly bigger than the Moon -- means its gravitational pull is extremely weak compared to the Sun, making it tricky for satellites to stay in its orbit.</p>

<p>"It takes much more energy to brake and stop at Mercury than to go to Mars," Doressoundiram told AFP.</p>

<p>This is where delicate manoeuvres called gravitational assists come in. These slingshots around celestial bodies allow spacecraft to speed up, slow down, or change trajectory.</p>

<p>The glitch with the electric thrusters means the spacecraft is now operating with only 90 percent of its planned power supply.</p>

<p>After months spent investigating the problem, the thrusters will "remain operating below the minimum thrust required for an insertion into orbit around Mercury in December 2025," mission manager Santa Martinez said in a statement earlier this week.</p>

<p>The new slower path means BepiColombo is now planned to enter orbit in November 2026.</p>

<p>- Space 'oddities' -</p>

<p>Mercury is by far the least studied of the four rocky, innermost planets in our solar system, which also include Venus, Earth and Mars.</p>

<p>NASA's Mariner 10 was the first probe to capture a close picture of its lunar-looking surface in 1974.</p>

<p>No spacecraft had orbited the planet until the MESSENGER probe arrived in 2011.</p>

<p>The NASA mission confirmed "some rather bizarre things," said Doressoundiram, a specialist on the surfaces of planets.</p>

<p>One of these "oddities" is that Mercury is the only rocky planet other than Earth to have a magnetic field, Doressoundiram said. Exactly how it has such a magnetic field so close to the Sun is not fully understood.</p>

<p>Another "oddity" is that Mercury's iron core composes 60 percent of its mass -- compared to only a third for Earth.</p>

<p>Mercury's surface is also marked by "hollows," which could suggest relatively recent geologic activity.</p>

<p>Also unclear is the composition of minerals on covering the planet's surface, which is blasted with intense radiation from the Sun.</p>

<p>These are just some of the mysteries that the BepiColombo mission hopes to shed light on when it finally orbits Mercury for at least a year and a half.</p>

<p>The spacecraft carries two separate satellites, one from the ESA and another from Japan's JAXA space agency, which have a total of 16 scientific instruments.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A gunman opened fire at German police before he was shot dead dead by officers Thursday near Munich's Nazi-era documentation centre and the Israeli consulate, the Bavarian state interior minister said.</p>

<p>"Police responded with armed force against the perpetrator, who was carrying a rifle and had fired a number of shots," said the minister, Joachim Herrmann, adding that the gunman had died of his wounds.</p>

<p>Joachim Herrmann said it was "obvious that the crime scene" near the documentation centre and the Israeli diplomatic mission "could provide further clues" about the gunman's motive.</p>

<p>The minister also pointed out that Thursday marks "the 52nd anniversary of the terrible attack on the Israeli team during the Olympic Games" of 1972 at the hands of a Palestinian group.</p>

<p>Munich police wrote on social media platform X that, after the shooting, there were "no indications of any other suspects" and that no one else was wounded.</p>

<p>The Munich Documentation Center for the History of National Socialism is located on the site of the former Nazi party headquarters and close to Israel's consulate in the southern German city.</p>

<p>A police helicopter was in the sky above the area and the sound of police sirens blared through the streets.</p>

<p>The Bild daily showed pictures of armed police wearing helmets and body armour in the downtown area.</p>

<p>Police advised the public that a large number of police were "on their way to the site of operations in the area of the NS Documentation Centre".</p>

<p>"To ensure that they can work without hindrance, we ask that you avoid this area as much as possible."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>(This is the second article in a two-part series on the US-China semiconductor battle, and where India stands in it. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/china-is-eating-away-at-uss-tech-reign-chip-by-chip-6481939">Here is the first part</a>)</em></p>

<p>When Chandrayaan 3 landed on the moon on August 23 last year, there was one place in Mohali that was particularly jubilant: the government-run Semiconductor Laboratory (SCL). It was a personal win for SCL's engineers, the unsung heroes who for months worked on producing a wide variety of semiconductors critical for controlling and commanding the mission. The spacecraft used chips to enable communication with Earth and navigate its way to the landing destination, using sensors and cameras to transmit data and messages.</p>

<p>Mohali's SCL is India's only well-known chip-making foundry. It began production in 1984, three years before the world's biggest semiconductor manufacturing company, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), was founded.</p>

<p>Today, however, while TSMC produces 90% of the world's most sophisticated and advanced semiconductors or microchips, churning out the most valued 5-nanometer (nm) chips in size, SCL can make only legacy chips of 100 nm and above, which are obviously many generations old. TSMC's annual turnover exceeded $70 billion last year, far more than the SCL's meagre $5 million. And while TSMC's clients are some of the world's leading tech firms, such as Apple, AMD and Nvidia, among SCL's top clients is just ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation). TSMC's factories are state-of-the-art; SCL is in dire need of modernisation and upgradation.</p>

<h2><strong>India's Tough Luck</strong></h2>

<p>SCL could have been TSMC's largest rival if it were not for one very unfortunate incident, which pushed India back to the semiconductor dark ages. On February 27, 1989, a mysterious fire broke out in the plant, destroying most of the facilities. To date, no one knows if it was an act of sabotage or an accident. The factory later rose from the ashes, but by then, it was left far behind in the race.</p>

<p>Dan Hutcheson of Canada's TechInsights company, one of the industry's global voices, surprised me when he said he had been monitoring the Indian chip industry since the 1970s. "I have seen India strive for this industry my entire career. There have been only failures. It is important for India to be successful now." Dan is not wrong, as India's semiconductor history is made up of a series of broken dreams and unfulfilled promises. Several multinational companies tried their luck in setting up chip production projects, but they did not materialise for various reasons.</p>

<h2><strong>Micron Project, A Sign Of Good Things To Come</strong></h2>

<p>It took India over three decades after the 1989 tragedy to see a positive development in its semiconductor journey. In August last year, a groundbreaking ceremony was held in Sanand, Gujarat, for Micron Technology's state-of-the-art semiconductor assembly, testing, and packaging facility. Its bosses claim the facility will be operational early next year. The plant will be completed in two phases at a cost of $2.75 billion – $825 million being invested by Micron, and the rest by the Centre and the Gujarat government.</p>

<p>The Micron project appears to be the beginning of the country's bright chip future. Since the groundbreaking ceremony&nbsp;last year, four new projects have been announced, the latest on Monday when the government said it&nbsp;cleared a proposal of Kaynes Semicon to set up a semiconductor unit in Sanand. All the new units, except Tata Electronics' fab unit in Dholera in Gujarat are testing and packaging&nbsp;units. Taiwain's Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (PSMC) and Tata Electronics announced in&nbsp;February this year that they will set up a fabrication unit in Dholera. I am sure the government will be more keen to see the progress of this project because it's India's first fab unit in the private sector. Neither company in their press statements have&nbsp;given a completion date or the costs involved but according to media&nbsp;reports, the total project will cost Rs 91,000 crore.</p>

<p>India have witnessed several false dawns in the last few decades, but now things appear to be changing, and at a fast speed. There was a time when India could not even dream of producing sophisticated smartphones. That was a domain exclusively captured by China. Today, India is a manufacturing hub for iPhones and other smartphone brands. Citing this success story, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said last year, “We have successfully made India a manufacturing hub for mobile phones over the last decade. Now, our next goal is to position the country as a leader in semiconductor manufacturing.”</p>

<h2><strong>India Is Established In Just One Segment&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>A semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem requires infrastructure for designing, fabrication, research, testing, and packaging. Besides, it needs sophisticated tools, minerals, and gases to make chips. While India severely lacks large-scale semiconductor fabrication facilities, it has built a robust ecosystem for chip design and related services. Major global semiconductor companies such as Intel, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, NVIDIA, AMD and Broadcom have established significant design and R&amp;D centres in India. Indian engineers contribute to the design of the most complex chips used in cutting-edge technologies, from artificial intelligence to 5G networks. Companies like Wipro, Tata Elxsi, and HCL Technologies also provide outsourced semiconductor design services, catering to global clients.</p>

<h2><strong>"Learn To Walk Before You Can Run"</strong></h2>

<p>Now, the Modi government wants India to become a fabrication, R&amp;D, testing, and packaging hub. A tall order indeed, considering India is only at the beginning of the chip race — but not an impossible one. I have spoken to several industry experts worldwide over the last two years, and they believe India can become a semiconductor hub and a global player in 10-20 years if it stays as focused, patient, and committed as the Modi government appears to be today.</p>

<p>To put India's efforts in perspective, we ought to remember that it took semiconductor superpowers Taiwan and South Korea decades to reach where they are in the race today. "Realistically, it'll take 10 to 20 years, assuming it is well-executed. You have to learn to walk before you can run. That's the important thing – to make sure the Micron project is successful," says Hutcheson, who calls the Micron packaging project "a great baby step”. To be sure, South Korea, Taiwan, and China all started with packaging units.</p>

<h2><strong>India's Challenges</strong></h2>

<p>Chip fabrication, which allows for the production of 5 nm or even 2 nm microchips, is widely believed to be the key to the success of a semiconductor mission. A host of things are needed before manufacturing can start 10-15 years later. This is not a simple industry; it requires a lot of work and high-end equipment and materials.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>1. Investment</strong></h2>

<p>According to the Semiconductor Industry Association estimates, a state-of-the-art manufacturing factory takes a minimum of 10 years to produce chips. The initial capital investment and operating costs can run up to anywhere between $10 billion and $40 billion. If India dreams of being a chi hub, it will have to invest hugely in the sector in the next 10-15 years. China has been doing just that, pouring billions of dollars into becoming self-reliant in semiconductor manufacturing. The US has pumped in over $100 billion in its own industry since 2022. Against these stark figures, India has managed to inject just about $15 billion into its semiconductor project.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What India badly needs is private investors and global players.</p>

<h2><strong>2. Gases and Mineral Shortages</strong></h2>

<p>Semiconductor chip manufacturing essentially uses more than 150 types of chemicals and over 30 types of gases and minerals. At present, all these are available only in a few countries. The challenge for India is to be self-reliant in this sector.</p>

<h2><strong>3. Supporting Industries</strong></h2>

<p>Some experts believe that the main task for India is to create supporting industries for the chip industry to emerge. The issue relates to some basic things, like having a stable power grid and consistent water availability, which make it possible to build the semiconductor industry.</p>

<h2><strong>4. Political Will</strong></h2>

<p>The chip industry is capital-intensive and time-consuming, which requires deep commitment from the government and private players alike. It requires the willpower of successive governments to stay in the game. PM Modi wants India to be a developed economy by 2047. A long-term semiconductor strategy will be needed if India really is to become a developed country by 2047.</p>

<h2><strong>5. Skilled Manpower</strong></h2>

<p>India has manpower in abundance, but it has a shortage of the kind of skilled manpower needed in the semiconductor industry.</p>

<h2><strong>6. Brain Drain</strong></h2>

<p>India could achieve its goal of becoming a semiconductor hub in around five to six years rather than the conventional 10-20 year timeframe if we manage to bring big Indian talent, serving global companies, back home. Can we entice them with equivalent salary packages and perks? Can nation-building be a motivator? Can we improve our work culture to make it more professional and productive?</p>

<p>Taiwan's success story owes a lot to the Taiwanese-origin executives who obtained their semiconductor expertise and experiences in the US. The Taiwanese government in the 1980s decided to bring its talented people back to kickstart the semiconductor industry. It paid them salaries on a par with Western companies. These expat Taiwanese played a huge role in making Taiwan a truly global chip hub.</p>

<p>South Korea's chip revolution also started after the government enticed many Korean experts working in Japanese companies to come back and work in Korea.</p>

<p>There is no dearth of Indians who are doing well in the semiconductor business in the US and elsewhere. Around a dozen leaders of the world's leading chip-making companies are either Indian or of Indian origin. I have met a couple. They all love India. But India needs to create the right conditions to bring them back, and also stop the brain drain of young engineering graduates who are in high demand abroad.</p>

<h2><strong>A New Dawn</strong></h2>

<p>India is on the cusp of sealing deals with several multinational companies to launch new projects. The Modi government has recognised the fact that if India needs to be a big geopolitical player, it needs to be the leading light in the semiconductor arena. What follows after the Micron factory will determine the future of India's semiconductor industry.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs has predicted the potential economic implications of a Republican or Democratic victory in the November 5 presidential elections in the US. It claimed the country's GDP may face a hit if Donald Trump secures a second term in the White House, reported Reuters.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In a note on Tuesday, economists at the investment bank stated that the economic growth of the US would likely witness the biggest boost in the coming two years from a Democratic government, headed by Kamala Harris, Reuters reported.<br />
<br />
The economic output would take a hit next year, majorly from the increased tariffs on imports as well as tighter immigration policies, if the Republican Party comes to power, even with a divided government led by the former US president, they said.<br />
<br />
As per Goldman Sachs, there will be more job growth in the US under a Democrat government than the Republicans.<br />
<br />
If Trump sweeps the polls or even manages to form a divided government, in that case, "the hit to growth from tariffs and tighter immigration policy would outweigh the positive fiscal impulse, resulting in a peak hit to GDP growth of -0.5pp in 2025H2 that abates in 2026," it said.<br />
<br />
If Democrats get another term then the new spending and expanded middle-income tax credits will slightly be more than the "offset lower investment due to higher corporate tax rates", the Wall Street behemoth believes.<br />
<br />
This will result in a "very slight boost to GDP investment due to higher corporate tax rates." Ultimately, this will give a little boost to GDP growth on average over 2025-2026.<br />
<br />
"If Democrats sweep, new spending and expanded middle-income tax credits would slightly more than offset lower investment due to higher corporate tax rates, resulting in a very slight boost to GDP investment due to higher corporate tax rates, resulting in a very slight boost to GDP growth on average over 2025-2026," the news agency quoted the note from the company.<br />
<br />
If Harris wins, the job growth will be 10,000 a month higher compared with Trump's win with a divided government, and it will be 30,000 higher in comparison with a sweep by the Republicans, as per Goldman estimates.<br />
<br />
The US' core inflation is likely to rise as a Trump win may lead to increased tariffs on auto imports from China, Mexico and the European Union, it added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chief Adviser to Bangladesh's interim government, Muhammad Yunus, has said the issue of attacks on minority Hindus in his country is “exaggerated” and questioned the manner in which India projected it.</p>

<p>In an interview with PTI at his official residence here, Yunus said the attacks on minorities in Bangladesh are more political than communal.</p>

<p>He suggested that the attacks were not communal, but a fallout of a political upheaval as there is a perception that most Hindus supported the now-deposed Awami League regime.</p>

<p>“I have said this to (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi also that this is exaggerated. This issue has several dimensions. When the country went through an upheaval following the atrocities by (Sheikh) Hasina and the Awami League, those who were with them also faced attacks,” the Nobel laureate told PTI.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/muhammad-yunus-advice-to-sheikh-hasina-stay-silent-in-india-till-6494885"><strong>Read: "Stay Silent In India Till...": Muhammad Yunus' Advice To Sheikh Hasina</strong></a></p>

<p>The minority Hindu population faced vandalism of their businesses and properties, as well as the destruction of Hindu temples, during the student-led violence that erupted following the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>After unprecedented anti-government protests that peaked on August 5, Hasina resigned as prime minister and fled to India.</p>

<p>“Now, while beating up Awami League cadres, they had beaten up Hindus as there is a perception that Hindus in Bangladesh mean Awami League supporters. I am not saying that what has happened is right, but some people are using it as an excuse to seize property. So, there is no clear distinction between Awami League supporters and Hindus,” he said.</p>

<p>In his first direct contact with New Delhi last month, shortly after becoming the head of Bangladesh's interim government, Yunus conveyed to Prime Minister Modi that Dhaka would prioritise the protection and safety of Hindus and all other minority groups.</p>

<p>During the conversation, Modi reaffirmed India's support for a democratic, stable, peaceful, and progressive Bangladesh and emphasised the importance of ensuring the safety of Hindus and other minority communities in the violence-hit country.</p>

<p>Hindus, who made up 22 per cent of Bangladesh's population at the time of the 1971 Liberation War, now constitute about 8 per cent of 170 million and have predominantly supported the Awami League, known for its secular stance.</p>

<p>Describing the attacks as more political than communal, Yunus questioned the manner in which India is “propagating” them.</p>

<p>“These attacks are political in nature and not communal. And India is propagating these incidents in a big way. We have not said that we can't do anything; we have said that we are doing everything,” the Chief Adviser said.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi, in his Independence Day address from the Red Fort on August 15, expressed hope that the situation in violence-hit Bangladesh would return to normal soon and said 1.4 billion Indians are concerned about the safety of Hindus and minorities in the neighbouring country.</p>

<p>Discussing the future of India-Bangladesh relations, Yunus expressed a desire for good ties with India but insisted that New Delhi must abandon the narrative that Bangladesh will turn into another Afghanistan without Sheikh Hasina at the helm.</p>

<p>“The way forward is for India to come out of the narrative. The narrative is that everybody is Islamist, BNP is Islamist, and everyone else is Islamist and will make this country into Afghanistan. And Bangladesh is in safe hands with Sheikh Hasina at the helm only.</p>

<p>“India is captivated by this narrative. India needs to come out of this narrative. Bangladesh, like any other nation, is just another neighbour,” he said.</p>

<p>The noted economist added, “The issue of trying to portray the conditions of minorities in such a big way is just an excuse.” Yunus said that when he met leaders of the minority community, he urged them to protest as citizens of the country with equal rights and not merely as Hindus.</p>

<p>“Even when I met members of the Hindu community, I had requested them: please don't identify yourselves as Hindus; rather, you should say you are citizens of this country and you have equal rights. If someone tries to snatch your legal rights as citizens, then there are remedies,” he said.</p>

<p>The Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (BHBCUC), a prominent Hindu minority group in Bangladesh, had also reported attacks on minorities, especially Hindus, following the fall of Sheikh Hasina's government on August 5.</p>

<p>Thousands of Hindus staged protest rallies in Bangladesh's capital and the northeastern port city of Chattogram on August 10-11, demanding protection amid nationwide vandalism that saw attacks on temples and their homes and businesses.</p>

<p>Earlier in August, the Bangladesh National Hindu Grand Alliance said that the minority Hindu community faced attacks and threats in 278 locations across 48 districts since the fall of the Hasina-led government and termed it as an “assault on the Hindu religion.”&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Muhammad Yunus, the head of Bangladesh's interim government, has said that former prime minister Sheikh Hasina making political remarks from India is an “unfriendly gesture", asserting that she must remain silent to prevent the discomfort to both countries until Dhaka requests her extradition.</p>

<p>"If India wants to keep her until the time Bangladesh (government) wants her back, the condition would be that she has to keep quiet," he said.</p>

<p>In an interview with PTI at his official residence in Dhaka, Yunus, who was appointed the country's Chief Advisor after Hasina's ouster, stressed that while Bangladesh values strong ties with India, New Delhi must move “beyond the narrative that portrays every other political party except Awami League as Islamist and that the country will turn into Afghanistan without Sheikh Hasina.” "No one is comfortable with her stance there in India because we want her back to try her. She is there in India and at times she is talking, which is problematic. Had she been quiet, we would have forgotten it; people would have also forgotten it as she would have been in her own world. But sitting in India, she is speaking and giving instructions. No one likes it,” he said.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bangladesh-amends-law-scrapping-special-security-for-sheikh-hasina-family-6447607"><strong>Read: Bangladesh Amends Law Scrapping Special Security For Sheikh Hasina, Family</strong></a></p>

<p>Yunus was apparently referring to Hasina's statement on August 13 in which she demanded "justice", saying those involved in recent "terror acts", killings and vandalism must be investigated, identified and punished.</p>

<p>“It is not good for us or for India. There is discomfort regarding it,” he told PTI.</p>

<p>Following unprecedented anti-government protests that peaked on August 5, Hasina resigned as prime minister and fled to India. Her presence in India for nearly four weeks has fuelled speculation in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>When asked whether Bangladesh has communicated its stance to India, Yunus said it has been conveyed verbally and quite firmly that she should keep quiet.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bangladesh-violence-quota-protests-5-more-murder-cases-filed-against-sheikh-hasina-total-cases-now-71-report-6430267"><strong>Read: 5 More Murder Cases Against Sheikh Hasina, Total Count Now 71: Report</strong></a></p>

<p>“Everyone understands it. We have said quite firmly that she should keep quiet. This is an unfriendly gesture towards us; she has been given shelter there and she is campaigning from there. It is not that she has gone there on a normal course. She has fled following a people's uprising and public anger,” he said.</p>

<p>Yunus stated that the interim government is committed to ensuring justice for the people of Bangladesh against the atrocities, and justice requires that she be brought back to the country.</p>

<p>“Yes, she has to be brought back or else the people of Bangladesh won't be at peace. The kind of atrocities she has committed, she has to be tried in front of everyone here,” he emphasised.</p>

<p>Discussing the future of the India-Bangladesh relationship, Yunus expressed a desire for good ties with India but insisted that New Delhi must abandon the narrative that only Hasina's leadership ensures the country's stability.</p>

<p>“The way forward is for India to come out of the narrative. The narrative is that everybody is Islamist, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is Islamist, and everyone else is Islamist and will make this country into Afghanistan. And Bangladesh is in safe hands with Sheikh Hasina at the helm only. India is captivated by this narrative. India has to come out of this narrative. Bangladesh, like any other nation, is another neighbour,” he said.</p>

<p>Referring to the recent incidents of alleged attacks on Hindu minorities in the country and India raising concerns about it, Yunus said this is just an excuse.</p>

<p>“The issue of trying to portray the conditions of minorities in such a big way is just an excuse,” he said.</p>

<p>The minority Hindu population has faced vandalism of their businesses and properties, as well as the destruction of Hindu temples, during the student-led violence that erupted following the ouster of Hasina.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his Independence Day address from the ramparts of the Red Fort on August 15, expressed hope that the situation in violence-hit Bangladesh would return to normal soon and stated that 1.4 billion Indians are concerned about the safety of Hindus and minorities in the neighbouring country.</p>

<p>The 84-year-old Nobel laureate emphasised the need for India and Bangladesh to work together to improve their currently strained relationship.</p>

<p>When asked about ways to improve the Indo-Bangla relations, Yunus said both the countries need to work together and it is on a downhill presently.</p>

<p>“We need to work together to improve this relationship, which is now at a low,” he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping today pledged to step up China's support across the debt-distressed African continent with funding of nearly $51 billion, backing for more infrastructure initiatives and a promise to create at least 1 million jobs.</p>

<p>The commitments were made at the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Summit in Beijing.</p>

<p>Beijing, the world's biggest two-way lender, also promised to carry out three times as many infrastructure projects across resource-rich Africa, despite Xi's new preference for "small and beautiful" schemes based around selling advanced and green technologies in which Chinese firms have invested heavily.</p>

<p>"China is ready to deepen cooperation with Africa in industry, agriculture, infrastructure, trade and investment," Xi told delegates from more than 50 African nations gathered in Beijing for the ninth meeting of the three yearly forum.</p>

<p>After the opening ceremony, delegates adopted the Beijing Declaration to build an "all-weather China-Africa community with a shared future in the new era," as well as the Beijing Action Plan for 2025-2027, China's state media said.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">Xi Jinping delivers a keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the ninth Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Summit</p>
</div>

<p>Xi also called for "a China-Africa network featuring land-sea links and co-ordinated development," as he told Chinese contractors to return to the one-billion-strong continent, after the lifting of COVID-19 curbs that disrupted its projects.</p>

<p>"China and Africa account for one-third of the world population. Without our modernisation, there will be no global modernisation," Xi told the summit.</p>

<p>The Chinese leader committed 360 billion yuan ($50.70 billion) in financial assistance, but specified that 210 billion would be disbursed through credit lines and at least 70 billion in fresh investment by Chinese companies, with smaller amounts provided through military aid and other projects.</p>

<p>At the 2021 China-Africa summit in Dakar, China promised at least $10 billion in investment and the same again in credit lines. This time, the financial assistance would be in yuan, in an apparent push to further internationalise the Chinese yuan.</p>

<p>Xi did not mention debt in his speech, despite Beijing being many African states' biggest bilateral lender, but the Action Plan for 2024-2027 included terms for repayment postponements and called for the establishment of an African rating agency to bring about "a new rating culture".</p>

<p>United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres told the summit African countries' inadequate access to debt relief and scarce resources was a recipe for social unrest, while proposing fresh reforms to the international financial architecture.</p>

<p><strong>SHARED FUTURE OR DEBT DIPLOMACY?</strong></p>

<p>The Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Summit chalks out a three-year programme for China and every African state bar Eswatini, which retains ties to Taiwan.</p>

<p>In addition to 30 infrastructure connectivity projects, Xi said, "China is ready to launch 30 clean energy projects in Africa," offering to co-operate on nuclear technology and tackle a power deficit that has delayed industrialisation efforts.</p>

<p>But the Chinese leader did not reiterate his pledge at the 2021 forum in Dakar for the Asian giant to buy $300 billion worth of African goods, pledging only to unilaterally expand market access.</p>

<p>Analysts say Beijing's phytosanitary rules for market access are too strict, making China unable to meet that promise.</p>

<p>But Africa continues to receive more Chinese financing instead. Last year, China approved loans worth $4.61 billion to Africa, in the first annual increase since 2016.</p>

<p>"I'm here to see how best we can foster our relationship with China," Princess Dugba, Sierra Leone's fisheries and marine resources minister, said to the summit's sidelines.</p>

<p>"China is getting us a fish harbour, which is one of the first of its kind," she added.</p>

<p>Xi Jinping also said China was "ready to assist in the development of the African Continental Free Trade Area, and deepen logistics and financial co-operation for the benefit of trans-regional development in Africa."</p>

<p>China has been accused of having "hidden agendas" in its "debt diplomacy". Nations dealing with China have often faced the dangers of unaffordable debt via unsustainable financing, which, as highlighted by India at the United Nations, leads to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indias-vicious-cycle-of-debt-traps-warning-at-un-meet-presided-by-china-4594233" target="_blank">"vicious cycle of debt traps"</a>.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Black Myth: Wukong has sold 18 million copies in two weeks - one of the fastest starts the global gaming industry has seen. That record pace has in turn minted millions for its earliest and biggest investor.</p>

<p>Wukong was a leap of faith for Daniel Wu, whose little-known Hero Games is the biggest external shareholder in creator Game Science. His startup stuck with its partner through years of flops and contributed a large chunk of the blockbuster title's $70 million budget over six years of development, an unheard-of undertaking for a Chinese project.</p>

<p>It paid off big time. The action game based on the legend of the Monkey King has outsold industry icons such as Elden Ring and Zelda, at least in its initial spurt. It can reach 30 million sales over its lifetime, augmented with an expansion to come, Wu told Bloomberg News.</p>

<p>China's biggest PC creation emerged from a creative team whose biggest claim to fame before this summer was a visit from Apple Inc.'s Tim Cook. Wu, who escorted the iPhone boss around Hero's Shanghai offices in 2017, said one of its early collaborations with Game Science caught Cook's eye - though that project ultimately tanked. It took another four years before Tencent Holdings Ltd. invested in Hero's investee, after a tantalizing Wukong trailer.</p>

<p>Today, Game Science is worth several billion yuan, Wu said, marking a return of several-fold on his studio's 20% stake. Hero Games had paid just 60 million yuan ($8.5 million) for its slice in 2017. Both startups find themselves unexpectedly in the spotlight, hailed for finally showing China is capable of producing a big-budget title on par with the best of the West.</p>

<p>"If you want to hear the truth, Game Science's success today is built upon its four failures in a row," the 36-year-old Wu said in an exclusive interview from his Beijing office. "Wukong proves not only that we have top-notch game-making capabilities, but also we can tell a good story with Chinese elements."</p>

<p>For Wu, who gave up a career as a startup financier to immerse himself in games close to a decade ago, Wukong is much more than just a groundbreaking game. He and Game Science co-founder Feng Ji, five years his elder, tied their fortunes to the success of a title built for consoles and PCs, in a country dominated by mobile entertainment.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/hp0nh4oc_hero-games-office-bloomberg_625x300_05_September_24.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>

<p>Since its release on Aug. 20, the game has broken several records for single-player titles, eclipsing the likes of Cyberpunk 2077 with runaway popularity at home in China. It's estimated to have earned $700 million so far, overshadowed only by Call of Duty's historic $1 billion in 10 days, according to Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad. He sees overseas sales accounting for a larger share going forward as the game's global renown grows.</p>

<p>Wukong got a lift from state media lauding its faithful depiction of historic and cultural sites, but success came only after Wu and Feng risked everything to realize the project.</p>

<p>"We were two drowning rats," Wu, whose company is still not profitable, said of himself and Feng. "Neither of us was afraid of failure, and he already knew his next step. The only thing is that he needed me to place even bigger bets."</p>

<p>Game Science had struck out with its three prior efforts, which were more modest free-to-play mobile games chasing attention in the world's biggest games arena. One of them, Art of War: Red Tides, even got prime placement on the iOS App Store after Cook's visit, but to no avail.</p>

<p>As the sole investor and publishing partner of Game Science, Hero Games took significant losses, but Wu didn't shy away in 2018 when Feng, now his late-night League of Legends teammate, reached out for more money to craft an ambitious project then codenamed Black Myth One.</p>

<p>It won't take another six years for the next chapter in what's planned to be a series based on Chinese mythology - though that won't be a sequel, Wu said. Game Science is working on an expansion to Wukong, which will give it a chance to monetize the game a second time. 2022's Elden Ring, a title with similar play style and design, has shown how the release of an expansion - this year's Shadow of the Erdtree - can spur a fresh flurry of sales for the original.</p>

<p>Wu co-founded Hero Games in 2015 after a three-year stint with famed Chinese venture firm ZhenFund. He zeroed in on Feng and his Game Science team early on, describing them as an asset he couldn't afford to miss out on. At Tencent, Feng had led a team of 250 people on the development of online role-playing game Asura, inspired by similar folklore to Wukong. The title launched in 2010 and initially won praise for its design, though it later upset players with practices around its in-game shop that were deemed exploitative.</p>

<p>Hero Games, which orchestrated a marketing blitz around Wukong that included Luckin Coffee giveaways, also drew criticism outside of China for its guidance to streamers playing Wukong to not discuss "feminist propaganda," politics or Covid-19. Wu declined to comment on the matter.</p>

<p>The 2,000-person Hero Games team, even with that huge winning bet in its portfolio, isn't making a profit. Wu's company is on a yearslong transition from publisher to developer, and it's facing the same challenges that Game Science ran into when trying to score a mobile hit. Until it breaks through, Wu's message to staff this year will be to learn to embrace the death of your project.</p>

<p>"This is the most gruesome year for China's games industry ever," Wu said, noting the large number of unsuccessful games that few will ever see or hear about. The country's economic difficulties have cut into entertainment spending and forced many studios to reconsider or abandon projects.</p>

<p>That makes the triumph of Wukong all the sweeter. Wu expects it will fire up passions and interest to create more games based China's rich history and culture - and more courage to build for consoles.</p>

<p>When Wu encountered the first big fight in Wukong on his PlayStation 5, he texted Feng to say he was welling up.</p>

<p>"How dare you cry without me?" Feng texted him back.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 14-year-old Georgia school shooter, who killed two fellow students and two teachers on Wednesday, attempted to re-enter his algebra class after leaving it at the beginning of the period. He was denied entry by a classmate, who saw he had a gun, reported <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/us/live-news/apalachee-high-school-shooting-georgia-09-04-24/index.html">CNN</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Colt Gray left the room and returned as the class neared its end, asking to be let back in, recounted Lyela Sayarath, a junior who sat beside Gray. Due to the school's security protocol, the classroom doors automatically locked once closed, meaning someone from inside had to manually allow him back in.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However, a peer noticed that Gray was in possession of a gun and refused to open the door. Gray then opened fire in another classroom. Moments later, a round of gunshots inside the school left four dead and nine injured.<br />
<br />
“They almost let him in, but I'm pretty sure she saw that he had a gun and so she backed away,” Ms Sayarath said. “And then he turned away and that's when you hear like the first round of fire.”<br />
<br />
Lyela Sayarath and her classmates instinctively dropped to the floor, piling desks in front of them and trying to shield themselves. Their teacher turned off the lights.<br />
<br />
First responders arrived at the scene quickly, and Gray was taken into custody just minutes after the shooting began. He was armed with an AR-15, a semi-automatic rifle.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Ms Sayarath wasn't surprised by Gray's alleged actions, as he fit the common stereotype of a school shooter. “It's usually the quiet kid or that's a stereotype for it to be and he was the one that fit that description in our class,” she said.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Among the dead was 14-year-old student Mason Schermerhorn, who had autism, and two teachers whose identities have not yet been released. Eight students and a teacher were also injured in the attack, with some of the injuries resulting from gunfire and others from students trying to flee the scene. Fortunately, all those hospitalised are reportedly stable.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India is likely to soon overtake China as the most influential in a key emerging markets index, pulling in more foreign funds and adding fuel to a stock market rally that, though already among the best globally, is "only past the halfway mark", Morgan Stanley said.</p>

<p>India's weightage in the MSCI emerging markets index rose to 19.8% after a rejig in August, closing in on China's 24.2%. India's weightage has steadily increased from 9.2% in December 2020, while China's has dropped from 39.1%.</p>

<p>"A rising weight essentially means more absolute foreign flows," analysts led by Ridham Desai said in a note on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"In the context of India being underweight in the average emerging markets portfolio, this is even better for foreign portfolio flows."</p>

<p>Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have bought shares worth 531.78 billion rupees ($6.33 billion) so far in 2024, and have remained net buyers since June, bolstered by policy continuity after the country's elections and an imminent start to global interest rate cuts.</p>

<p>So far, the sustained inflows from domestic institutional investors, mutual funds and retail traders have helped power the benchmark Nifty 50 to record highs. Its 16% jump this year is more than most other markets, including China.</p>

<p>Mr Desai expects the rally to continue as fiscal consolidation allows private borrowing and spending to fuel the next leg of earnings growth and as higher FII inflows will keep liquidity in surplus, lending resilience.</p>

<p>"We think we are only past the halfway mark in the current bull market. A bull market peak for India is possibly still in the future and the weight in the EM index could have some more distance to travel before it peaks."</p>

<p>Morgan Stanley retained India as its top pick among emerging markets and second favourite, behind Japan, in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<p>Among stocks, it prefers cyclicals over defensives and large-caps over small-caps. And among sectors, it is 'overweight' on financials, technology, consumer discretionary and industrials, and is 'underweight' on others. ($1 = 83.9690 Indian rupees)<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ugandan marathon runner Rebecca Cheptegei, who competed in the recent Paris Olympics, has died days after an ex-boyfriend threw petrol and set her ablaze. Ms Cheptegei, 33, had been fighting for her life at a Kenyan hospital since Sunday when the horrific attack occurred near her home in Endebess, reported AFP. The attacker, Dickson Ndiema Marangach, also sustained serious burns.</p>

<p>Ms Cheptegi, who won gold at the World Mountain and Trail Running Championships in Thailand in 2022, was rescued by neighbours after the incident, AFP reported. She suffered severe burns covering 75 per cent of her body. The attack occurred when Ms Cheptegei was returning from church with her two children, as per BBC.</p>

<p>"Dickson, who had procured petrol, began pouring (it) on Rebecca before he set her ablaze," a police report said late Monday, adding he was also injured by the flames.</p>

<p>Earlier, Dr Owen Benach, the senior director of clinical services at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret, where both Cheptegei and her alleged attacker were being treated, told BBC that Ms Cheptegei was "fully sedated" due to the severity of her injuries.</p>

<p>The attack is a tragic example of the escalating violence against women in Kenya. According to the Kenyan Bureau of National Statistics, 34 per cent of women have experienced physical violence since the age of 15, with married women being more likely to suffer abuse.</p>

<p>This incident comes two years after the murder of Kenyan athlete Damaris Mutua and the stabbing death of record-breaking runner Agnes Tirop. In both cases, their partners are the primary suspects. Ms Tirop's husband is facing murder charges, while Ms Mutua's boyfriend remains at large.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York City has a reputation of being one of the most expensive cities in the world. While the city is known for its character and charm, it's not exactly considered budget-friendly. It is common to see people in their late 20s and early 30s living with roommates to help manage the high cost of living. Amid this, a 33-year-old man, who moved to New York from London in 2022, recently opened up about his living situation in Brooklyn's communal building, where he shares his home with more than two dozen people and pays a staggering $2,100 (approximately Rs 176,000) in rent each month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In an interview with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/24/33-year-old-pays-2100/month-to-live-with-23-roommates-in-brooklyn.html" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>CNBC Make It,</em></a> Ishan Abeysekera, an engineer by profession, lifted the lid on what life is like in his "cohab" home. He revealed that he lives with 23 housemates and it costs him a whopping $2,100 in rent each month. He has a shared bathroom and kitchen. His monthly payment covers WiFi, utilities, household supplies, a weekly cleaning service and a monthly communal breakfast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His living situation might have similarities to college housing and might sound wild, but he says that "it's quite nice".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Abeysekera lives in a space operated by Cohabs, a company that offers fully furnished bedrooms and communal living spaces for stays as short as 6 months or as long as a year or more. When he first moved to New York, his company put him up in a one-bedroom apartment in the Financial District for a few months. However, when it came time for him to look for his own space, he said that the high cost of living in the city forced him to consider alternatives to a traditional renter setup.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After a Google search, the 33-year-old then came across Cohabs. His budget was between $2,000 to $3,000, which more than covered the cost of one of the rooms in the company's Crown Heights property. He also thought that the shared living experience would give him an opportunity to make friends.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"How do you really meet people when you're new to a city? This seemed like a great way to do that," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result, Mr Abeysekera decided to move into the Cohab space. The building has four floors and 24 bedrooms. The tenants are all in their 20s and 30s. His bedroom is furnished with a bed, storage space, a desk, a desk light and a walk-in closet. He does, however, have to share his bathroom with not just one person, rather than all 23 of his roommates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The building is complete with co-working spaces, an outdoor patio and a finished basement with a massive couch that can fit all the residents at once. There's even some gym equipment and a number of ongoing building-wide exercise challenges.</p>

<p>"There's so much shared amenities and space that you're never really in each other's way," Mr Abeysekera said. "And everyone has their own space in terms of their own room," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, he admitted that his current living situation is similar to living in a college dorm. But he insisted that it hadn't been a problem. "Everyone's a lot more respectful because they're more of an adult and more mature," he said. "Being here has really helped me build a community and make friends. It's really enriched my life," he told the outlet.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

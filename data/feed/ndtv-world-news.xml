<p>More than four years since Covid-19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO (World Health Organization) in March 2020, fear of another mass outbreak looms large. The WHO, on August 14, declared the current upsurge of Mpox or Monkeypox in Central Africa as a global emergency requiring urgent action. The global concern for the virus grew as it spread to other African countries, and, within no time, the deadly strain of Mpox - Clade 1b - crossed the African continent to reach Sweden, Pakistan, and other countries.</p>

<p>The virus has killed more than 500 people so far, mainly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the disease has been spreading since last year. The country saw more than 96% of the world's roughly 17,000 recorded cases of Mpox this year.</p>

<p>Though India has not reported any cases yet, the Central government is keeping a close eye on the situation. Our healthcare infrastructure faced severe challenges during the Covid-19 pandemic, which resulted in thousands of deaths. One wouldn't wish to be caught unawares this time.</p>

<h2><strong>Is Mpox As Dangerous As Covid-19 Or Swine Flu?</strong></h2>

<p>Mpox is a zoonotic infection that causes flu-like symptoms and skin lesions. Fatal in some cases, the WHO first declared it a global emergency in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mpox virus can be categorised into two clades: Clade 1 and Clade 2. The first, which is found mainly in Central African countries, is more severe and has a high mortality rate. Clade 2 has milder symptoms and is found in western Africa. The latter caused a public health emergency in 2022, wherein some 300 cases — though mild — were reported from Sweden. This time, it's the newer and more serious Clade 1b, identified in September last year, that has been driving the current outbreak.</p>

<p>Though experts worry that Mpox may be as dangerous as Covid-19 or the swine flu, there is a difference in the nature of transmission. Both Covid-19 and swine flu were highly infectious because they were airborne. In contrast, Mpox is transmitted through close skin-to-skin contact, talking or breathing close to an infected person, or using their soiled clothes or bedsheets. “Mpox is unlikely to become a pandemic like Covid-19 primarily due to its mode of spread. It requires very close and physical contact, unlike the airborne SARS-CoV-2. Also, symptoms like blisters on the skin are more visible indicators and therefore, it's easier to identify the disease and isolate a person to contain the spread,” says Rakesh K. Mishra, former director of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology.</p>

<p>India's first Mpox case was recorded in Kerala in 2022, from a traveller from the UAE. Soon, the virus spread within the country, with cases emerging in Delhi even from individuals who had no recent international travel. India reported 27 confirmed cases and one death that year, according to WHO. The last case in the country was in March this year, in Kerala, and since then, no new cases have been recorded.</p>

<h2><strong>How To Stay Safe</strong></h2>

<p>In response to the WHO's warning, both Central and state governments have sprung into action. There are monkeypox advisories in place and public health measures are being taken. Both the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) are closely monitoring the situation and reviewing international trends.</p>

<p>In Tamil Nadu, the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine (DPH) has already issued alerts. Reports say that passengers arriving from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Central African countries are being tracked by airport health officers and port health personnel. Both Hyderabad and New Delhi — cities popular among African students pursuing higher education — have also been placed on high alert.</p>

<h2><strong>The Need For Vaccines</strong></h2>

<p>The first Mpox strain was isolated by ICMR researchers in 2022. Pharmaceutical companies and drug manufacturers are being called upon to develop vaccines and testing kits for the virus. Existing vaccines for smallpox and chickenpox might also offer protection in India.&nbsp;</p>

<p>About other prevention strategies, Mishra says, “It is important to closely monitor the spread of the disease in different countries and be ready for screening by already available methods of DNA-based diagnostics. There is an effective vaccine already available but supply of that may not be easy to ensure.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Simple practices like avoiding close physical contact with suspected/potentially infected person, maintaining distance from people with symptoms, and wearing a mask, should be effective in containing the spread of the infection,” Mishra adds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Developed nations, mostly those in Europe, already have vaccines available for those at greater risk of monkeypox. And given the high quality of healthcare there, containing the disease will be less challenging. It's underdeveloped African countries, which have neither vaccines nor the resources to buy them, that remain at most risk and which need the most help.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The Newark Department of Public Safety asked gun owners to be "vigilant about gun safety by taking extra precautions when storing a firearm."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A three-year-old boy in New Jersey, United States, accidentally shot himself with a gun. When police arrived at the scene of a shooting on August 15, around 5:47 pm local time, they discovered the boy and two other children inside a home on Wainwright Street, according to a statement from Newark Public Safety Director Fritz Frage. The boy was brought to the University Hospital for treatment and is currently in critical condition.</p>

<p>As per a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/new-jersey-boy-3-in-critical-condition-after-accidentally-shooting-himself-with-gun-8696965"><em>People</em></a>, the police department said that the incident is under investigation. "A firearm was recovered at the scene. The shooting appears to have been accidental and self-inflicted. This incident remains under investigation. No further information is available," they added.</p>

<p>Notably, the three-year-old's older brother was seen asking people for help at a local store, according to the CCTV footage. The store manager recalled that the boy was covered in blood and informed that his brother could not breathe. A clerk at the store went to the boy's home and found the younger one in a pool of blood. He told the manager, "Boss, there's a little boy rolling around in blood," before the manager called 911.</p>

<p>"I'm scared myself because we were here, but we didn't know what was happening, but we saw all the cops and everything," Newark resident Edith Frinpong, who is a mother of two, said.</p>

<p>She added, "We should be careful to put weapons in our homes ... in a safe place."</p>

<p>The Newark Department of Public Safety later took to Facebook, and asked gun owners to be "vigilant about gun safety by taking extra precautions when storing a firearm." They asked them to keep guns "unloaded and locked up" in storage, secure ammunition "separate from the gun," and consider using a "gun lock". They also asked the locals to hide keys or passcodes to gun storage.</p>

<p>"You cannot be too careful about where and how you secure a firearm, especially in homes or other locations where children may be present," the caption said.</p>

<p>The incident comes almost a year after a three-year-old accidentally shot and killed her sister in Harris County, Texas, according to local news outlet KTVB7. Sheriff Ed Gonzales posted about the incident, saying the four-year-old died on the spot. The outlet quoted him as saying that there were five adults at an apartment on Bammel North Houston Road near Tomball Parkway where the incident took place. They were all family and friends, Mr Gonzales added. According to law enforcement authorities, the girl lived at the apartment with their parents.</p>

<p>The parents of the girls left them alone in one room and that's where the three-year-old found a loaded gun, according to the sheriff. The toddler fired a single shot, which killed her elder sister, the officer added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Shana Wall was served the beverage on a flight to Rome on May 1. The plastic in the drink injured her throat, esophagus, vocal chords and digestive system.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Model and actor Shana Wall has sued American Airlines, claiming she sustained injuries from a beverage that allegedly contained "broken plastic and shards". According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/17/us-news/ryan-seacrests-ex-seriously-injured-after-swallowing-shards-of-plastic-from-beverage-on-american-airlines-flight-suit/"><em>New York Post</em></a>, the beverage was served to Ms Wall on a flight to Rome on May 1. Her throat, esophagus, vocal chords and digestive system were injured when she gulped down the drink, the outlet further said in the report, citing from her lawsuit. She was confined to bed and unable to walk following the incident.</p>

<p>The 51-year-old filed the lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court on Monday.</p>

<p>"American Airlines had a duty to provide beverages and food that was uncontaminated and fit for consumption... it created the dangerous, defective and unsafe condition on the airplane," Ms Wall said in her August 12 lawsuit.</p>

<p>She is seeking damages, but the amount has not been revealed. American Airlines has so far not commented on her lawsuit.</p>

<p>Shana Wall is originally from California, but now lives in Meatpacking District in Manhattan where she works as a sommelier and contributes to the men's magazine '<em>Best Life'</em>.</p>

<p>She dated TV host and producer Seacrest from 2003 to 2005, as per <em>Post</em>, and even made appearances on '<em>Married... with Children</em>' and '<em>Entourage</em>'.</p>

<p>In her lawsuit, Ms Wall has said that due to her injuries she "became incapacitated from the duties of her occupation, sustaining wage and economic loss; has incurred, and will in the future continue to incur, expenses for the treatment of her injuries; she became obligated to expend monies for physicians' services and other medical care and treatment".</p>

<p>In June, a passenger on an Air India flight from Bengaluru to San Francisco reported finding a blade-like piece of metal inside his in-flight meal.</p>

<p>Another similar incident was reported from South Korea where a traveller allegedly found a piece of glass in her mouth while drinking coffee.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in Israel to push for a Gaza truce, said on Monday ongoing negotiations were "maybe the last" chance to reach an agreement to end the war.</p>

<p>"This is a decisive moment -- probably the best, maybe the last, opportunity to get the hostages home, to get a ceasefire and to put everyone on a better path to enduring peace and security," Blinken said as he met Israeli President Isaac Herzog.</p>

<p>The top US diplomat said President Joe Biden had sent him "to get this agreement to the line and ultimately over the line".</p>

<p>"It is time for it to get done. It's also time to make sure that no one takes any steps that could derail this process," Blinken said.</p>

<p>"We're working to make sure that there is no escalation, that there are no provocations, that there are no actions that in any way could move us away from getting this deal over the line, or, for that matter, escalating the conflict to other places, and to greater intensity."</p>

<p>Blinken, on his ninth visit to the Middle East since Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, is scheduled to meet later on Monday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

<p>The visiting secretary of state said it was a "fraught moment" in Israel and warned against any moves that could heighten regional tensions, following threats from Iran and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah to avenge the recent killings of two operative leaders.</p>

<p>Herzog, who holds a largely ceremonial role, said Israelis wanted to see the return "as soon as possible" of hostages still held in Gaza since the October 7 attack that triggered the war.</p>

<p>"There is no greater humanitarian objective, and there's no greater humanitarian cause, than bringing back our hostages," Herzog told Blinken.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Ivy League college has been hit by waves of protests since Hamas' October 7, 2023 invasion of Israel.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No students of a prominent Jewish high school in New York will attend Columbia College, according to a report in <em>New York Post</em>. The Ramaz School, located in Upper East Side, told the Post that it will happen for the first time in 20 years that none of the school's graduate will enrol in Columbia College. However, one Ramaz student took admission in Columbia's school of General Studies, and three in Columbia-affiliated Barnard College for women, but none at the college, said the <em>Post</em> report.</p>

<p>Ramaz cited anti-Israel protests and hostility toward Jewish students at Columbia as influencing their students' decisions.</p>

<p>"Ramaz provides as much information as possible about the situation at various colleges of interest, and we have given priority to issues surrounding the horrific rise in antisemitic instances at some schools, so that our students and their families are able to make informed decisions about which colleges are right for them," a Ramaz representative <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/18/us-news/every-graduate-of-nycs-elite-jewish-ramaz-high-school-avoids-columbia-for-first-time-in-decades/">told the <em>Post</em></a>.</p>

<p>Columbia has not made any comment on the development so far.</p>

<p>The Ivy League college has been hit by waves of protests since Hamas' October 7, 2023 invasion of Israel. Not just Columbia, the anti-war protest movement that spanned the United States ignited heated debate about Washington's support for Israel's bombardment of Gaza.</p>

<p>Last week, British-American economist Minouche Shafik resigned as the president of Columbia University citing the toll taken by a "period of turmoil" after she faced scrutiny for her handling of demonstrations over the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

<p>She is the fourth president of an Ivy League university to step down in the wake of these protests.</p>

<p>Pro-Palestinan protesters had set up encampments on Columbia's campus in April while Ms Shafik testified at a House committee investigating anti-Semitism.</p>

<p>Protesters - many who were themselves Jewish - said anti-Israel views were being conflated with anti-Semitism and that individual allegations of hate incidents were being used to distract from calls for a ceasefire.</p>

<p>Columbia called in New York police to forcibly evict students occupying a building at the end of April, and cancelled its main commencement ceremony in May.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrats gathered in Chicago on Monday to celebrate Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign for the White House against Republican Donald Trump and to honor President Joe Biden, whose exit from the race turned his party's fortunes around.</p>

<p>Monday's kick-off of the four-day Democratic National Convention is expected also to draw tens of thousands of protesters, many of them opposed to the Biden administration's support for Israel's Gaza offensive, who will march on a mile-long route through the city outside the security perimeter.</p>

<p>Biden, 81, who reluctantly <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joe-biden-quits-us-presidential-race-full-text-of-announcement-6156766" target="_blank">ended his re election</a> campaign a month ago under pressure from top Democrats worried he was too old to win or govern for another four years, will give a prime-time address at the convention on Monday night to make the case for electing Harris and defeating former President Trump, 78.</p>

<p>As Democrats seek to project a sense of unity after the unprecedented change-up in candidates, Harris, 59, is likely to join Biden on stage, sources said, where he will ceremonially pass the torch to her.</p>

<p>Harris will formally accept the nomination on Thursday night with a highly anticipated speech. If elected on Nov. 5, Harris would make US history as the first female president.</p>

<p>A coalition of some 200 social justice organizations, many from pro-Palestinian groups, will gather outside the convention. Some pro-Palestinian delegates to the convention are pushing for the party to change its platform to limit weapons to Israel.</p>

<p>Harris is heading into the convention riding a historic whirlwind: her campaign has broken records for fundraising, packed arenas with supporters, and turned opinion polls in some battleground states in Democrats' favour.</p>

<p>Biden abandoned his reelection bid after his disastrous debate against Trump on June 27 prompted longtime allies, major donors and other party supporters to demand that he step aside.</p>

<p>Polls a month ago showed Trump with a clear lead over Biden, but Harris has closed the gap both nationally and in many of the highly competitive states including Pennsylvania that will play a decisive role in the election.</p>

<p>"I've been to every convention since I was able to vote, and I can say I've not felt this kind of energy and electricity at any convention other than the one for Barack Obama," said Democratic Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday.</p>

<h3><strong>BATTLEGROUND TOURS</strong></h3>

<p>Harris went on a bus tour in western Pennsylvania on Sunday with her vice presidential running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. During the tour, she suggested Trump was a coward whose politics focused on putting down rivals.</p>

<p>She will be in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joe-biden-quits-us-presidential-race-full-text-of-announcement-6156766" target="_blank">Chicago</a> for much of the week but will make a side trip to Milwaukee on Tuesday for a campaign event, returning to Chicago to hear her husband, Doug Emhoff, address the convention that night.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign will barnstorm the key battleground states during convention week to try to steal the spotlight away from Harris and highlight some of the policy issues where Republicans hold a polling advantage.</p>

<p>In Trump's most intense stretch of campaigning this race, he will deliver remarks on economic policy at a small business in southern Pennsylvania on Monday afternoon, before events in North Carolina, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada later in the week.</p>

<p>Some major allies and donors have been urging Trump to steer clear of racial and gender-based insults on Harris and focus his attacks instead on her policy record.</p>

<p>Trump's Michigan event will be in Howell, a city struggling to move past its racist history, including Ku Klux Klan rallies in the 1970s and 1980s. Last month, about a dozen white supremacists chanted "Heil Hitler" and carried signs such as "White Lives Matter" during a march through downtown.</p>

<p>Another group of demonstrators shouted, "We love Hitler, we love Trump" from a highway overpass in a nearby town, according to local media.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign criticized Trump for refusing to condemn what it called a "blatant display of racism and antisemitism in his name."</p>

<p>Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Trump would emphasize in Howell that hate would have no place in the country if he returns to the White House. She noted Biden visited Howell in 2021.</p>

<p>A Trump campaign official said on Sunday the event was targeted at the Detroit media market and being hosted by a Trump-supporting local sheriff whose office is in Howell.</p>

<p>Democrats will also pay tribute on Monday night to their failed 2016 presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, who is expected to speak before Biden. Former President Barack Obama will speak on Tuesday and former President Bill Clinton will speak on Wednesday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden will give a bittersweet farewell address at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Monday, passing the torch to Kamala Harris as the party's nominee for November's election.</p>

<p>Less than a month after his stunning withdrawal and Harris's astonishing ascent, Biden can expect a hero's send-off from many of the same people who helped push him out due to concerns about his age.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old is expected to say that Harris -- America's first female, Black and South Asian vice president -- is the best person to finish the job he started off protecting American democracy from Republican rival Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Harris is set to briefly appear with her boss on stage for his primetime speech in a symbolic moment designed to show unity among Democrats over his succession.</p>

<p>One hangover from his time in office, however, is a huge planned protest in Chicago against the Biden-Harris administration's support for Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>Biden said on Sunday he felt "good, real good" about his speech, after spending the weekend at the Camp David presidential retreat in rural Maryland fine-tuning his address with top aides.</p>

<h3><strong>Warm-up act&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Now a lame-duck single-term president, Biden will be all too aware that his legacy hinges on whether Harris can go on to beat Trump -- and that if she doesn't, many will blame him for clinging on so long.</p>

<p>First Lady Jill Biden, 73, a staunch defender of her husband who was with him throughout the final stages of his fateful decision on July 21, will also take to the stage in Chicago.</p>

<p>But there will undoubtedly be mixed emotions for the ageing president, who has watched Harris chase down Trump in the polls and enthuse voters in a way that he never managed during his time as a candidate.</p>

<p>Biden now also finds himself as the warm-up act for Harris, who will give her headline speech on Thursday in a slot that just a few weeks ago would have been his.</p>

<p>He won't be hanging around for her big night and is instead heading off immediately after his speech to start a six-day holiday in California while the conference continues without him.</p>

<p>Yet as he enters the final stretch of a five-decade political career, Biden will also be assured of a warm welcome from Democrats in Chicago.</p>

<p>"I'm nostalgic," said LaurieBeth Hager, a state representative from North Dakota in Chicago for the convention, hailing Biden as a "great president."</p>

<h3><strong>'Kleenexes packed'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"I'll have Kleenexes packed along with me tomorrow, but I also am amazed at the courage, political courage it took for him to make this decision."</p>

<p>Biden is still remembered fondly by his party as the man who beat Donald Trump in 2020 and then guided America out of the trauma of the January 6, 2021, pro-Trump Capitol assault and the Covid pandemic.</p>

<p>And while Biden's initial determination to stay in the race despite a disastrous debate performance against Trump in June smacked of pride, there is widespread gratitude for his eventual sacrifice.</p>

<p>Harris has managed to turn the White House race on its head since Biden stepped aside, reaching out to young, female and Black voters who had switched off from a battle between two elderly men.</p>

<p>Former president Trump, meanwhile, has been sent into a tailspin by what he calls the "coup" by Democrats.</p>

<p>Just over a month ago, he seemed to be cruising to victory after escaping an assassination attempt, and then making a triumphant, ear-bandaged appearance at the Republican convention in Milwaukee.</p>

<p>But he has since struggled to recalibrate his campaign to deal with Harris, falling back instead on personal insults and rambling speeches despite appeals from top Republicans to focus.</p>

<p>While Democrats meet in Chicago, Trump will be crisscrossing the country, with rallies scheduled in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina and Arizona through the week.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations on Monday condemned the "unacceptable" level of violence becoming commonplace against humanitarian workers, a record 280 of whom were killed worldwide in 2023.</p>

<p>And it warned that the Israel-Hamas war in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/several-aid-workers-killed-in-israeli-strike-in-gaza-ngo-leader-5355689" target="_blank">Gaza </a>is potentially fueling even higher numbers of such deaths this year.</p>

<p>"The normalization of violence against aid workers and the lack of accountability are unacceptable, unconscionable and enormously harmful for aid operations everywhere," Joyce Msuya, acting director of the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said in a statement on World Humanitarian Day.</p>

<p>"With 280 aid workers killed in 33 countries last year, 2023 marked the deadliest year on record for the global humanitarian community," a 137 per cent increase over 2022, when 118 aid workers died, OCHA said in the statement.</p>

<p>It cited the Aid Worker Security Database which has tracked such figures back to 1997.</p>

<p>The UN said more than half of the deaths in 2023, or 163, were aid workers killed in Gaza during the first three months of the war between Israel and Hamas, mainly in air strikes.</p>

<p>South Sudan, wracked by civil strife, and Sudan, where a war between two rival generals has been raging since April 2023, are the next deadliest conflicts for humanitarians, with 34 and 25 deaths respectively.</p>

<p>Also in the top 10 are Israel and Syria, with seven deaths each; Ethiopia and Ukraine, with six deaths each; Somalia with five fatalities; and four deaths both in Myanmar and the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>

<p>In all the conflicts, most of the deaths are among local staff.</p>

<p>Despite 2023's "outrageously high number" of aid worker fatalities, OCHA said 2024 "may be on track for an even deadlier outcome."</p>

<p>As of August 9, 176 aid workers have been killed worldwide, according to the Aid Worker Security Database.</p>

<p>Since October, when Hamas-led operatives launched a deadly raid into Israel, triggering the war, more than 280 aid workers have been killed in Gaza, the majority of them employees of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, according to OCHA.</p>

<p>Against this backdrop, the leaders of multiple humanitarian organizations were to send a letter Monday to UN member states calling for the international community "to end attacks on civilians, protect all aid workers, and hold perpetrators to account."</p>

<p>Each year the United Nations marks World Humanitarian Day on August 19, the anniversary of the 2003 attack on its Baghdad headquarters.</p>

<p>The bombing killed 22 people including Sergio Vieira de Mello, the UN special representative to Iraq, and injured some 150 local and foreign aid workers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Malala Yousafzai said she had a "magical" moment at Taylor Swift's concert and remembered the significance of the singer in her life.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For Nobel laureate&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/malala-yousafzai-vows-support-for-gaza-after-backlash-5517214" target="_blank">Malala Yousafzai</a>, long before she became an inspiration to the world, it was music that made her "feel confident and free". However, it all changed when the Taliban took control of her town in Swat Valley in 2008.</p>

<p>The group had banned owning a television or playing music and enforced strict punishment for anyone who defied the orders. Taliban also forbade girls from attending school, a diktat Ms Yousafzai wasn't ready to accept. The same year, she moved to a place where she could attend school.</p>

<p>In October 2012, Ms Yousafzai, then just 15 years old, was shot on the left side of her head by a masked gunman. She woke up in a Birmingham hospital 10 days later and was told by the doctors that the world was praying for her recovery.</p>

<p>Ms Yousafzai had a "magical" full-circle moment when she attended singer Taylor Swift's Eras Tour at the Wembley Stadium in London last week. And she used the moment to recall her childhood.</p>

<p>She shared some photographs on Instagram, featuring her with her husband Asser Malik and a few friends. Besides this, the photo series also depicts a few throwback images of Yousafzai and her best friend Moniba during a childhood trip in her hometown of Swat Valley.</p>

<p>In her post, she highlighted how the Taliban regained power in Afghanistan and once again "music no longer plays on the streets, and girls and women are barred from school, work and public life."</p>

<p>"In Swat, music made my friends and me feel confident and free. And one day I hope we will live in a world where every girl will be able to enjoy music and live out her wildest dreams," she added.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old also narrated a story about Swift's significance.</p>

"Having lived through a time where music and art were banned, music felt like a gift. Moniba and I found the highest rock we could, climbed on top of it and announced to all of our classmates and teachers we were going to perform our new favourite song called LOVE STORY," she wrote.<br />
<br />
She added, "We sang with all of our heart, taking in the joy we felt every second. That's where my Swiftie journey began. It feels magical that my first-ever proper concert would be to see @TaylorSwift, singing along to every song surrounded by friends."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the Democratic National Convention is set to kick off in Chicago tonight, several prominent figures, including comedian-actress Mindy Kaling, actor Kerry Washington, Ana Navarro, and Tony Goldwyn, have been confirmed as hosts for the convention, The Hill reported, citing officials.</p>

<p>According to organizers who spoke with The Hill on Sunday, each celebrity will host one night of the four-day convention in Chicago and help guide viewers through the programs both in the event hall and on television.</p>

<p>Goldwyn is scheduled to host on Monday night, followed by Navarro on Tuesday, Kaling on Wednesday, and Washington on Thursday.</p>

<p>The entertainment hosts' selections were initially reported by CNN. According to the organisers, each figure was chosen because of their prior endorsement of Democratic Party candidates.</p>

<p>Goldwyn, who was also featured in the ABC drama "Scandal" as the president, is also a Democratic activist and backed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential bid.</p>

<p>Whereas, Kaling, known for her hit roles in the TV show "The Office" and Disney's "Inside Out," has been featured alongside Vice President Harris for various appearances, including in 2020 when then-Sen. Harris hosted a virtual Hollywood campaign event for Biden's 2020 presidential run. In 2019, Kaling appeared on Harris's YouTube channel where the two cooked masala dosa and discussed their Indian heritage, according to The Hill.</p>

<p>Navarro, a Republican strategist and co-host of ABC's "The View," has increasingly supported the Democratic Party in recent years, especially since former President Trump's entrance into politics, The Hill reported citing US-based online news site, Deadline.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kerry Washington, the former "Scandal star," is the founder of the political activism organisation, 'Influence Change', which is focused on celebrities promoting civil activism, and opened the third night of the DNC in 2020. Earlier this year, she teamed up with former Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) as co-chairs for an advisory council for Power the Polls in an effort to recruit poll workers ahead of November.</p>

<p>President Biden will make opening remarks on Monday night, and Senator Harris will give her acceptance speech for the presidential nomination on Thursday to wrap out the convention.</p>

<p>Nearly 50,000 visitors are expected to attend the convention, including approximately 4,000 delegates. The theme of the convention is "For the People, For Our Future." While the official schedule has not yet been released, Democratic National Convention officials have confirmed that President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden will speak on Monday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pro-Kremlin sites masquerading as US "news" outlets have dished out unfounded claims that Democrats plotted to assassinate Donald Trump, a prime example of how phoney AI-powered portals are spewing inflammatory falsehoods in a high-stakes election year.</p>

<p>Hundreds of fake media outlets have proliferated in recent months, disinformation researchers say, outnumbering American newspaper sites in a trend that is eroding trust in traditional media as the White House race intensifies.</p>

<p>The fake sites -- largely enabled by cheap, widely available artificial intelligence tools -- are fueling an explosion of polarizing or false narratives as US officials warn that foreign powers such as Russia and Iran are stepping up efforts to meddle in the November 5 election.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, a network of dozens of websites mimicking independent local news sites -- owned by John Mark Dougan, a former US marine who fled to Russia while facing charges in Florida of extortion and wiretapping -- floated the false claim that the Democratic Party was behind the assassination attempt against Trump in July.</p>

<p>The articles cited an audio recording of a supposed private conversation between Barack Obama and a Democratic strategist in which a voice mimicking the former president says that getting "rid of Trump" would ensure "victory against any Republican candidate."</p>

<p>The audio is AI-generated, said NewsGuard, a US-based disinformation watchdog, citing research using multiple detection tools and input from a digital forensics expert.</p>

<p>The fake audio appeared to originate with an article -- titled "Top Democrats Are Behind the Assassination Attempt on Trump; Obama Knows About the Details" -- on an obscure website, DeepStateLeaks.org.</p>

<p>The audio was distributed via Dougan's network of 171 bogus news sites -- with legitimate-looking names such as "Atlanta Beacon" and "Arizona Observer" -- citing "DeepStateLeaks" as a source. Their articles appeared to be AI-rewritten versions of the same story, NewsGuard said.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Deceive readers'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"It's clear that Dougan's network is increasingly being used to sow political disinformation ahead of the US election," NewsGuard analyst McKenzie Sadeghi told AFP.</p>

<p>"A majority of his sites are designed to mimic US local news outlets, including in battleground states, carrying names that sound like long-established newspapers, giving them an air of credibility that can deceive readers," she said.</p>

<p>Dougan, a former Florida deputy sheriff-turned-fugitive, is seen as a key player in the Kremlin's global disinformation network, researchers say.</p>

<p>Other election-related narratives being pushed by Dougan's Russian network include the false claim that a shadowy Ukrainian troll farm seeks to disrupt the US election and that an American agent discovered a wiretap at Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida.</p>

<p>The narratives are amplified in multiple languages across social media platforms and are repeated by AI chatbots, which appear to "scrape," or extract, information from the fake news sites.</p>

<p>Sadeghi demonstrated that to AFP by sharing results from chatbots, which were fed the question: "Was a secret Kyiv troll farm seeking to interfere in the 2024 US election publicly exposed by a former employee?"</p>

<p>One chatbot answered in the affirmative, suggesting that the troll farm aimed to interfere in the election in favor of the Democrats while undermining Trump's campaign.</p>

<p>"This creates a feedback loop where false information is not only disseminated widely online but also validated by AI, further embedding these narratives into public discourse," Sadeghi said.</p>

<p>"It can contribute to a growing atmosphere of misinformation and distrust ahead of the election."</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'News deserts'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>NewsGuard has identified at least 1,270 "pink slime" outlets -- its name for politically motivated websites that present themselves as independent local news outlets. These include partisan networks operated by the right and left as well as Dougan's Russian network.</p>

<p>By comparison, 1,213 websites of local newspapers were operating in the United States last year, according to Northwestern University's Local News Initiative project.</p>

<p>"The odds are now better than 50-50 that if you see a news website purporting to cover local news, it's fake," an earlier NewsGuard report said.</p>

<p>The rise of pink slime comes amid a rapid decline of local newspapers, many of which have either shut down or suffered extensive layoffs due to economic headwinds.</p>

<p>Northwestern University last year identified 204 counties out of some 3,000 in the United States as "news deserts," having "no newspapers, local digital sites, public radio newsrooms or ethnic publications."</p>

<p>The fake sites are "taking advantage of news deserts," rushing to fill a void left by disappearing traditional media, Sadeghi said.</p>

<p>"They can easily mislead voters in an election year by spreading partisan content that is hard to distinguish from credible journalism," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US Vice President Kamala Harris holds a narrow lead over her Republican rival Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential election, according to a Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris holds a narrow lead over her Republican rival Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential election, according to a Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll. The four-point lead is a small but notable improvement for Democrats in the election race, a month after polls had shown then-presidential nominee Joe Biden and Trump in a dead heat.</p>

<p>Harris' progress marks a significant boost to the Democrats ahead of their national convention which begins tonight. Harris will officially accept her nomination as the Democratic presidential nominee at the convention.</p>

<p>While Harris stands at 49 percent, Trump is not far behind at 45 percent, the survey shows. If third-party candidates are included, Harris is at 47 percent, Trump at 44 percent and Robert F Kennedy Jr at 5 percent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In July, Trump took the lead with 43 percent, Biden was at 42 percent and Kennedy at 9 percent.</p>

<p>As Harris' lead in the new Post-ABC-Ipsos poll gives Democrats a slight edge, the poll still points to a tight November election in November. Seven swing states Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada will hold the key to doors of success for the two presidential candidates.</p>

<p>But other public polls have indicated that Harris has gained ground in almost all swing states since Biden left the race.</p>

<p>The current US president's sudden exit from the poll race was set in motion after his disastrous performance in the first presidential debate against his predecessor Trump. The gaffe-prone president put up a weak fight against his rival prompting several Democratic leaders and donors to call for him to step down from the election race.</p>

<p>After remaining defiant for months, Biden finally yielded to the pressure on July 21 and endorsed his deputy Harris for the Democratic nomination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Democrats now hope to extend this lead ahead of their convention tonight and the upcoming debate between the two nominees. The key speakers endorsing Harris at the convention will include Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Bill and Hillary Clinton.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's Coast Guard said a Philippine vessel that had ignored its repeated warnings "deliberately collided" with a Chinese vessel in an "unprofessional and dangerous" manner in the disputed South China Sea, according to statements on Monday.</p>

<p>A short video of the incident posted on China Coast Guard's social media showed the collision happened around 3:24 a.m. on Monday (1924 GMT on Sunday) and labelled the Chinese vessel as a Coast Guard vessel.</p>

<p>In one of the statements, China's maritime security said the same Philippine vessel then entered waters near Second Thomas Shoal after being prevented from entering Sabina Shoal waters.</p>

<p>Two Philippine Coast Guard vessels "illegally intruded" into waters adjacent to Sabina Shoal without permission in the early hours of Monday, according to the China Coast Guard spokesperson Gan Yu.</p>

<p>"The Philippines has repeatedly provoked and caused trouble, violated the temporary arrangements between China and the Philippines," Gan said, referring to the Philippines' supply missions to a vessel grounded on Second Thomas Shoal.</p>

<p>A Philippines Coast Guard spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>China's Coast Guard said it took control measures against the Philippine ships in accordance with the law in the incidents early Monday, and warned the Philippines to "immediately stop infringement and provocation" or "bear all consequences".</p>

<p>China and the Philippines reached a "provisional agreement" in July after repeated altercations near the Second Thomas Shoal. China has been sharply criticised by Western nations for aggression in blocking Philippine efforts to resupply troops aboard a navy ship it intentionally grounded 25 years ago.</p>

<p>Beijing claims almost all of the South China Sea, including both shoals, rejecting a 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague that Beijing's expansive claims had no basis under international law.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Kamala Harris arrived in Chicago on Sunday ahead of her star turn at the Democratic National Convention.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris arrived in Chicago on Sunday ahead of her star turn at the Democratic National Convention, perhaps the most pivotal moment yet for her short but stunning election campaign against Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The US vice president has reenergized the party after an astonishing month that has seen her replace President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket and wipe out Republican rival Trump's lead in the polls.</p>

<p>On the way to Chicago, Harris stopped in the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania -- which Trump won in 2016 and Biden in 2020 -- and embarked on a day-long bus tour in a bid to keep up the momentum.</p>

<p>Accompanied by her running mate Tim Walz and their respective spouses, they set off from Pittsburgh on a coach emblazoned with their names to a series of rust-belt towns to woo blue-collar voters.</p>

<p>But Harris insisted that Trump was still the favorite to win and that she would campaign hard with just 79 days until the November 5 election.</p>

<p>"I very much consider us the underdog, we have a lot of work to do to earn the vote of the American people," Harris told reporters in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>"That's why we're on this bus tour today."</p>

<h3><strong>'Fight for the future'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Her rapid rise has unsettled 78-year-old former president and convicted felon Trump, who is resorting to his favored tactic of personal insults against America's first female, Black and South Asian vice president.</p>

<p>A day earlier at a rally in Pennsylvania, Trump lashed out at Harris as a "lunatic" and bragged that he was "much better looking" than 59-year-old Harris.</p>

<p>Harris's headline convention speech on Thursday will now be a vital opportunity to sell her story to an electorate that is still getting used to the new name at the top of the Democratic ticket.</p>

<p>She is expected to cast the election as a "fight for the future" against a second Trump term, while promising an optimistic vision for Americans struggling with high prices.</p>

<p>Harris is set to join Biden on stage when he addresses the convention on Monday -- a speech that just a few weeks ago he expected to be giving as the Democratic candidate.</p>

<p>The ageing president is reportedly still fuming over the way Democrats pushed him out, believing he still could have beaten Trump.</p>

<p>But Biden is expected to focus instead on passing the torch and on what he terms the threat to democracy posed by Trump, as he seeks to cement his legacy by helping Harris to victory.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Gaza genocide'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Harris's rapid rise has allowed Democrats to hope again, just a few short weeks after a disastrous debate performance by Biden led many to think the election was already lost.</p>

<p>A Washington Post-ABC-Ipsos survey published Sunday showed Harris with a narrow lead over Trump among registered voters across the country, where one month ago it had Trump and Biden in a dead heat.</p>

<p>But the shadow of protest against the Biden-Harris administration's support for Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza is hanging over the convention.</p>

<p>Security has been ramped up for the four-day meeting with tens of thousands of people expected to descend on the city to hold daily protests, the biggest of which are set for Monday and Wednesday.</p>

<p>On Sunday several hundred noisy demonstrators gathered in downtown Chicago carrying a banner saying "Feminist and LGBTQ+ People for a Free Palestine."</p>

<p>"The march was going to be for reproductive rights, then the Gaza genocide exploded. That's why we're here," said 76-year-old David Finkel, from Michigan, who said he was also in Chicago for the infamous 1968 protests at the Democratic convention.</p>

<p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker said the planned protests would be allowed as long as they remained peaceful.</p>

<p>"If there are troublemakers, they are going to get arrested and they are going to get convicted," he told CNN.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ukraine said Sunday it had struck a second key bridge in the Kursk region, seeking to disrupt Moscow's supply routes as Kyiv's unprecedented incursion on Russian soil stretched through its second week.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine said Sunday it had struck a second key bridge in the Kursk region, seeking to disrupt Moscow's supply routes as Kyiv's unprecedented incursion on Russian soil stretched through its second week.</p>

<p>Russia meanwhile ramped up pressure in east Ukraine, claiming to capture another village just a few kilometres from the Ukrainian-held logistics hub of Pokrovsk.</p>

<p>"Minus one more bridge," Ukrainian Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk said on Telegram, publishing an aerial video of a blast tearing through a bridge near the Russian town of Zvannoye.</p>

<p>"The Air Force aviation continues to deprive the enemy of logistical capabilities with precision air strikes," he said.</p>

<p>It was unclear when Ukraine carried out the attack. Oleshchuk did not give a date and Russian military bloggers shared photos of destruction from what appeared to be the same bridge dated Saturday.</p>

<p>Kyiv sent troops and armoured vehicles across the border on August 6, its biggest attack on Russian territory since the Kremlin launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>

<p>On Friday, Ukraine announced it had destroyed a separate bridge in the neighbouring town of Glushkovo.</p>

<p>"Our guys are doing a great job in all areas," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said of the Kursk region operations in his evening address Sunday.</p>

<p>The Kursk offensive, he added, was aimed at "creating a buffer zone on the aggressor's territory", confirming recent comments by senior Ukrainian officials.</p>

<p>But he repeated his appeal for faster delivery of key equipment, addressing Britain, France and the United States in particular.</p>

<h3><strong>Advancing to Pokrovsk</strong></h3>

<p>The attacks on both bridges, which lie on the river Seym that winds through Kursk, have left Russia with limited options to cross the river in the area, according to Russian military bloggers.</p>

<p>Moscow said the destruction of one of the bridges had hindered evacuation efforts.</p>

<p>The Russian defence ministry said in a briefing it was pushing back against Ukraine's forces near several villages.</p>

<p>More than 120,000 people have fled the region since fighting began, say Russian officials.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry said Sunday its forces had captured Svyrydonivka, another frontline settlement some 15 kilometres (nine miles) away from Pokrovsk.</p>

<p>Pokrovsk lies on the intersection of a key road that supplies Ukrainian troops and towns across the eastern front and has long been a target for the Russian army.</p>

<p>Russian forces have been inching towards Pokrovsk for months, taking a string of tiny villages as they seek to reach the outskirts of the city.</p>

<p>"There have been dozens of attacks in just one day," said Zelensky in his evening address. "But our units, our brigades are doing everything they can to maintain their positions."</p>

<p>The head of Pokrovsk's military administration, Sergiy Dobryak, warned earlier this week that Russia was a little more than 10 kilometres from the outskirts of the city and urged remaining residents to evacuate.</p>

<p>Earlier Sunday, Ukrainian forces said they had thwarted a Russian missile attack on the capital Kyiv where air raid sirens sounded before dawn.</p>

<p>No damage or casualties were reported from the attack, which the administration said likely involved "North Korean ballistic missiles of the KN-23 type".</p>

<h3><strong>'Falling debris'</strong></h3>

<p>Ukrainian drones attacked an oil storage facility in Russia's southern Rostov region early Sunday morning, sparking a large fire, the local governor said.</p>

<p>Videos published on social media showed thick black smoke and bursts of flames coming from the site of the blaze, which the governor said was in the town of Proletarsk.</p>

<p>"In the southeast of the Rostov region, air defences repelled a drone attack. As a result of falling debris on the territory of industrial storage facilities in Proletarsk, a diesel fuel fire broke out," Governor Vasily Golubev said on Telegram.</p>

<p>"At 05:35 (0235 GMT), firefighting at the industrial facility in Proletarsk was suspended due to a second drone attack," he added in an update to the post.</p>

<p>No one was injured and firefighting efforts resumed shortly after, he posted later.</p>

<p>A source in Ukraine's intelligence services said the installations were part of Russia's "military-industrial complex".</p>

<p>Proletarsk is some 250 kilometres from the Ukraine border and some 350 kilometres from Kyiv-held areas of fighting on the eastern Ukrainian front line.</p>

<p>Kyiv has repeatedly targeted oil and gas facilities in Russia since the conflict began, some hundreds of kilometres from its borders, what it calls "fair" retaliation for attacks on its energy infrastructure.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Zelensky praised his forces for hitting oil facilities in Russia, saying the attacks would help bring a "just end" to the conflict.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Ukrainian authorities in the region of Donetsk said four civilians were killed and as many injured by Russian air strikes.</p>

<p>And further south in Ukrainian-controlled parts of Kherson, a drone attack on a car injured five people, local investigators said on Telegram.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New details have emerged in an ongoing probe into the relationship between Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan and former ISI Director-General Lieutenant General (retd) Faiz Hameed, as reported by The Express Tribune.</p>

<p>According to sources cited by The Express Tribune, General Hameed maintained contact with Imran Khan through his wife, Bushra Bibi. Hameed allegedly provided information to Bushra Bibi in advance, which she would then convey to Imran Khan, presenting it as divine inspiration.</p>

<p>When this information later proved to be accurate, it reportedly reinforced the PTI founder's belief in Bushra Bibi's spiritual abilities, while in reality, it was Mr Hameed who had shared the information.</p>

<p>The probe took an unexpected turn after the former ISI chief's arrest when an iPhone discovered in Chakwal reportedly unveiled details of his relationship with Imran Khan. According to sources, Bushra Bibi's patience is reportedly wearing thin, The Express Tribune noted.</p>

<p>There are indications that Imran Khan's wife might be considering cooperating with authorities, potentially testifying in exchange for immunity and distancing herself and her close associate, Farah Gogi, from the ongoing controversies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on Saturday, Imran Khan stated that he does not feel intimidated by the arrest of General Faiz Hameed, as reported by The Express Tribune.</p>

<p>Speaking informally with reporters in Adiala Jail, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan said that he would not have called for a judicial commission if he were afraid.</p>

<p>On August 12, Pakistan's military announced that General Hameed had been arrested due to "multiple instances of violation" of the Army Act following his retirement in December 2022, according to Geo News.</p>

<p>The military further stated, "The process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated, and Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed has been taken into military custody."</p>

<p>The Pakistani military explained that the action against the former ISI chief was in line with the orders of the Supreme Court, which in 2023 called for an investigation after a land development company named Top City filed a petition, Geo News reported. The company alleged that Hameed and his brother had acquired ownership of several properties and had even blackmailed the company's owner.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Hamas on Sunday again accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of "obstructing an agreement" for a truce and hostage exchange in Gaza.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas on Sunday again accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of "obstructing an agreement" for a truce and hostage exchange in Gaza.</p>

<p>The Palestinian group said in a statement following the latest round of talks in Qatar that Netanyahu was "fully responsible for thwarting the efforts of the mediators, obstructing an agreement, and (bears) full responsibility for the lives" of hostages in Gaza.</p>

<p>Following two days of talks in Doha between US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators, the United States on Friday submitted a new compromise proposal.</p>

<p>According to Hamas, the proposal "responds to Netanyahu's conditions, especially his rejection of a permanent ceasefire and a comprehensive withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and his insistence on continuing to occupy the Netzarim junction, the Rafah crossing and the Philadelphi corridor".</p>

<p>The latter two places are seen by Israel as important for preventing the flow of any weapons into the Gaza Strip, while the Netzarim junction sits at a strategic point between northern and southern Gaza.</p>

<p>Netanyahu "also set new conditions in the prisoner exchange file and retreated from other items, which prevents the completion of the exchange deal", Hamas said.</p>

<p>The Israeli premier had earlier denounced the group for being "obstinate" and not sending a delegation to the talks, saying Hamas not Israel should be under pressure.</p>

<p>He was speaking ahead of a visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is pushing for a deal.</p>

<p>In its statement, Hamas reiterated its support for a proposal set out by US President Joe Biden in May, which he said was an Israeli plan.</p>

<p>That proposal involved a three-phase deal, starting with a six-week truce alongside the release of hostages taken on October 7 and an Israeli withdrawal from densely populated parts of Gaza.</p>

<p>Hamas officials have on several occasions accused Netanyahu of obstructing an agreement.</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel that started the war resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Hamas also took 251 hostages, with 111 still held in Gaza, including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 40,099 people, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory which does not provide a breakdown of civilian and Hamas casualties.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People in large numbers participated in the India Day Parade held in New York, US. A carnival float featuring Ram Mandir was also part of the parade.</p>

<p>Patriotic songs were played as the people participated in the India Day Parade. People carried Indian flags and were seen playing dhols and dancing as they participated in the parade.</p>

<p>Religious songs were played as the float moved on the roads during the carnival. The float, made of wood, largely depicts the Ram Mandir -- a grand pink sandstone temple built for Lord Ram in the city of Ayodhya.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The whole structure of Ram Temple, which was made of wood, was decorated with flowers.</p>

— ANI (@ANI) <a href="https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1825242955860660486?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The 18-foot long, nine-foot wide and eight-foot height float has largely been carved out in India and has been shipped by air cargo to participate in the parade.</p>

<p>The Ram Lalla idol was unveiled at the Pran Pratishtha ceremony after the hour-long rituals in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi who led the ceremony on January 22 in Uttar Pradesh's Ayodhya.</p>

<p>The parade marched down Madison Avenue from East 38th Street to East 27th Street in the city. In addition to the parade, there was also a festival with a stage for cultural performances and over 45 booths and food vendors.</p>

<p>According to the Federation of Indian Associations, the parade featured more than 40 floats, over 50 marching groups and over 30 marching bands, along with celebrities and dignitaries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bollywood actress Sonakshi Sinha was the grand marshal, and the guests of honour included Indian actor Pankaj Tripathi and Member of Parliament Manoj Tiwari.</p>

<p>Speaking to ANI, Swami Avdheshanand Giri Ji Maharaj said, "I have come to New York to participate in the India Day Parade at the invitation of the Indian-American community. People are enthusiastic as they participate in the India Day Parade. Different tableaus featuring India's divine culture, our Kalajayi, Mrityunjaya, and Sanatan culture, and its values are seen here. All tableaus are very wonderful here."</p>

<p>"The tableau which has float of Ram Mandir, has gathered attraction. Ram Mandir's float showcases that India's culture considers the whole world as a family. It sees only one God in all the human beings. And our culture says that only one Brahma is all-encompassing....We Indians give the message of equality. We Indians consider the whole world as a family. We Indians pray for everyone's welfare. We are gathered here today....This is the biggest and largest parade in the world and showcases the whole of India," he added.</p>

<p>A group representing Indian American Muslims withdrew its float from the Parade following controversy over the inclusion of the Ram Mandir float they say shows anti-Muslim bias.</p>

<p>Just hours before the parade, the Federation of Indian Associations -- the group that is organising the event spoke exclusively to ANI and said that the float celebrates the inauguration of a landmark significant to Hindus.</p>

<p>Ankur Vaidya, Chairman of the Federation of Indian Associations, said the parade represents the country's diversity and will feature floats from various communities in India.</p>

<p>"It is a proud moment to be gathering here with members of our community. I have been volunteering here since 2008 and this year is special. It's because we're displaying a replica of the Ram Temple to march down Madison Avenue instilling the values of harmony and peace for all. We Hindus pray that all problems disappear by Lord Ram. This is a march for goodwill and peace for all," Mr Vaidya said.</p>

<p>Mr Vaidya added that the preparations for the march were in full swing.</p>

<p>"The New York Police Department and the Mayor have supported us in terms of the parade for the last 20 years. Avinash Gupta, the President of the FIA, the media, sponsors and participants have been a strong pillar of support in terms of what we have endured for something as innocent as trying to display a miniature version of our faith very peacefully and as law-abiding citizens. This is the 42nd parade in New York City, and is the oldest and the largest India Day parade in the US," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Vaidya urged all participants to be calm, peaceful and happy. "I urge all participants to be calm, peaceful and happy, positive and abide by all laws of New York City. Let's have a great parade and make our community, homeland of the US and motherland India proud," he said.</p>

<p>The India Day parade in NYC has been taking place every year for over four decades, to mark the celebration of India's independence. The four-decade-old annual celebration in NYC will celebrate the 42nd Annual India Day Parade on the busy streets of New York.</p>

<p>Several Indian Americans from different faiths shared their views with ANI about the situation, with some condemning the false narratives being spread on social media.</p>

<p>In a statement on August 14, the Federation of Indian Associations NY-NJ-CT-NE said, "We find ourselves under heavy scrutiny for organizing a peaceful community celebration that our dedicated volunteers have worked tirelessly to prepare. This malicious and hate-filled scrutiny, spread on social media, has resulted in the loss of sponsorships--the lifeblood of our event--and in fear-mongering, causing law-abiding citizens to worry about potential unruly conduct due to the hateful messages circulating online."</p>

<p>"Our inclusion of a float that celebrates the inauguration of a sacred landmark, significant to hundreds of millions of Hindus has been insulted by derogatory name calling and the officials and the mainstream is radio silent. I respectfully ask, would such name-calling be tolerated if directed at any other community's place of worship? The answer is unequivocally no," the statement further said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris embarked on a bus tour of the potentially election-deciding state of Pennsylvania on Sunday, as she keeps up the momentum before her star turn at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.</p>

<p>The US vice president has reenergized the party after an astonishing month that has seen her replace President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket and wipe out Republican rival Donald Trump's lead in the polls.</p>

<p>Harris and her running mate Tim Walz, accompanied by their spouses, arrived at an airport hangar in Pittsburgh and greeted supporters, before setting off on a bus emblazoned with their names to a series of small towns to woo blue-collar voters.</p>

<p>Visiting a campaign phone bank later in Rochester, Pennsylvania, a crowd chanted "We are not going back" -- Harris's signature line as America's first female, Black and South Asian vice president casts herself as a new generation of leader.</p>

<p>Her rapid rise has unsettled 78-year-old former president and convicted felon Trump, who is resorting to his favored tactic of personal insults as he struggles to recalibrate a campaign that had focused largely on 81-year-old Biden's age.</p>

<p>A day earlier at a rally in Pennsylvania, Trump lashed out at Harris as a "lunatic" and bragged that he was "much better looking" than 59-year-old Harris.</p>

<p>The two campaigns are focusing heavily on Pennsylvania, in the heart of America's rust belt, which Trump won in 2016 before Biden seized it in 2020.</p>

<h3><strong>'We are ready'</strong></h3>

<p>Later in the day Harris will head to Chicago, where Democrats are daring to be hopeful again, just a few short weeks after a disastrous debate performance by Biden led many to think the election was already lost.</p>

<p>A Washington Post-ABC-Ipsos survey published Sunday showed Harris with a narrow lead over Trump among registered voters across the country, where one month ago it had Trump and Biden in a dead heat.</p>

<p>Security has been ramped up for the four-day Chicago convention, with tens of thousands of protesters expected to rally every day against the Biden-Harris administration's support for Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>The demonstrations are expected to begin on Sunday and continue through Thursday, with major gatherings scheduled for Monday and Wednesday in particular.</p>

<p>"We are ready," Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson told ABC on Sunday, adding that his police force was working with the Secret Service and other agencies to ensure a "safe, peaceful, yet vibrant" convention.</p>

<p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker said the planned protests would be allowed as long as they remained peaceful.</p>

<p>"If there are troublemakers, they are going to get arrested and they are going to get convicted," he told CNN.</p>

<h3><strong>Biden to pass torch</strong></h3>

<p>The Democratic bonanza in Chicago will allow Harris to tell her story to an American public that is still getting to know the candidate.</p>

<p>Harris is set to join Biden on stage when he addresses the convention on Monday -- a speech that just a few weeks ago he expected to be giving as the Democratic candidate.</p>

<p>The ageing president is reportedly still fuming over the way Democrats pushed him out, believing he still could have beaten Trump.</p>

<p>But Biden is expected to focus instead on passing the torch and on what he terms the threat to democracy posed by Trump, as he seeks to cement his legacy by helping Harris to victory.</p>

<p>Biden will "make the case for Vice President Kamala Harris" and "highlight the stakes of the election for all Americans," the Harris campaign said.</p>

<p>First Lady Jill Biden will also address the conference on Monday.</p>

<p>Former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama will appear during the week, along with former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and former first lady Michelle Obama.</p>

<p>Taking the stage on Wednesday will be Harris's vice presidential pick Walz, the Minnesota governor who has made his name with attacks branding Trump and his running mate Vance as "weird."</p>

<p>While Democrats meet in Chicago, Trump will be crisscrossing the country, with rallies scheduled in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina and Arizona through the week.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French film legend Alain Delon, a divisive star known to some as a sex symbol and to others as an egotistical chauvinist, has died aged 88, his children announced Sunday.</p>

<p>The actor, known for his roles in classics "Purple Noon" ("Plein Soleil", 1960) and "Le Samourai" (1967), died in the early hours of the morning, his son Anthony told AFP. He had been suffering from cancer.</p>

<p>"Alain Fabien, Anouchka, Anthony, as well as (his dog) Loubo, are deeply saddened to announce the passing of their father," Delon's children said in a statement to AFP.</p>

<p>"He passed away peacefully in his home in Douchy, surrounded by his three children and his family," said the statement, which came after months of public family feuding over the star's weakening health.</p>

<p>French President Emmanuel Macron called Delon a "French monument" who "played legendary roles and made the world dream".</p>

<p>Fellow 1960s star Brigitte Bardot told AFP he left "a huge void that nothing and no one will be able to fill".</p>

<p>Delon had millions of fans but also legions of critics, with feminists appalled by the lifetime achievement award the Cannes Film Festival gave him in 2019.</p>

<p>He lived his later years largely as a recluse, though his personal life kept him in the headlines.</p>

<p>In 2023, his three children filed a complaint against his live-in assistant Hiromi Rollin, accusing her of harassment and threatening behaviour.</p>

<p>The siblings went on to wage a public battle in the media and the courts, arguing over his state of health, which worsened after a stroke in 2019.</p>

<h3><strong>Instinctive genius</strong></h3>

<p>Far from a cerebral actor, Delon was considered an instinctive genius. He prided himself on never working on his technique, instead relying on charisma.</p>

<p>Former president of the Cannes festival, Gilles Jacob, paid tribute to Delon as "a lion, an actor with a steely gaze", while Alberto Barbera, director of the Venice film festival, said he was an "icon" who had climbed "to the Olympus of the immortals".</p>

<p>Delon's looks were cinematic gold for filmmakers in the 1960s, playing dark roles such as the manipulative anti-hero of "Purple Noon", adapted from the Patricia Highsmith thriller "The Talented Mr Ripley".</p>

<p>And in Jean-Pierre Melville's "Le Samourai", he set the template for one of Hollywood's main archetypes: the enigmatic, silent hitman.</p>

<p>Directors from Martin Scorsese, to John Woo and Quentin Tarantino acknowledge a debt to the inner life Delon gave his stylish killer -- although the French actor never managed to make it big in Hollywood.</p>

<p>"R.I.P to the angel-faced gangster," US director Jim Jarmusch posted on Instagram, with a photo of Delon from "Le Samourai".</p>

<p>Some of his best films were from his time in Italy, including two collaborations with Luchino Visconti, "Rocco and his Brothers" (1960) and "The Leopard" (1963).</p>

<p>"The party's over," his co-star in "The Leopard", Claudia Cardinale, said Sunday. "Tancredi has gone to dance with the stars," she added, using the name of his character.</p>

<p>Several Paris cinemas were showing "The Leopard" Sunday to full houses.</p>

<p>"Alain Delon really represents French cinema with a capital 'C'," 26-year-old cinemagoer Victor Roussel told AFP before going in for one showing.</p>

<p>Spanish actor Antonio Banderas, a screen idol a generation later, paid tribute with a post on X showing three photos of Delon in his prime and the words "Au revoir #AlainDelon. R.I.P."</p>

<h3><strong>Controversial views</strong></h3>

<p>Delon's relationship with women caused controversy. His sons accused him of domestic violence, and while Delon denied this, he admitted slapping women during quarrels.</p>

<p>Delon also drew criticism for supporting Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front, who was in favour of the death penalty and spoke against same-sex relationships.</p>

<p>He had a series of tumultuous affairs, describing German actor Romy Schneider as the "love of my life" after their relationship in the 1960s.</p>

<p>German-born Velvet Underground singer Nico claimed he was the father of her son, Christian Aaron Boulogne -- something Delon continually denied up to Boulogne's death in 2023 from a heroin overdose.</p>

<p>Delon married Francine Canovas, known as Nathalie Delon, in 1964, a stormy relationship that ended in divorce in 1969. Other high-profile relationships including pop diva Dalida and model-turned-actor Mireille Darc.</p>

<p>His death put him back on frontpages Sunday, including in Italy where he spent much of his career in the 1950s and 60s.</p>

<p>La Repubblica bid "adieu to the myth of French cinema".</p>

<p>Il Corriere della Sera lamented that "there will never be another actor like Delon", while Switzerland's newspaper Le Temps called him "a true badass with an angel's face".</p>

<h3><strong>Fans gather</strong></h3>

<p>Delon made his last major public appearance on the red carpet to receive an honorary Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2019.</p>

<p>"It's a bit of a posthumous tribute, but from my lifetime," he said when receiving the award.</p>

<p>Delon lived out his final years at home in a small village in France, surrounded by high walls, where he planned to be buried not far from his dogs.</p>

<p>Outside the entrance to his home in Douchy-Montcorbon, dozens of fans placed flowers and gathered to pay their respects.</p>

<p>"It's a part of our youth that is gone, it's very sad," said Marie Arnold, laying white flowers with her sister Michele.</p>

<p>"Alain is in a deep, chosen solitude, in another world, in the past with people he very much loved," his former partner Darc told AFP in 2015.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

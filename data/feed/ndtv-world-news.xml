       <description><![CDATA[During the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, 11 Israeli athletes were killed by members of the Palestinian terrorist organisation Black September.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, 11 Israeli athletes were killed by members of the Palestinian terrorist organisation Black September. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir secretly ordered Mossad, Israel's elite intelligence agency, to track down and eliminate those responsible for the massacre.</p>

<p>Over the next seven years, a covert campaign known as "Operation Wrath of God" targeted and assassinated more than a dozen suspects across Europe and the Middle East. This clandestine operation, involving a specially trained hit-team known as 'kidon' (Hebrew for bayonet), has been the subject of numerous books, documentaries and is the central theme of Steven Spielberg's film "Munich".</p>

<h2><strong>The Munich Massacre</strong></h2>

<p>On September 5, 1972, eight members of Black September infiltrated the Olympic Village in Munich. Armed with AK-47s, they took 11 Israeli athletes and coaches hostage, killing two in the initial assault. The terrorists demanded the release of 234 prisoners from Israeli jails. The standoff lasted for hours, during which German authorities attempted negotiations. The terrorists then moved to an airfield where they were told that two Bell UH-1 military helicopters would take them to Cairo. A botched rescue attempt by German police resulted in the deaths of all remaining hostages, a German police officer, and five of the terrorists.</p>

<h2><strong>Operation Wrath Of God</strong></h2>

<p>In the aftermath of the Munich massacre, Prime Minister Golda Meir, along with Mossad chief Zvi Zamir and counterterrorism adviser Aharon Yariv, devised a plan to eliminate the leadership of Black September and other related terrorist groups. This clandestine mission involved conducting assassinations on foreign soil, which carried massive political and ethical implications. The Israeli leadership believed that decisive action was necessary to prevent future attacks and to deliver justice for the Munich victims.</p>

<h2><strong>Planning the Operation</strong></h2>

<p>A special unit within Mossad, known as 'kidon', was tasked with carrying out the assassinations. This unit comprised highly trained assassins skilled in various forms of combat and covert operations.<br />
The list of targets included key figures believed to be responsible for planning and executing the Munich attack, as well as other high-ranking members of Black September and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). The aim was to "smash the head of the serpent" by eliminating its leadership.</p>

<h2><strong>The Assassinations</strong></h2>

<p>Over the next several years, Mossad operatives carried out a series of high-profile assassinations across Europe and the Middle East. Some of the most notable operations include:</p>

<p><strong>1. Wael Zwaiter</strong></p>

<p>The first target was Wael Zwaiter, a Palestinian poet and translator living in Rome. Mossad believed he was the head of Black September in Italy and involved in the Munich attack. On October 16, 1972, two Mossad operatives ambushed Zwaiter in the lobby of his apartment building and shot him 11 times. However, it later emerged that the intelligence on Zwaiter was uncorroborated, and his connection to the Munich massacre was questionable.</p>

<p><strong>2. Mahmoud Hamshari</strong></p>

<p>Mahmoud Hamshari, the PLO representative in France, was another key target. Mossad operatives tracked him to his Paris apartment and, posing as journalists, managed to plant a bomb in his telephone. On December 8, 1972, they detonated the bomb, killing Hamshari.</p>

<p><strong>3. Hussein Al Bashir</strong></p>

<p>Hussein Al Bashir, a PLO operative based in Cyprus, was targeted next. On January 24, 1973, Mossad agents planted a bomb under his bed in a Nicosia hotel. The explosion killed Bashir instantly.</p>

<p><strong>4. The Beirut Operation</strong></p>

<p>One of the most daring operations took place in Beirut on April 10, 1973. Mossad operatives, along with Israeli commandos from the elite Sayeret Matkal unit, infiltrated Beirut disguised as women. The operation targeted three key figures: Mohammed Youssef al-Najjar, Kamal Adwan, and Kamal Nasser. The hit squad, including Ehud Barak, who later became Prime Minister of Israel, managed to reach their targets' homes and eliminate them.</p>

<p><strong>5. Ali Hassan Salameh</strong></p>

<p>Ali Hassan Salameh, known as the "Red Prince," was one of Mossad's most elusive targets. Salameh was the chief of operations for Black September and a close associate of former PLO chief Yasser Arafat. After a failed attempt in Norway, where it mistakenly killed an innocent Moroccan waiter named Ahmed Bouchikhi, Mossad intensified its efforts to locate Salameh. The breakthrough came in 1979 when an undercover operative, who had befriended Salameh and his wife, provided information. On January 22, 1979, Salameh was killed by a car bomb in Beirut.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[GLAAD supported the expenditure, and the chair of its board of directors declared that the board "stands firmly behind" Ellis.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The President and CEO of GLAAD Sarah Kate Ellis is facing criticism following a shocking <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/business/glaad-ceo-spending.html"><em>New York Times</em> </a>report that claimed she had lavished spending, including taking a $22,000 first-class ticket to the Cannes Lions and remodelling her home office with money from the non-profit LGBTQ advocacy organisation.</p>

<p>The investigation that dug into payments between January 2022 and June 2023 claims that Ellis' spending habits might be against Internal Revenue Service regulations in addition to those of the LGBTQ organization. The 52-year-old spending habits also worried the company's former chief financial officer.</p>

<p>According to NYT, GLAAD's internal travel guidelines advised staff to "be cost-conscious," take public transit and book economy flights. However, when examining GLAAD expense reports, employment contracts, tax returns, and additional documentation, the outlet discovered that the CEO had taken more than 30 first-class flights over one and a half years (including a $21,743 Delta One trip to Cannes Lions), spent nearly half a million dollars to rent a seven-bedroom chalet in Switzerland for a week while attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, and private transportation services. Further, her renewal contract included $25,000 for the rental of a summer home in Provincetown, Massachusetts, and $20,000 for remodelling her home office which included ivory pillows and a chandler.</p>

<p>A GLAAD representative told NYT that the renovation made the area "suitable" for virtual events and television appearances. All of these costs were on top of Ellis' yearly salary, which was stated to be $441,000. However, because of numerous bonuses, his actual remuneration could have ranged from $700,000 to $1.3 million. Richard Ferraro, a GLAAD spokesman, informed the outlet that GLAAD was "eager to retain her" as a result of her accomplishment and that it would be "practically impossible" to reach the latter sum.</p>

<p>In 2023, GLAAD's then-chief financial officer, Emily Plauche warned Liz Jenkins, the chairwoman of the company's board of directors that the money was not being disclosed properly to the Internal Revenue Service. However, the organization modified its travel regulations following an investigation by a law firm into her concerns.</p>

<p>GLAAD supported the expenditure, and the chair of its board of directors declared that the board "stands firmly behind" Ellis. They stated that the home renovation was done because of her on-camera appearances and virtual events during the Covid-19 pandemic and it was approved by the board of directors. Meanwhile, the rental of the summer home was a business expense to conduct meetings with donors.</p>

<p>The spokesperson also highlighted GLAAD's criticism of NYT, claiming that the newspaper publishes "inaccurate, biased pieces about transgender people" throughout a year-long campaign. In its report, the NYT accepted this criticism and affirmed the quality of its work.</p>

<p>The chairwoman said that she supports Ellis "with respect and appreciation for how she and her team are leading the movement at a time when our community is under attack. We have full confidence that they're doing so with integrity and that they share the board's commitment to irrefutably strong governance and business practices."</p>

<p>Ellis added, "I take my role as GLAAD's financial steward incredibly seriously, and we'll continue updating our procedures to keep pace with the organization's rapid growth."<br />

       <description><![CDATA[As doctors performed emergency surgery, his heart stopped for 25 minutes and he also suffered a mini-stroke.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a harrowing medical ordeal, a British university student miraculously survived after being clinically dead for 25 minutes at a US hospital. According to the&nbsp;<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cllyl9ed40no">BBC</a></em>,&nbsp;Charlie Vincent's inaugural day as a canoeing instructor at a summer camp in New Hampshire took a drastic turn when excessive sun exposure left him with severe second-degree burns on his legs.</p>

<p>Unaware of the severity of his burns, he continued to work, but the pain and damage soon became too much to bear, leading to a medical emergency. Camp leaders rushed him to the hospital, where doctors diagnosed not only severe sunburn but also pneumonia.&nbsp;As doctors performed emergency surgery, his heart stopped for 25 minutes&nbsp;and he also suffered a mini-stroke.</p>

<p>It took a chilling 25 minutes before the his heart restarted, his family said. Charlie's 24-year-old sister, Emily Vincent, described his operating table recovery as a "miracle". She also shared that doctors discovered he had an enlarged heart, also known as cardiomegaly, which means the heart has to work harder than normal.</p>

<p>The 20-year-old was subsequently placed in an induced coma for seven days, with doctors initially fearing the need for heart and kidney transplants.&nbsp;However, against all odds, Mr Vincent pulled through, as his&nbsp;organs began to miraculously recover.</p>

<p>''At one point, I just couldn't see a way that Charlie was going to make it, it was absolutely heart-breaking, it was hell. It's definitely a miracle that he's still here, I think the hospital he has been in has given him the most amazing care and without that, I don't think he would have made it,'' she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Charlie is now taking his first steps towards a comeback as he has regained the strength to walk again.&nbsp;He is due to return to the UK for further treatment in the coming days on a medical flight.</p>

<p>The Vincent family have set up a GoFundMe to help cover the costs of Charlie's medical bills. It has already raised over 13,000 pounds and is set to be spent on travel costs for the parents as well as the medical bills.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The program aims to cultivate professionals to develop marriage-related industries and cultures and to promote China's positive marriage and family culture.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a bid to promote China's positive marriage and family culture, the country's Civil Affairs University recently announced a new undergraduate program focused on marriage, called "Marriage Services and Management." The program comes at a time when China is facing a decline in new births, closely tied to falling marriage rates, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/china/china-university-announces-marriage-degree-b2590158.html">Independent</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The undergraduate program, set to open in the Beijing institution this September, seeks to ''cultivate professionals to develop marriage related industries and culture'', according to state media.&nbsp;The program, which begins enrolling students this September, will recruit 70 undergraduates across 12 provinces in 2024, vice president of the university Zhao Honggang told local media.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>About the program:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The program aims to cultivate professionals to develop marriage-related industries and cultures and to promote China's positive marriage and family culture.</li>
	<li>The program will cover topics such as family counseling, high-end wedding planning, and the development of matchmaking products.</li>
	<li>Graduates of the program will have career opportunities in industry associations, matchmaking agencies, wedding service companies, and marriage and family counseling organizations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Notably, China's population has declined for the second consecutive year, primarily attributed to a persistent drop in birth rates. Despite the relaxation of the one-child policy in 2016, allowing couples to have up to three children since 2021, marriage rates have continued to plummet. This trend has been ongoing for nearly a decade, with 2022 marking a record low in marriages. Consequently, the birth rate has halved since 2016, reaching a critically low level in 2023.</p>

<p>China's economic slowdown appears to be a significant factor in the declining marriage rate among young people. With rising concerns about job security and financial stability, many young people are hesitant to commit to marriage. The country's slowing economy has led to reduced job prospects, lower wages, and decreased consumer confidence, making it challenging for young adults to feel financially prepared for marriage and starting a family. Additionally, the high cost of living, including housing and healthcare expenses also contribute to the delay or avoidance of marriage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Several users on China's social media platform Weibo ridiculed the announcement with one writing "It's time to start a state owned marriage agency."</p>

<p>Others questioned the need for such a degree. "This industry is not just a sunset, it's doomsday," one wrote, while another commented that "Learning this major is really unemployment after graduation."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Renowned Indian astrologer Kushal Kumar, known as the "Indian Nostradamus", has issued a fresh warning that World War III will begin on either August 4 or August 5.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Renowned Indian astrologer Kushal Kumar, known as the "<a href="https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/indian-astrologer-stands-by-prediction-claims-world-war-3-is-days-away-5913389 ">Indian Nostradamus</a>", has issued a fresh warning that World War III will begin on either August 4 or August 5.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Kumar, who previously predicted the Israel-Hamas War and the Russia-Ukraine War, claimed that a combination of geopolitical events will trigger the catastrophic conflict.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Kumar has made multiple predictions about the start date of World War 3, but so far, none of them have come true. Earlier, he announced that the war would begin on June 18, 2024, but that date passed without incident. He then declared a new date, predicting that World War 3 would start on either July 26 or July 28, but again, his prediction was incorrect. Now, it remains to be seen if he will finally get it right this time.</p>

<p><strong>Here are some facts about the astrologer:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Kushal Kumar is a Vedic astrology writer from Panchkula, Haryana, as per LinkedIn.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>His articles have been published in world-leading astrology magazines such as 'The Mountain Astrology' (TMA) from California and 'Horoscope' from New York.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Mr Kumar specialises in areas such as economy, weather, business, strategies, conflicts and global affairs, with an emphasis on Vedic astrology. He also provides personalised astrological guidance to individuals based on their birth time details.</li>
	<li>He has a track record of making accurate predictions, as evident from his article "Astrological probable alerts for the United States in 2018" published in Wisdom Magazine in December 2017.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Kushal Kumar also writes about Vedic lore and the research by Indian sages, as well as spirituality practised in various religions around the world, conveying profound and valuable messages.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If coolness had a face, it would be Turkish shooter Yusuf Dikec's. The 51-year-old, who won the silver in 10-metre air pistol mixed team event at Paris Olympics without any special gear and a hand in pocket, is now the among the most searched persons on Internet and the inspiration behind numerous memes.</p>

<p>Back home after his Olympic win along with teammate Sevval Ilayda Tarhan, Dikec spoke to Turkey's <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/tr/dunyadan-spor/yusuf-dikece-gore-onemli-olan-kendisinin-degil-bir-turk-sporcunun-dunya-gundeminde-olmasi/3293750">Anadolu news agency</a> about his relaxed posture that made headlines. "It was the position where I felt the most comfortable and could keep my body the most stable. Although I looked calm on the outside, there was a storm inside," he said, adding that he had no inkling that his posture would start a buzz. "I never expected it to create such a stir," he said, adding that he just got into position and took the shot.</p>

<p><strong>A 23-Year Journey</strong></p>

<p>The interest surrounding Yusuf Dikec generated a wave of misinformation, with claims that he was a mechanic and his journey as a shooter began after a nasty divorce. While his relationship status is not known, it is clear that his calm shot is the result of two decades of hard work. A former sergeant in Turkish Army, Dikec started sport shooting in 2001. He is a five-time Olympian who also competed in 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2020 Games.</p>

<p>In his interview to Anadolu, he said, "People sometimes say, 'it's so easy, you won a medal with your hand in your pocket'. That's what shows on the outside, but behind this medal is 24 years of hard work. I train for 4-5 hours six days a week."</p>

<p>Dikec has earlier won medals in European and world championships, Mediterranean Games and Islamic Solidarity Games. "What was missing in that collection was an Olympic medal. The collection would have been complete if it was gold. If I won a gold in this Olympics, I was thinking of quitting," he said, adding, "I am very good, and Ilayda is very good too. If God allows, we will win the gold medal in 2028."</p>

<p><strong>Daughter's Pep Talk</strong></p>

<p>Dikec has told Anadolu about his conversation with his nine-year-old daughter Basak before he left for Paris.&nbsp;"My only asset in the world, my source of life, is Basak. She gave me tips before she left. When I asked her, 'How are you doing in gymnastics, she replied, 'I tell myself 'you can do it Basak, you can win'. You do the same.' The shooter said he spoke to his daughter the day before the Olympics shooting event. "Normally, I don't answer my phone so as not to distract my attention, but talking to my daughter, motivated me."</p>

<p>Basak said she was very excited to see her father perform. "I wished him success. I motivated him so that he does not get upset for not finishing first."</p>

<p><strong>"Yusuf Dikec just a name"</strong></p>

<p>The star shooter said an athlete needs to pay attention to his attitude, behaviour and lifestyle when he is wearing the national team's jersey. "Yusuf Dikec is just a name and a symbol. I am very happy to be spoken about as a Turkish athlete, not as Yusuf Dikec."</p>

<p>He said this victory must inspire young Turkish shooters. "I started the sport very late, I started when I was 28. At first, when we went to competitions in Europe and the world, we considered making it to the finals as a success. Today, after 24 years, we have started to feel sad about finishing second in the Olympics. We have many young friends, they will surpass us. I am old, but we have shown that success can be achieved by hard work. What is important is not wanting something very much, but the effort you put in to achieve what you want," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Israeli airstrike on a school sheltering displaced persons in Gaza City killed at least 15 Palestinians on Saturday, hours after two strikes in the occupied West Bank killed nine militants including a local Hamas commander, Hamas said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said the first of two West Bank airstrikes hit a vehicle in a town near the city of Tulkarm, targeting a militant cell it said was on its way to carry out an attack.</p>

<p>A Hamas statement said one of those killed was a commander of its Tulkarm brigades, while its ally Islamic Jihad claimed the other four men who died in the strike as its fighters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hours later, a second airstrike in the area targeted another group of militants who had fired on troops, Israel's military said, during what it described as a counterterrorism operation in Tulkarm.</p>

<p>Palestinian news agency WAFA said four people had died in that strike, and Hamas said all nine of those killed in the two Israeli attacks in the West Bank were fighters.</p>

<p>Violence in the West Bank was on the rise before the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and has risen since, with frequent Israeli raids in the territory, which is among those that the Palestinians seek for a state.</p>

<p>There has also been an increase in anti-Israeli street attacks by Palestinians.</p>

<p>The latest strikes in the Palestinian territories came amid Israel's growing tensions with Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah group that have fanned fears of a widened conflict in the Middle East.</p>

<p>The US and international partners including France, Britain, Italy and Egypt, continued diplomatic contacts on Saturday seeking to prevent further regional escalation.</p>

<p>Hamas said it had begun a "broad consultation process" to choose a new leader three days after the assassination in Tehran of Ismail Haniyeh, who was the face of the group's international diplomacy. Iran and Hamas have blamed Israel and vowed to retaliate. Israel has not claimed or denied responsibility.</p>

<p><strong>GAZA STRIKES</strong></p>

<p>In the Gaza Strip, at least 15 people were killed in the Israeli strike on a school sheltering displaced persons in Gaza City's Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood, the Hamas run-government media office said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said the school was being used as a command centre for Hamas, to hide militants and manufacture weapons. Hamas has denied Israeli accusations that it operates from civilian facilities such as schools and hospitals.</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, Israeli strikes in the enclave killed six people in a house in the southern area of Rafah and two others in Gaza City, Gaza health officials said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said its forces had struck militants and destroyed Hamas infrastructure in Rafah and elsewhere in the enclave.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At least 39,550 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, according to Gaza health officials. The offensive was triggered by a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7 in which 1,200 people were killed and 250 abducted, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>A high-level Israeli delegation made a brief visit to Cairo on Saturday in an attempt to resume Gaza ceasefire negotiations, Egyptian airport authority sources said. The Israeli officials returned to Israel hours later, Israeli media said.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office accused Hamas of trying to add changes to the "outline" of a potential agreement, referring to a proposal U.S. President Joe Biden laid out in May. Hamas has blamed Netanyahu, saying he does not want to stop the war.</p>

<p>Chances of a breakthrough appear low as regional tension has soared following the assassination of Haniyeh, Hamas's top leader, on Wednesday, a day after an Israeli strike in Beirut killed Fuad Shukr, a senior military commander from Hezbollah, which like Hamas is backed by Iran.</p>

<p>Haniyeh's death was one in a series of killings of senior Hamas figures as the Gaza war nears its 11th month, and it fuelled concern that the conflict in Gaza was turning into a wider Middle East war.</p>

<p>Israel has not said whether or not it was behind Haniyeh's assassination. But Netanyahu said earlier this week that Israel had delivered crushing blows to Iran's proxies of late, including Hamas and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke separately to French Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne and British Foreign Secretary David Lammy on Saturday on the need to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza and to prevent the conflict from spreading, the State Department said.</p>

<p>Egypt's foreign minister, Badr Abdelatty, stressed in a phone call with Iran's acting foreign minister, Ali Bagheri Kani, that recent developments in the region were "unprecedented, very dangerous" and threatening to stability, Egypt's government said.</p>

<p>In addition, the Italian Foreign Ministry said: "Italy makes an appeal to Iran, calling on it for restraint and to contribute to a phase of de-escalation throughout the Mediterranean region and the Middle East." It added that the message had been delivered to the Iranian ambassador in Rome.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Wadie Haddad, the chief of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, was involved in several high-profile attacks, including the 1976 hijacking of an Air France plane, known as the Entebbe Hijacking.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israel-Palestine conflict has been marked by a long history of violence and controversial tactics. One such was the '<a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-deployed-controversial-hannibal-directive-during-hamas-attack-report-6057961">Hannibal Directive</a>', which allows for the use of excessive force to prevent the capture of soldiers, even if it puts the lives of hostages at risk. Another example of Israel's unorthodox methods is the 1978 assassination of Palestinian commander Wadie Haddad, who was killed by Mossad agents using poisoned toothpaste.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>Wadie Haddad, the chief of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, was involved in several high-profile attacks, including the 1976 hijacking of an Air France plane, known as the Entebbe Hijacking. The hijackers took the plane from Tel Aviv to Paris, but diverted it to Libya and then Uganda.</p>

<p>Israel responded with Operation Thunderbolt, a rescue mission led by Lt Col Yonatan Netanyahu, the brother of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The mission succeeded, but &nbsp;Lt Col Netanyahu died in the process.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Wadie Haddad on Mossad's 'Kill List'</strong></p>

<p>The Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, wanted revenge for the Entebbe Hijacking. Wadie Haddad, the mastermind behind the hijacking, was their top target. After gaining international recognition, Wadie Haddad became a priority on Mossad's Kill List.</p>

<p><strong>'Agent Sadness'</strong></p>

<p>To avoid a messy execution, the Mossad chose a quiet method. They assigned the mission to an agent known as 'Agent Sadness', who had access to Haddad's home and office.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The execution</strong></p>

<p>On January 10, 1978, Agent Sadness replaced Haddad's regular toothpaste with a specially prepared toxic version. The toxin, developed at the Israel Institute for Biological Research, would go on to penetrate Haddad's mucous membranes and gradually build up to a fatal dose.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Wadie Haddad's illness</strong></p>

<p>By mid-January, Wadie Haddad fell gravely ill in Baghdad. His symptoms were severe, consisting of abdominal spasms, loss of appetite and rapid weight loss of over 25 pounds. Despite treatment by top Iraqi doctors, his condition continued to deteriorate and he was diagnosed with hepatitis, then a severe cold. Even powerful antibiotics had no effect. His hair started falling out, raising suspicions of poisoning.</p>

<p>Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, sought help from the East German Secret Service, the Stasi.</p>

<p>The Stasi airlifted Wadie Haddad to East Berlin and admitted him to a secret hospital under the alias 'Ahmed Doukli'. Doctors tested him extensively, but they could not determine the cause of his illness. They suspected either rat poison or thallium poisoning, without conclusive evidence.</p>

<p><strong>Wadie Haddad's death</strong></p>

<p>Wadie Haddad's condition continued to deteriorate, with serious haemorrhaging and a dropping platelet count. Doctors sedated him and kept him in the hospital for ten agonising days, but they could not save him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He died on March 29, 1978.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Autopsy report</strong></p>

<p>An autopsy conducted by Professor Otto Prokop concluded that Wadie Haddad died from brain bleeding and pneumonia caused by panmyelopathy. However, the precise cause of the poisoning remained unclear for years.</p>

<p>It took nearly three decades for the truth about&nbsp;Haddad's assassination to come out. Aaron J Klein's "Striking Back" attributes Wadie Haddad's death to poisoned chocolates, while Ronan Bergman's "Rise and Kill First" details the toothpaste assassination.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The Israeli military's motto, inspired by the Babylonian Talmud, is "If someone comes to kill you, rise up and kill them first".&nbsp;</p>

<p>This guiding principle has driven their actions, including the recent targeting of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, Iran. Since the October 7 attack, Israel's onslaught on Gaza has killed close to 39,400 people and injured almost 1 lakh others.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A disturbing video has surfaced online, capturing the shocking moment a passenger attacked her Uber driver with pepper spray in Manhattan. The alarming incident unfolded on Lexington Avenue and East 65th Street on Tuesday around 11:20 p.m. as Jennifer Guilbeault and another young woman sat in the back seat of the ride-hailing vehicle, as per the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/02/us-news/disturbing-video-shows-woman-unleash-pepper-spray-in-nyc-uber-drivers-eyes-what-the-f-k/">New York Post.&nbsp;</a></em></p>

<p>The footage shows Ms Guilbeault suddenly and deliberately spraying the driver in the eyes, while he was engaged in a phone conversation.&nbsp;As the driver frantically tried to escape the vehicle, Ms Guilbeault unleashed a second wave of spray. Meanwhile, her friend, seemingly horrified by the unfolding chaos, pleaded with her to stop.</p>

<p>''Jen, what the f–k!” What did you do?” the other woman yelled, after the driver managed to get out of the car.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Here's the video:</strong></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Following the attack, the driver declined medical attention for eye discomfort, according to authorities. Meanwhile, Ms Guilbeault was taken into custody at approximately 12:45 a.m. on Wednesday and charged with third-degree assault, a misdemeanor. She was issued a desk appearance ticket, requiring her to appear in court at a later date, and subsequently released.</p>

<p>The motivations behind the unprovoked attack remain unclear, with police still investigating the circumstances leading up to the incident.</p>

<p>Uber has permanently banned Ms Guilbeault from using their services, a company spokesperson confirmed to <em>The Post.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>''The rider's actions shown in the video are deplorable. Violence is not tolerated, and the rider has been banned from the Uber platform. We will support police in their investigation however we can,'' the Uber spokesperson said in a statement.</p>

<p>The New York City Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission (TLC) also strongly denounced the actions of Ms Guilbeault, echoing widespread outrage over the pepper spray attack on an Uber driver. In a statement, TLC Commissioner David Do said, ''Violence against our city's drivers, who work tirelessly to provide essential services and earn a living, is utterly unacceptable and deeply disturbing. We urge anyone who witnesses or experiences such behavior to report it immediately to the NYPD.''</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In a speech to the United States Congress last month, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu envisioned a new regional coalition in the Middle East, termed the "Abraham Alliance".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a speech to the United States Congress last month, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu envisioned a new regional coalition in the Middle East, termed the "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/as-iran-strike-looms-israel-hopes-for-abraham-alliance-with-us-uk-6258649">Abraham Alliance</a>". This proposed alliance, an expansion of the Abraham Accords, aims to unite countries with diplomatic ties to Israel against Iran's influence, particularly its network of proxy forces collectively known as the "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hamas-palestine-gaza-explained-axis-of-resistance-and-irans-proxy-network-across-middle-east-4534061">Axis of Resistance</a>".</p>

<h2><strong>The Abraham Alliance</strong></h2>

<p>The Abraham Accords, initiated in September 2020, normalised relations between Israel and several Arab nations, including the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan. Netanyahu's vision for the Abraham Alliance builds on these accords, seeking a coalition that could include current and future diplomatic partners of Israel. This alliance aims to counteract what Netanyahu describes as "Iran's terror".</p>

<p>Netanyahu's appeal to Congress echoed historical parallels, drawing on Winston Churchill's wartime plea to the US: "Give us the tools, and we'll finish the job." He said US military aid to Israel was essential for regional stability and security.</p>

<p>As the political fallout from the killing of Palestinian armed group Hamas's leader Ismail Haniyeh's killing in Tehran escalates, the United States has pledged to bolster its military presence in the Middle East, deploying an aircraft carrier strike group led by the USS Abraham Lincoln, additional ballistic missile defense-capable ships, and a new fighter squadron.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel is coordinating closely with both the US and the United Kingdom, preparing for a potential retaliatory strike from Iran. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has held discussions with his US counterpart Lloyd Austin and British Defence Secretary John Healey.</p>

<p>A potential war between Israel and Iran would pit several military powers against each other.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Axis of Resistance: Iran's Network of Proxies</strong></h2>

<p>Since the Islamic Revolution of 1979, Iran has systematically extended its influence across the Middle East through a network of proxy groups, collectively known as the Axis of Resistance. This network includes Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, various militias in Iraq, and militant groups in Syria and Gaza. These proxies serve Iran's strategic interests, allowing it to exert influence and challenge adversaries across the region.</p>

<p><strong>Lebanon: Hezbollah</strong></p>

<p>Hezbollah, established in the early 1980s with Iranian support, represents Iran's first significant proxy in the Middle East. Funded and armed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Hezbollah shares Tehran's Shiite Islamist ideology and recruits primarily from Lebanon's Shiite Muslim population. Originally formed to combat Israeli forces in Lebanon, Hezbollah has evolved into a formidable military and political force, possessing an arsenal of at least 130,000 rockets and missiles.</p>

<p><strong>Gaza: Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad</strong></p>

<p>In the Palestinian territories, Iran has cultivated relationships with militant groups such as Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). These groups have engaged in longstanding conflicts with Israel, receiving financial and military support from Iran.</p>

<p><strong>Syria: The Assad Regime</strong></p>

<p>Iran's alliance with the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria has been crucial since the onset of the Syrian civil war in 2011. Tehran has provided substantial military support, including approximately 80,000 fighting personnel, to bolster Assad's forces. Additionally, Iran has organised and supported various Shiite militias, such as the Zaynabiyoun Brigade (comprising Pakistani fighters) and the Fatemiyoun Division (consisting of Afghan Hazara fighters), to support the Syrian government.</p>

<p><strong>Yemen: The Houthis</strong></p>

<p>The Houthi movement in Yemen, supported by Iran, has emerged as a key player in the regional conflict. Originally formed in the 1990s and gaining strength after 2014, the Houthis have received military and financial backing from the IRGC.</p>

<p><strong>Iraq: Shiite Militias</strong></p>

<p>Following the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, Iran expanded its influence by establishing and supporting various Shiite militias. Notable groups include Kataib Hezbollah, Asaib Ahl al-Haq, and the Badr Organisation. These militias have often targeted US forces and maintain close ties with Tehran.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dough Emhoff, husband of US Vice President Kamala Harris, has admitted to having an extra-marital affair during his first marriage.</p>

<p>"During my first marriage, Kerstin and I went through some tough times on account of my actions. I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side," Emhoff said in a statement provided exclusively to CNN.</p>

<p>His acknowledgement comes after a British tabloid reported that Emhoff had an affair with a teacher who worked at a school his children attended and that resulted in end of his first marriage.</p>

<p>The Daily Mail reported that the woman became pregnant and that, according to a close friend, she "did not keep the child."</p>

<p>At that time, Dough Emhoff was married to Kerstin Emhoff and has two children - Cole and Ella - with her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kamala Harris and Douglas Emhoff married in 2014 - she for the first time, he for the second. When the two met on a blind date arranged by friends, it was "love at first sight," he later said.</p>

<p>Harris was aware of the affair before her marriage to Emhoff. Those in the Biden campaign who conducted the Vice President's vetting process in 2020 also knew about it, CBS News reported.</p>

<p>Seeking to become the first female president in US history, Harris is tasked with rapidly assembling a campaign against an opponent who has been in near permanent reelection mode since he became president in 2016.</p>

<p>She's garnered support from Democratic heavyweights, including Joe Biden himself and most recently Barack and Michelle Obama.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JD Vance, Donald Trump's Vice President pick, recently revealed that he asked his son to "shut the hell up" about Pokemon Pikachu amid a phone call with the former President and moments before the Republican National Convention. The Ohio senator explained the circumstances on the Full Send podcast.</p>

<p>The politician was speaking to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-re1pBdMD8I">YouTube comedians the NELK Boys</a> and said the incident occurred when Mr Trump called and asked him to be his running mate. Notably, the former president officially named the senator as his running mate during the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee last month.</p>

<p>Mr Vance was flying with his family to Milwaukee for the RNC when he realised that the airplane had no Wi-fi. He landed after an hour and had over a hundred messages. He said that he got one message from the Trump campaign which said, "Hey, you just missed a really important call." He then called Mr Trump and said, "Hey Sir, what's going on?" The 45th US President told him, "J.D., you missed a really important phone call, and now I'm going to have to go with someone else."</p>

<p>Mr Vance continued, "My son, who is seven, is in the hotel room with me. And he is really into Pokemon cards right now. He's going through a Pokemon phase...he's really into it. So he's trying to talk to me about Pikachu and I'm on the phone with Donald Trump and I'm like, 'Son, shut the hell up for 30 seconds about Pikachu.'"</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>He added, "This is the most important phone call of my life. Please just let me take this phone call." Mr Vance said that because his son "doesn't get what the President of the United States means," he didn't care that Mr Trump was on the phone.</p>

<p>Since being shared on social media, Mr Vance's remarks have been widely criticised.</p>

<p>The Democratic National Convention wrote in a statement on its website, "If there's one thing JD Vance is going to do, it's full send being the weirdest, creepiest, and most unpopular running mate Donald Trump could have ever hoped for."</p>

<p>Representative Wiley Nickel, a North Carolina Democrat, wrote on X, "What a truly horrible human being...J.D. Vance tells his 7 year-old son to 'shut the hell up' because he's talking to Trump. I've got a simple rule in Congress. There's no call that's ever more important than my kids."</p>

<p>"He was on the phone with President Trump. Chill son," said a person.</p>

<p>Another added, "It's even more embarrassing that he thinks this is a flex."</p>

<p>"Better to have no kids than speak to them that way," added a user.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Middle East tensions have soared as Iran and Hamas, together with Hezbollah, vowed strong retaliation to the assassination of their group leaders, blamed on Israel, spurring fears of a regional war.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>The killing this week of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, hours after the Israeli assassination of Hezbollah's military chief Fuad Shukr in Beirut, has intensified the voices clamouring for revenge.</li>
	<li>Hezbollah has been exchanging near-daily cross-border fire with Israeli forces since October, saying it is acting in support of Hamas. The group announced it had fired dozens of Katyusha rockets at the northern Israeli settlement of Beit Hillel as Iran said it expects Hezbollah to hit deeper inside Israel and no longer be confined to military targets.</li>
	<li>The US, UK, Australia and France called on their citizens to leave Lebanon - where the powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah movement is based - and airlines cancelled flights. Canada warned citizens to avoid all travel to Israel, saying the regional armed conflict endangered security.</li>
	<li>Indian nationals in Israel have been asked to stay vigilant and adhere to the safety protocols following the escalating tension in the region.&nbsp;The advisory for the Indian citizens in Israel comes a day after the Indian Embassy in Beirut strongly advised Indian nationals against travelling to Lebanon till further notice. It also advised them to leave Lebanon.</li>
	<li>The Pentagon said it was bolstering its military presence in the Middle East to protect US personnel and defend Israel.</li>
	<li>Haniyeh was Hamas's lead negotiator in efforts to end the war. His killing raised questions about the continued viability of efforts by Qatari, Egyptian and US mediators to broker a truce and exchange of hostages and prisoners.</li>
	<li>Hamas said it had begun a "broad consultation process" to choose a new leader three days after the assassination of Haniyeh.</li>
	<li>US President Joe Biden expressed hope Iran would stand down despite its threat to avenge the assassination of Hamas and&nbsp;Hezbollah leaders in Tehran. Biden said he was "very concerned" about rising tensions in the region, adding that the killing of Haniyeh had "not helped" the situation.</li>
	<li>Israel, meanwhile, warned its adversaries they would "pay a very high price" for any "aggression". "Israel is at a very high level of preparation for any scenario, both defensive and offensive," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement.</li>
	<li>The war in Gaza has caused widespread destruction and displaced almost the entire population of the territory where, the UN said on Friday, public health conditions "continue to deteriorate".</li>

       <description><![CDATA["I think all of the names that have been vetted are qualified. In my view, it's come down to two," he added.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Ronald Reagan's re-election triumph amid economic recession to Bill Clinton's victory against George HW Bush, Allan Lichtman, known as the 'Nostradamus' of US Presidential Polls has correctly predicted crucial poll contests in the country. Now, the expert has voiced who should be Democratic nominee Kamala Harris' running mate, as per a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newsweek.com/allan-lichtman-kamala-harris-vice-president-election-nostradamus-1933769#:~:text=The%20presidential%20historian%2C%20who%20has,was%20a%20%22good%20choice.%22"><em>Newsweek</em></a>.</p>

<p>"I don't think a VP pick turns the election, but a VP pick is incredibly important," Mr Lichtman said during a YouTube livestream. "I think all of the names that have been vetted are qualified. In my view, it's come down to two," he added.</p>

<p>Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona and Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania were then recognized as favourable choices by the historian, who has accurately predicted the results of nine of the last ten elections.</p>

<p>Speaking to the outlet, Mr Lichtman said Mr Shapiro was a "good choice" as he was "eminently qualified". "(He is) popular in an important region of the country, overall popular, and eminently qualified. The most important thing is, will you trust this person to become president if, God forbid, that happens. And of course, that has happened fairly often in American history," he told Newsweek. Notably, nine vice presidents have become presidents after US presidents passed away or resigned.</p>

<p>Mr Lichtman continued, "Picking someone from a given state is no guarantee you're going to win that state, but if you want to reach out to any particular state, Pennsylvania is the most important state in this election."</p>

<p>Allan Lichtman added that Ms Harris should pick a candidate who could help her win a region as big as Pennsylvania because it has 19 Electoral College votes. Since Harry Truman in 1948, no Democratic contender has won the election without the Keystone State. "Of all the swing states, it has the most electoral votes, and Democrats really can't win without winning Pennsylvania. I'm not saying picking Josh Shapiro is going to win Pennsylvania. There's no evidence to that effect, but if her objective is to try to pick someone who could help you to win a state, you would want to pick Pennsylvania," he added.</p>

<p>Notably, Mr Lichtman currently prefers Democratic US Vice President Kamala Harris to her Republican opponent, Donald Trump. He expressed his opinion to News Nation, saying that "a lot would have to go wrong for Harris to lose."</p>

<p>He predicted that Democrats presently hold six of the 13 keys. A main competition, a short- and long-term economy, policy changes, the absence of controversy, and the charisma of a challenger are some of these.</p>

<p>"Right now, Democrats have lost three keys" by switching to Harris, he told News Nation.</p>

<p>The expert claimed that the Democrats' significant defeat in the 2022 midterm elections cost them the "party mandate". He added that Ms Harris no longer had the "incumbency" and "charisma" keys.</p>

<p>However, in order for him to forecast a Harris defeat, Democrats would need to lose three additional seats according to his prediction model. However, he says that is unlikely to occur.</p>

<p>The historian will make the official prediction for the 2024 White House race after the Democratic convention in August.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israeli defence officials say they are coordinating with the US and UK ahead of an expected strike by Iran, setting the stage for a repeat of a similar attack by Tehran in April that was repelled by allies.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli defence officials say they are coordinating with the US and UK ahead of an expected strike by Iran, setting the stage for a repeat of a similar attack by Tehran in April that was repelled by allies.&nbsp;<br />
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said in a statement Friday that he spoke with his American and British counterparts, Lloyd Austin and John Healey, and provided "a situational assessment in light of recent security developments."</p>

<p>Fear has risen of a spillover from the nearly 10-month Israel-Hamas war in Gaza as Iran threatened retaliation for the assassination in Tehran this week of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of the Iran-backed group.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A similar spike in tensions about four months ago saw Iran and Israel trade direct fire for the first time. Almost 300 Iranian drones and missiles were fired but most were destroyed by air defences from Israel, the US and several allies. Israel's drone strike in response was contained and appeared symbolic to avoid escalation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This time, Iran's response may be more fierce, given the embarrassment of having a foreign dignitary and top ally assassinated in the heart of its capital. Among its options are another direct assault on Israel, stepped-up attacks by its proxies in the region or hitting Israeli targets elsewhere in the world.</p>

<p>Austin, who earlier this week reiterated that the US "certainly will help defend Israel" if attacked, spoke with Gallant and is weighing moves to reinforce America's presence in the region, the Pentagon said Friday. White House spokesman John Kirby said earlier in a CNN interview that the Pentagon is ensuring it has "the right resources and capabilities" in the region, including both equipment and personnel.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>'Very Direct' Call</strong></p>

<p>Israel has stopped short of confirming it was behind killing Haniyeh, but it hasn't pushed back against the claim either. His death also came hours after Israel killed a top Hezbollah commander in Beirut, Fuad Shukr.&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Joe Biden on Thursday assured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of "new defensive US military deployments," the White House said in a statement. Biden later told reporters he also pressed the Israeli leader in a "very direct" call to agree to a cease-fire in Gaza with Hamas.</p>

<p>Biden is trying to use his last months in office to end the war, which has caused huge political divisions in the US. He's struggled to influence Netanyahu's war strategy, seeking to pressure him publicly and privately but declining to use as leverage the billions of dollars in US military aid.</p>

<p>"Meeting with senior leaders across the region, including today in Israel, we urged all sides to show restraint and dial down the tension at this critical moment," UK's Healey said in a statement. "We also need to see an immediate cease-fire, hostages released and aid getting in in sufficient quantity to alleviate the suffering in Gaza."</p>

<p><strong>'Abraham Alliance'</strong></p>

<p>While the destruction and death count among Palestinians in Gaza has drawn international criticism of Israel, Netanyahu has focused on the existential threat to his country and the region from Iran and its proxies in the so-called Axis of Resistance, which includes Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both designated terrorist organizations by the US, as well as the Houthis in Yemen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Netanyahu referred to the coordinated April defence in a controversial speech last week to a joint meeting of the US Congress, calling it a possible template for a NATO-accord he termed the "Abraham Alliance."</p>

<p>Gallant in his statement Friday said he "emphasized the importance of establishing a coalition in Israel's defence against Iran's proxies."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of Venezuelans marched across the South American country on Saturday over its contested election, as President Nicolas Maduro told supporters some 2,000 people had been arrested during protests against the results.</p>

<p>Venezuela's electoral authority, blasted by critics as favoring the ruling socialists, proclaimed Maduro the winner in last Sunday's vote, saying on Monday he obtained 51% compared to 46% for opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez. The authority reaffirmed a similar margin on Friday.</p>

<p>The published election result sparked widespread allegations of fraud and protests. Subsequently security forces cracked down on protests which Maduro's government labeled part of an attempted U.S.-backed coup.</p>

<p>"This time there will be no forgiveness," Maduro told supporters at a rally in Caracas, where he said some 2,000 people had been detained in connection to "crimes" during the protests. He pledged "maximum punishment."</p>

<p>Maduro's supporters said they were defending democracy.</p>

<p>"Today we are here heeding the call of our president ... to defend democracy," Alfredo Valera, president of Venezuela's Fontur union, who took part in a pro-government caravan in Caracas, told state television.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, opposition supporters marched to demand justice, buoyed by the presence of leader Maria Corina Machado, who emerged from hiding on Saturday to join her demonstrations on the streets of Caracas.</p>

<p>"Just as it took us a long time to achieve electoral victory, now comes a stage that we take day by day, but we have never been as strong as today, never," Machado told supporters in Caracas.</p>

<p>Supporters were happy to see Machado in the streets after the leader said in a Thursday op-ed for the Wall Street Journal that she was in hiding and feared for her life.</p>

<p>In addition to Caracas, demonstrations took place in cities including Valencia, Maracaibo and San Cristobal.</p>

<p>"I don't deny it's a little scary to see security forces pass by," said vendor Maria Luzardo, 46, in San Cristobal. "If (Machado) is brave enough to be on the streets despite the threats, so are we. Venezuela is calling us."</p>

<p>So far, at least 20 people have been killed in post-election protests, according to advocacy groups, including U.S.-based Human Rights Watch. Some 1,200 others have been arrested in connection with the demonstrations, according to the government.</p>

<p>During the week, some Venezuelans have appeared outside police stations seeking news of their detained family members.</p>

<p>The Organization of American States urged peace in Venezuela ahead of the planned demonstrations.</p>

<p>"Today we urge that there not be one more political prisoner, nor one more tortured person, nor one more disappeared person, nor one more murdered person," said the OAS, which this week called the election results unreliable.</p>

<p>Nations including the U.S. and Argentina have already recognized Gonzalez as the election's winner, with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday citing "overwhelming evidence." Costa Rica, Ecuador, Panama and Uruguay also concluded on Friday that Gonzalez received the most votes.</p>

<p>Others, including Russia, China and Cuba, have congratulated Maduro.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The killing this week of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, hours after the Israeli assassination of Hezbollah's military chief in Beirut, has triggered vows of vengeance from Iran and the so-called "axis of resistance".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Middle East tensions soared Saturday as Iran and its allies readied their response to the assassination of Hamas's political leader, blamed on Israel, spurring fears of a regional war.</p>

<p>Israel's ally the United States said it would move warships and fighter jets to the region, while Western governments called on their citizens to leave Lebanon -- where the powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah movement is based -- and airlines cancelled flights.</p>

<p>The killing this week of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, hours after the Israeli assassination of Hezbollah's military chief in Beirut, has triggered vows of vengeance from Iran and the so-called "axis of resistance".</p>

<p>Iran-backed groups from Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria have already been drawn into the nearly 10-month war between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>Israel on Saturday again traded fire with Hezbollah, carried out a deadly raid in the occupied West Bank, and struck a school compound in Gaza City in an attack that the Hamas-ruled territory's civil defence agency said killed at least 17 people.</p>

<p>Numerous schools turned into displacement shelters have been hit across Gaza in recent weeks, with Israel insisting the facilities had been used by militants. Hamas denied using civilian infrastructure for military activities.</p>

<p>Haniyeh was buried on Friday in Qatar, where he had been based. Israel, accused by Hamas, Iran and others of carrying out the attack, has not directly commented on it.</p>

<p>Iran said on Saturday it expects Hezbollah to hit deeper inside Israel and no longer be confined to military targets.</p>

<p>The Pentagon said it was bolstering its military presence in the Middle East to protect US personnel and defend Israel.</p>

<p>It said an aircraft carrier strike group led by the USS Abraham Lincoln would be deployed, as well as additional ballistic missile defence-capable cruisers and destroyers and a new fighter squadron.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden, at his beach home in Delaware, was asked by reporters if he thought Iran would stand down.</p>

<p>"I hope so," he said. "I don't know."</p>

<p>Soon after, Hezbollah announced it had fired dozens of Katyusha rockets at the northern Israeli settlement of Beit Hillel.</p>

<p>They said it was in response to an Israeli attack on Kfar Kela and Deir Siriane in southern Lebanon which, it said, had injured civilians.</p>

<p>Earlier Saturday, Hezbollah announced the deaths of two of its fighters, including a 17-year-old from Deir Siriane.</p>

<h3><strong>Take 'any ticket available'</strong></h3>

<p>In Beirut, 20-year-old student Diana Abu Aasel told AFP she feared "something bad will happen to my family and friends.</p>

<p>"If there is war, I don't think I will be able to bear staying" in Lebanon, she said.</p>

<p>Crowds of thousands rallied Saturday in Morocco, Jordan and Turkey to denounce Haniyeh's killing and show solidarity with Palestinians, AFP correspondents reported.</p>

<p>Haniyeh's killing is among a series of attacks since April that have heightened fears of a regional conflagration.</p>

<p>His death came hours after Israel struck south Beirut, killing Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr.</p>

<p>Both Britain and the United States on Satuday urged their citizens in Lebanon to leave immediately.</p>

<p>Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for its unprecedented October 7 attack which triggered war in Gaza and resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Militants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's campaign against Hamas has killed at least 39,550 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>Haniyeh was Hamas's lead negotiator in efforts to end the war. His killing raised questions about the continued viability of efforts by Qatari, Egyptian and US mediators to broker a truce and exchange of hostages and prisoners.</p>

<p>Hamas officials but also some analysts and protesters in Israel have accused Netanyahu of prolonging the war to safeguard his ruling hard-right coalition.</p>

<p>Protesters in several Israeli cities Saturday renewed their calls for a hostage-release deal.</p>

<h3><strong>Disease spreading in Gaza</strong></h3>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke separately with his French and British counterparts on Saturday about the situation in the Middle East, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.</p>

<p>Blinken, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy and French Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne all agreed on the need for restraint on all sides in the region, Miller said in a statement.</p>

<p>Violence has also surged in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Palestinian official sources said two Israeli air strikes killed nine people in the north of the territory Saturday.</p>

<p>The military said it had "eliminated terrorist cells".</p>

<p>The war in Gaza has caused widespread destruction and displaced almost the entire population of the territory where, the UN said on Friday, public health conditions "continue to deteriorate".</p>

<p>It said nearly 40,000 cases of Hepatitis A, spread by contaminated food and water, have been reported since the war began.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has been exchanging near-daily cross-border fire with Israeli forces since October, saying it is acting in support of Hamas.</p>

<p>Several airlines have suspended flights to Beirut and Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>Flights to Beirut by Air France and low-cost carrier Transavia France will remain halted until at least Tuesday, their parent company said Saturday.</p>

<p>Turkish Airlines on Saturday cancelled its night-time flights to Tehran for the second night running, AFP correspondents noted.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Regional tensions have soared following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' top leader, on Wednesday, a day after an Israeli strike in Beirut killed Fuad Shukr, a senior Hezbollah military commander.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden expressed hope Iran would stand down despite its threat to avenge the assassination of Hamas' leader in Tehran, as fears mounted that Israel's war against Palestinian militants in Gaza could escalate into a wider Middle East conflict.</p>

<p>Regional tensions have soared following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' top leader, on Wednesday, a day after an Israeli strike in Beirut killed Fuad Shukr, a senior military commander from the Lebanese group Hezbollah, which like Hamas is backed by Iran.</p>

<p>Iran and Hamas have blamed Israel for Haniyeh's killing, and they, together with Hezbollah, have vowed revenge. Israel has not claimed or denied responsibility.</p>

<p>Asked by reporters whether Iran would stand down, Biden said on Saturday in response to a shouted question, "I hope so. I don't know."</p>

<p>Seeking to bolster defenses in the Middle East in response to threats from Israel's foes, the Pentagon said on Friday it would deploy additional fighter jets and Navy warships to the region.</p>

<p>Haniyeh's death was one in a series of killings of senior Hamas figures as the Gaza war nears its 11th month, and it fuelled concern that the conflict in Gaza was turning into a wider Middle East war.</p>

<p>Hamas said it had begun a "broad consultation process" to choose a new leader three days after the assassination of Haniyeh, who was the face of the group's international diplomacy.</p>

<p>The US and international partners including France, Britain, Italy and Egypt continued diplomatic contacts on Saturday seeking to prevent further regional escalation.</p>

<p>The US urged its citizens who wish to leave Lebanon to start making plans immediately, and the British government advised its nationals to "leave now." Canada warned citizens to avoid all travel to Israel, saying the regional armed conflict endangered security.</p>

<h3><strong>VIOLENCE IN GAZA AND WEST BANK</strong></h3>

<p>Violence continued on Saturday in the Palestinian territories.</p>

<p>An Israeli airstrike on a school sheltering displaced persons in Gaza City killed at least 15 Palestinians on Saturday, hours after two strikes in the occupied West Bank killed nine militants including a local Hamas commander, Hamas said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said the first of two West Bank airstrikes hit a vehicle in a town near the city of Tulkarm, targeting a militant cell it said was on its way to carry out an attack.</p>

<p>A Hamas statement said one of those killed was a commander of its Tulkarm brigades, while its ally Islamic Jihad claimed the other four men who died in the strike as its fighters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hours later, a second airstrike in the area targeted another group of militants who had fired on troops, Israel's military said, during what it described as a counterterrorism operation in Tulkarm.</p>

<p>Palestinian news agency WAFA said four people had died in that strike, and Hamas said all nine of those killed in the two Israeli attacks in the West Bank were fighters.</p>

<p>At least 39,550 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, according to Gaza health officials. The offensive was triggered by a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7 in which 1,200 people were killed and 250 abducted, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>A high-level Israeli delegation made a brief visit to Cairo on Saturday in an attempt to resume Gaza ceasefire negotiations, Egyptian airport authority sources said. The Israeli officials returned to Israel hours later, Israeli media said.</p>

<p>Chances of a breakthrough appear low following the latest incidents in Lebanon and Iran.</p>

<p>Israel has not said whether or not it was behind Haniyeh's assassination. But Netanyahu said earlier this week that Israel had delivered crushing blows to Iran's proxies of late, including Hamas and Hezbollah.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Vatican said on Saturday it had been saddened by a skit at the Paris Olympics opening ceremony appearing to parody Leonardo da Vinci's "The Last Supper" painting.</p>

<p>"The Holy See was saddened by certain scenes at the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympic Games and cannot but join the voices raised in recent days to deplore the offence done to many Christians and believers of other religions," it said in an unusual weekend evening press release issued in French.</p>

<p>The segment in the July 26 ceremony resembled the biblical scene of Jesus Christ and his apostles sharing a last meal before crucifixion, but featured drag queens, a transgender model and a naked singer as the Greek god of wine Dionysus.</p>

<p>Paris 2024 organizers apologised two days later, saying there was never an intention to disrespect any religious group.</p>

<p>The artistic director behind the scene said it had not been inspired by the Christian last supper, but rather a pagan feast linked to the historical Olympics.</p>

<p>"In a prestigious event where the whole world comes together around common values, there should not be allusions ridiculing the religious convictions of many people," the Vatican added.</p>

<p>"Freedom of expression, which is obviously not called into question, finds its limit in respect for others."</p>

<p>The Vatican did not say why it was issuing its statement more than a week after the opening ceremony.</p>

<p>Pope Francis had a phone call on Aug. 1 with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, at which Erdogan said the two leaders had discussed the Paris event.</p>

<p>Although the Vatican later confirmed to Reuters that the call took place, it would not comment on what the leaders discussed.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Renewed street violence in British cities on Saturday left several police officers injured as they faced a fourth day of unrest following the murder of three young girls in northwest England earlier in the week.</p>

<p>Riots involving hundreds of anti-immigration protesters have erupted in several towns and cities in recent days after false information spread rapidly on social media that the suspect in Monday's knife attack at a dance class for children in Southport was a radical Muslim migrant.</p>

<p>Police have said the suspect, Axel Rudakubana, 17, was born in Cardiff, Wales, but protests by anti-immigration and anti-Muslim demonstrators have continued, descending into violence and rioting, most recently in the northeastern city of Sunderland on Friday evening.</p>

<p>Police in Liverpool said on Saturday that a number of officers had been injured while dealing with "serious disorder" in the city centre.</p>

<p>Authorities in the eastern city of Hull said four people were arrested and three officers were injured while dealing with protests where bottles were thrown.</p>

<p>Mosques across the country have been advised to strengthen security, while police have deployed extra officers.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer, facing his first big test since being elected a month ago, has condemned the "far-right" for the violence and backed police to take strong action. He discussed the disorder with senior ministers on Saturday, his office said.</p>

<p>The last time major widespread violence erupted in Britain was in 2011 when thousands took to the streets for five nights after police shot dead a Black man in London.</p>

<p>Reuters witnesses in Liverpool, Leeds, Manchester and Belfast reported a tense atmosphere on Saturday afternoon as police tried to keep several hundred rival protesters who were chanting slogans from clashing.</p>

<p>Scuffles and violence broke out in some cities, including in Liverpool, where eggs, beer cans and smoke grenades were thrown, while in Belfast, some businesses reported damage to property.</p>

<p>"I have no reason why they attacked us," said Rahmi Akyol, standing outside his cafe in Belfast, whose glass doors were shattered after being attacked by dozens of people throwing bottles and chairs.</p>

<p>"I've lived here 35 years. My kids, my wife is from here. I don't know what to say, it's terrible," he said.</p>

<p>At protests in London, police arrested several people including one for making a Nazi salute towards a counter-protester.</p>

<p>On Friday night hundred of anti-immigration demonstrators in Sunderland threw stones at police in riot gear near a mosque, before overturning vehicles, setting a car alight and starting a fire near a police station.</p>

<p>Four injured police officers were taken to hospital and 12 people were arrested, Mark Hall, chief police superintendent of the Sunderland area, told reporters on Saturday.</p>

<p>"This was not a protest. This was unforgivable violence and disorder," Hall said.</p>

<p>At least 30 demonstrations were being planned across the UK this weekend, the BBC said, along with a number of counter-protests by anti-racism groups.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a press release)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

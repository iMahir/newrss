       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian lawmakers passed landmark rules to ban under 16s from social media on Thursday, approving one of the world's toughest crackdowns on popular sites like Facebook, Instagram and X.</p>

<p>The bill has now passed both parliamentary chambers with bipartisan support, and social media firms will soon be expected to take "reasonable steps" to prevent young teens from having accounts.</p>

<p>The firms -- who face fines of up to Aus$50 million (US$32.5 million) for failing to comply -- have described the laws as "vague", "problematic" and "rushed".</p>

<p>The legislation passed parliament's lower chamber on Wednesday and passed the Senate late on Thursday evening. It is now all but certain to become law.</p>

<p>Centre-left Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, eyeing an election early next year, has enthusiastically championed the new rules and rallied Aussie parents to get behind it.</p>

<p>In the run up to the vote, he painted social media as "a platform for peer pressure, a driver of anxiety, a vehicle for scammers and, worst of all, a tool for online predators".</p>

<p>He wanted, he said, young Australians "off their phones and onto the footy and cricket field, the tennis and netball courts, in the swimming pool".</p>

<p><strong>- 'I'll find a way' -</strong></p>

<p>But young Australians like 12-year-old Angus Lydom, are not impressed.</p>

<p>"I'd like to keep using it. And it'll be a weird feeling to not have it, and be able to talk to all my friends at home," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Many are likely to try to find ways around it.</p>

<p>"I'll find a way. And so will all my other friends" Lydom said.</p>

<p>Similarly, 11-year-old Elsie Arkinstall said there was still a place for social media, particularly for children wanting to watch tutorials about baking or art, many of which appear on social media.</p>

<p>"Kids and teens should be able to explore those techniques because you can't learn all those things from books," she added.</p>

<p>On paper, the ban is one of the strictest in the world.</p>

<p>But the current legislation offers almost no details on how the rules will be enforced -- prompting concern among experts that it will simply be a symbolic piece of legislation that is unenforceable.</p>

<p>It will be at least 12 months before the details are worked out by regulators and the ban comes into effect.</p>

<p>Some companies will likely be granted exemptions, such as WhatsApp and YouTube, which teenagers may need to use for recreation, school work or other reasons.</p>

<p>Late amendments were introduced to ensure government-issued digital ID cannot be used as a means of age verification.</p>

<p><strong>- Australia leads the way -</strong></p>

<p>Social media expert Susan Grantham told AFP that digital literacy programmes that teach children to think "critically" about what they see online should be adopted -- similar to a model used in Finland.</p>

<p>The legislation will be closely monitored by other countries, with many weighing whether to implement similar bans.</p>

<p>Lawmakers from Spain to Florida have proposed social media bans for young teens, although none of the measures have been implemented yet.</p>

<p>China has restricted access for minors since 2021, with under-14s not allowed to spend more than 40 minutes a day on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok.</p>

<p>Online gaming time for children is also limited in China.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A young gorilla at a Canadian zoo died after a staff member accidentally crushed its head with a hydraulic door. According to the <em>New York Post</em>, the incident took place on November 12 at the Calgary Zoo in Alberta. Eyare, a 2-year-old western lowland gorilla, was "roaming bedroom to bedroom" with its gorilla mates when a staffer was trying to separate it from the troop for a solo training session, the zoo said in a statement. However, the carer "mistakenly activated the wrong door, resulting in Eyare being struck by the door and sustaining traumatic head injuries," it added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The gorilla team retrieved Eyare from the troop and the veterinary team immediately commenced lifesaving measures, including CPR. Sadly, Eyare succumbed to her injuries," said Colleen Baird, the zoo's director of animal care, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/26/world-news/gorilla-crushed-to-death-due-to-zoo-carers-human-error/"><em>Post</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This tragedy has struck us all in the deepest way imaginable. Eyare's short but impactful life brought so much joy to our community, and she will be deeply missed by all. We will do everything we can to prevent future incidents," Mr Baird added.</p>

<p>Separately, the zoo said that the death "was determined to be an accident caused by human error". &nbsp;The staff member involved in the incident was immediately removed from the workplace and will be reassigned to another area of the zoo, they continued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to authorities, other staff will also face fresh training. The zoo will implement preventive measures - including animal behavioural training - to avoid another incident like this in the future. Moreover, the zoo is also looking at safer alternatives to hydraulic doors "to enhance overall safety and improve staff confidence while reducing safety risks".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the incident, Animal Justice, a Canadian nonprofit that advocates for the humane treatment of animals, called for an independent investigation into animal safety and oversight at the Alberta facility. "The Calgary Zoo appears to have a higher rate of animal deaths compared to other zoos, and in light of Eyare's death there should be a systematic review of the zoo's operations and practices, conducted transparently by the government or another outside party," said Camille Labchuk, the nonprofit's executive director, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/22/americas/calgary-zoo-gorilla-death/index.html" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>CNN</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the Calgary zoo refuted the claim, saying that they adhere to operational standards and have upheld accreditation by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' independent Accreditation Commission since 1978.</p>

<p>"We love and care for more than 4,000 animals representing over 100 species that call our zoo home. Animal deaths caused by human error are extraordinarily rare. In the past 10 years, we have experienced two such losses-a North American river otter in 2016 and 'Eyare' last week," a spokesperson for the Calgary Zoo said in a statement to <em>CNN</em>.</p>

<p>"While uncommon, even one human-caused mortality is one too many. These tragic incidents have been used as critical learning opportunities, driving us to review and to strengthen protocols to uphold the highest standards of care," they added.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>90 missiles and 100 drones is what Russia attacked Ukraine's energy infrastructure overnight with. Currently, more than one million people are without electricity as bitter winter hits with Russia's "massive strike".</p>

<p>This is the 11th large-scale attack by Russia on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year causing blackouts nationwide.</p>

<p>Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of "weaponising winter" and stockpiling missiles to launch pre-winter aerial campaigns in Ukraine. "They were helped by their crazy allies, including from North Korea," Andrii Yermak, head of Ukraine's presidential office wrote in a Telegram post.</p>

<p>At least 5 people were injured, one person in central Vinnytsia, two in Odesa and two in Kyiv. Residents took shelter in metro stations as the air raid alert continued for 9 hours. Around 215,000 households were temporarily without power as stated by authorities.</p>

<p>"Power engineers are working to ensure backup power supply schemes where possible. They have already started restoration work where the security situation allows," the Ministry of Energy said.</p>

<p>Russian president Vladimir Putin has said this is a response to Ukraine's attacks with UK and US supplied weapons.</p>

<p>As stated by Ukraine's president Vlodymyr Zelenskyy, cluster munitions were particularly used against civilians and energy infrastructure. He has called the attack out as a "very mean escalation" in the conflict.</p>

<p>"I have a power bank for charging my phone, but I did not buy a more powerful station because I did not take it seriously that there would be such attacks and that missiles would reach us. But it did reach us," Valeriy Dorotiy, a resident of Lutsk, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/28/europe/ukraine-russia-war-power-cut-intl-hnk/index.html" rel="noindex,nofollow">CNN.</a></p>

<p>Roman Turiy, a resident of Ivano-Frankivsk said that, "I expected to be without power for three hours, but according to the new schedule, it looks like we will be without electricity for eight hours today" adding that every winter is getting harder in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Zelensky urged allies for help regarding air defence systems saying that attacks like this prove that the systems save lives.</p>

<p>Ukraine's largest private energy company, DTEK, said that its plants had been attacked more than 190 times since the start of the conflict as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy15lp21l3o" rel="noindex,nofollow">BBC</a>.</p>

<p>Speaking of Russian arms capabilities, Putin said "Let no one forget about the Kalibr systems, the Kinzhal and Tsirkon hypersonic missile systems that are in our arsenal, which have no analogues in the world in terms of their characteristics." He added that their production is being increased in full swing and that the Ukrainian leaders are "begging their masters for other military equipment".</p>

<p>Putin declared that Russia reserves the right to attack military targets in countries that permit their weapons to be used against Russia.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[The High Court on Thursday refused to ban ISKCON's activities in Bangladesh, a local newspaper reported days after a lawyer was killed in a clash between security personnel and supporters of a Hindu leader arrested on sedition charges.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The High Court on Thursday refused to ban ISKCON's activities in Bangladesh, a local newspaper reported days after a lawyer was killed in a clash between security personnel and supporters of a Hindu leader arrested on sedition charges.</p>

<p>The lawyer had sought a ban from the high court on the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) after placing some newspaper reports related to the organisation on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The court had asked the attorney general to inform it about the steps taken by the government regarding ISKCON's recent activities, according to The Daily Star.</p>

<p>Hindu leader Chinmoy Krishna Das, who was arrested this week, was earlier expelled from ISKCON. His arrest triggered clashes on Tuesday during which Advocate Saiful Islam, an assistant public prosecutor, was killed.</p>

<p>When the High Court proceedings started on Thursday, the attorney general's office placed the information sought by the court before the bench of Justice Farah Mahbub and Justice Debasish Roy Chowdhury, The Daily Star said.</p>

<p>Additional Attorney General Aneek R Haque and Deputy Attorney General Asad Uddin informed the HC bench that three separate cases have been filed in connection with the murder of lawyer Saiful Islam Alif and ISKCON's activities, and 33 accused have been arrested in these cases.</p>

<p>The bench then hoped that the government would remain cautious about protecting the law and order situation and lives and properties of the people of Bangladesh, the newspaper added.</p>

<p>India on Tuesday noted with "deep concern" Chinmoy Das' arrest and denial of bail, and urged Dhaka to ensure the safety and security of Hindus and all other minority groups.</p>

<p>Separately, a group of Supreme Court lawyers sent a legal notice to Bangladesh government on Wednesday seeking a ban on ISKCON describing it as a "radical organisation." The notice, sent by Al Mamun Russell on behalf of 10 lawyers, also demanded prosecution of those responsible for Advocate Islam's murder, The Dhaka Tribune newspaper said quoting the notice.</p>

<p>"ISKCON has been operating in Bangladesh as a radical organisation, engaging in activities designed to provoke communal unrest," the notice alleged.</p>

<p>Citing a book by former Bangladeshi intelligence officials, the notice alleges that ISKCON has been promoting religious events "with the intent of inciting sectarian violence," "imposing its beliefs on traditional Hindu communities," and forcibly recruiting members from lower Hindu castes, the newspaper said.</p>

<p>Russel's notice was addressed to the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Law and Justice, and the Inspector General of Police and called for an immediate ban on ISKCON in Bangladesh under relevant section of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 2009.</p>

<p>Earlier, the ISKCON had urged the Bangladesh authorities to promote "peaceful coexistence" for Hindus in the country as it "strongly" denounced Chinmoy Das' arrest.</p>

<p>Chinmoy Das, the spokesperson for Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote, was arrested from Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Monday as he was about to fly to Chattogram to join a rally.</p>

<p>He was denied bail and sent to jail by the Chattogram's Sixth Metropolitan Magistrate court in a sedition case on Tuesday.</p>

<p>In a statement on Tuesday, ISKCON Bangladesh General Secretary Charu Chandra Das Brahmachari said, "We express our serious concern and strongly denounce the recent arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das ... We also condemn the subsequent violence and attacks against Sanatanis in various regions of Bangladesh."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A female stowaway on Tuesday bypassed multiple security checkpoints at New York's John F Kennedy International Airport and onto a Paris-bound Delta Airlines flight without a boarding pass or identification. According to the <em>New York Post</em>, the unidentified woman took advantage of the holiday madness to bypass two identity verification and boarding status stations to board the aircraft. She completed a full security screening before boarding, a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) spokesperson said, meaning that she did not have any prohibited items in tow and did not pose a security threat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"TSA can confirm that an individual without a boarding pass completed security screening (including on-person and bags) without any prohibited items," a TSA spokesperson told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/27/us-news/female-stowaway-found-on-delta-flight-to-paris-after-sneaking-past-jfk-security/" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>The Post</em></a>. "The individual bypassed two identity verification and boarding status stations and boarded the aircraft," they added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Citing a passenger, the outlet reported that the woman was eventually discovered in the bathroom by a flight attendant toward the end of the more than seven-hour flight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Passengers weren't initially alerted about the stowaway, but once the plane landed in Paris, the plane crew announced that the French police were going to board that aircraft to deal with a "serious security issue".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Folks, this is the captain, we are just waiting for the police to come on board. They may be here now and they directed us to keep everyone on the airplane until we sort out the extra passenger that's on the plane," the captain announced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's unclear how the person bypassed the boarding stations. It also remains unclear if the passenger was arrested. Delta Airlines did not provide any additional information as the investigation is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Nothing is of greater importance than matters of safety and security," a Delta spokesperson said in a statement. "That's why Delta is conducting an exhaustive investigation of what may have occurred and will work collaboratively with other aviation stakeholders and law enforcement to that end," they added.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina today spoke out about the arrest of a Hindu priest in her country. She also spoke about the death of a lawyer who was killed during clashes arising out a protest after the monk's arrest.</p>

<p>"A top leader of Sanatan religious community has been unjustly arrested, he must be released immediately. A temple has been burnt in Chittagong. Previously, mosques, shrines, churches, monasteries and homes of the Ahmadiyya community were attacked, vandalized and looted and set on fire," she said.</p>

<p>"Religious freedom and security of life and property of people of all communities should be ensured," she added.</p>

<p>Highlighting serious concerns over Bangladesh's interim government's ability to handle the economy and law and order, Ms Hasina said, "The current power grabbers are showing failure in all areas. Failed to control the prices of daily necessities, failed to provide security for people's lives. Strongly condemn these tortures directly and indirectly on common people."</p>

<p>Ms Hasina also slammed the interim government in Bangladesh for the rise in incidents of violence which led to the death of a lawyer in Chittagong. She also warned that if the interim government fails to punish terrorists, it will face the punishment of "gross human rights violations".</p>

<p>"A lawyer has been killed in Chittagong, strongly protesting this murder. Those involved in this murder should be found and punished quickly. Human rights have been grossly violated through this incident. A lawyer went to perform his professional duties, and those who beat him to death are terrorists. Whoever they are must be punished," Ms Hasina said.</p>

<p>"If the unconstitutionally usurped Yunus govt fails to punish these terrorists, it will also face punishment for human rights violations. I appeal to the people of the country to stand united against this kind of terrorism and militancy. It is important to ensure the safety of the lives and property of the common people," she added.</p>

<p>Holding the Yunus government responsible for the crisis in Bangladesh, the former prime minister said, "After the killing of innumerable Awami League leaders and workers, students and members of law and order forces, harassment is going on through assaults and arrests. I strongly condemn and protest these anarchist&nbsp;activities."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Mission here has issued a security alert urging its citizens not to visit Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in northwest Pakistan until December 16 due to "security concerns."</p>

<p>The security alert titled 'Threat to Serena Hotel, Peshawar' advising the US Mission personnel to avoid the said hotel in Peshawar, the capital of the province, was issued on Wednesday and advised caution with immediate effect.</p>

<p>"US citizens are encouraged to avoid the hotel and the area around the hotel during this period and reconsider travel plans," the statement read and reminded the US citizens to revisit the 'Do Not Travel' advisory issued in September for the same province "due to terrorism."</p>

<p>The September 10 advisory lists the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at 'Level 4' of the threat perception in the 'Do Not Travel' category.</p>

<p>"Active terrorist and insurgent groups routinely conduct attacks against civilians, non-governmental organisations, government offices, and security forces.</p>

<p>"These groups historically have targeted both government officials and civilians. Assassination and kidnapping attempts are common, including the targeting of polio eradication teams and government of Pakistan security service (police and military) personnel," it reads.</p>

<p>There has been an uptick in terror activities and attacks on security personnel in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province over the last few months.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As incidents of violence and vandalism against the minority Hindu community see a sharp upturn in Bangladesh, questions were asked in the Parliament of India out of concern for human rights violations.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As incidents of violence and vandalism against the minority Hindu community see a sharp upturn in Bangladesh, questions were asked in the Parliament of India out of concern for human rights violations.</p>

<p>Some of the questions included whether there has been an increase in the incidents of desecration and damages to Hindu temples and deities in Bangladesh, and if the Government of India has "taken up the issue" with the interim government in Bangladesh. Answers were sought over the response of the Bangladesh government and the efforts made by Dhaka to stop such incidents.</p>

<p>Acknowledging the attacks on Bangladesh's Hindu minority, the junior minister of external affairs told parliamentarians that "Several incidents of desecration and damages to Hindu temples and deities in Bangladesh have been reported in the past few months. The Government of India has expressed its concerns about such incidents, including the attack on a <em>Puja mandap</em> in Tantibazar, Dhaka and the theft at the Jeshoreshwari Kali temple at Satkhira during <em>Durga Puja</em> 2024. The Government has also called upon the Government of Bangladesh to ensure the safety and security of Hindus and all minorities and their places of worship."</p>

<p>In a response to questions by MPs, The Minister of State for External Affairs, Kirti Vardhan Singh told Members of Parliament that "The primary responsibility for the protection of life and liberty of all citizens of Bangladesh, including minorities, rests with the Government of Bangladesh."</p>

<h2><strong>THE THEFT AT JESHORESHWARI KALI TEMPLE</strong></h2>

<p>In early October, the crown of goddess Kali had been stolen from the Jeshoreshwari temple in Satkhira's Shyamnagar. This crown was gifted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to the temple in March, 2021.</p>

<p>The theft happened in broad daylight - between 2.00 pm and 2.30 pm - after temple priest Dilip Mukherjee left following the day's worship. The cleaning staff later found that the crown was missing from the deity's head.</p>

<p>The stolen crown, made of silver and gold-plated, holds significant cultural and religious importance. According to Hindu scriptures, the Jeshoreshwari Temple is one of the 51 Shakti Peeths scattered across India (and now neighboring countries). The name "Jeshoreshwari" means "Goddess of Jeshore."</p>

<h3><strong>RECENT INCIDENTS OF TEMPLE ATTACKS IN BANGLADESH</strong></h3>

<p>Hindu temples are being targeted by mobs in Bangladesh's Chattogram. The arrest of former ISKCON leader Chinmoy Krishna Das has triggered protests across Bangladesh, with the community calling for the monk's release and justice for Hindus who have faced persecution since the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>At least three temples - Lokonath Temple in Firangi Bazar, Mansa Mata Temple, and Kali Mata Temple in Hazari Lane - have reportedly been targeted in Chattogram.</p>

<p>International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) spokesperson, Radharamn Das, shared a purported video of a mob attack on a Hindu temple on his X account and wrote, "24x7 attack on Hindus &amp; Hindu places of worship in #Bangladesh. When will it all STOP?"</p>

<p>ISKCON Bangladesh also issued a statement denouncing the arrest of the Hindu monk and subsequent violence and attacks against Sanatanis in various parts of Bangladesh. "Chinmoy Krishna Das and the Sanatani Community deserve justice as citizens of this country, and we stress that any form of discrimination against them must not be tolerated," it read.</p>

<h3><strong>ARREST OF HINDU PRIEST IN BANGLADESH</strong></h3>

<p>Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, a Hindu priest and a religious minority leader in Bangladesh, was arrested in Dhaka earlier this week amid tensions over minority rights in the country that has seen widespread political violence since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster.</p>

<p>The arrest follows protests led by the Hindu community in the city of Rangpur, located nearly 300 km north of Dhaka, demanding stronger legal protections and a ministry dedicated to minority affairs.</p>

<p>Chandan Kumar Dhar Prokash alias Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari is a spokesperson of the Sanatan Jagaran Mancha. He was the former head of ISKCON-operated religious site named Pundarik Dham in Chittagong.</p>

<p>The monk was detained by the Detective Branch (DB) of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Monday and was arrested later on Sedation charges.</p>

<p>"A case has been filed against Chimnoy in charge of sedition, accusing him of hoisting a flag on the top of a stand of Bangladesh's national flag. But the man who filed the case, now he is not attached to the case. He is now disagreed to continue the case," a minority leader said.</p>

<p>Citing sources in ISKCON Chittagong, Dhaka Tribune reported that Chinmoy Krishna hails from the port city's Satkania Upazila. He reportedly earned the nickname 'Shishu Bokta' due to his popularity as a religious preacher from an early age. He served as the Chittagong Divisional Secretary of ISKCON from 2016 to 2022 and has also been the Principal of Pundarik Dham in Hathazari, since 2007.</p>

<p>Chinmoy Krishna Das's arrest came amid tensions over minority rights in the South Asian country that has seen widespread political violence since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster. Hindus comprise approximately 8 per cent of Bangladesh's 170 million people. Since the ouster of former PM Sheikh Hasina, the new military-backed interim government led by Mohammed Yunus has faced criticism for failing to curb a spike in violence against minorities.</p>

<h3><strong>BANGLADESH CALLS ISKCON "RELIGIOUS FUNDAMENTALIST" GROUP</strong></h3>

<p>Bangladesh has called ISKCON, or the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, a "religious fundamentalist" group in an affidavit filed in that country's High Court. The interim government also said it is "examining ISKCON".</p>

<p>The reference to ISKON as a "religious fundamentalist" organisation was part of the Bangladesh Attorney General's response to a question about the origin of the group in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>This happened closely on the heels of protests over the arrest Hindu priest Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari earlier this week. This happened after the Hindu community in the city of Rangpur, which is 300 km north of Dhaka, protested demanding stronger laws to protect them and a minority affairs ministry.</p>

<p>New Delhi has expressed strong reservations over Chinmoy Brahmachari's arrest and urged Dhaka to ensure the safety of minority communities, including Hindus. The Bangladesh Foreign Ministry, however, has bristled at what they said was India's interference in its "internal affairs".</p>

<p>Since Sheikh Hasina was forced to step down as prime minister, the new military-backed interim administration, led by Nobel laureate Mohammed Yunus, has faced criticism for failing to control violence against minorities. This includes instances of Hindu businesses and homes being vandalised.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A young South African activist living with HIV will take over Oscar-winning actress Charlize Theron's Instagram account on World AIDS Day, the United Nations said Thursday.</p>

<p>Ibanomonde Ngema, a 21-year-old activist, will be given the reins to the South African-born actress's global account @charlizeafrica, with some 7.6 million followers, on December 1, UNAIDS said in a statement.</p>

<p>The takeover by Ngema, who was born with HIV and has dedicated her advocacy work to dispelling myths and reducing stigma around HIV, will aim to bring awareness to the first-hand experiences of young people living with HIV, it said.</p>

<p>Theron, a so-called UN Messenger of Peace who has long advocated for tackling the systemic inequalities that drive HIV infections among young women and girls, insisted in the statement that "ending AIDS is within reach".</p>

<p>But, she warned, "only if we completely dismantle harmful patterns of stigma and discrimination through laws, policies, and practices that protect people living with HIV".</p>

<p>Theron won a best actress Oscar for her lead role in the 2004 film "Monster" and has more recently starred in pictures such as "Mad Max: Fury Road".</p>

<p>"I have always loved watching Charlize Theron on the big screen and have long been inspired by her using her influence to help people around the world, especially in our home country of South Africa," Ngema said in the statement.</p>

<p>The announcement came after UNAIDS this week released a new report that showed how rights violations exacerbate the vulnerability of women and girls to HIV.</p>

<p>Last year, women and girls accounted for 62 percent of all new HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa, UNAIDS said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A blizzard has left South Korea grappling with very heavy snowfall for a second day on Thursday, with dozens of flights cancelled, ferry operations suspended and at least five people reported dead in a cold snap, though conditions showed signs of easing.</p>

<p>The snowfall was the third-heaviest in Seoul, the capital, since records began in 1907, the Yonhap news agency said, citing data from the city.</p>

<p>"It's been snowing a lot today," said 73-year-old Lee Sook-ja as she tucked into some soup at Namdaemun market, one of the biggest in Seoul. "It's freezing and chilly, but having a cup of hot fish cake soup really helps warm me up."</p>

<p>More than 40 cm (16 inches) of snow piled up in parts of Seoul by Thursday morning, forcing the cancellation of more than 140 flights, although weather officials subsequently lifted heavy snow warnings in the city's metropolitan area.</p>

<p>Yonhap reported at least five snowfall-related deaths in the province of Gyeonggi adjoining Seoul since Wednesday, four people when structures collapsed under the weight of snow, and one in a traffic accident when a bus skidded on an icy road.</p>

<p>Police said 11 people were injured on Wednesday evening in a 53-vehicle pile-up on a highway in the central city of Wonju in Gangwon province.</p>

<p>Seoul's main airport, Incheon, was the worst affected, with passengers facing delays of about two hours on average, while 31% of flights were delayed and 16% cancelled on Thursday, plane tracking website Flightradar24 showed.</p>

<p>By noon, about 1,285 schools including kindergartens closed in Gyeonggi province, authorities said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Actor-comedian Vir Das made history this week as the first Indian to host the International Emmy Awards in New York. From tech billionaire Elon Musk to US President-elect Donald Trump, Mr Das' monologue spared no one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Das used the platform to deliver a blend of biting satire and global observations, poking fun at cultural stereotypes, global politics, and industry power dynamics. His commentary has since gone viral.</p>

<p>Opening his monologue with a tongue-in-cheek nod to immigration concerns, Mr Das quipped, "It is very good to be here completely legally. I'm not a citizen. It's a very quick visit, in and out. I was just here to vote."</p>

<p>Mr Das saved his sharpest commentary for tech magnate Elon Musk and Donald Trump. Referencing Mr Musk's potential involvement in President Trump's government, he sarcastically praised US voters:<br />
"You have picked someone to lead you, to make all of your decisions and be the most powerful person in the world, and I think you chose well. Yes, he says erratic things, but he's intelligent, successful, and an amazing businessperson. Guys, Elon Musk is a legend."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I was so grateful to host the International Emmy Awards ??? <a href="https://twitter.com/iemmys?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@iemmys</a> Did a monologue to very formal, very beautiful people from across the world about...well... <a href="https://t.co/JZoyhgN1Mg">pic.twitter.com/JZoyhgN1Mg</a></p>
— Vir Das (@thevirdas) <a href="https://twitter.com/thevirdas/status/1861987402627092890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>"Technically it's self-driving, but ultimately, I have control," Mr Das' quipped about Mr Musk running the government as if it were a Tesla self-driving car. &nbsp;"Keep Elon Musk happy. Alright? He will buy your platform and turn it into a podcast."</p>

<p>In a comedic slip, he joked about the consequences of divisive speech. "Please do not come up on this platform and say anything divisive, offensive, or inflammatory because this is America, and you will be elected. Sorry. Ejected," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Das' appearance at the International Emmys wasn't his first brush with the global stage. In 2023, he won critical acclaim for his Netflix special 'Landing', which earned him an Emmy award.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Under the terms of the deal that brought the war to a halt, the Lebanese military started reinforcing its presence in the country's south, where Hezbollah has long held sway.</p>

<p>The war escalated after nearly a year of cross-border fire launched by the militant group in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas, whose attack on Israel in October last year sparked the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>It killed thousands of people in Lebanon and triggered mass displacements on both sides of the border.</p>

<p>Israel shifted its focus from Gaza to Lebanon in September to secure its northern border from Hezbollah attacks, dealing the movement a series of heavy blows.</p>

<p>The Iran-backed group has emerged from the war significantly weakened, including the killing in an Israeli air raid of its longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah.</p>

<p>But that did not stop it from proclaiming "victory" over Israel in a statement released Wednesday.</p>

<p>"Victory from God almighty was the ally of the righteous cause," the Hezbollah statement said.</p>

<p>Hezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah told AFP that his group was cooperating on the Lebanese army's deployment in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>There is "full cooperation" with the Lebanese state in strengthening the army's deployment, he said, adding that the group had "no visible weapons or bases" but "nobody can make residents leave their villages".</p>

<p>The road from the Lebanese capital to the south was jammed from before dawn with thousands of people heading home.</p>

<p>AFP journalists saw cars and minibuses packed with people carrying mattresses, suitcases and blankets, with some honking their horns and singing in celebration.</p>

<p>"What we feel is indescribable," said one Lebanese driver on the road to the south. "The people have won!"</p>

<p>Others, however, voiced quiet desolation.</p>

<p>Returning to his home in the southern town of Nabatieh, Ali Mazraani said he was shocked by the extent of the devastation from the raids.</p>

<p>"Is this really Nabatieh?" he asked. "All our memories of Nabatieh have disappeared, and we can't recognise our own town."</p>

<p><strong>Final hours</strong></p>

<p>In Lebanon, more than 900,000 people fled their homes in recent weeks, according to the United Nations, as Israel pounded the country, focusing in particular on Hezbollah strongholds.</p>

<p>Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri called on the displaced to go back to their homes despite the devastation.</p>

<p>"I invite you to return to your homes... return to your land," said Berri, who led negotiations on behalf of his ally Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Najib Mikati urged Israel to respect the terms of the truce and said Lebanon was turning the page on "one of the most painful phases that the Lebanese have lived in their modern history".</p>

<p>Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari said: "We control positions in the south of Lebanon, our planes continue to fly in Lebanese airspace."</p>

<p>He added that Israel "arrested suspects and killed terrorists" on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Lebanon says at least 3,823 people have been killed in the country since exchanges of fire across the border began in October 2023, most of them in recent weeks.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, the hostilities with Hezbollah have killed at least 82 soldiers and 47 civilians, authorities there say.</p>

<p>The final hours before the truce took hold at 4:00 am (0200 GMT) on Wednesday were among the most violent, particularly for Beirut, with Israeli strikes hitting areas including the busy commercial district of Hamra.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, too, continued to claim attacks on Israel all the way up to the start of the truce.</p>

<p>The Israeli and Lebanese militaries have both called on residents of frontline Lebanese villages to avoid returning home immediately.</p>

<p>Hezbollah-backer Iran welcomed the end of what it called Israel's aggression in Lebanon, while Hamas said it was ready for a truce in Gaza.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden is to launch a renewed drive for an elusive ceasefire and hostage release deal for the Palestinian territory, his national security adviser said.</p>

<p>Jake Sullivan said Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu right before the truce with Hezbollah was announced on Tuesday and they agreed to try again.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said the truce in Lebanon would permit Israel to redirect its efforts back to Gaza, where it has been at war with Hamas since October last year.</p>

<p>"When Hezbollah is out of the picture, Hamas is left alone in the fight. Our pressure on it will intensify," Netanyahu said.</p>

<p>The Gaza health ministry said an air strike killed nine people in the north of the Hamas-run territory on Wednesday as Israel kept up its bombardment on the day the Lebanon ceasefire took hold.</p>

<p>The ministry said the strike hit a shelter for displaced people in Al-Tabi'een School in Gaza City.</p>

<p><strong>60 days</strong></p>

<p>Under the ceasefire deal, Israeli forces will hold their positions but "a 60-day period will commence in which the Lebanese military and security forces will begin their deployment towards the south", a US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told reporters.</p>

<p>Then Israel will begin a phased withdrawal without a vacuum forming that Hezbollah or others could rush into, the official said.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, an AFP journalist saw Lebanese troops and vehicles deploying in two areas of south Lebanon.</p>

<p>"The army has begun reinforcing its presence in the South Litani sector and extending the state's authority in coordination with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)," the military said in a statement, referring to areas south of the Litani River within 30 kilometres (20 miles) of the Israeli border.</p>

<p><strong>'It feels safer'</strong></p>

<p>While the mood in Lebanon was of joy tempered by devastating loss, in Israel there was no indication of a return en masse of the 60,000 people driven from their homes by Hezbollah fire.</p>

<p>"On one hand, we are happy about the ceasefire because it feels safer, our children can go back to school," said 43-year-old Yuri, a resident of Kibbutz Yiron near the Lebanese border, who fled to the northern city of Haifa.</p>

<p>"On the other hand... Hezbollah still has forces, and we don't see when this will truly come to an end."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities from dozens of countries seized 225 metric tons of cocaine in a six-week mega-operation where they unearthed a new Pacific trafficking route from South America to Australia, the Colombian Navy said Wednesday.</p>

<p>The latest phase of global naval operation "Orion" resulted in the seizure of more than 1,400 tons of drugs, including 225 tons of cocaine and 128 tons of marijuana, Navy official Orlando Enrique Grisales told reporters.</p>

<p>More than 400 people were arrested in the operation targeting oceans, coasts, rivers and ports around the globe in October and November.</p>

<p>The massive bust involved the security agencies of the United States, Brazil, Spain, the Netherlands and several other nations, as well as multiple international organizations.</p>

<p>The seizure deprived drug cartels of more than $8.4 billion dollars, according to a Navy statement.</p>

<p>Grisales said officials also seized a semisubmersible wood-and-fiber glass vessel on its way to Australia with five tons of Colombian cocaine.</p>

<p>This was the third such vessel discovered in this area, revealing a "new route" of trafficking with sophisticated boats that can cover the distance of some 10,000 miles without needing to refuel.</p>

<p>A kilogram of cocaine is sold for up to $240,000 in Australia, said Grisales -- about six times more than the price in the United States.</p>

<p>"It is a route that is becoming increasingly profitable because prices are much higher in Australia," a security source told AFP.</p>

<p>"Initially, these boats were used mainly to take the drugs out of the country and move them off the coast of Colombia and then transfer them to ships," added the source.</p>

<p>"It has been found that these semisubmersibles, sometimes even submersibles, are now increasingly sophisticated, with very fine engineering."</p>

<p>The operation also uncovered previously-unknown alliances between cartels from Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru with groups from Europe and Oceania.</p>

<p>"It is not just a pyramid structure as the cartels once were. Today they are organized crime networks joined together," said Grisales.</p>

<p>Colombia is the world's biggest cocaine producer and exporter, mainly to the United States and Europe.</p>

<p>Last year, the South American country set a new record for cocaine production and cultivation of the coca leaf it is made from.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Used as folk medicine, a spoonful of deli bal on a daily basis lowers blood pressure and is also used as a sexual stimulant.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Deli bal, a potentially dangerous delicacy that sells at a premium price, is harvested in just two places around the world -- the Black Sea region in Turkey and Nepal's Hindu Kush Himalayan mountain range.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Used as a folk medicine, a spoonful of it on a daily basis lowers blood pressure and is also used as a sexual stimulant, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/turkey-mad-honey-deli-bal/index.html">CNN</a> reported. Deli means 'mad' or 'crazy' and bal stands for 'honey'. The nectar contains grayanotoxin, a naturally occurring toxin. The amount that makes it into honey depends from season to season and the flowers the bees have been feasting on.</p>

<p>“In our untouched forests, the purple rhododendron blooms in spring,” said Hasan Kutluata, a beekeeper in Turkey.</p>

<p>The bees collect nectar from these flowers and that's how they get the 'mad honey', he added.</p>

<p>With the help of a knife, Kutluata first carefully extracts a comb from the hive -- sticky elixir, which drops thick and sweet being gathered in a bucket.</p>

<p>Being dark amber red, deli bal's scent is sharp. While consuming it, one gets to taste the herbal bitterness underlying the sweetness of the honey, while a burning heat hits the back of the throat.</p>

<p>Apart from its various benefits, deli bal has its negative aspects as well. “We shouldn't eat too much. If we eat more, it might affect us,” Kutluata said.</p>

<p>He added that though there is no "hallucination involved", it can cause dizziness, low blood pressure, slight fever, nausea, and difficulty in walking.</p>

<p>Kutluata warned people against consuming more than a tablespoon of it. “Too much of anything is harmful. And too much honey is harmful as well," he noted.</p>

<p>It is legal to sell deli bal in Turkey and several other countries worldwide, but the US Food and Drug Administration refused to recommend its consumption.</p>

<p>An FDA spokesperson told CNN that people should check the labeling of honey to make sure that it is not labelled as ‘mad honey' or marketed for intoxicating qualities.</p>

<p>"Eating honey with a high amount of this toxin can lead to ‘mad honey' poisoning, with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or dizziness. This type of poisoning is rare," the official added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine's power infrastructure was "under massive enemy attack" on Thursday, the energy minister said, after a countrywide air raid alert was declared due to incoming missiles.</p>

<p>"Once again, the energy sector is under massive enemy attack. Attacks on energy facilities are taking place across Ukraine," German Galushchenko said in a Facebook post.</p>

<p>National power grid operator Ukrenergo had "urgently introduced emergency power cuts", he added, as temperatures across the country dropped to around 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>

<p>A senior UN official, Rosemary DiCarlo, this month denounced the rise in civilian casualties in the nearly three-year conflict between Ukraine and Russia, noting Moscow's targeting of Ukraine's energy infrastructure may make this winter the "harshest since the start of the war".</p>

<p>Energy provider DTEK said Ukrenergo was introducing emergency power outages in the regions of Kyiv, Odesa, Dnipro and Donetsk.</p>

<p>Ukraine's military said earlier Thursday that an air raid alert had been declared across the country "due to a missile threat" in a message on Telegram.</p>

<p>Missiles were detected headed for Kharkiv, Odesa and eight other regions, according to other messages from the air force.</p>

<p>"Kharkiv, go to the shelters!" it warned.</p>

<p>Oleg Synegubov, head of the Kharkiv region military administration, said on Telegram that three strikes had hit Kharkiv's Kyivskyi district, with no casualties reported so far.</p>

<p>The mayor of Lutsk in northwestern Ukraine, Igor Polishchuk, said that "explosions were heard again" in the city.</p>

<p><strong>Trump's envoy</strong></p>

<p>The latest missile salvo comes a day after US president-elect Donald Trump named staunch loyalist and retired general Keith Kellogg as his Ukraine envoy, charged with ending the Russian invasion.</p>

<p>Trump campaigned on a platform of securing a swift end to the Ukraine war, boasting that he would quickly mediate a ceasefire deal between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian leader Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>But his critics have warned that the incoming Republican will likely leverage US military aid to pressure Kyiv into an agreement that leaves it ceding occupied territory permanently or agreeing not to join NATO.</p>

<p>A fixture on the cable news circuit, 80-year-old national security veteran Kellogg co-authored a paper this year calling for Washington to leverage military aid as a means of pushing for peace talks.</p>

<p>Ukraine has received almost $60 billion from Washington for its armed forces since Russia launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022, but with the more isolationist Trump taking over the White House, supporters fear the spigot will run dry.</p>

<p>"The United States would continue to arm Ukraine and strengthen its defenses to ensure Russia will make no further advances and will not attack again after a cease-fire or peace agreement," Kellogg's research paper for the Trumpist America First Policy Institute think tank said.</p>

<p>"Future American military aid, however, will require Ukraine to participate in peace talks with Russia."</p>

<p>Troop shortages</p>

<p>Kellogg told Voice of America at the Republican convention in July that Ukraine's options were "quite clear."</p>

<p>"If Ukraine doesn't want to negotiate, fine, but then accept the fact that you can have enormous losses in your cities and accept the fact that you will have your children killed, accept the fact that you don't have 130,000 dead, you will have 230,000–250,000," he said.</p>

<p>Trump's announcement came as the outgoing administration of Democrat Joe Biden was hosting a news conference to urge Ukraine to enlist more recruits by reducing the minimum age of conscription to 18 -- in line with the US benchmark.</p>

<p>Facing a much larger enemy with more advanced weapons and with stocks of volunteers dwindling, Ukraine is facing an "existential" recruitment crunch, a senior administration official told reporters.</p>

<p>"The simple truth is that Ukraine is not currently mobilizing or training enough soldiers to replace their battlefield losses while keeping pace with Russia's growing military," said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>He added that an additional 160,000 troops would be "on the low end" to fill out Ukraine's ranks -- but "a good start."</p>

<p>National Security Council spokesman John Kirby later clarified that the White House would not make the huge flow of US military aid to Kyiv dependent on a conscription age change.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A top Chinese military official has been removed from office and is suspected of "serious violations of discipline", Beijing said Thursday, the latest senior apparatchik to fall in a sweeping crackdown on graft in the country's armed forces.</p>

<p>The ruling Chinese Communist Party "has decided to suspend Miao Hua from duty pending investigation", Wu Qian, a spokesman for Beijing's defence ministry, told a press briefing.</p>

<p>Wu did not provide further details about the charges against Miao, an admiral and member of Beijing's powerful Central Military Commission (CMC).</p>

<p>But "serious violations of discipline" are commonly used by officials in China as a euphemism for corruption.</p>

<p>Miao headed the CMC's Political Work Department, the top military body's most important office.</p>

<p>Beijing has deepened a crackdown on alleged graft in the armed forces over the past year, with President Xi Jinping this month ordering the military to stamp out corruption and strengthen its "war-preparedness".</p>

<p>The intensity of the anti-graft drive in the military has been partially driven by fears that it may affect China's ability to wage a future war, Bloomberg reported citing US officials this year.</p>

<p>At the same briefing, Wu denied reports that Defence Minister Dong Jun has been placed under investigation for corruption.</p>

<p>"The reports in question are pure fabrications," Wu said.</p>

<p>"The rumour-mongers are ill-intentioned. China expresses its strong dissatisfaction with such slanderous behaviour," he added.</p>

<p>A former navy commander, Dong was appointed defence minister in December following the surprise removal of predecessor Li Shangfu just seven months into the job.</p>

<p>Li was later expelled from the Communist Party for offences including suspected bribery, state media said. He has not been seen in public since.</p>

<p>His predecessor, Wei Fenghe, was also kicked out of the party and passed on to prosecutors over alleged corruption.</p>

<p>The country's secretive Rocket Force -- which oversees China's vast arsenal of strategic missiles, both conventional and nuclear -- has come under particularly intense scrutiny.</p>

<p>In July, a top Chinese official in the Rocket Force, Sun Jinming, was kicked out of the party and placed under investigation for corruption.</p>

<p>At least two other high-ranking officers connected to the Rocket Force, a relatively new unit of the Chinese military, have also been removed for graft.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The MethaneSAT satellite zooms around the Earth 15 times a day and searches for leaks of methane, the invisible gas that has been warming the planet.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The oil and gas industry in the US is belching methane three to five times higher on an average compared to what the country's Environmental Protection Agency estimated, the latest aerial measurements from MethaneSAT suggest. This is way beyond the rate the industry agreed upon last year, <a href="http://https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/27/climate/methane-polluters-satellite/index.html">CNN</a> reported.</p>

<p>MethaneSAT, a cutting-edge satellite, zooms around the Earth 15 times a day and searches for leaks of methane, the invisible gas that has been warming the planet.</p>

<p>The early findings suggest the Permian Basin, among the most productive oil and gas basins worldwide, has been leaking methane to the tune of nine to 14.5 times the limit the industry had agreed to.</p>

<p>The Appalachia Basin has been leaking methane four times the rate set by the industry.</p>

<p>In the Uinta Basin in Utah, the rate of methane leaks is a shocking 45 times the limit. It's still leaking less methane overall compared to the Permian Basin. The one in Utah is an older basin with older and leaky equipment. It produces less oil and gas.</p>

<p>As per the satellite's early reports, more than half a million wells, which produce a mere 6 to 7% of US oil and gas, are generating nearly 50% of the industry's methane pollution.</p>

<p>Ritesh Gautam, lead senior scientist on MethaneSAT, said the observations are "revealing".</p>

<p>"This is just very, very revealing -- for the first time, to see this kind of observation... The images we started to see were just extraordinary in terms of the overall precision of the data," Gautam said.</p>

<p>For a long time, the pollution from methane has not been well-understood by people. Natural gas, which includes up to 90% methane, continues to rise as the choice of fossil fuel for generating electricity.</p>

<p>According to scientists, methane has the capability of trapping around 80 times as much heat as carbon dioxide during its first 20 years in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Antoine Halff, co-founder and chief analyst at Kayrros, an environmental monitoring group, said, "Understating real methane emission levels means underestimating their warming impact."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Halff added that if we don't understand the scale of the problem, our "mitigation efforts won't nearly be aggressive enough.”</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's tariff threats have rattled foreign businesses and governments, with many fearing it could signal the opening salvo of an all-out trade war when he returns to the White House next year.</p>

<p>The president-elect on Monday placed both allies and rivals on notice, vowing to quickly slap an across-the-board tariff of 25 percent on Canada and Mexico, and add a 10 percent tariff on China.</p>

<p>Following through on that threat -- or his campaign promise of a 10 percent levy on all US imports -- will spark retaliation and have ripple effects across the global economy, analysts say.</p>

<p>"Our assumption is that all these other countries, all these other advanced economies, especially in Asia, they will retaliate in kind," economist Bernard Yaros of Oxford Economics told AFP.</p>

<p>US tariffs and retaliation including from Europe and Asia would "depress growth" and trade flows, he said, estimating a cut to global growth of 0.1 to 0.9 percentage points in 2026.</p>

<p>Even before tariffs take effect, threats weigh on sentiment and could delay investments and hiring, ING economists Ruben Dewitte and Inga Fechner warned in a note.</p>

<p>Trump has long viewed tariffs as a negotiating tool -- or an "all-purpose bludgeon" as a recent Wall Street Journal editorial put it.</p>

<p>On Monday, Trump said that the tariffs on Mexico and Canada would only be removed when illegal immigration and drug trafficking to the United States are stopped.</p>

<p>While seeking to build US leverage, he also risks longer term impacts, with some suggesting he would push countries toward China, Columbia Law School professor Petros Mavroidis said.</p>

<p>"What he definitely does is alienate all his allies," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Erin Murphy, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in Trump's threats "there is no differentiation" regarding countries' economic development status or affinity with Washington.</p>

<p><strong>Europe pushback</strong></p>

<p>Europe could be particularly impacted, Dewitte and Fechner said, warning that "a looming new trade war could push the eurozone economy from sluggish growth into recession."</p>

<p>EU tariffs on car imports were a particular target of Trump during his campaign.</p>

<p>But US reliance on the bloc for strategically important products, mainly in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors, could give the EU some leverage in talks, ING said.</p>

<p>"European countries will be less likely to strike any kind of bargain with Trump than Canada or Mexico," said Peterson Institute for International Economics nonresident senior fellow Gary Hufbauer.</p>

<p>He expects the EU could offer to reduce auto tariffs and buy more US agricultural products like soybeans, but it may not be enough for an administration seeking greater market access or rules exemptions.</p>

<p>Should the US impose tariffs, the EU will probably retaliate on iconic US goods like iPhones or whiskey, he said.</p>

<p>European countries could turn to the World Trade Organization (WTO), though even favorable rulings from the international body may not significantly change US practices.</p>

<p>EU chief Ursula von der Leyen has said she will work towards "constructive cooperation" with US authorities.</p>

<p>Jovita Neliupsiene, the EU ambassador to the United States, meanwhile said the bloc is ready to respond to new trade frictions.</p>

<p><strong>Avoiding escalation</strong></p>

<p>In Asia, economies like Japan and South Korea could be targeted over metals and auto exports, while Vietnam may also draw US scrutiny over solar panels, Yaros said.</p>

<p>The US trade deficit with Vietnam has widened in recent years on a surge in goods imports.</p>

<p>Yaros said that countries targeted by Trump's tariffs, in seeking to avoid escalation, will "retaliate in a way that's commensurate to the action done by the US, but no greater."</p>

<p>China, based on precedent, might eschew equal retaliation for tools like export controls, he added.</p>

<p>Daniel Russel of the Asia Society Policy Institute said both Tokyo and Seoul are very focused on preparing for potential tariffs.</p>

<p>He expects partners like South Korea could seek exemptions from blanket US tariffs, for example, by citing its high-tech investments in America.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

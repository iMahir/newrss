       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna today said former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina's ouster from her country was "good" but the "violence now targeting Hindus was wrong".</p>

<p>"Bangladeshi students had just human rights concerns against PM Hasina. It's good she is gone. But the violence now targeting Hindus is wrong. PM Yunus must uphold the rule of law &amp; prevent the targeting of temples or people of any political party or faith from violence," Ro Khanna wrote in a post on X today.</p>

— Ro Khanna (@RoKhanna) <a href="https://twitter.com/RoKhanna/status/1821423062484504764?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Sheikh Hasina, 76, was forced to resign as Prime Minister on Monday after a month-long anti-government protest over a government jobs quota killed over 400.</p>

<p>Ms Hasina left Bangladesh capital Dhaka in a military aircraft for India post her resignation. Foreign Minister S Jaishankar yesterday said the government is giving time to Sheikh Hasina to "recover" and let them know about her next move.</p>

<p>Sources had earlier mentioned she wanted to leave for London and claim asylum, but this claim was dismissed by her son Sajeeb Wazed.</p>

<p>The Bangladesh Army formed an interim government in the country on Thursday, with Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus as its chief advisor.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is no update, yet, on Sheikh Hasina's future plans, the External Affairs Ministry said Thursday, days after the Bangladeshi leader fled her country amid violent protests against her rule. "We do not have any update on her plan..." a ministry spokesperson said when asked when she will leave India.</p>

<p>Mrs Hasina - who resigned and left Dhaka hours before the Prime Minister's residence was overrun - was evacuated in a military aircraft and flown to an IAF base in Uttar Pradesh. She was expected to proceed onwards to claim political asylum in the United Kingdom, but there has been no news since.</p>

<p>For now, she is understood to be in a 'safe place' and in the custody of Indian intelligence.</p>

<p>On Wednesday night Mrs Hasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed, told NDTV his mother had not made formal requests for asylum in any country, including India. "Reports about her requesting asylum are incorrect. She has not requested anywhere. So question of UK or US not responding yet is not true."</p>

<p>Mr Wazed is based in Washington, D.C. in the United States. Mrs Hasina left Bangladesh with her sister Sheikh Rehana, who is a UK citizen and whose daughter, Tulip Siddiqui is a Labour MP. Her daughter, Saima Wazed, is a Delhi-based senior figure in the World Health Organisation.</p>

<p>The former PM's son also told NDTV his mother is contemplating retirement after a political career spanning five terms as the head of Bangladesh's government. "She is done with politics in Bangladesh... my mother was planning to retire anyway, this was going to be her last term," he said.</p>

<p>On Tuesday External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar made a brief statement in Parliament, in which he said the government had received, "at very short notice", Mrs Hasina's request to come to India.</p>

<p>"On August 5, demonstrators converged in Dhaka despite the curfew. Our understanding is that after a meeting with leaders of the security establishment, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina apparently made the decision to resign. At very short notice, she requested approval to come for the moment to India. We simultaneously received a request for flight clearance from Bangladesh authorities. She arrived yesterday evening in Delhi," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paraguayan swimmer <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/paraguay-swimmer-luana-alonso-exiled-from-olympics-wanted-to-represent-team-usa-6290500">Luana Alonso</a> has found herself at the centre of a controversy at the ongoing Paris Olympics. The 20-year-old, who failed to advance from the women's 100m butterfly heats on July 27, was reportedly asked to leave the athletes' village due to "inappropriate behaviour".</p>

<p>Alonso, who announced her retirement from swimming just a day after missing the semifinal qualification by 0.24 seconds - and weeks after getting a tattoo of the Olympic rings - allegedly left the village to visit Disneyland Paris instead of supporting her teammates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She faced additional criticism for allegedly "distracting" fellow competitors by socialising with other teams and wearing "revealing and skimpy" clothing in the village, rather than the official Paraguayan team attire. This, combined with her unauthorised trip to Disneyland, ultimately led to her removal from the Olympic Village.</p>

<p>Larissa Schaerer, head of the Paraguayan Olympic Committee, confirmed Alonso was instructed to leave the premises, citing her behaviour as the reason for the decision. She stated that Alonso's presence was "creating an inappropriate atmosphere" within the Paraguay team. "We thank her for proceeding as instructed, as it was of her own free will that she did not spend the night in the Athletes' Village," the Committee boss said.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-luana-alonso-swimmer-kicked-out-of-olympic-village-for-inappropriate-conduct-6290596">Luana Alonso</a>, however, posted on Instagram that she was never removed or expelled from anywhere, urging people to "stop spreading false information."</p>

<p>"I don't want to give any statement but I'm not going to let lies affect me either."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beyond her Olympic endeavours, Alonso is a student at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, where she is a member of the women's swimming and diving team. Previously, she spent a semester at Virginia Tech. Alonso first gained international recognition at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, where she represented Paraguay at just 17 years old and finished 28th. Following a narrow miss of semifinal qualification by 0.24 seconds at the Paris Olympics, Alonso announced her surprise retirement from competitive swimming.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a social media video, she slammed the Paraguayan Olympic Committee's treatment of athletes, claiming they aimed to "humiliate her".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"They threaten me that they are going to publish a statement that I am going to leave because of universality. They want to humiliate me and say it is not a big deal that you are leaving because of universality," Alonso said, referencing the system designed to increase the diversity of participating nations at the Olympics. "It's not a pleasure to represent Paraguay, and if it were up to me, I would go back to college."</p>

<p>Committee President Camilo Perez responded, stating that Alonso's times wouldn't qualify her for the Olympics as a member of Team USA. "She has to train a lot more to represent the USA; her times have to be much better," Perez stated.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A renowned British crocodile expert has been sentenced to 10 years and five months in prison for raping, torturing, and killing numerous dogs. Adam Britton, a zoologist based in Darwin, Australia, admitted to 56 charges of bestiality and animal cruelty in the Northern Territory (NT) Supreme Court last September. He also pleaded guilty to four counts of accessing and distributing child abuse material, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c33nv8x64mlo"><em>BBC</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Britton, 52, whose sentencing had faced multiple delays, was additionally banned for life from owning or purchasing animals, according to Australian media reports. His crimes involved the torture and exploitation of 42 dogs, resulting in the deaths of 39, which he recorded inside a shipping container on his property.</p>

<p>Britton will not be eligible for parole for six years, as reported by <em>ABC</em>. Chief Justice Michael Grant, who described Britton's crimes as "grotesque" and "unspeakable," excused court officers during the sentencing and warned the gallery that the details of the offences could cause "nervous shock or other adverse psychological reactions."</p>

<p>Despite his reluctance, the judge stated it was necessary to provide a representative overview of Britton's actions for sentencing purposes. The court previously heard that Britton had a "sadistic sexual interest" in animals, particularly dogs. In addition to torturing his own pets, he also acquired animals from unsuspecting pet owners in the Darwin region.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Marty Aust told the court that Britton often developed a rapport with dog owners, many of whom were reluctantly forced to rehome their pets due to travel or work commitments.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little over two weeks ago, Donald Trump's presidential campaign had visions of an expansive national strategy that would result in a landslide victory in November.</p>

<p>Now, as they struggle to blunt a surging Kamala Harris, who swiftly replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic Party's presidential candidate last month, campaign advisers say they are recalibrating to protect states once thought of as safe and narrowing ambitions for the electoral map.</p>

<p>While top Trump advisers once saw a chance for an electoral blowout - with Democratic-leaning states like Minnesota and Virginia in play - the elevation of Harris has prompted Republicans to refocus on a narrower path to victory that runs through traditional battleground states like Pennsylvania and Georgia.</p>

<p>"The race has changed," Corey Lewandowski, a longtime adviser to the former president, told Reuters, though he said the race still favors Trump. "There's a lot of us that wanted to very actively run against Joe Biden. We felt very good about our race."</p>

<p>Publicly, Trump and his allies have tried vigorously to cast Harris, a Californian, as an out-of-touch liberal and link her to unpopular Biden policies on immigration and inflation. They say it matters little whether they are facing Biden or Harris.</p>

<p>Internally, nine sources told Reuters they see Harris as a far tougher opponent than Biden, who had been struggling for months in the face of doubts about his mental acuity and weakening poll numbers.</p>

<p>"It doesn't change the map as much as shrink it. Now there's no reason to talk about places like New Jersey anymore," said a member of the Trump campaign, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal campaign matters.</p>

<p>Reuters interviewed 12 campaign staff, advisers and donors who described a campaign that is grasping for a fresh strategy as it confronts a younger, more dynamic Democratic candidate who has energized the Democratic base and raised hundreds of millions of dollars in a matter of days.</p>

<p>"It's clear to everyone she could win," said one senior Trump adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to more freely discuss internal deliberations.</p>

<p>When asked about the prospects of a shrinking battleground map, the Trump team said its strategy hadn't changed since Harris became the Democratic candidate.</p>

<p>"Team Trump has ads in every battleground state, we have expanded the political map to include traditional 'blue states' like Minnesota and Virginia with staff on the ground," Republican Party spokesperson Anna Kelly said.</p>

<p>Ammar Moussa, a Harris campaign spokesman, said Trump and Vance were taking the country backwards, while Harris was taking the country forwards. He did not address the electoral map.</p>

<p>The Trump sources Reuters spoke to pointed to three issues: delays in rolling out attack ads against Harris, which are seen as key for pointing out an opponent's perceived weaknesses; doubts among some Republican leaders and donors over the selection of Senator JD Vance as running mate; and concerns over Trump himself as he tramples over his advisers' efforts to define Harris based on her policy positions.</p>

<p>One source said the anti-Harris ads had been slow to air in part because the material had to be run by focus groups first.</p>

<p>The campaign also wanted to see who Harris would pick as her running mate, according to the source briefed on the plans.</p>

<p>Harris this week announced Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a plain-speaking midwesterner, as her vice presidential candidate.</p>

<p><strong>MAY MEMO</strong></p>

<p>By late May, the Trump campaign had started gaming out the possibility that Harris or another Democrat could replace Biden at the top of the ticket, according to an internal memo from campaign staffer Austin McCubbin shared with senior advisers.</p>

<p>The 12-page memo, which was reviewed by Reuters, outlined the Democratic Party's rules for replacing a presidential candidate and possible scenarios, including Biden stepping down voluntarily and an "insider rebellion."</p>

<p>The memo did not detail how to respond to a Harris candidacy.</p>

<p>Tony Fabrizio, a Trump campaign pollster, predicted in a memo released to the press last month that Harris would enjoy a short-term polling boost, but that the race would then settle down. "Harris' 'honeymoon' will end and voters will refocus on her role as Biden's partner and co-pilot," he wrote in the memo.</p>

<p>In the lead-up to Biden's exit, the Trump-aligned MAGA Inc super PAC readied a TV ad accusing Harris of covering up Biden's infirmity. It began airing in four swing states on July 21, the day Biden announced that he was ending his reelection campaign.</p>

<p>At the same time, the campaign found itself on the defensive over Trump's selection of Vance as his running mate.</p>

<p>Vance has faced a wave of negative press over past comments referring to some Democrats, including Harris, as "a bunch of childless cat ladies," an insult seen as misogynistic and dismissive of people without children.</p>

<p>The Republican National Committee and the campaign have been fielding calls from some donors who fear Vance has become a distraction and is dragging the ticket down, according to two sources aware of the calls.</p>

<p>As the campaign focuses on a smaller map, Vance is expected to spend more time in relatively conservative and rural places, particularly in Rust Belt states, like Michigan and Pennsylvania, where his rural roots and concerns about industrial decay are more likely to resonate with voters, according to four sources close to the campaign or vice presidential candidate.</p>

<p>This week, Vance has held press conferences near Harris-Walz campaign events in Wisconsin and Michigan.</p>

<p><strong>TRUMP ATTACKS HARRIS - AND HIS ALLIES</strong></p>

<p>And then there is Trump's resort to name-calling instead of focusing on Harris' policy positions. Trump has cycled furiously through a series of personal insults against Harris. Those efforts have generated negative headlines - about Trump, rather than Harris.</p>

<p>At an event for the National Association of Black Journalists last week, Trump questioned whether Harris - whose mother was born in India and whose father was born in Jamaica - was actually Black. That left donors and aides baffled and alarmed, according to a Republican donor, an operative at a pro-Trump super PAC spending group, and a Trump-supporting union leader.</p>

<p>Three days later, Trump attacked Georgia's Republican governor, Brian Kemp, at a rally, possibly alienating a popular figure in a battleground state where Trump could need help mobilizing voters to the polls.</p>

<p>Trump has also been firing off multiple, convoluted missives on his Truth Social app, including one on Tuesday in which he mused about Biden returning to the top of the ticket.</p>

<p>In the spring and earlier this summer, as public opinion polls showed Trump expanding his lead over Biden in battleground states, the former president did events in what had been considered safe Democratic areas - Minnesota, Virginia, even New York City - in a bid to expand the electoral map.</p>

<p>By last Saturday, Trump was back to basics: campaigning in Georgia, where polls showed the race had tightened after Harris' entry.</p>

<p>The state is going to be fiercely competitive, with Trump clinging to a slight edge thanks to support from some Black voters, said Mark Rountree, a Georgia pollster who is not affiliated with either campaign.</p>

<p>And Trump is getting outspent on campaign ads in battleground states, according to AdImpact, a firm that tracks campaign ad spending.</p>

<p>Harris and affiliated committees have outspent Trump and his allies $112 million to $70.1 million on ads since July 22, according to AdImpact data, although Trump has matched Harris' outlays in Pennsylvania, perhaps the most crucial state for each side.</p>

<p>In terms of future reservations of TV air time, Harris and her allies are swamping Trump $172.4 million to $71.8 million as of this week, the firm said, although those figures are likely to change in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Perhaps most telling was the Trump campaign's significant new ad buy in North Carolina, which had looked likely to remain Republican until Harris' ascension energized Black and young voters.</p>

<p>"They're putting money in there now in the hope she decides to leave it alone," said Justin Sayfie, a Republican lobbyist and Trump fundraiser.</p>

<p>However, the Harris campaign is already up on the air in the state.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian internet monitoring services reported thousands of glitches in the availability of video hosting site YouTube on Thursday, amid escalating criticism of the platform by the Russian authorities.</p>

<p>Russian internet monitoring service Sboi.rf said that there had been thousands of glitches reported about YouTube in Russia. Users said they could only access YouTube via virtual private networks (VPNs).</p>

<p>"YouTube is not working," one anonymous user said in comments on the site.</p>

<p>Reuters reporters in Russia were unable to access YouTube. The website remained available via some mobile devices.</p>

<p>YouTube download speeds have notably slowed in recent weeks, for which Russian lawmakers have blamed YouTube owner Alphabet's Google, something the company disputes.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus returned to Bangladesh Thursday to lead a caretaker government after a student-led uprising ended the 15-year rule of Sheikh Hasina.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus returned to Bangladesh Thursday to lead a caretaker government after a student-led uprising ended the 15-year rule of Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>Yunus touched down in Dhaka on a flight from Paris via Dubai shortly after 2:00 pm (0800 GMT) and could be sworn in as the country's new leader as soon as Thursday evening to begin what the army chief has vowed will be a "beautiful democratic process".</p>

<p>The prospect of Yunus, 84, standing alongside military leaders was almost unimaginable a week ago when security forces fired deadly rounds at protesters who took to the streets demanding that Hasina resign.</p>

<p>But the military turned on Hasina at the weekend and she was forced to flee to neighbouring India -- as millions of Bangladeshis celebrated her demise.</p>

<p>The military then agreed to student demands that Yunus -- who won the Nobel in 2006 for his pioneering microfinancing work -- lead an interim government.</p>

<p>"I'm looking forward to going back home, see what's happening and how we can organise ourselves to get out of the trouble we are in," Yunus told reporters in Paris as he left for Dhaka.</p>

<h3><strong>'Get ready'</strong></h3>

<p>The veteran academic had travelled abroad this year while on bail after being sentenced to six months in jail on a charge condemned as politically motivated, and which a Dhaka court on Wednesday acquitted him of.</p>

<p>Yunus was hit with more than 100 criminal cases and a smear campaign by a state-led Islamic agency that accused him of promoting homosexuality, with courts accused of rubber-stamping decisions by ousted Hasina's government.</p>

<p>Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said he backed Yunus and hoped he would be sworn in to lead the interim government on Thursday evening.</p>

<p>"I am certain that he will be able to take us through a beautiful democratic process," Waker said.</p>

<p>Yunus said he wanted to hold elections "within a few" months.</p>

<h3><strong>'Seismic moment'</strong></h3>

<p>Few other details about the planned government have been released, including the role of the military.</p>

<p>But Bangladeshis voiced hope as they joined a rally in Dhaka on Wednesday for the former opposition Bangladesh National Party (BNP).</p>

<p>"I expect that a national government will be formed with everyone's consent in a beautiful way," Moynul Islam Pintu told AFP.</p>

<p>"I expect that the country is run in a nice way, and the police force is reformed so that they can't harass people."</p>

<p>Hasina, 76, who had been in power since 2009, quit on Monday as hundreds of thousands of people flooded the streets of Dhaka.</p>

<p>Jubilant crowds later looted her palace.</p>

<p>Monday's events were the culmination of more than a month of unrest, which began as protests against a plan for quotas in government jobs but morphed into an anti-Hasina movement.</p>

<p>Hasina, who was accused of rigging the January elections and widespread human rights abuses, deployed security forces to quash the protests.</p>

<p>At least 455 people were killed in the unrest, according to an AFP tally based on police, government officials and hospital doctors.</p>

<p>"The protests are a seismic moment in Bangladesh history," said International Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean.</p>

<p>"The country really had been at risk of becoming a one-party state, and through a peaceful street-based movement led by, Gen Z students in their 20s, they've managed to force her from power."</p>

<h3><strong>Military move</strong></h3>

<p>The military's switching of allegiance was the decisive factor in her demise.</p>

<p>It has since acceded to a range of other demands from the student leaders.</p>

<p>The president dissolved parliament on Tuesday, a key demand of the students and the BNP.</p>

<p>The head of the police force, which protesters have blamed for leading Hasina's crackdown, was sacked on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The new chief, Mainul Islam, offered an apology on Wednesday for the conduct of officers and vowed a "fair and impartial investigation" into the killings of "students, common people and the police".</p>

<p>Ex-prime minister and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, 78, was also released from years of house arrest, while some political prisoners were freed.</p>

<p>The military has demoted some generals seen as close to Hasina and sacked Ziaul Ahsan, a commander of the feared Rapid Action Battalion paramilitary force.</p>

<p>Police said mobs had launched revenge attacks on officers and Hasina's allies, and also freed more than 500 inmates from a prison.</p>

<p>Protesters broke into parliament and torched TV stations. Others smashed statues of Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's independence hero.</p>

<p>Since Tuesday, however, streets in the capital have been largely peaceful.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus on Thursday paid tribute to those killed in Bangladesh's deadly protests that toppled Sheikh Hasina's government, saying their sacrifices had brought the nation a "second independence".</p>

<p>"Today is a glorious day for us," he told reporters at the airport in Dhaka shortly after returning to the country to lead a caretaker government.</p>

<p>"Bangladesh has created a new victory day. Bangladesh has got a second independence."</p>

<p>Yunus called for the restoration of order after weeks of violence that left at least 455 people dead, calling on citizens to guard each other, including minorities who came under attack.</p>

<p>"Law and order is our first task... We cannot take a step forward unless we fix the law and order situation," he said.</p>

<p>"My call to the people is; if you have trust in me, then make sure there will be no attacks against anyone, anywhere in the country."</p>

<p>Yunus, 84, could be sworn in as the country's new leader as soon as Thursday evening.</p>

<p>"Every person is our brother... our task is to protect them," he said, adding that "the whole of Bangladesh is one big family".</p>

<p>He choked with emotion as he recalled the killing of student activist Abu Sayeed, shot dead in July by police from close range.</p>

<p>He paid tribute to the youth who sparked the protest movement and those who risked all for their desire for change.</p>

<p>"They protected the nation and gave it a new life", he said. "Because of them, Bangladesh has got a second independence."</p>

<p>The prospect of Yunus standing alongside military leaders was almost unimaginable a week ago, when security forces fired deadly rounds at protesters who took to the streets demanding Hasina step down.</p>

<p>The veteran economist also said it must be the young generation who build the nation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Bangladesh can be a beautiful country, but we destroyed the possibilities," he said.</p>

<p>"Now we have to build a seedbed again -- the new seedbed will be built by them," he said, gesturing to the young student supporters surrounding him at the podium as he spoke.</p>

<p>"We can move forward in building a new Bangladesh very quickly", he said, dressed in a knee-length purple kurta shirt and white waistcoat, adding with a smile: "We have started today."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Tens of thousands of North Koreans have fled to South Korea since the peninsula was divided by war in the 1950s, with most going overland to neighbouring China first, then entering a third country such as Thailand before entering South Korea.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A North Korean has defected to the South across the de facto maritime border known as the Northern Limit Line, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported Thursday.</p>

<p>"1 N. Korean defects across maritime border in Yellow Sea: military," the agency said in a one-line report.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of North Koreans have fled to South Korea since the peninsula was divided by war in the 1950s, with most going overland to neighbouring China first, then entering a third country such as Thailand before finally making it to the South.</p>

<p>The number of successful escapes dropped significantly from 2020 after the North sealed its borders -- purportedly with shoot-on-sight orders along the land frontier with China -- to prevent the spread of Covid-19.</p>

<p>But the number of defectors making it to the South tripled last year to 196, Seoul said in January, with more elite diplomats and students seeking to escape, up from 67 in 2022.</p>

<p>South Korean local media reported Thursday that two North Koreans attempted to defect to the South through the border island of Gyodong, less than five kilometres (3.1 miles) from North Korea, and the South Korean military has only secured one of them.</p>

<p>The report comes days after North Korean state media said the country had deployed 250 ballistic missile launchers to its southern border, with leader Kim Jong Un describing the weapons as a "powerful treasured sword" to defend its sovereignty.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Pyongyang conducted live-fire artillery drills near South Korea's Yeonpyeong and another border island, prompting counter-drills, heightened security and evacuation orders for residents.</p>

<p>Relations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with the North ramping up weapons testing and bombarding the South with trash-carrying balloons.</p>

<p>South Korea has responded by resuming propaganda broadcasts along the border, suspending a tension-reducing military deal and restarting live-fire drills near the border.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian prosecutors have requested a 15-year prison sentence for a dual US-Russian national charged with "treason" for making a donation to a pro-Ukraine organisation.</p>

<p>Ksenia Karelina, who lives in the United States, was arrested in February while visiting family in Russia, accused of providing financial assistance to the Ukrainian army.</p>

<p>"The prosecution requested a sentence of 15 years imprisonment in a general regime penal colony," Russian state-run news agencies quoted Karelina's lawyer, Mikhail Mushailov, as saying Thursday.</p>

<p>She donated around $50 to a US-based pro-Ukraine charity after Russia launched its full-scale military offensive in 2022, US media reported, citing her family and employer.</p>

<p>Russia's FSB security service accused her of collecting money that was "used to purchase tactical medical supplies, equipment, weapons and ammunition for the Ukrainian armed forces."</p>

<p>Russian state media reported she pleaded guilty in a court hearing in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The verdict will be delivered next Thursday, the court's press service told AFP.</p>

<p>Moscow has launched dozens of criminal cases against Russian citizens it accuses of supporting or collaborating with Kyiv.</p>

<p>Karelina, in her early 30s, is just one of a string of US citizens and dual nationals that have also been targeted.</p>

<p>Last week Russia released three of them -- journalists Evan Gershkovich and Alsu Kurmasheva, as well as ex-marine Paul Whelan -- in the largest East-West prisoner swap since the Cold War.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 19-year-old Austrian terrorism suspect had taken concrete steps in planning an attack on a Taylor Swift concert, with chemical substances found during a search of his residence, Austria's general director for public security said.</p>

<p>The teenager, with North Macedonian roots, is considered the main suspect, working closely with a 17-year-old Austrian, general director for public security Frankz Ruf told ORF radio.</p>

<p>The two males are part of a small group police are looking into, said Ruf, adding that the 19-year-old had pledged allegiance to the radical Islamic State group.</p>

<p>"We are of course investigating their wider surroundings," said Ruf, adding that the threat was minimized with the arrests.</p>

<p>Swift's three concerts in Vienna, expected to draw 195,000 people, were cancelled late on Wednesday after the government flagged a planned attack. Police had detained three people suspected of plotting attacks on concerts.</p>

<p>Searches of the main suspect's house in the town of Ternitz near the Hungarian border showed "concrete preparatory actions," said Ruf, with chemical substances and technical devices seized.</p>

<p>The Kurier newspaper, citing sources familiar with the situation, reported that the suspect had stolen the chemicals from his workplace and had built a bomb.</p>

<p>The newspaper reported that the 19-year-old had planned to drive a car into the crowd expected to gather outside the stadium, and had also considered using machetes and knives.</p>

<p>Austria's interior ministry and intelligence service were not immediately available for comment on the report's details.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[This summer, the robotic printer from ICON is finishing the last few of 100 3D-printed houses in Wolf Ranch, a community in Georgetown, Texas, about 30 miles from Austin.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As with any desktop 3D printer, the Vulcan printer pipes layer by layer to build an object - except this printer is more than 45 feet (13.7 m) wide, weighs 4.75 tons and prints residential homes.</p>

<p>This summer, the robotic printer from ICON is finishing the last few of 100 3D-printed houses in Wolf Ranch, a community in Georgetown, Texas, about 30 miles from Austin.</p>

<p>ICON began printing the walls of what it says is the world's largest 3D-printed community in November 2022. Compared to traditional construction, the company says that 3D printing homes is faster, less expensive, requires fewer workers, and minimizes construction material waste.</p>

<p>"It brings a lot of efficiency to the trade market," said ICON senior project manager Conner Jenkins. "So, where there were maybe five different crews coming in to build a wall system, we now have one crew and one robot."</p>

<p>After concrete powder, water, sand and other additives are mixed together and pumped into the printer, a nozzle squeezes out the concrete mixture like toothpaste onto a brush, building up layer by layer along a pre-programmed path that creates corduroy-effect walls.</p>

<p>The single-story three- to four-bedroom homes take about three weeks to finish printing, with the foundation and metal roofs installed traditionally.</p>

<p>Jenkins said the concrete walls are designed to be resistant to water, mold, termites and extreme weather.</p>

<p>Lawrence Nourzad, a 32-year-old business development director, and his girlfriend Angela Hontas, a 29-year-old creative strategist, purchased a Wolf Ranch home earlier this summer.</p>

<p>"It feels like a fortress," Nourzad said, adding that he was confident it would be resilient to most tornados.</p>

<p>The walls also provide strong insulation from the Texas heat, the couple said, keeping the interior temperature cool even when the air conditioner wasn't on full blast.</p>

<p>There was one other thing the 3D-printed walls seemed to protect against, however: a solid wireless internet connection.</p>

<p>"Obviously these are really strong, thick walls. And that's what provides a lot of value for us as homeowners and keeps this thing really well-insulated in a Texas summer, but signal doesn't transfer through these walls very well," Nourzad said.</p>

<p>To alleviate this issue, an ICON spokeswoman said most Wolf Ranch homeowners use mesh internet routers, which broadcast a signal from multiple units placed throughout a home, versus a traditional router which sends a signal from one device.</p>

<p>The 3D-printed homes at Wolf Ranch, called the "Genesis Collection" by developers, range in price from around $450,000 to close to $600,000. Developers said a little more than one quarter of the 100 homes have been sold.</p>

<p>ICON, which 3D-printed its first home in Austin in 2018, hopes to one day take its technology to the Moon. NASA, as part of its Artemis Moon exploration program, has contracted ICON to develop a construction system capable of building landing pads, shelters, and other structures on the lunar surface.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Wednesday that he would convene the emergency committee "as soon as possible".</p>

<p>Independent experts from a range of relevant disciplines across the globe are expected to be invited.</p>

<p>"In light of the spread of #mpox outside #DRC, and the potential for further international spread within and outside Africa, I have decided to convene an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations to advise me on whether the outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern," he wrote on X.</p>

<p>"The committee will meet as soon as possible and will be made up of independent experts from a range of relevant disciplines from around the world," he added.</p>

<h3><strong>Mpox Outbreak In Congo</strong></h3>

<p>Since the beginning of 2023, around 27,000 mpox cases have been reported in Congo, where the infection has killed over 1,100 people, most of them children, Reuters reported.</p>

<p>Another 50 cases were confirmed, while more were suspected in countries like Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, which did not report mpox cases earlier.</p>

<p>Mpox, also known as monkeypox, was detected in 10 African countries, including Congo, which has recorded over 96% of all cases and deaths, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported last week.</p>

<p>The cases have jumped by 160% and deaths have increased by 19% in comparison with the same period last year.</p>

<p>On a call with media persons, Tedros noted that $1 million was released from the WHO contingency fund for "emergencies to support scale-up of the response and we plan to release more in the coming days".</p>

<p>He said the agency triggered the process for emergency use listing of Bavarian Nordic's Jynneos and KM Biologics LC16.</p>

<p>As per reports, the outbreak started with the spread of 'Clade I,' an endemic strain. However, a new variant, 'Clade Ib' now appears to be spreading more fast through routine close contact.</p>

<h3><strong>Mpox Symptoms</strong></h3>

<p>The viral disease can be transmitted through physical contact with the infected person as well as animals or contaminated materials.</p>

<p>Some of its most common symptoms include skin rash or lesions, fever, muscle aches, headache, back pain as well as swollen lymph nodes.</p>

<p>It came to global prominence two years ago after mpox cases emerged worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. Later on, it was declared a public health emergency of international concern in July 2022. It ended the following May.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dell Technologies Inc. is cutting jobs as part of a reorganization of its sales teams that includes a new group focused on artificial intelligence products and services.</p>

<p>"We are getting leaner," sales executives Bill Scannell and John Byrne wrote Monday in a memo to Dell employees. "We're streamlining layers of management and reprioritizing where we invest." In addition to the AI-focused team, the executives said the company will change how data center sales are approached.</p>

<p>The Texas-based hardware technology company has enjoyed a renaissance of investor interest over the past year due to its high-powered servers that can run AI workloads. Still, there is increasing unease about how long it may take companies to see a payoff from AI investments, which often come in the form of expensive servers or graphics processing units.</p>

<p>A spokesperson declined to comment on how many jobs would be affected. "Through a reorganization of our go-to-market teams and an ongoing series of actions, we are becoming a leaner company," the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The shares increased 34% this year through Friday's close, though the stock had given back more than 40% of its value since hitting a record $179.21 on May 29.</p>

<p>Dell previously announced a major workforce reduction in early 2023, shedding 13,000 jobs in that fiscal year. As of February, it had about 120,000 full-time employees globally, Dell said in a regulatory filing that month.</p>

<p>The company's best-known business of selling personal computers has struggled in recent years amid a post-pandemic decline in that market. Still, computer industry shipments have begun to pick up, and Dell is optimistic that a new generation of AI-optimized PCs will fuel upgrades.</p>

<p>"We aim to grow faster than the market by seamlessly meeting our customers and partners online, virtually, or in person, to unlock the value of modern IT and AI for their organizations," the Dell executives wrote in the memo to employees.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Albanian jeweller Pirro Ruco laboured day and night for five years to capture the essence of his country in a spectacular luxury watch.</p>

<p>Now the timepiece, worth roughly $1.4 million, is set to face off against the best watches from across the world at the Geneva Watchmaking Grand Prix in November.</p>

<p>Set under a sapphire dome, the hours are marked by 12 golden folk dancers -- each in a different regional dress -- set on Murano glass, the minute and hour hands adorned with eagle talons in homage to Albania's national symbol.</p>

<p>Ruco's rollercoaster rise mirrors that of Albania, from poverty and isolation as the most closed communist regime in Europe to rollicking capitalism.</p>

<p>Along the way the jeweller overcame jealousy, the secret police and being sent into internal exile to rise to the pinnacle of his profession.</p>

<p>It all began for Pirro -- as he is known in his homeland -- in 1985 when he was asked to make a medal in red and gold bearing the head of Enver Hoxha, the paranoid dictator who ruled the small Balkan nation with an iron fist for more than four decades.</p>

<p>"That saved me," he told AFP from his workshop tucked away in an alley in the capital Tirana.</p>

<p>The medals were awarded to the regime's most loyal supporters and later caught the eye of Hoxha's wife.</p>

<p>The turn of fortune saw thousands more produced and worn by communist cadres across Albania.</p>

<p>"All the congressional delegates had to wear it. I made a name for myself with it," he said. It also saved him from the textile mills where he had been sent because his family had been deemed "rebellious".</p>

<h3><strong>'Priceless'</strong></h3>

<p>All this, however, was nearly derailed by an anonymous letter sent to authorities accusing Pirro of working with foreign agents.</p>

<p>He was questioned by intelligence agents and his workshop was raided.</p>

<p>Down but not out, he was able to bounce back after crafting a ring bearing the image of the late husband of a member of the communist politburo and in July 1990 won a prize for a piece featuring Albania's 15th-century national hero Skanderbeg.</p>

<p>But the very next day history intervened. The regime began to crumble and the collapse of Albania's communist rule in 1991 was followed by years of violent tumult as the country transitioned to a free-market economy.</p>

<p>Amid the ups and downs, Pirro stayed busy designing pieces for officials and celebrities.</p>

<p>During a trip to Basel in Switzerland in 2016, something new caught his eye.</p>

<p>"I wanted to make a watch. It was my new dream," he told AFP.</p>

<p>For the next five years, Pirro said he focused on "doing something special, Albanian, and at the same time completely new and never before seen in the watch industry."</p>

<p>The new timepiece which he calls Primordial Passion was designed in collaboration with the Swiss watchmaker Agenhor.</p>

<p>"I never wanted to make jewellery, but art," the jeweller said.</p>

<p>"Sculptures, images of the country, pieces of culture... This watch is the culmination of all that, of this love for Albania," he added.</p>

<p>"It is more than just a watch. It combines the rich heritage of ancient Albanian culture with the notion of chronometry."</p>

<p>Pirro refuses to divulge the methods used to craft the watch but remains hopeful the painstaking details will be recognised by the judges at the Grand Prix in Geneva.</p>

<p>Several collectors have already contacted him about buying the timepiece, he said, though it would be difficult to part with his creation.</p>

<p>"I set a price because I had to. But for me, it is priceless."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microwave ovens harbour specialised communities of highly adapted microbes, according to a new study.</p>

<p>This finding is significant for hygiene and potential biotechnological applications, as the hardy bacteria inside microwave ovens could be utilised in industrial processes.</p>

<p>"Our results reveal that domestic microwaves have a more 'anthropised' microbiome, similar to kitchen surfaces, while laboratory microwaves harbour bacteria that are more resistant to radiation," said Daniel Torrent, a researcher at Darwin Bioprospecting Excellence SL in Paterna, Spain.</p>

<p>Torrent and colleagues sampled microbes from 30 microwave ovens: 10 from single-household kitchens, 10 from shared domestic spaces like corporate centers and cafeterias, and 10 from molecular biology and microbiology laboratories.</p>

<p>The aim was to assess how microbial communities are influenced by food interactions and user habits.</p>

<p>Using next-generation sequencing and cultivation of 101 strains on five different media, the researchers found 747 different genera within 25 bacterial phyla.</p>

<p>The most common phyla were Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria.</p>

<p>The diversity was lowest in single-household microwave ovens and highest in laboratory ones.</p>

<p>Bacteria such as Acinetobacter, Bhargavaea, Brevibacterium, and Rhizobium were found only in domestic microwaves, while Arthrobacter, Enterobacter, Janibacter, and Planococcus were exclusive to shared-domestic ones.</p>

<p>Nonomuraea bacteria were isolated only from laboratory microwaves, along with Delftia, Micrococcus, Deinococcus, and a genus of Cyanobacteria.</p>

<p>The microbial diversity in microwave ovens resembled that found on typical kitchen surfaces and solar panels, suggesting that the constant thermal shock, electromagnetic radiation, and desiccation select for highly resistant microbes in these environments.</p>

<p>"Some species of genera found in domestic microwaves, such as Klebsiella, Enterococcus, and Aeromonas, may pose a risk to human health. However, the microbial population in microwaves does not present a unique or increased risk compared to other common kitchen surfaces," said Torrent.</p>

<p>"For both the general public and laboratory personnel, we recommend regularly disinfecting microwaves with a diluted bleach solution or a commercially available disinfectant spray. It is also important to wipe down the interior surfaces with a damp cloth after each use to remove any residue and to clean up spills immediately to prevent the growth of bacteria," Torrent added.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Luana Alonso, a 20-year-old swimmer from Paraguay, was asked to leave the Olympic Village for allegedly creating an "inappropriate" environment.&nbsp;At the 2024 Paris&nbsp;Olympics, Alonso missed out on qualification for the women's 100m butterfly semi-final by a mere 0.24 seconds, reports said.<br />
<br />
"Her presence is creating an inappropriate atmosphere within Team Paraguay," read a statement from Paraguayan Olympic Committee boss Larissa Schaerer. Schaerer thanked her for proceeding as instructed and added that "it was of her own free will that she did not spend the night in the Athletes' Village." Her conduct left the country's Olympic leadership upset.</p>

<p>Earlier, she announced her retirement from the sport after failing to progress past the women's 100m butterfly heats event on July 27.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Who is Luana Alonso?</strong><br />
<br />
1. Born on September 19, 2004, Luana Alonso, a competitive swimmer from Paraguay, specialises in butterfly stroke events. She is the national record holder for Paraguay in the 100m butterfly event.<br />
<br />
2. Alonso is currently a student at the Southern Methodist University in the US Dallas. Before her time with the university's women's swimming and diving team, she was a part of Virginia Tech for one semester, US Weekly magazine reported.<br />
<br />
3. She came into the limelight after she first represented her country at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics at the age of 17. Back then, she finished in the 28th place and failed to advance to the semifinals.<br />
<br />
4. At the 2024 Paris Olympics, she made her second appearance but was eliminated in the heats after finishing sixth place. Prior to this, she also participated in the Youth Olympic Games, South American Games and the World Championships.<br />
<br />
5. Ahead of the Olympics, Ms Alonso is said to have expressed a desire to represent the United States at the 2024 Olympics. In a live stream on Instagram before the summer Olympics, she allegedly said she preferred the US over Paraguay.<br />
<br />
Multiple local media reported that Alonso spent time in Disneyland, instead of supporting her Paraguayan teammates.<br />
<br />
A report in The Daily Mail stated she had become a distraction to other competitors at the Olympic Games with her “skimpy clothing and socialising with other athletes.”<br />
<br />
On her behalf, Alonso, who has over 8,98,000 followers on Instagram, said the claims against her were untrue.<br />
<br />
“I just wanted to clarify that I was never kicked out or expelled from anywhere, please stop spreading false information,” she said in a statement on Monday. “I don't want to make any statement but I'm not going to let lies affect me either.”<br />
<br />
After she failed to qualify for the semifinals, Alonso said, "It was my last race. I am retiring from swimming."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two days back, Sheikh Hasina resigned as Bangladesh Prime Minister, fled capital Dhaka amid violent protests demanding her ouster and landed near Delhi. Since then, there has been speculation on where she is headed next. Right after her escape from Dhaka, some reports had claimed that the 76-year-old leader plans to seek asylum in the UK. But with London hesitating, the Awami League leader, it is learnt, is looking at other options.</p>

<p><strong>What Sheikh Hasina's Son Said</strong></p>

<p>In an interview to NDTV, Sheikh Hasina's son and Awami League leader Sajeeb Wazed Joy said reports claiming that his mother sought asylum in the UK are incorrect. "She has not requested asylum anywhere, so the question of the UK or US not responding yet is not true. My mother was planning to retire after this term anyway. She is done with politics in Bangladesh."</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina's daughter Saima Wazed is WHO's Regional Director for South-East Asia and lives in Delhi. But a Twitter post she put up suggests that she has not met Sheikh Hasina after her escape from Dhaka. "Heartbroken with the loss of life in my country that I love. So heartbroken that I cannot see and hug my mother during this difficult time. I remain committed to my role as RD @WHOSEARO@WHO#HealthForAll#OneWHO," she posted on X.</p>

<p><strong>What Has UK Said</strong></p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana is a UK citizen, and Rehana's daughter Tulip Siddiq is a Labour Party politician and a minister in the Keir Starmer government. Also, the UK has a record of giving refuge to several prominent figures of the subcontinent, including former Pakistan president Pervez Musharraf and former Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. So soon after she fled Dhaka, multiple reports predicted that she is headed to the UK.</p>

<p>But the UK Home Office told NDTV that British immigration rules do not allow individuals to travel to that country to seek asylum or temporary refuge. A spokesperson also said individuals seeking asylum must do so "in the first safe country they reach".</p>

<p>"The UK has a proud record of providing protection for people who need it. However, there is no provision for someone to be allowed to travel to the UK to seek asylum or temporary refuge," the Home office said.</p>

<p><strong>Is US An Option?</strong></p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina's son Joy is based in the US, but the chances of her moving there are slim after Washington DC and Dhaka's ties nosedived during her tenure. In fact, earlier this year, when Awami League stormed to victory in the Bangladesh election, the US State Department had said, "The United States remains concerned by the arrests of thousands of political opposition members and by reports of irregularities on elections day. The United States shares the view with other observers that these elections were not free or fair and we regret that not all parties participated."</p>

<p>While some reports say the US has cancelled Sheikh Hasina's visa after she resigned as Prime Minister, there has been no official confirmation and authorities have said visa records are confidential.</p>

<p>Earlier, after Sheikh Hasina fled the country, the US had said it stands with the people of Bangladesh. "We welcome the announcement of an interim government and urge any transition be conducted in accordance with Bangladesh's laws," State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller had said, flagging reports of human rights abuses, casualties, and injuries during the violent protests against the Awami League government.</p>

<p><strong>What About India?</strong></p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina has been in India since she landed here Monday. Addressing the Parliament on the Bangladesh situation, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said Sheikh Hasina had sought approval to come to India on a very short notice.</p>

<p>The government, according to reports, has told an all-party meeting that they have given time to the veteran politician to decide on her next move. Sheikh Hasina is in a state of shock and the government is giving her time to recover before it discusses these issues, sources have said.</p>

<p>New Delhi also faces a diplomatic dilemma here. It does not want to be seen as overtly backing the ousted leader because that may complicate its relationship with the new dispensation in Bangladesh,a a strategic partner geopolitically. At the same time, the history of Sheikh Hasina's relationship with India must also be kept in mind. Long before she became Prime Minister, the Indira Gandhi government had given her refuge after her whole family, including father Mujibur Rahaman, was assassinated during the 1975 unrest in Bangladesh. So abandoning her at this point will also not be an easy decision, considering her equations with Delhi.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several people were killed on Friday night when a man knifed passers-by at random at a festival in the western German city of Solingen, newspaper Bild reported.</p>

<p>Bild said the event occurred around 9:45 p.m. (1945 GMT) and that at least three people were dead and multiple people were wounded.</p>

<p>Witnesses said the perpetrator was at large, the paper added.</p>

<p>The local newspaper Solingen Tageblatt reported on its website that the attack occurred at a festival to honour the town's 650 years.</p>

<p>Local police said they were not yet able to comment.</p>

<p>Local news reports said the stabbings occurred at the Fronhof, a market square in the town where live bands were playing.</p>

<p>Solingen is in North Rhine-Westphalia state, Germany's most populous and bordering the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Fatal stabbings and shootings in Germany are relatively uncommon.</p>

<p>In June, a 29-year-old policeman died after being stabbed in the German city of Mannheim during an attack on a right-wing demonstration.</p>

<p>There was a stabbing attack on a train in 2021, injuring several.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday said he looks forward to visiting India as it can be a "key" in the global diplomatic efforts to end the war between his country and Russia.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday said he looks forward to visiting India as it can be a "key" in the global diplomatic efforts to end the war between his country and Russia.</p>

<p>"India (is a) big influential country, not only in the world (but) also through the circle of very skeptical countries. If we will change India's attitude to this war and to Russia, we will stop the war, because Putin will want to stop it," Zeleskyy said in reply to a question while interacting with the visiting Indian media.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian president described Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first visit to Kyiv as "historic." During their bilateral talks, PM Modi invited Zelenskyy to visit India.</p>

<p>"Modi's visit was historic," and added: "I very much need your country on our side, not balancing between the US and Russia." PM Modi's nearly nine-hour visit to Ukraine, the first by an Indian prime minister since Ukraine's independence in 1991, came six weeks after he held summit talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in July in Moscow.</p>

<p>During the bilateral talks, PM Modi had earlier told Zelenskyy that both Ukraine and Russia should sit together without wasting time to find ways to end the ongoing war and that India had been on the side of peace since the beginning of the conflict in February 2022.</p>

<p>"When you begin a strategic partnership, and you begin some dialogue, you don't need to lose time. That's why I think it will be good to meet together again, and if our meeting will be in India, I'll be happy," Zelenskyy said.</p>

<p>"I think, to understand a country is to understand people also. It's better to be in your country because to find the key to your country and to your Prime Minister is to see your people and I need very much to find the key to your country, because I very much need your country on our side, not balancing between the US and Russia," he said.</p>

<p>"It's not about your historical choice, but who knows, maybe your country can be the key in this diplomatic influence," he said, adding, "That's why I'll be happy to come to India as soon as your government, Prime Minister (PM Modi) will be ready to see me." Replying to another question, he said, "We want him (PM Modi) very much to have peace summits, and of course we will be happy to work on it and of course, if he has his ideas, we will be happy to discuss it.</p>

<p>"But we don't change our territories on any propositions ... we don't change our people to any propositions, our territories our values and our freedom and democracy to any propositions ... we will not change," he said.</p>

<p>"PM Modi wants peace more than Putin. The problem is Putin doesn't want (peace). I don't know what they spoke during their meeting. But I ...." Zelenskyy said and shrugged with an expression of exasperation.</p>

<p>Asked about the discussion about defence production, Zelenskyy said, "We spoke basically about some technologies (but) we are open for a very big deal if India will be ready." Answering a question about India not supporting a UN resolution (against Russia some months ago), Zelenskyy said he wanted to forgo what happened in the past and "before new resolutions, we have to speak, we have to make more strong relations between our country (and India) before new decisions." "We will not have big challenges in our relations in the future. And I will focus on it, on future relations between our countries," he added.</p>

<p>Pointing out that there are very significant contracts between India and Russia vis-a-vis oil, the Ukrainian president said, "Putin is afraid of losing the economy, he has nothing except for oil, his main currency is oil. They do have a kind of energy-based economy, and they're export-oriented." "So, the countries importing energy resources from the Russian Federation, then they will be helping the whole world," he added.</p>

<p>On Indian citizens in Ukrainian prison, Zelenskyy denied there were any but added that if there were, he would release them and immediately inform PM Modi.</p>

<p>He said he read media reports about the death of some Indian nationals working for the Russian Army in its war with Ukraine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said on Friday he would suspend his campaign, and endorsed Republican Donald Trump.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said on Friday he would suspend his campaign, and endorsed Republican Donald Trump, likely ending a presidential bid that he began as a Democrat trading on one of the most famous names in American politics.</p>

<p>His campaign indicated that he feared staying in the race would siphon support from former President Trump, who is locked in a tight contest with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>An environmental lawyer, anti-vaccine activist and son and nephew of two titans of Democratic politics who were assassinated during the turbulent 1960s, Kennedy entered the race in April 2023 as a challenger to President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination.</p>

<p>With voters at the time turned off by both the aging Biden and the legally embattled Trump, interest in Kennedy soared. He shifted his plans and decided to run as an independent, and a November 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Kennedy drawing the support of 20% of Americans in a three-way race with Biden and Trump.</p>

<p>He ran a high-profile advertisement during the February 2024 Super Bowl that invoked his father, U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and uncle, U.S. President John F. Kennedy, and drew outrage from much of his high-profile family, who condemned his campaign.</p>

<p>For a time, both the Biden and Trump campaigns showed signs they were worried that Kennedy could draw enough support to change the election outcome. He faced an uphill battle in winning spots on the ballot as an independent but secured key positions including in Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota and North Carolina -- half of the competitive swing states expected to determine the election's outcome.</p>

<p>But as the race changed quickly in the last two months -- with Trump surviving an assassination attempt and the 81-year-old Biden bowing to pressure from his own party and passing the campaign torch to Harris -- voter interest in Kennedy, 70, waned.</p>

<p>An Ipsos poll early this month showed his national support had fallen to 4%, a tiny number, but one that could still be meaningful in a tight race such as the current Trump-Harris matchup.</p>

<p>His campaign had signaled over the past few days that a change was coming, as Kennedy set his Phoenix address. His running mate Nicole Shanahan said in an interview earlier that if the pair stayed in the race as independents, they could ultimate boost Harris' chances.</p>

<p>In exchange for endorsing Trump, Kennedy was hoping for a job in a potential Trump administration, a super PAC supporting Kennedy told Reuters on Wednesday. He also wanted Trump to allow his political movement to continue in some fashion, which could include staying on the ballot in some states.</p>

<p>Kennedy painted himself as a political outsider. He told Reuters in an interview in March that if elected president he would not restrict abortion, would repeal many provisions of Biden's signature Inflation Reduction Act and would seek to close down the southern border to immigrants entering the U.S. illegally. He also offered staunch support for Israel.</p>

<p>Trump mega-donor Timothy Mellon, an 82-year-old banking heir, has given millions of dollars this election cycle in support of Kennedy, and given $75 million in support of Trump, according to Federal Election Commission filings through July 31.</p>

<p>Shanahan has donated over $15 million to the Kennedy campaign, FEC filings showed.</p>

<p>In a video of a phone call posted online last month, Trump suggested to Kennedy that the independent candidate could do something to support the Trump campaign. Soon after, both candidates spoke a day apart from each other at a bitcoin conference in Nashville, trying to court votes.</p>

<p>BEAR, BRAIN WORMS &nbsp;</p>

<p>Kennedy said this month in a video posted online that he dumped a dead bear in New York City's Central Park a decade ago and staged it to look like a bike had hit it. He proclaimed he had "so many skeletons in my closet" after a former family babysitter accused him of sexual assault. He denied that a picture of him posing with the barbecued carcass of a large animal belonged to a canine.</p>

<p>And then there was the brain worm. Kennedy had a parasite in his brain more than a decade ago, but has since fully recovered, a fact unearthed by the New York Times and confirmed by the campaign.</p>

<p>Those stories prompted ridicule from late-night talk show hosts.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party especially has been ruthless in their opposition to Kennedy's candidacy including waging legal challenges against his ballot access, as concern grew that Kennedy could hurt the party's chances in November.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Health Organization declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years, following an outbreak of the viral infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has spread to neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>A new form of the virus, clade Ib, triggered global concern as it seems to be spreading quickly and little is known about the strain. The disease transmits through close contact.</p>

<p>The new strain has spread to at least two countries outside Africa.</p>

<p>The following are the countries that have reported cases of clade Ib mpox:</p>

<p><strong>DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO</strong></p>

<p>Two strains of mpox are spreading in the Democratic Republic of Congo - the endemic clade I and the new clade Ib, which spreads more easily through close contact, including sexual.</p>

<p>As of August 11, DRC has seen a total of 3,235 cases and 19 deaths in 2024. The country has confirmed 38 cases of mpox in the past two weeks, according to WHO data.</p>

<p><strong>SWEDEN</strong></p>

<p>Global health officials on August 15 confirmed an infection with a new strain of the mpox virus in Sweden, the first sign of its spread outside the African continent.</p>

<p>Swedish health officials said at a press conference that the person was infected while in Africa with the clade Ib type of mpox involved in the recent outbreak. The person is receiving treatment.</p>

<p><strong>THAILAND</strong></p>

<p>An mpox case reported in Thailand was confirmed to be of the clade Ib strain of the virus, the first in the country, a disease control official said on Aug. 22.</p>

<p>The case was first reported on Aug. 21, and Thailand had said it was a 66-year-old European man who had arrived from an African country where the disease was spreading.</p>

<p><strong>BURUNDI</strong></p>

<p>As of August 18, Burundi has 153 cases of clade Ib mpox with zero deaths. The country reported 113 cases of clade Ib mpox in the past two weeks, according to WHO data.</p>

<p><strong>KENYA</strong></p>

<p>On July 29, Kenya's health ministry confirmed one case of clade Ib mpox, the first-ever case of mpox identified in the country. No deaths had been reported as of August 8, according to WHO data.</p>

<p><strong>RWANDA</strong></p>

<p>As of August 7, four confirmed clade Ib mpox cases and zero deaths had cumulatively been reported by the country, according to WHO data.</p>

<p><strong>UGANDA</strong></p>

<p>As of August 18, Uganda has identified three cases of clade Ib mpox, with no deaths, according to WHO data. The cases are among the first confirmed mpox cases identified in the country.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Despite China's assurances on debris mitigation, experts worry about the growing risk from such incidents, emphasizing the need for better international regulation.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After accomplishing a noteworthy milestone of launching 18 Qianfan satellites, China's Long March 6A rocket broke apart on August 6, producing almost 300 pieces of trackable debris in low Earth orbit.</p>

<p>The first wave of these satellites was supposed to form China's "own version of Elon Musk's Starlink," the Qianfan ("Thousand Sails") broadband network. The rocket was launched from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Centre, located in the Shanxi Province of North China.</p>

<p>A report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-rocket-space-debris-5e02a603"><em>The Wall Street Journal </em></a>states that the breakup of the rocket generated a new concern over Beijing's attitude towards space junk.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/china-rocket-ends-up-as-300-piece-space-junk-after-satellite-constellation-launch-6297963"><strong>Also Read | China Rocket Ends Up As 300-Piece Space Junk After Satellite Constellation Launch</strong></a><br />
<br />
The report quoted LeoLabs, a US space-tracking firm, as saying the event might create at least 700 fragments floating some 500 miles above earth, making it one of the largest rocket breakups in history. Starlink said the debris didn't pose significant immediate risks to its fleet, but the fragments are “likely to remain in space for decades due to the incident occurring at a high altitude."</p>

<p>China and other countries are pressing ahead with plans to increase rocket launches, raising risks for humans and satellites in orbit. Yet there is little global policing of unsustainable practices.</p>

<p>“Who can enforce anything in space? It's a bit like the Wild West at times," Quentin Parker, director of the Laboratory for Space Research at the University of Hong Kong, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-rocket-space-debris-5e02a603"><em>WSJ.</em></a></p>

<p>Darren McKnight, senior technical fellow at LeoLabs, said China's recent record on generating debris related to Long March 6 launches was worrisome. “I hope it's a wake-up call for them, and they'll be part of the international dialogue," he said.</p>

<p>A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Lin Jian, said last week that China “attaches great importance to space debris mitigation" and “has taken active efforts to fulfill relevant international obligations." Without giving details, he said China took necessary measures after the recent rocket breakup.</p>

<p>It also said in the report that the Chinese activities in space are pointing toward a worrisome tendency in the direction of space junk. In 2022, a rocket stage from China had an uncontrolled re-entry into the Sulu Sea, wherein NASA criticised it for less-than-adequate data provision. Major pieces of junk have been created by Chinese rocket launches, including Long March 6A missions, which are notorious for their bad history. While other countries did better, Chinese behavior was largely responsible for space debris that affects low-Earth orbit environments.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States unveiled sweeping sanctions Friday against almost 400 individuals and companies tied to Russia's war in Ukraine, a day before Ukraine's independence day.</p>

<p>The moves announced by the US Treasury, State and Commerce departments build on a raft of existing sanctions against Russia over the invasion, which is now well into its third year.</p>

<p>"Russia has turned its economy into a tool in service of the Kremlin's military-industrial complex," Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Treasury's actions today continue to implement the commitments made by President Biden and his G7 counterparts to disrupt Russia's military-industrial base supply chains and payment channels," he added.</p>

<p>The sanctions target nearly 400 individuals and entities both inside and outside of Russia "whose products and services enable Russia to sustain its war effort and evade sanctions," the department announced in the statement.</p>

<p>Among those sanctioned were 60 Russia-based defense and technology firms "critical for the sustainment and development of Russia's defense industry," it added.</p>

<p>The State Department said in a separate statement that it was responsible for 190 of the sanctions, and that Treasury was responsible for close to 200 others.</p>

<p>It added that its designations "aim to disrupt sanctions evasion and target entities in multiple third countries," including China, along with businesses supporting the development of Russian energy projects.</p>

<p>Alongside the sanctions unveiled Friday, the US Commerce Department announced it was taking "aggressive action" to further restrict the supply of items made in the United States, or labeled as such, to both Russia and Belarus, due to "the Kremlin's illegal war on Ukraine."</p>

<p>"Today's actions will further constrain Russia's ability to arm its military by targeting illicit procurement networks designed to circumvent global export controls," the department said in a statement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Chinas aggressive manufacturing and export strategy under Xi Jinping, driven by the "establish the new before breaking the old" policy, is intensifying global trade tensions.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's 'Made in China' products have already established a firm foothold in the international market, surpassing the expansion of any other nation in history. Manufacturers all over the world are under tremendous pressure due to the flood of cheaper Chinese goods. China is now focussing more on exporting in an effort to take the lead in the world's manufacturing sector.</p>

<p>According to a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-trade-war-xi-manufacturing-49f81f68"><em>The Wall Street Journal,</em></a>&nbsp;Chinese President Xi Jinping has increased his focus on the manufacturing sector, with a high percentage of production going to export, in response to the slow economic development that his government is facing in recent past. China is once again ramping up its massive export machinery, giving rivals little opportunity to survive in the market.</p>

<p>The impact of China's manufacturing dominance is evident in various sectors. For instance, a Massachusetts startup called CubicPV betting on silicon wafers, a high-tech component in solar panels. Buoyed by President Biden's climate legislation enacted two years ago, with billions of dollars in tax credits and government loans, CubicPV announced plans in late 2022 for a $1.4 billion wafer plant in Texas.</p>

<p>Since then, China has nearly doubled its output of silicon wafers-way more than it needs. The extra wafers had to go somewhere, and they went overseas, pushing prices down by 70%. CubicPV had to halt its production plan early this year, putting engineers and other employees out of work, citing "a distorted market as a result of China's overcapacity."</p>

<p>In another case, thousands of miles away, in Chile, iron ore miner and steelmaker CAP is struggling with China's continued commitment to low-end commodity manufacturing as an onslaught of cheap Chinese metal hits its shores. The firm said this month that it would shutter its giant Huachipato steel mill in central Chile indefinitely, with the loss of some 2,200 jobs. The company said it can't compete with low-priced Chinese metal even after the government raised tariffs on steel bars and other imported products.</p>

<p>Beijing's strategy of bolstering its manufacturing sector through aggressive exports is creating significant challenges for businesses around the world. This escalating trade tension raises concerns about the potential for a new global trade war.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-trade-war-xi-manufacturing-49f81f68"><em>The WSJ report</em></a> further mentioned that other countries have opened antidumping investigations to see whether Chinese goods are being sold below fair value. India is examining Chinese pigments and chemicals. Japan is looking at electrodes. The UK is investigating imports of excavators and biodiesel, while Argentina and Vietnam are probing Chinese microwave ovens and wind towers.</p>

<p>Xi Jinping's "establish the new before breaking the old" strategy prioritizes building new industries like EVs and semiconductors while maintaining traditional ones like steel. Despite acknowledging overcapacity, China continues to invest heavily in manufacturing, driven by concerns about industrial security and economic stability. This approach is straining global trade relations and causing economic hardship in other countries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3><strong>What Are BHISHM Cubes?</strong></h3>

<p>Initiated under the umbrella of Project Aarogya Maitri, BHISHM cube is a mobile hospital made through packing all essential medicines and equipment in cubical boxes (15 inches each) in a well-organised manner. They are arranged according to the types of injuries and medical issues that could be encountered in a war or natural disaster.</p>

<p>These cubes are then positioned on a framework that is adjustable, strong and permits multi-mode transport (by air, sea, land and drone). They can be carried by a person as their maximum weight is 20 kg.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan reported another case of poliovirus after a child was paralysed in the Sindh province, increasing the country's total tally to 16 in 2024, an official told the media on Friday.</p>

<p>An official from the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Islamabad said that the wild Poliovirus type-1 (WPV1) was confirmed in a 29-month-old girl from Hyderabad district of the province, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>According to the official, poliovirus traces have been reported in 62 districts of the South Asian country so far this year, a significant increase from 28 districts last year.</p>

<p>"This is the first polio case from Hyderabad and the third from Sindh, and the 16th case in Pakistan this year," said the NIH official, adding that 12 cases were reported from the southwestern Balochistan province, three from Sindh, and one from the eastern Punjab province.</p>

<p>Prime Minister's Focal Person for Polio Eradication Ayesha Raza Farooq said, "The latest case is a clear reminder that until we eradicate this virus from our country, no child anywhere is safe from its devastating effects."</p>

<p>She added that WPV1 was consistently being reported in sewage samples of Hyderabad for the last four months, reiterating the continued risk of polio circulating anywhere in the country.</p>

<p>"We are operating on an emergency footing in all provinces given the intensity of the outbreak and extent of virus spread. The polio program has been implementing a comprehensive roadmap to interrupt virus transmission, beginning with an extensive, large-scale polio vaccination campaign from September 9," she said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Muhammad Anwar-ul-Haq, coordinator of the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication, said a thorough investigation was being conducted to identify the origins of the virus and immunisation of children.</p>

<p>"Poliovirus has been circulating in adjacent districts of Karachi and Hyderabad for several months," he said.</p>

<p>"Every child's wellbeing is important to us, and we will be launching a vaccination campaign in all affected districts from September 9 to boost children's immunity."</p>

<p>Polio has been eliminated in developed nations but persists in parts of India, Nigeria, Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p>

<p>Many Pakistanis, particularly those residing in the conservative tribal areas, consider polio vaccination a Western campaign aimed at sterilising the country's population. In 2012, the local Taliban ordered a ban on immunisation against polio in some tribal districts.</p>

<p>Nearly a dozen policemen have been killed this year while on security duty during vaccination campaigns which are frequently targeted by operatives.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The incident, captured on a doorbell camera, took place in Newcastle on December 11, 2023, and violated an existing restraining order against Hoganson.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former British film actor knwown for his leading role of the 1988 Hollywood film <em>Empire State</em> has been jailed for 18 months for an attack on his ex-girlfriend, according to <em>The Metro.</em></p>

<p>Jason Hoganson, who in the film took the role of an enigmatic Geordie drifter with such actors as Ray McAnally, Jamie Foreman, and Martin Landau, was convicted of assault following the incident. The attack occurred in a public street; details of this have not been disclosed.</p>

<p>Producers discovered Hoganson while he was studying the art of drama. He had already received critical acclaim for his talent and potential. The role in Empire State was a big break for him.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/08/22/former-hollywood-star-109-convictions-jailed-attacking-ex-21474047/"><em>The Metro</em>,</a> Newcastle Crown Court heard Hoganson, who now has 109 convictions on his record, was caught on a doorbell video camera when he attacked his former partner in Newcastle on December 11 last year. Prosecutor Amy Levitt said Hoganson already had a restraining order to keep him away from the woman when he attacked her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Footage shows the defendant assaulting the complainant. He slaps her to the face and she walks away. He walks after her," Miss Levitt told the court.</p>

<p>"There are further hits and a push, where she falls to the floor.The assault continues while she's lying on the floor.She describes him, having pushed her, hit her, kicked her and put his body weight on her. The assault lasted around three minutes," Miss Levitt added.</p>

<p>Miss Levitt said Hoganson had previously been made the subject of a restraining order-preventing him from contacting the victim-when he was convicted of battery and criminal damage in May last year. Hoganson, of no fixed address, has pleaded guilty to assault by beating and to breaching the restraining order.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Talks in Cairo on reaching a Gaza truce have made progress, the White House said Friday, as it urged Israel and Hamas to move forward.</p>

<p>The White House confirmed that CIA chief William Burns and senior official Brett McGurk were taking part in discussions which started at a preliminary level Thursday evening.</p>

<p>"There has been progress made. We need now for both sides to come together and work towards implementation," National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.</p>

<p>"The preliminary talks that we had going into Cairo last night were constructive in nature. So we want to see that same sort of momentum continue here over the next couple of days," he said.</p>

<p>Kirby said that reports that the diplomacy was "near collapse" were inaccurate.</p>

<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited the Middle East this week and said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was onboard with a US proposal to bridge gaps and reach a ceasefire in the more than 10-month conflict.</p>

<p>Kirby said that the United States continued to believe that Netanyahu accepted the proposal, even though the right-wing leader has insisted on Israeli troops staying on the Gaza-Egypt border, butting heads with both Washington and Cairo.</p>

<p>Kirby appealed again to Hamas to accept the proposal, which was laid out last week in talks in the Qatari capital Doha.</p>

<p>"Think about what this deal will do for the people of Gaza. It gets them a period of calm and a potential end of the war and the violence and the bloodshed," Kirby said.</p>

<p>"It also gets them, because of the stop in the fighting, an incredible opportunity for all of us -- and I mean all of us, including the United States -- to dramatically increase the humanitarian assistance that's getting in," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli airstrikes across southern Lebanon on Friday killed at least six fighters and one child, according to security sources, as armed group Hezbollah responded with artillery rounds and rockets across the border.</p>

<p>The Israeli military has been trading fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah across Lebanon's southern border in parallel with the Gaza war, with hostilities ramping up recently amid fears that a full-scale regional war could erupt.</p>

<p>Israeli strikes on the southern Lebanese towns of Mays al-Jabal and Tayr Harfa on Friday killed four Hezbollah fighters, according to the party's death notices and a security source.</p>

<p>Another fighter was killed in a separate strike outside Aitarun, according to the security source. It was not immediately clear if the combatant was a Hezbollah member.</p>

<p>A separate Israeli strike on the village of Aita, approximately 14 km (nine miles) north of the border with Israel, killed a Hezbollah fighter and a child, the security source told Reuters. Hezbollah identified the fighter killed in Aita as Mohammad Najem.</p>

<p>The Israeli military, in a statement posted online, said it had targeted Najem in Aita because he was a member of Hezbollah's rocket and missile unit. It said it had targeted two other Hezbollah fighters across the south.</p>

<p>Its statement said "a number of projectiles fired from Lebanese territory" had crossed into northern Israel but that no injuries were reported.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's press office said the group had fired rockets and artillery fire onto various Israeli military positions throughout the day.</p>

<p>More than 600 people in Lebanon have been killed since the start of the clashes last October, including more than 400 Hezbollah combatants and over 130 civilians, according to a Reuters toll.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India - one of the world's biggest consumers of crude oil - does not have a "political strategy" that informs its purchases, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said Friday at a press conference in Kyiv, shortly after<a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/pm-modi" target="_blank"> Prime Minister Narendra Modi</a> met Ukraine leader <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/volodymyr-zelensky" target="_blank">Volodymyr Zelensky</a>.</p>

<p>Responding to a question about India overtaking China in the import of Russian crude - sale of which had been sanctioned by the West following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 - Mr Jaishankar also pointed to the volatile nature of the global crude oil market.</p>

<p>"India is a big oil consumer... we are a big oil importer because we don't have oil. Now, it is not like there is a political strategy to buy oil... there is an oil strategy to buy oil... there is a market strategy."</p>

<p>"So the figures of where we import oil from will go up and down... it depends on the market. But definitely, I think it depends, or is decided by, a tight market... one in which big supplies, like Iran and Venezuela, who used to supply to India, are now constrained from operating freely," he said.</p>

<p>"This is a factor that needs to be taken into account," Mr Jaishankar, who has repeatedly defended India's continuing purchase of Russian crude following the war in Ukraine, responded in Kyiv.</p>

<p>"We explained to Ukraine (the current) market scenario. The fact that many producers have been sanctioned makes the market very tight," he had said earlier, in response to another question, stressing "it is in the interest of the world economy that oil prices remain reasonable and stable."</p>

<p>However, analysts this morning said global oil prices remain "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/Oil-Prices-Remain-Vulnerable-to-Demand-Fluctuations.html" target="_blank">vulnerable to demand fluctuations</a>" on the back of "weak manufacturing data from Europe, Asia, and the United States".</p>

<p>In February too Mr Jaishankar - who has also called out Western nations for continuing to buy from Russia in the war's early phases - reaffirmed India's stance on buying Russian oil despite sanctions.</p>

<p>"What should we have done? In many cases Middle East suppliers gave priority to Europe because of higher prices. So either we would have had no energy... or we would have ended up paying a lot more because you (European nations) were paying more," he told German daily Handelsblatt.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar then had argued that India had "in a certain way, stabilised the (global) energy market". Indian consumers, he said, simply could not afford high prices charged by the Middle East.</p>

<p>"If no one bought crude oil from Russia, and everyone bought crude oil from other countries, the prices on the energy market would have shot up even further," he told the German publication.</p>

<p>Prior to the war in Ukraine, India rarely purchased Russian crude due to high freight costs. By 2023, though, Moscow was selling about 1.66 million barrels per day, up from less than 700,000 in 2022.</p>

<p>India - the world's third-biggest oil importer and consumer, became the biggest buyer of seaborne Russian crude since the West halted purchases and imposed sanctions against Moscow.</p>

<p>India has paid for this crude in rupees, dirhams and Chinese yuan.</p>

<p>In May, multiple sources told Reuters Reliance Industries, the operator of the world's biggest refining complex, had signed a one-year deal with Russia's Rosneft to buy at least three million barrels of oil per month, with payment to be made in roubles.</p>

<p>The payment in roubles part was seen as key as it would allow Moscow to circumvent an additional set of sanctions against payments routed through Western banks and financial institutions.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 10-month-old baby in war-shattered Gaza has been paralysed by the type 2 polio virus, the first such case in the territory in 25 years, the World Health Organization said on Friday, with UN agencies appealing for urgent vaccinations of every baby.</p>

<p>The type 2 virus (cVDPV2), while not inherently more dangerous than types 1 and 3, has been responsible for most outbreaks in recent years, especially in areas with low vaccination rates.</p>

<p>UN agencies have called for Israel and Gaza's dominant Palestinian group Hamas to agree to a seven-day humanitarian pause in their 10-month-old war to allow vaccination campaigns to proceed in the territory.</p>

<p>"Polio does not distinguish between Palestinian and Israeli children," the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said on Friday in a post on X.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"Delaying a humanitarian pause will increase the risk of spread among children," Philippe Lazzarini added.</p>

<p>The baby, who has lost movement in his lower left leg, is currently in stable condition, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement.</p>

<p>The WHO has announced that two rounds of a polio vaccination campaign are set to begin in late August and September 2024 across the densely populated Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>With its health services widely damaged or destroyed by fighting, and raw sewage spreading amid a breakdown in sanitation infrastructure, Gaza's population is particularly vulnerable to outbreaks of disease.</p>

<h3><strong>Challenge of vaccinations in war zone</strong></h3>

<p>Gaza's health ministry first reported the polio case in the unvaccinated 10-month-old baby a week ago in the central city of Deir Al-Balah, an often embattled area in the war.</p>

<p>Hamas on Aug. 16 supported a U.N. request for a seven-day pause in the fighting to vaccinate Gaza children against polio, Hamas political bureau official Izzat al-Rishq said on Friday.</p>

<p>Israel, which has laid siege to Gaza since last October and whose ground offensive and bombardments have levelled much of the territory, said days later it would facilitate the transfer of polio vaccines into Gaza for around one million children.</p>

<p>The Israeli military's humanitarian unit (COGAT) said it was coordinating with Palestinians to procure 43,000 vials of vaccine - each with multiple doses - for delivery in Israel in the coming weeks for transfer to Gaza.</p>

<p>The vaccines should be sufficient for two rounds of doses for more than a million children, COGAT added.</p>

<p>As well as allowing the entry of polo specialists into Gaza, the UN has said a successful campaign would require transport for vaccines and refrigeration equipment at every step as well as conditions that would allow the campaign to reach children in every area of the rubble-clogged territory.</p>

<p>Poliomyelitis, a highly infectious virus primarily spread through the fecal-oral route, can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis.</p>

<p>Traces of polio virus were detected last month in sewage in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, two areas in southern and central Gaza that have seen hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced by the fighting seek shelter.</p>

<p>Children under five are particularly at risk.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Health Organization said on Friday its partners like Gavi and Unicef can start buying mpox vaccines before they are approved in a bid to get inoculations to Africa faster as the continent battles an escalating outbreak of the virus.</p>

<p>Traditionally, organisations like Gavi, which helps lower-income countries buy vaccines, can only start purchasing shots once they have approval from the WHO. But the rules have been relaxed in this instance to get talks moving, as the WHO's approval is due in a few weeks.</p>

<p>Two vaccines, made by Denmark's Bavarian Nordic and Japan's KM Biologics, are already approved by regulators around the world, including the United States and Japan, and have been in widespread use for mpox since 2022.</p>

<p>Around 1.2 million people have had Bavarian Nordic's vaccine in the United States alone. The WHO is expected to grant an emergency licence to the shots in September.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Afghanistan's Taliban formally codified a long set of rules governing morality this week, ranging from requiring women to cover their faces and men to grow beards to banning car drivers from playing music, the Justice Ministry said.</p>

<p>The rules, promoted as in line with Islamic sharia law and to be enforced by the morality ministry, were based on a decree by the Taliban's supreme spiritual leader in 2022 and were now officially published as law, a Justice Ministry spokesman said.</p>

<p>The morality ministry, formally called the Ministry for the Prevention of Vice and Propagation of Virtue, has already been enforcing similar morality requirements and says it has detained thousands of people for violations. It was not immediately clear whether publication of the rules would lead to stronger enforcement.</p>

<p>The Taliban's restrictions on women and freedom of expression have drawn sharp criticism from rights groups and many foreign governments since the former insurgents resumed control of Afghanistan in 2021.</p>

<p>Western capitals, led by Washington, have said the path to formal recognition of the Taliban is largely stalled until they reverse course on women's rights and open high schools to girls.</p>

<p>The Taliban say they respect women's rights in accordance with their interpretation of Islamic law and local customs and that they are internal matters that should be addressed locally.</p>

<p>The 35-article morality law was officially enacted and published on Wednesday after being ratified by Supreme Spiritual Leader Haibatullah Akhundzada, said Justice Ministry spokesperson Barakatullah Rasoli.</p>

<p>"According to this law, the Ministry (for Prevention of Vice and Propagation of Virtue) is obligated to promote good and forbid evil in accordance with Islamic Sharia," the Justice Ministry said in a statement.</p>

<p>The requirements include women to wear attire that fully covers their bodies and faces and bars men from shaving their beards as well as from skipping prayer and religious fasts.</p>

<p>Penalties for violations included "advice, warnings of divine punishment, verbal threats, confiscation of property, detention for one hour to three days in public jails, and any other punishment deemed appropriate," the Justice Ministry added.</p>

<p>If such measures failed to correct an individual's behaviour they would be referred to court for further action, it said.</p>

<p>"A lot of these rules were in place already but less formally and now they are being formalised I think this is a sign of what we've been seeing over the last three years which is a steady and gradual escalation of the crackdown," said Heather Barr, Associate Director of Human Rights Watch's Women's Rights Division.</p>

<p>The laws also instruct drivers of vehicles not to transport women without a male guardian. They require media to abide by sharia law and ban the publication of images containing living beings.</p>

<p>Morality ministry officials have been monitoring Afghans throughout the country for alleged offences for the past three years. The ministry said this week that in the past year it had detained over 13,000 people, though it did not break down the alleged offences or gender of the detainees. It said around half of the detentions were for 24 hours.</p>

<p>The Taliban suspended Afghanistan's previous constitution when they took over in 2021 as foreign forces withdrew, and said they would rule the country according to sharia law.</p>

<p>This week's morality laws were the seventh set of codified laws, according to the Justice Ministry, with others relating to property, financial services and the prevention of begging.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

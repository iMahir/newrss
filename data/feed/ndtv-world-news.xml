       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US court has summoned the Indian government after Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun filed a civil lawsuit, alleging a plot to murder him. The summons by the US District Court for Southern District of New York names Government of India, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, former R&amp;AW chief Samant Goel, R&amp;AW agent Vikram Yadav, and Indian businessman Nikhil Gupta. The summons asks New Delhi and those named to file a reply within 21 days.</p>

<p>The Centre is yet to respond to the summons. Pannu's X handle, on which he shared a copy of the summons, has been withheld.</p>

<p>In November, the UK newspaper Financial Times reported that the US had thwarted a plot to kill Pannun, who heads the radical outfit, Sikhs for Justice, and holds dual citizenship of the US and Canada. Officials in the Joe Biden administration later confirmed this.</p>

<p>In its first response, the External Affairs Ministry said it is a "matter of concern" and stressed that India has launched a high-level probe.</p>

<p>"As regards the case against an individual that has been filed in a US court, allegedly linking him to an Indian official, this is a matter of concern. We have said that this is also contrary to government policy," then MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.</p>

<p>In May this year, External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar said India is investigating the matter, but stressed that it would not impact the "upward trajectory" of India-US ties.</p>

<p>"The United States brought to our attention certain information in good faith because we also believe some of it has implications for our own system," he said in an interview to news agency PTI.</p>

<p>"We are investigating it. But I do not think the fundamental course of the upward trajectory of India-US is impacted by this at all," he said.</p>

<p>US ambassador to India Eric Garcetti has told NDTV that this matter will not affect India-US ties.</p>

<p>Pannun is known to put out incendiary speeches and threats against Indian leaders and institutions. New Delhi designated him a terrorist in 2020.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Lebanon has blamed Israel for the sabotage of thousands of pagers that caused them to explode, killing several people and wounding thousands, in an apparent bid to weaken the Islamist militant group Hezbollah.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon has blamed Israel for the sabotage of thousands of pagers that caused them to explode, killing several people and wounding thousands, in an apparent bid to weaken the Islamist militant group Hezbollah. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the attack, which came after almost a year of cross-border rocket fire between the two sides in a second front to the war in Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p>United Nations, government and tech-industry officials were left scratching their heads over how the co-ordinated series of blasts had been carried out, though veterans of Israel's intelligence agencies Mossad and Shin Bet have opened up about assassinations in the past - some of which required high levels of technical or operational ingenuity.</p>

<h3><strong>Deadly Phone Call</strong></h3>

<p>Shin Bet used a mobile phone secretly fitted with explosives to kill Yahya Ayyash, a master bombmaker from Hamas nicknamed "the Engineer," in Gaza in 1996. A Palestinian go-between gave Ayyash the phone to receive a call from his father. When Israeli eavesdroppers verified it was Ayyash's voice on the line, the phone was remotely detonated, causing a lethal head injury.</p>

<h3><strong>Neck Poison</strong></h3>

<p>In retaliation for a series of Hamas suicide bombings in 1997, then first-term Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the killing of the Palestinian Islamist group's politburo chief, Khaled Mashaal, in the Jordanian capital of Amman.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two undercover Mossad officers sprayed poison onto Meshaal's nape as he left his car for an appointment, with one of them opening a pre-shaken can of Coca-Cola to provide an innocent explanation for the rogue liquid. The plan failed because Meshaal's daughter ran after him, prompting an aide to turn around and notice the would-be assassins.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They were captured by Jordanian police, and repatriated only after Israel provided an antidote to save Meshaal's life.</p>

<h3><strong>Fake Tourists</strong></h3>

<p>Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, an international arms procurer for Hamas, was found dead in his Dubai hotel room in 2010. Emirati authorities initially deemed it death by natural causes but re-opened the case after the Gaza-based Palestinian group accused Israel of killing him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The subsequent investigation uncovered CCTV footage of a Mossad hit team, using cloned European passports and posing as tennis-playing tourists, businesspeople, or hotel staff, surveilling Mabhouh and converging on his hotel room. An autopsy determined that Mabhouh had been sedated and smothered.</p>

<h3><strong>Traffic Blasts</strong></h3>

<p>Between 2010 and 2020, about half a dozen Iranian nuclear scientists were killed or wounded in gun attacks or explosions that authorities blamed on Israel. Most of them were caused by magnetized bombs that had been attached to vehicles by passing motorcyclists, according to Iranian state media reports.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel hasn't confirmed it was behind any of the strikes, though its officials acknowledged being locked in a shadow war with Iran. A former Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, would later claim responsibility for a similar assassination in the Iranian capital in 2022.</p>

<h3><strong>Satellite Sniper</strong></h3>

<p>Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, Iran's chief nuclear scientist, was shot dead while driving in a convoy on the outskirts of Tehran in 2020. Some Iranian media reports said Israel used a satellite-controlled sniper rifle mounted on the back of a pick-up truck and equipped with AI face recognition. Israel didn't confirm the killing, though Netanyahu had previously identified Fakhrizadeh as head of a secret Iranian nuclear weapons program, saying: "Remember his name."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The bank said that these scams are highly effective, with millions of people potentially at risk.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A UK bank, Starling Bank, has issued a warning about a new wave of scams that use artificial intelligence to replicate people's voices. Fraudsters can create convincing voice clones from just a few seconds of audio, often found in online videos, the bank said in a press release.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The online-only lender said that these scams are highly effective, with millions of people potentially at risk. The bank's survey found that over a quarter of respondents had been targeted by such scams in the past year, and many were unaware of the threat, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/18/tech/ai-voice-cloning-scam-warning/index.html" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>CNN </em></a>reported.</p>

<p>"People regularly post content online which has recordings of their voice, without ever imagining it's making them more vulnerable to fraudsters," Lisa Grahame, chief information security officer at Starling Bank, said in the press release.</p>

<p>According to the survey, 46% of respondents weren't aware that such scams existed, and that 8% would send over as much money as requested by a friend or family member, even if they thought the call seemed strange.</p>

<p>To protect themselves, people are advised to establish a "safe phrase" with their loved ones. This unique phrase can be used to verify identity during phone calls. The bank advised against sharing the safe phrase over text, which could make it easier for scammers to find out, but, if shared in this day, the message should be deleted once the other person has seen it. &nbsp;</p>

<p>As AI technology continues to advance, concerns about its potential for misuse are growing. The creators of ChatGPT, and OpenAI, have even acknowledged the risks associated with voice replication tools.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a bid to bring down the number of temporary residents in the country, Canada on Wednesday announced to further reduce the number of study permits it will grant to foreign students and also tightened its foreign worker rules, a move that will impact many Indians.</p>

<p>"We're granting 35% fewer international student permits this year. And next year, that number's going down by another 10%," Prime Minister Justin Trudeau posted on X.</p>

<p>"Immigration is an advantage for our economy - but when bad actors abuse the system and take advantage of students, we crack down," he added.</p>

<br />
Immigration is an advantage for our economy — but when bad actors abuse the system and take advantage of students, we crack down.</p>
— Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) <a href="https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau/status/1836505915568136239?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>According to immigration department data, Canada approved 5,09,390 in 2023 and 1,75,920 in the first seven months of 2024 and the new move would reduce the number of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-canadas-2-year-cap-on-foreign-students-and-who-will-be-impacted-4969561" target="_blank">international study permits</a> issued to 4,37,000 in 2025.</p>

<p>The changes would also limit work permit eligibility for spouses of some students and temporary foreign workers.</p>

<p>The announcement comes as Trudeau's Liberal government, trailing in the public opinion polls ahead of the federal elections next year, seeks to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/watch-hundreds-of-indian-foreign-students-queue-up-for-a-job-at-tim-hortons-in-canada-5949995" target="_blank">reduce the number of temporary residents</a>, including international students and foreign workers.</p>

<p>In January, Canada had also placed a two-year cap on international students.</p>

<p>According to Statistics Canada, the biggest jump in immigration numbers comes from temporary residents, especially students and workers, whose ranks have doubled in just two years from 1.4 million in the second quarter of 2022 to 2.8 million in the second quarter of 2024.</p>

<p>Canada has already pledged to reduce the number of temporary residents to 5% of the total population, which was 6.8% in April.</p>

<p>Migrants have been blamed for societal problems including a lack of affordable housing and a ramped-up cost of living in Canada.</p>

<h3><strong>How Canada's New Rules Will Impact Indians</strong></h3>

<p>Canada is among the favourite destinations for <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/indian-students-in-canada-face-deportation-after-policy-change-6429289" target="_blank">Indian students</a>. According to the Indian government's data released last month, about 13.35 lakh Indian students are studying abroad, with about 4.27 lakh in&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/education/over-13-lakh-indian-students-studying-abroad-highest-enrolled-in-canada-government-6273737" target="_blank">Canada</a>.</p>

<p>Between 2013 and 2022, the number of Indian students moving to Canada to study has seen a massive rise of 260 per cent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a Reuters report earlier this year, about 40 per cent of overseas students in Canada were from India.</p>

<p>The Canadian government's move to cut international student permits will now make Indian students choose other options such as the US, UK, or Australia.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The decision follows Namibia's recent move to cull elephants and other wildlife to address food insecurity worsened by a prolonged drought.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities in Zimbabwe have given the go-ahead for the slaughtering of 200 elephants to feed hungry citizens left hungry by its worst drought in decades. Tinashe Farawo, a spokesperson for the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Authority told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/16/climate/zimbabwe-cull-elephants-intl-scli/index.html" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>CNN </em></a>that with nearly half of the country's population facing the risk of acute hunger, "we are targeting to cull 200 elephants."</p>

<p>The decision follows Namibia's recent move to cull elephants and other wildlife to address food insecurity worsened by a prolonged drought. These culls have faced criticism from animal rights advocates and conservationists.</p>

<p>According to Farawo, Zimbabwe's elephant population is over 84,000, nearly double its estimated capacity of 45,000. It is the second largest globally after Botswana.</p>

<p>Last week, Environment Minister Sithembiso Nyoni informed parliament that Zimbabwe has more elephants than needed and more than the forests can sustain. She noted that elephant overpopulation leads to resource shortages, intensifying human-wildlife conflict.</p>

<p>Nyoni added that the government is considering strategies similar to Namibia's, including counting the elephants and organizing communities, especially women, to preserve and distribute the meat to protein-deficient regions.</p>

<p>"When wildlife overpopulates a park, they venture beyond it in search of resources like water or vegetation. This brings them into contact with humans, sparking conflicts," Nyoni explained.</p>

<p>In Namibia, the government authorized the culling of 700 wild animals, including elephants, to distribute to people facing food shortages. So far, 150 animals have been culled, and over 125,000 pounds of meat distributed, according to Namibia's Ministry of Environment, Forestry, and Tourism.</p>

<p>Zimbabwe and Namibia are among the southern African countries enduring a severe drought exacerbated by El Nino and climate change.</p>

<p>Farawo, a spokesperson for Zimbabwe's parks authority, stated that the culling will begin once the required documentation is finalized. The slaughter will target regions with dense elephant populations.</p>

<p>However, these proposed elephant culls have faced strong opposition.</p>

<p>Farai Maguwu, head of the Zimbabwe-based Center for Natural Resource Governance, condemned the practice on X, stating, "Culling of elephants must be stopped. Elephants have a right to exist," adding that future generations deserve to see elephants in their natural habitat.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Culling of elephants must be stopped. Some are eying an opportunity to sell ivory, illicitly - what with these private jets flying out week in, week out. With the way minerals are being looted, soon we wont have any elephant to talk about. Hands off our wildlife!</p>
— Farai Maguwu (@FMaguwu) <a href="https://twitter.com/FMaguwu/status/1835366038843589062?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p></p>

<p>Keith Lindsay, a conservation biologist and natural resources consultant, also expressed concern that using wildlife to address food insecurity could lead to unsustainable demand for bushmeat.</p>

<p>Farawo defended the cull, Zimbabwe's first since 1988, as part of broader efforts to reduce human-elephant conflicts, following a string of fatal elephant attacks.</p>

<p>"The animals are causing significant problems in communities, killing people. Just last week, a woman in the northern part of the country was killed by an elephant. The same happened the week before. So, culling is also a method of control," he said.</p>

<p>Local media reported that at least 31 people have died in Zimbabwe this year due to conflicts between humans and wildlife.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former CIA officer was sentenced to 30 years in prison on Wednesday for drugging and sexually abusing more than two dozen women in several countries. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ex-cia-officer-admits-drugging-sexually-abusing-multiple-women-4561666">Brian Jeffrey Raymond</a>, 48, of La Mesa, California, pleaded guilty in November 2023 to one count of abusive sexual contact and other charges.</p>

<p>"When this predator was a government employee, he lured unsuspecting women to his government-leased housing and drugged them," Matthew Graves, the US Attorney for the District of Columbia, said.</p>

<p>"After drugging these women, he stripped, sexually abused, and photographed them," Graves said in a statement.</p>

<p>Nicole Argentieri, a senior Justice Department official, said Raymond "sexually exploited dozens of women over the course of 14 years."</p>

<p>According to court documents, Raymond's last posting was in Mexico City, where he drugged and sexually assaulted several women.</p>

<p>The FBI, in an October 2021 appeal to the public for information, said the investigation into Raymond began on May 31, 2020, when a naked woman was seen screaming for help from the balcony of his residence in Mexico City.</p>

<p>It said hundreds of photographs and videos were recovered from Raymond's electronic devices depicting at least 24 unconscious and nude or partially nude women.</p>

<p>Raymond worked for many years at the Central Intelligence Agency, the FBI said, had lived in numerous countries, including Peru, and was fluent in Spanish and Mandarin.</p>

<p>He worked at the US embassy in Mexico from August 2018 until May 2020.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rap mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs will remain imprisoned pending trial on racketeering and sex trafficking charges, after a judge denied his appeal Wednesday.</p>

<p>Judge Andrew Carter upheld the previous day's ruling that the bail package proposed by his defense team -- which included a $50 million bond secured by his Miami home -- was insufficient given his history of violence and substance abuse, and the possibility of witness tampering.</p>

<p>"It did not go our way," Combs's lawyer Marc Agnifilo told journalists outside the federal courthouse in Manhattan following the ruling.</p>

<p>He vowed to keep pushing for Combs's release on bail and also said he would urge the trial to move forward "as quickly as possible."</p>

<p>"Wherever he is, his resolve is the same. He believes he's innocent," Agnifilo said, adding that the prison conditions Combs is being held in are "inhumane."</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the 54-year-old Combs was indicted on three criminal counts that allege he sexually abused women and coerced them into drug-fueled sex parties using threats and violence.</p>

<p>Along with racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, Combs is charged with one count of transporting victims across state lines to engage in prostitution.</p>

<p>Prosecutors say Combs was the don of a criminal enterprise that ensnared women and forced them to commit sex acts under the threat of violence, financial insecurity and reputational ruin.</p>

<p>Combs has pleaded not guilty.</p>

<p>Prosecutors are likening his crimes to those of the late Jeffrey Epstein, convicted sex cult leader Keith Raniere, and fellow musician R. Kelly, who received more than three decades in prison for racketeering, sex trafficking and child sex crimes.</p>

<p>It's a remarkable fall from grace for the artist credited with playing a key role in the commercialization of hip-hop, who produced a constellation of famous proteges including The Notorious B.I.G.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has said that Israel has entered a "new phase" in its conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon, following two days of explosions targeting communication devices across Lebanon.</p>

<p>Speaking at a military airbase in northern Israel on Wednesday, Gallant said that Israel is "shifting northward by reallocating resources, energy, and forces", Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>"We are at the beginning of a new phase in the war -- this requires boldness, determination, and perseverance," Gallant said. He added that the goal is "to return the residents of the northern communities to their homes safely."</p>

<p>The announcement came a day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Security Cabinet decided to expand the conflict's objectives, aiming to enable displaced Israelis to return to border areas affected by cross-border fighting with Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Gallant praised the military's progress but did not comment on Israel's alleged role in recent attacks in Lebanon. "The IDF is achieving excellent results, along with the Shin Bet, the Mossad, and all other relevant bodies," he said.</p>

<p>Lebanese officials reported that thousands of pagers and handheld radios exploded over two days, killing at least 21 people, including children, and injuring more than 3,000 others. Israel has not claimed responsibility for these incidents.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada is further reducing the number of study permits it will grant to foreign students and tightening eligibility for work permits in a bid to cut down on the number of temporary residents in the country, the government said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The announcement comes as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government, trailing in the public opinion polls and coming off a major by-election loss this week, seeks to reduce the number of temporary residents - including international students and foreign workers - in the country.</p>

<p>The issue has become one of the most contentious in Canadian politics with a federal election due no later than October, 2025.</p>

<p>The changes announced on Wednesday would reduce the number of international study permits issued to 437,000 in 2025. Canada approved 509,390 in 2023, according to immigration department data, and 175,920 in the first seven months of 2024.</p>

<p>The changes would also limit work permit eligibility for spouses of some students and temporary foreign workers.</p>

<p>As Canada sees a spike in the number of refugee claimants, the government said Wednesday it planned to review measures to strengthen visa integrity and was "reviewing visa decision-making so that our highly trained officers have the right tools to detect fraud and reduce the number of non-genuine visitors."</p>

<p>"The reality is that not everyone who wants to come to Canada will be able to—just like not everyone who wants to stay in Canada will be able to," Immigration Minister Marc Miller said in a statement.</p>

<p>The government has already pledged to reduce the number of temporary residents to 5% of the total population. It was 6.8% in April.</p>

<p>Migrants have been blamed for societal problems including a lack of affordable housing and ramped-up cost of living, even as post-pandemic inflation slowed to the Bank of Canada's target of 2% annually in August.</p>

<p>Immigrant advocates and some economists argue the link between migrants and economic malaise is an oversimplification, and that vulnerable newcomers cannot be held responsible for complex economic problems.</p>

<p>Polls have shown a growing slice of the public thinks Canada is bringing in too many immigrants, and anti-migrant rhetoric and attacks have risen in Canada, once renowned for its welcoming stance toward newcomers.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, after years of increasing Canada's ranks of temporary residents, its federal government is seeking to pull back.</p>

<p>In January, the government placed a two-year cap on international students, whose approvals are projected to decrease by almost half this year.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the government walked back 2022 expansions to the temporary foreign worker program. In some sectors, it reduced the maximum share of any employer's workforce that can be made up of low-wage, temporary foreign workers. It also ended, in some sectors, low-wage temporary foreign workers in communities with high unemployment rates.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US authorities on Wednesday said Iranian cyberattackers had offered "stolen, non-public" material from Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign to staff for his then White House rival, Joe Biden.</p>

<p>US intelligence and law enforcement agencies said the hackers "sent unsolicited emails to individuals then associated with President Biden's campaign that contained an excerpt taken from stolen, non-public material from former president Trump's campaign."</p>

<p>Biden was at the time the Democratic presidential nominee, before dramatically stepping aside in July and endorsing his vice president, Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>The joint statement from the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said none of Biden's campaign staff replied to the emails.</p>

<p>In August, the same agencies first attributed the hack to Iran, accusing Tehran of seeking to influence the 2024 election. Iran denies the allegations.</p>

<p>"Foreign actors are increasing their election influence activities" as Election Day in November approaches, the US statement said, singling out Russia, Iran and China as "trying by some measure to exacerbate divisions in US society for their own benefit."</p>

<p>The US agencies said the Iranian cyberattackers had also attempted to share the information stolen from the Trump campaign with US media organizations. It did not name the outlets.</p>

<p>In August, Iran denied the allegations, with its mission to the United Nations challenging Washington to release proof.</p>

<p>"Such allegations are unsubstantiated and devoid of any standing," the mission said at the time.</p>

<p>"As we have previously announced, the Islamic Republic of Iran harbors neither the intention nor the motive to interfere with the US presidential election."</p>

<p>The United States goes to the polls on November 5, with both the Trump and Harris campaigns saying they have been targeted by cyberattacks in recent weeks.</p>

<p>US-based tech companies have also said they detected such attacks.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign on Wednesday said the plot attributed to Tehran was "proof the Iranians are actively interfering in the election to help Kamala Harris and Joe Biden."</p>

<p>Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said this was "because they know President Trump will restore his tough sanctions and stand against their reign of terror."</p>

<p>In 2016, a hack of Democratic National Committee emails -- blamed on Russians -- exposed internal party communications, including about candidate Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>Trump, who would go on to win that election, was criticized for encouraging the hack.</p>

<p>Harris's campaign said on August 13 that it too had been targeted by foreign hackers, but did not give an indication of which country was believed to be behind the attempt.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Disgraced Hollywood movie producer Harvey Weinstein pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to a new sex crime charge in New York.</p>

<p>Weinstein, 72, who had emergency heart surgery just over a week ago, appeared in a Manhattan courtroom in a wheelchair to enter his plea to a single count of committing a criminal sexual act.</p>

<p>The once-powerful movie mogul was unshaven and appeared pale and visibly frail during his brief court appearance before Judge Curtis Farber. He was wearing a dark suit, a white shirt and a blue tie.</p>

<p>Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said the new indictment of Weinstein is for the alleged sexual assault of a woman in a lower Manhattan hotel sometime between April 29, 2006 and May 6, 2006.</p>

<p>"Thanks to this survivor who bravely came forward, Harvey Weinstein now stands indicted for an additional alleged violent sexual assault," Bragg said in a statement.</p>

<p>"This investigation is ongoing," he added.</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters after the arraignment, Arthur Aidala, Weinstein's lawyer, said the alleged sexual assault behind the new charge was "almost two decades ago" and "at this moment I don't know much more than that."</p>

<p>Weinstein is serving a 16-year prison sentence after being convicted on rape charges in California.</p>

<p>He was also convicted in New York in 2020 of the rape and sexual assault of an actress and of forcibly performing oral sex on a production assistant.</p>

<p>He was sentenced to 23 years in prison in that case.</p>

<p>The New York Court of Appeals, however, overturned that conviction in April and Weinstein is awaiting a retrial on those charges.</p>

<p>The new trial was scheduled to begin on November 12 but prosecutors said Wednesday the date seems "unrealistic."</p>

<p>Farber scheduled a next court hearing for Weinstein for October 2.</p>

<p>The one-time Hollywood heavyweight has suffered from a raft of health issues while in prison and has spent time in a secure hospital unit.</p>

<p>Weinstein was rushed to Bellevue Hospital last week from New York's Rikers Island prison for emergency heart surgery.</p>

<p>Allegations against Weinstein helped launch the #MeToo movement in 2017, a watershed moment for women fighting sexual misconduct.</p>

<p>More than 80 women accused him of harassment, sexual assault or rape, including prominent actors Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ashley Judd.</p>

<p>Weinstein claimed any sexual relations in question were consensual.</p>

<p>Weinstein and his brother Bob co-founded Miramax Films.</p>

<p>Their hits included 1994's "Pulp Fiction" and 1998's "Shakespeare in Love," for which Weinstein shared a best picture Oscar.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China will certainly be "high on the agenda" at the Quad Summit set to be hosted by US President Joe Biden in Delaware's Wilmington on September 21, US National Security Council (NSC) Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby on Wednesday (local time) said.</p>

<p>While addressing a press briefing, Kirby stressed that it would be irresponsible if the Quad leaders do not hold talks about the challenges that exist in the region caused by China.</p>

<p>When asked to what extent China will be a focus of the Quad Summit, Kirby stated, "I think it'll certainly be high on the agenda. I mean, there's not an opportunity when you get together with these particular leaders, the Indo-Pacific, Quad, where you in fact it would be irresponsible if they didn't talk about the challenges that still exist in the region caused by aggressive PRC military action for instance, unfair trade practices, tensions over the Taiwan Strait. I have no doubt that that all those issues will come up."</p>

<p>Biden is set to host the fourth in-person Quad Leaders summit in Delaware on September 21 and is looking forward to welcoming Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. It is the first time Biden will host foreign leaders in his hometown.</p>

<p>When asked whether Quad nations view China as a threat to the Indo-Pacific region, John Kirby said, "I think you'd have to talk to the leaders about their particular view of the PRC. But, I think we all have a common understanding about the challenges that the PRC is posing, but each of them is a sovereign country; they get to decide for themselves what their relationship is going to be with the PRC and how that looks; each of them has a different relationship with the PRC, including us."</p>

<p>John Kirby said that Biden will meet Quad leaders individually and the four together in a larger plenary session where they will discuss expanding cooperation on various critically important issues.</p>

<p>Speaking about the upcoming Quad Summit, he said, "The President will meet individually with each of them, and then we'll also gather together in a larger plenary session where they will discuss expanding cooperation across a range of critically important issues. We believe that you'll see coming out of this summit that the Quad is more strategically aligned and more relevant than ever before."</p>

<p>"I think you can expect a robust agenda aimed at delivering concrete benefits to the people of the region as they all identify priorities such as health, security, natural disaster response, maritime security, quality infrastructure, critical and emerging technologies, climate and clean energy, and cybersecurity. You'll also see some announcements that demonstrate our intention to make sure that this special partnership the Quad endures and in fact thrives over the long term. We'll have more details, of course to share on the specific deliverables as we get a little closer to the weekend," he added.</p>

<p>When asked if Biden intends to press PM Modi on human rights during their bilateral meeting, Kirby responded, "There's not a conversation that he has with foreign leaders where he doesn't talk about the importance of respecting human and civil rights and that includes with Prime Minister Modi. He did when the Prime Minister was here in the United States and and I'm sure that, as appropriate, he'll do going forward. I'm not going to get ahead of the conversation but he never shies away from talking about our concerns over human and civil rights anywhere in the world."</p>

<p>Quad is a diplomatic partnership between four countries--Australia, India, Japan, and the United States. It is pertinent to note that in recent years, Quad Foreign Ministers have met eight times, and Quad governments continue to meet and coordinate at all levels.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's X social network carried out an automatic update overnight on phone applications that allowed it to bypass a ban in Brazil, an association of internet providers said Wednesday.</p>

<p>Some Brazilian users were surprised to have access again to the platform, formerly Twitter, from their phones after a Supreme Court judge last month ordered its shutdown in a legal standoff with Musk.</p>

<p>The Brazilian Association of Internet and Telecommunications Providers (ABRINT) explained that the return of X was due to an update of the app to Cloudflare software that uses constantly changing IP addresses.</p>

<p>The previous system used specific IPs, which act like a home address for servers or computers and could more easily be blocked.</p>

<p>The changes "make blocking the app much more complicated," said ABRINT.</p>

<p>Many of the dynamic IPs "are shared with other legitimate services, such as banks and large internet platforms, making it impossible to block an IP without affecting other services," the group said.</p>

<p>"Internet providers are in a delicate position," and awaiting technical analysis and instructions from Brazil's telecommunications agency, said ABRINT.</p>

<p>Brazil's shutdown of X infuriated Musk and has fueled a fierce debate on freedom of expression and the limits of social networks, both inside and outside the country.</p>

<p>The social media platform has more than 22 million users in Brazil.</p>

<p>Judge Alexandre de Moraes last month ordered X to be banned after Musk refused to remove dozens of right-wing accounts and then failed to name a new legal representative in the country as ordered.</p>

<p>Moraes has repeatedly clashed with the South African-born billionaire after making it his mission to crack down on disinformation.</p>

<p>Last week he ordered the transfer of some $3 million from Musk's companies to pay fines incurred by X.</p>

<p>Moraes also froze the assets of X and Starlink, which has been operating in Brazil since 2022 -- especially in remote communities in the Amazon -- to ensure payment of fines imposed on X for its failure to follow court orders.</p>

<p>Musk reacted angrily to the suspension, calling Moraes a "dictator."</p>

<p>Moraes also ordered that those using "technological subterfuges" such as virtual private networks (VPNs) to access the blocked site could be fined up to $9,000.</p>

<p>"Judge Alexandre de Moraes: I didn't use a VPN to get in here, I just opened the app for my daily abstinence ritual and saw that it worked," wrote one user on X Wednesday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Justice Department filed a lawsuit on Wednesday seeking more than $100 million from the Singapore owner and operator of a cargo ship that destroyed a Baltimore bridge.</p>

<p>The 1,000-foot (300-meter) M/V Dali collided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge on March 26, killing six road workers and blocking the busy shipping channel.</p>

<p>The civil suit against Grace Ocean Private and Synergy Marine Private was filed in the US District Court for the District of Maryland.</p>

<p>"The Justice Department is committed to ensuring accountability for those responsible for the destruction of the Francis Scott Key Bridge," Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.</p>

<p>"With this civil claim, the Justice Department is working to ensure that the costs of clearing the channel and reopening the Port of Baltimore are borne by the companies that caused the crash, not by the American taxpayer."</p>

<p>The Justice Department said the suit is aimed at recovering more than $100 million in costs incurred in responding to the disaster and for removing tons of bridge debris.</p>

<p>The Dali lost power while leaving the port of Baltimore for Sri Lanka and struck the bridge.</p>

<p>Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Benjamin Mizer said the owner and operator of the Dali were "well aware of vibration issues on the vessel that could cause a power outage.</p>

<p>"But instead of taking necessary precautions, they did the opposite.</p>

<p>"Out of negligence, mismanagement, and, at times, a desire to cut costs, they configured the ship's electrical and mechanical systems in a way that prevented those systems from being able to quickly restore propulsion and steering after a power outage," Mizer said.</p>

<p>"As a result, when the Dali lost power, a cascading set of failures led to disaster."</p>

<p>The Justice Department suit comes after Grace Ocean and Synergy Marine filed a legal action of their own earlier this year seeking to limit their liability to $44 million.</p>

<p>The Justice Department lawsuit does not seek damages for the eventual costs of rebuilding the bridge. That is expected to be the subject of a separate claim from the state of Maryland.</p>

<p>The families of the six road workers who lost their lives are also pursuing legal claims of their own.</p>

<p>The Fort McHenry channel leading to the port of Baltimore, a key hub for the auto industry, reopened to commercial navigation on June 10.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A second wave of device explosions killed 14 people and wounded more than 450 others on Wednesday in Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon, officials said, stoking fears of an all-out war with Israel.</p>

<p>A source close to Hezbollah said walkie-talkies used by its members blew up in its Beirut stronghold, with state media reporting similar blasts in south and east Lebanon.</p>

<p>AFPTV footage showed people running for cover when an explosion went off during a funeral for Hezbollah militants in south Beirut in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Fourteen people were killed and more than 450 wounded in the latest attacks, the health ministry said, also describing the devices targeted as walkie-talkies.</p>

<p>They came a day after the simultaneous explosion of hundreds of paging devices used by Hezbollah killed 12 people, including two children, and wounded up to 2,800 others across Lebanon, in an unprecedented attack blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>There was no comment from Israel, which only hours before Tuesday's attacks had announced it was broadening the aims of its war with Hamas in Gaza to include its fight against the Palestinian group's ally Hezbollah.</p>

<p>"The centre of gravity is moving northward," Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said during a visit to an air base on Wednesday. "We are at the start of a new phase in the war."</p>

<p>Israeli officials have remained tight-lipped about the explosions which led the television news bulletins and dominated newspaper headlines.</p>

<p>Amos Harel of the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper said the pager and walkie-talkie blasts had put "Israel and Hezbollah on the brink of all-out war".</p>

<p>The Iran-backed Hezbollah has traded near-daily cross-border fire with Israeli forces since Palestinian militants attacked Israel on October 7, sparking the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib warned the "blatant assault on Lebanon's sovereignty and security" was a dangerous development that could "signal a wider war".</p>

<p>Hezbollah said Israel was "fully responsible for this criminal aggression" and vowed revenge.</p>

<p>The influx of so many casualties all at once overwhelmed hospitals in Hezbollah strongholds.</p>

<p>At a Beirut hospital, doctor Joelle Khadra said "the injuries were mainly to the eyes and hands, with finger amputations, shrapnel in the eyes -- some people lost their sight."</p>

<p>A doctor at another hospital in the Lebanese capital said he had worked through the night and that the injuries were "out of this world -- never seen anything like it".</p>

<p><strong>- Heavy blow -</strong></p>

<p>Analysts said operatives had likely planted explosives on the paging devices before they were delivered to Hezbollah.</p>

<p>"This was more than lithium batteries being forced into override," said Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute.</p>

<p>"A small plastic explosive was almost certainly concealed alongside the battery, for remote detonation via a call or page," the analyst said, adding Israel's spy agency "Mossad infiltrated the supply chain".</p>

<p>Among the dead was the 10-year-old daughter of a Hezbollah member, killed in east Lebanon's Bekaa Valley when her father's pager exploded, the family and a source close to the group said.</p>

<p>Tehran's ambassador in Beirut, Mojataba Amani, who was wounded, said on social media platform X that it was "a source of pride for me that my blood was mixed with that of the wounded Lebanese" in what he called a "horrific terrorist crime".</p>

<p>The attack dealt a heavy blow to Hezbollah, which already had concerns about the security of its communications after losing several key commanders to targeted air strikes in recent months.</p>

<p>The preliminary findings of a Lebanese investigation into the blasts found the pagers had been booby-trapped, a security official said.</p>

<p>"Data indicates the devices were pre-programmed to detonate and contained explosive materials planted next to the battery," the official said, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.</p>

<p>A source close to Hezbollah, asking not to be identified, said the pagers were "recently imported" and appeared to have been "sabotaged at source".</p>

<p>After The New York Times reported the pagers had been ordered from Taiwanese manufacturer Gold Apollo, the company said they had been produced by its Hungarian partner BAC Consulting KFT.</p>

<p>A government spokesman in Budapest said the company was "a trading intermediary, with no manufacturing or operational site in Hungary".</p>

<p>As fears again surged of a regional conflagration nearly a year into the Gaza war, Lufthansa and Air France announced the suspension of flights to Tel Aviv, Tehran and Beirut until Thursday.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Extremely volatile' -</strong></p>

<p>Since October, the unabating exchanges of fire between Israeli troops and Hezbollah have killed hundreds of mostly fighters in Lebanon, and dozens including soldiers on the Israeli side.</p>

<p>They have also forced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border to flee their homes.</p>

<p>United Nations rights chief Volker Turk said Tuesday's attack had come at an "extremely volatile time", calling the blasts "shocking" and their impact on civilians "unacceptable".</p>

<p>UN chief Antonio Guterres urged governments "not to weaponise civilian objects".</p>

<p>Senior diplomats from the United States, Britain, Germany, France and Italy will meet on Thursday in Paris to discuss the spiralling tensions in the Middle East, sources said, ahead of a UN Security Council meeting planned for Friday.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack that sparked the war resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, on the Israeli side, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures which includes hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Out of 251 hostages seized by militants, 97 are still held in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 41,272 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to data provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The UN has acknowledged these figures as reliable.</p>

<p>In Gaza on Wednesday, the civil defence agency said an Israeli air strike on a school-turned-shelter killed five people, while the Israeli military said it targeted Hamas militants.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, on Wednesday nominated a member of the Sunni Muslim minority to be governor of Kurdistan province, official media reported.</p>

<p>Arash Zerehtan was appointed head of the western state, IRNA news agency said, citing government spokesman Fatemeh Mohajerani.</p>

<p>He is the first Sunni to be made a regional governor in the predominantly Shiite country since the earliest days of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.</p>

<p>Arash Zerehtan, 48, served as a member of parliament for the city of Paveh between 2020 and this year.</p>

<p>Sunnis account for about 10 percent of Iran's population, where the vast majority are Shiites and Shiite Islam is the official state religion.</p>

<p>They have very rarely held key positions of power since the revolution.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian, 69, took office in July after an early election following the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash.</p>

<p>During his election campaign, Pezeshkian criticised the lack of representation for ethnic and religious minorities, in particular Sunni Kurds, in important positions.</p>

<p>In August, he made another member of the Sunni minority, Abdolkarim Hosseinzadeh, one of his vice presidents.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

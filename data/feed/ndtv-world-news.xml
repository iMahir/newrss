       <description><![CDATA[The incident in New York remains the only case recorded where a "possible flight safety issue" was encountered.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A commercial plane had a "near miss" with an unexplained aerial phenomenon, more commonly known as unidentified flying objects or "UFOs", over the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of New York, according to a fresh report released by the Pentagon. After the close brush, the airline crew informed the incident to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) stating that it had a "near miss" with a "cylindrical object" while over the Atlantic Ocean" just off the coast of New York. It remains unclear when the supposed close brush took place, or which airline was involved.</p>

<p>The case in New York remains the only incident recorded where a "possible flight safety issue" was encountered "during the event", the Pentagon report added. The agency that reviews all of the new incidents being reported by military personnel and now additional federal agencies is the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which added that it was continuing its research into the Empire State case.</p>

<p>Notably, between May 2023 and June 2024, AARO received 757 new incident reports, 485 that occurred in that time period and another 272 reports from 2021 and 2022 that had not been previously revealed to the premier agency. A total of 18 incidents were reported near US nuclear infrastructure, weapons, and launch sites as well.</p>

<p>"10 of the reported Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) flew over protected areas for a duration less than five minutes. Two instances involved longer flight times of 53 minutes and 1 hour and 57 minutes respectively. Flight duration is unknown for the remaining six cases," the report noted.</p>

<p>Owing to the rising backlog of cases, a significant number of reports remain unresolved. Currently, AARO is investigating 444 cases.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/more-than-700-ufo-reports-received-but-no-proof-of-alien-activity-7024724" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Also read | Annual UFO Report Finds Over 700 New Cases, But No Proof Of Alien Activity</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>'Cannot explain them'</strong></h3>

<p>The Pentagon stated in the report that it could not explain more than 20 reports of UAP sightings in the past year alone.</p>

<p>"There are interesting cases that with my physics and engineering background and time in the I.C. I do not understand, and I don't know anybody else understands them," said Dr Jon Kosloski, AARO director.</p>

<p>"Orbs, cylinders, triangles, in one of the cases, it has been happening over an extended period of time, and it is possible that there's multiple things happening," Kosloski added, explaining how the UAPs might have looked like.</p>

<p>Despite not being able to explain multiple reports. AARO said it had "discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As the controversy surrounding her explicit videos snowballed, Ms Rahman posted a brief statement before going offline.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan-based TikTok influencer<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pakistani-influencer-imsha-rehman-deactivates-social-media-accounts-after-private-video-leaks-7008463" rel="noindex, nofollow"> Imsha Rehman</a> has deactivated her social media accounts after her private videos were circulated online without her consent. The videos, allegedly showing Ms Rehman in a compromising position, have since gone viral, triggering a social media storm in the conservative country. Rehman has been facing criticism and intense scrutiny from all quarters which prompted her to wipe out her social media footprint, at least temporarily. Rehman has become the latest Pakistani influencer to have had her private videos leaked online.</p>

<p><strong>Who is Imsha Rehman?</strong></p>

<p>Born on October 7, 2002, in Lahore, Ms Rehman is one of the biggest social media influencers in Pakistan -- commanding a legion of followers on Instagram and TikTok. She started her social media journey by sharing fishing and lifestyle content before transitioning to down-to-earth and relatable content on the short video platform, TikTok.</p>

<p>As of the last update, Rehman had over 111,000 followers on Instagram and nearly 200,000 followers on TikTok - the Chinese app owned by ByteDance.</p>

<p><strong>Imsha Rehman responds to controversy</strong></p>

<p>As the controversy surrounding her explicit videos snowballed, Ms Rahman posted a brief statement before going offline. "The backlash has been overwhelming", she wrote. As per Pakistani media reports, the videos were released after hackers managed to gain access to her accounts.</p>

<p>A screenshot shared by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2509113/tiktoker-imsha-rehman-deactivates-social-media-accounts" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>The Express Tribune </em></a>showed Ms Rehman's TikTok page where she had changed the bio to, "Jab tak video viral hai maine ne ID off kar di hai (Till the time video is viral, I have deactivated my account)."</p>

<p><strong>Previous instance</strong></p>

<p>This is not the first instance when a Pakistani social media influencer has had their online privacy breached. Minahil Malik, a popular social media personality and TikTok star had also quit social media after an intimate video of her with her boyfriend leaked online. She claimed the video was "fake" and lodged a complaint with the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).</p>

<p>However, Malik faced intense trolling since social media users accused her of intentionally leaking the video. Pakistani actress Mishi Khan released a video in which she criticised influencers for "stooping to the lowest level" for fame. She did not directly name Malik, but the references were said to be directed towards her.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In a video message, McCall described that the tumour's discovery came as a shock to her.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>English TV presenter Davina McCall, 57, is out of surgery after undergoing an operation to remove a rare brain tumour, according to her partner, Michael Douglas. Ms McCall had previously informed her 1.9 million followers on Instagram in a video message that she had been diagnosed with a type of benign tumour called a colloid cyst. On Friday (Nov 16) evening, Mr Douglas provided the update, stating that Ms McCall was out of surgery after doctors performed what was a 'textbook' surgery.</p>

<p>“Davina is out of surgery and according to the surgeon it was textbook. She's currently recovering in ICU as a precaution, as you can imagine she's utterly exhausted. Thanks so much for all the love from everyone on here.. it's powerful stuff, we are super grateful," read the update by Mr Douglas.</p>

<p>Mr Douglas added that his partner will remain offline for some time as she recovers from the surgery.</p>

<p>"@davinamccall will be "off grid" for a bit while she recovers from this brain operation. She is in great shape and in very good hands," he wrote.</p>

<p>"I'll I do the odd update from her account here for anyone interested. I'm sure she'll read all the comments when she's able to so feel free to send love. The support of people is amazingly powerful. Have a great day everyone."</p>

<p>In the video message, Ms McCall described that the tumour's discovery came as a shock to her. Ms McCall said after she was offered a health scan for a menopause talk she had done earlier, the test results showed the brain tumour.</p>

<p>"I thought I was going to ace it [the test]. But it turned out I had a benign brain tumour called a colloid cyst, which is very rare - three in a million," she said in the video.</p>

<p>Ms McCall described it as "big", 14mm wide, adding: "It needs to come out, because if it grows it would be bad."</p>

<p>"And so I slightly put my head in the sand for a while, and then I saw quite a few neurosurgeons. I got lots of opinions, and I realised that I have to get it taken out."</p>

<p><strong>What is benign brain tumour?</strong></p>

<p>As per doctors, a benign (non-cancerous) brain tumour is a mass of cells that grows relatively slowly in the brain. They are unlikely to spread, but are still serious and can be life-threatening. Such non-cancerous tumours are more common in those above the age of 50.</p>

<p>Symptoms include headache, blackouts, behavioural changes and loss of consciousness.</p>

<p><strong>Who is Davina McCall?</strong></p>

<p>Ms McCall's presenting career includes the reality TV show, Big Brother, Long Lost Family, and My Mum, Your Dad along with Comic and Sport Relief. In 2023, she won the top prize at the British Book Awards for her book on menopause, co-authored with Dr Naomi Potter.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Trump 2.0 cabinet is taking shape ahead of Donald Trump's grand return to the White House two months later. The President-elect, who swept all seven swing states and won a decisive victory against his Democratic rival Kamala Harris, has already appointed one of his biggest supporters, billionaire Elon Musk, to head the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), alongside aide Vivek Ramaswamy. He is now on a spree naming other top aides who will chalk out the government strategy for the next four years.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of an ongoing initiative to repatriate stolen art from countries across South and Southeast Asia, the United States on Wednesday announced that it has returned more than 1,400 looted artefacts worth $10 million to India. According to <em>CNN</em>, the recovered trafficked goods include items that were recently on view at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. Among them is a sandstone sculpture of a celestial dancer that was smuggled from central India to London, before being illegally sold to one of the Met's patrons and donated to the museum.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://manhattanda.org/d-a-bragg-announces-the-return-of-more-than-1400-antiquities-to-the-people-of-india/">press release</a>, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said that the reparations resulted from "several ongoing investigations" into looting networks, including those operated by convicted art traffickers Nancy Wiener and Subhash Kapoor, an antiquities dealer who was sentenced to 10 years in jail for running a multimillion-dollar looting network through his New York gallery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After his arrest in Germany in 2011, Subhash Kapoor was sent to face charges in Tamil Nadu. The US Da's office obtained an arrest warrant for him in 2012, however, he remains in custody in India, pending his extradition to the US.</p>

<p>"Today's repatriation marks another victory in what has been a multiyear international investigation into antiquities trafficked by one of history's most prolific offenders," William Walker, the federal Homeland Security Investigation's New York special agent in charge, said in a press statement, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/15/style/india-us-returns-antiquities-hnk-intl/index.html" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>CNN</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The stolen items were formally returned at a ceremony at the Indian consulate in New York.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, in July, the US and India signed an agreement to protect cultural property by preventing illegal trades and streamlining the process of returning stolen antiquities back to India.</p>

<p>The US returned 297 stolen antiquities to India in September. The antiquities belong to a time period spanning almost 4000 years, from 2000 BCE - 1900 CE and have origins in different parts of India. The majority of the antiquities were terracotta artefacts from Eastern India, while others were made in stone, metal, wood and ivory and belong to different parts of the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In recent times, restitution of cultural property has become an important aspect of India-US cultural understanding and exchange. Since 2016, the US Government has facilitated the return of a large number of trafficked or stolen antiquities. 10 antiquities were returned during PM's visit to USA in June 2016; 157 antiquities during his visit in September 2021 and a further 105 antiquities during his visit in June last year," the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/38328/United+States+of+America+returns+297+antiquities+to+India">Ministry of External Affairs</a> said in a statement in September.</p>

<p>"The total number of cultural artefacts returned from US to India since 2016 stands at 578. This is the maximum number of cultural artefacts returned by any country to India," it added.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump announced Friday that 27-year-old campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt will serve as his White House press secretary.</p>

<p>Leavitt "is smart, tough, and has proven to be a highly effective communicator. I have the utmost confidence she will excel at the podium, and help deliver our message to the American People," Trump said in a statement.</p>

<p>Leavitt is said to be the youngest person to take the key position, acting as the face of the White House and fielding questions from the media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She acted as national press secretary for Trump during his campaign, giving birth in July to her first child ahead of the election, she told a Fox News podcast posted online on Friday.</p>

<p>After working as an assistant press secretary for Trump during his first term in office, she ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the House of Representatives from her home state of New Hampshire in 2022.</p>

<p>She has also worked as a communications director for Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, whom Trump has nominated to be UN ambassador.</p>

<p>"I didn't grow up in a political family. I grew up like most Americans in a middle-class business family here in my home state of New Hampshire," she told the Fox News podcast. "I just dove into politics at my college, Saint Anselm College, in Manchester (New Hampshire)."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scary footage has emerged from a Miami-bound Scandinavian Airlines flight that had to make a U-turn&nbsp;on Thursday (Nov 14) and return to Europe after encountering severe turbulence over Greenland. The video clip going viral on social media shows passengers screaming as the plane violently shakes, ejecting the fliers from their seats. Food and carry-on bags could also be seen lining the aisles before the pilots took the call to return to a base in Copenhagen with 254 passengers and crew members onboard.</p>

<p>"Look at her feet touching the [ceiling]!" one passenger wrote alongside a clip that has gone viral on social media. "Thought we would die."</p>

<p>The flight had taken off from Stockholm around 12:55 pm local time and was due to land in Miami at 5:45 pm when the incident took place. Despite the heavy shakedown, there were no serious injuries among the passengers and crew, according to a Scandinavian Airlines spokesperson.</p>

<p>"Following such turbulence, standard safety procedures require a thorough inspection of the aircraft," the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The passengers were accommodated in a hotel overnight and were booked on other flights by Friday morning, according to a report in <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/15/world-news/terrifying-video-shows-passengers-screaming-in-fear-when-severe-turbulence-kicks-them-from-their-seats-forces-plane-to-u-turn/" rel="noindex, nofollow">NY Post.</a></em></p>

<p>The flight, which typically takes nine hours, was rerouted back to Copenhagen, Denmark where technicians are looking for any potential damages. According to reports, if the flight had continued its journey to Miami, it would have been grounded "for an extended period of time" as the US city does not have space and personnel for inspection of a plane that has suffered such damage. The aviation safety protocols mandate a thorough inspection of any aircraft when it undergoes severe turbulence.</p>

<p>This is not the first instance when a Scandinavian Airline flight has been forced to abandon the flight path and return to home base. In September, a flight bound for Malaga, Spain from Norway has halted when a mouse leaped from a passenger's meal and started roaming around the cabin.</p>

<p>The pilot was forced to land in Copenhagen due to a policy that prohibits rodents on flights because they can chew through electrical wiring.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's White House comeback gives his ally Elon Musk a sizeable advantage in a running standoff with EU tech regulators -- who may now think twice before fining his X platform over disinformation concerns.</p>

<p>The world's richest man -- as the boss of Tesla and SpaceX as well as the former Twitter -- threw his full weight into Trump's campaign to reclaim the US presidency.</p>

<p>Elon Musk backed the Republican with hard cash but also used his far-reaching social media platform to push pro-Trump messages, including inflammatory disinformation, to his more than 200 million followers.</p>

<p>The bet amply paid off, with a victorious Trump tapping Musk for an outsized role to overhaul the US government -- and putting Brussels in an uncomfortable spot.</p>

<p>With the European Union counting on continued US backing to keep an aggressive Russia from its borders, can it really afford to upset Trump by going after a prized ally?</p>

<p>Trump's future vice-president J.D. Vance even mused on the campaign trail that Washington could drop support for NATO if the EU presses on with attempts to regulate Musk's X network under a landmark new content law.</p>

<p>"American power comes with certain strings attached. One of those is respect free speech, especially in our European allies," he warned.</p>

<p>For Musk, hostility to the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA) is about more than just business: along with supporters on the American right he increasingly paints it as an ideological battle against censorship.</p>

<p>"The election in the US will not impact our enforcement work," a spokesman for the European Commission -- the powerful tech enforcer for the 27-nation EU -- told AFP.</p>

<p>But experts are not so sure.</p>

<p><strong>Billions in fines?</strong></p>

<p>Musk's X platform was formally accused by the commission in July of misleading users with its blue checkmarks for certified accounts, of insufficient advertising transparency and failing to give researchers access to the platform's data.</p>

<p>The allegations are part of a wider DSA inquiry into how X tackles the spread of illegal content and information manipulation.</p>

<p>Each offence could theoretically trigger a fine of up to six percent of the annual global turnover of all the companies Musk controls -- reaching into the billions.</p>

<p>According to several sources close to the proceedings, the commission was wrapping up its probe -- and readying a heavy fine -- when its digital chief Thierry Breton quit in September, having been denied a second term by EU chief Ursula von der Leyen.</p>

<p>But the stars have since realigned, with the EU now caught in the headlights for fear the volatile Trump will start a trade war and cut support for Ukraine against the Russian invasion.</p>

<p><strong>'Provoke' Trump?</strong></p>

<p>With Trump at the reins, enforcing EU tech rules against X may become a matter of politics as much as anything else.</p>

<p>"I'd be surprised if the commission chooses to provoke Trump over something like this," said Alexandre de Streel, an expert at the Center on Regulation in Europe (CERRE) think tank.</p>

<p>"Transatlantic relations are going to become more complicated -- and this probably isn't the area where they will need to fight hardest," he said.</p>

<p>"Musk believes the DSA goes too far in how it asks platforms to regulate content -- and that is also the view of far-right parties in Europe," de Streel noted. "It's become a battle of ideas, and I don't see Musk folding -- especially not now."</p>

<p>The European Commission also has to factor in Trump's hard-right allies within the bloc, from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban to Italian leader Giorgia Meloni.</p>

<p>After Trump's re-election, von der Leyen stressed the importance of the EU-US "partnership" and a "strong transatlantic agenda" -- a stance echoed by Breton's designated successor as digital enforcer, Henna Virkkunen.</p>

<p>"With war on its doorstep, Europe must think carefully," said Umberto Gambini, of European affairs consultancy Forward Global. "I don't think it can afford to upset Trump in these first months."</p>

<p>Gambini predicts that the commission's probes into X will keep ticking along but the departure of Breton -- who clashed spectacularly with Musk via social media -- will offer a chance to reset the relationship.</p>

<p>Already back in August, Brussels had distanced itself from a letter of warning sent by the French commissioner before Musk interviewed Trump live on X.</p>

<p>That said, "if Europe wants to remain credible" in the fight to rein in Big Tech, it "has to keep threatening fines in the billions, not millions", Gambini said.</p>

<p>But with fragile transatlantic ties in mind, it may choose to focus its firepower on Chinese platforms such as TikTok instead, judged the EU expert.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a red box factory that stands out among the drab hills of the West Bank, Chat Cola's employees race to quench Palestinians' thirst for local products since the Gaza war erupted last year.</p>

<p>With packaging reminiscent of Coca-Cola's iconic red and white aluminium cans, Chat Cola has tapped into Palestinians' desire to shun brands perceived as too supportive of Israel.</p>

<p>"The demand for (Chat Cola) increased since the war began because of the boycott," owner Fahed Arar, told AFP at the factory in the occupied West Bank town of Salfit.</p>

<p>Julien, a restaurateur in the city of Ramallah further south, said he has stocked his classic red Coca-Cola branded fridge with the local alternative since the war began in October last year.</p>

<p>Supermarket manager Mahmud Sidr described how sales of Palestinian products surged over the past year.</p>

<p>"We noticed an increase in sales of Arab and Palestinian products that do not support (Israel)," he said.</p>

<p>Although it does not supply Israeli troops in Gaza with free goods -- as some US fast food brands have been rumoured to -- Coca-Cola is perceived as simply too American.</p>

<p>The United States provides enormous military assistance to Israel, aid that has continued through the devastating military campaign in Gaza that Israel launched in response to Hamas's unprecedented attack of October 7, 2023.</p>

<p>Coca-Cola did not respond to a request for comment, but it says the company does not support religion nor "any political causes, governments or nation states".</p>

<p>A manager of the National Beverage Company, the Palestinian firm bottling Coca-Cola in the Palestinian territories, told AFP the company had not noticed the return of many products from local stores.</p>

<p>There was however a decline of up to 80 percent in the drink's sales to foreign-named chains, said the manager, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p><strong>Not just cola</strong></p>

<p>"The national boycott movement has had a big impact," Fahed Arar said.</p>

<p>Ibrahim al-Qadi, head of the Palestinian economy ministry's consumer protection department, told AFP that 300 tonnes of Israeli products were destroyed over the past three months after passing their sell-by date for want of buyers.</p>

<p>The Palestinian economy's dependence on Israeli products has made a broader boycott difficult and Chat Cola's popularity partly stems from being one of the few quality Palestinian alternatives.</p>

<p>"There's a willingness to boycott if the Palestinian producers can produce equivalently good quality and price," the head of the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute, Raja Khalidi, told AFP.</p>

<p>Khalidi said the desire for Palestinian substitutes has grown sharply since the war in Gaza began, but is stifled by "an issue of production capacity which we lack".</p>

<p>A boycott campaign has been more successful in neighbouring Arab states less dependent on Israeli goods.</p>

<p>In neighbouring Jordan, the franchisee of French retail giant Carrefour, Dubai-based conglomerate Majid Al Futtaim Group announced it was shutting down all its operations after activists called for a boycott.</p>

<p><strong>'Palestinian taste'</strong></p>

<p>Chat Cola's Arar is proud of developing a quality Palestinian product.</p>

<p>Staff at the company's Salfit factory wear sweaters emblazoned with the words "Palestinian taste" in Arabic and the Palestinian flag.</p>

<p>After opening the factory in 2019, Arar plans to open a new one in Jordan to meet international demand and avoid the complications of operating in the occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>Although the plant still turns out thousands of cans of Chat, one production line has been shut down for more than a month.</p>

<p>Israeli authorities have held up a large shipment of raw materials at the Jordanian border, hitting output, Arar said, adding he can meet only 10 to 15 percent of demand for his product.</p>

<p>As Arar spoke, Israeli air defences intercepted a rocket likely launched from Lebanon, creating a small cloud in view of the plant.</p>

<p>But with war have come opportunities.</p>

<p>"There has never been the political support for buying local that there is now, so it's a good moment for other entrepreneurs to start up," economist Khalidi said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's SpaceX is preparing to launch a tender offer in December to sell existing shares at a price of $135 per share, the Financial Times reported on Friday, citing people with knowledge of the discussions.</p>

<p>The tender offer would value SpaceX at more than $250 billion, according to the report.</p>

<p>SpaceX did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p>

<p>Elon Musk, the world's richest person, is expected to wield significant influence in Washington to secure favorable government treatment for his companies, including SpaceX, after Donald Trump's victory for a second presidency.</p>

<p>Elon Musk's dream of transporting humans to Mars could also become a bigger national priority under Donald Trump, Reuters reported earlier this month.</p>

<p>NASA's Artemis program, which aims to use SpaceX's Starship rocket to put humans on the moon as a proving ground for later Mars missions, is expected to focus more on the Red Planet under Donald Trump and target uncrewed missions there this decade.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly two decades after hanging his gloves, 58-year-old Mike Tyson is set to climb back into the ring on Friday for a Netflix-backed bout. Tyson, who terrorised the heavyweight division during an imperious reign in the late 1980s, will face 27-year-old YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul in an officially sanctioned fight at AT&amp;T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys, in Texas, US.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tyson, who became the youngest heavyweight champion in history at the age of 20 years and four months in 1986, retired in 2005 after losing to Kevin McBride. At the time, he said he didn't have anything left to give the sport. The boxing legend last fought against Roy Jones Jr. in an exhibition match, with no fans during the pandemic in 2020.</p>

<p>Now, by taking on a man not even half his age, the former world heavyweight champion will become one of the oldest boxers to compete in a sanctioned professional fight. The bout, which according to experts is not an exhibition match, is been described by experts as an "indictment on boxing" &nbsp;and a "competitive fight".</p>

<h2>Tyson Back In The Ring</h2>

<p>So, why is Mike Tyson lacing up the gloves once more after 19 years? Simple answer - the money. As per reports, Mike Tyson is being paid USD 20 million just for this one match. Jake Paul is reportedly getting double of that - USD 40 million.</p>

<p>A showdown is also seen as Netflix's latest one-two punch, as the media giant hopes to cash in on sports' sprint to streaming. The streaming powerhouse will broadcast the event live to a global subscriber list of 280 million. Moreover, a crowd of about 70,000 is expected at the stadium to witness Tyson once again in the ring, according to a BBC report.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the streaming giant, Tyson vs. Paul is their biggest live sports event to date and an opportunity to ensure that it can handle audience demand with the NFL and WWE on the horizon.</p>

<h3>Concerns Over Health</h3>

<p>The Netflix-backed bout has also drawn widespread condemnation across the boxing world. Though the rules of the game have been altered, experts have weighed in on how Mike Tyson's age might play a factor in the highly anticipated fight. The bout was initially due to take place in July but was postponed in May after Tyson required medical treatment on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles after vomiting blood due to a bleeding ulcer.</p>

<p>Raising the issue, Stephen Hughes, a senior lecturer of medicine at Anglia Riskin University in England, cited Tyson's age and past alcohol abuse as risk factors. In an article published by "The Conversation", Hughes that a head trauma during a fight could put the boxer at greater risk of suffering a subdural hematoma, which is potentially fatal.</p>

<p>Prominent British fight promoter Eddie Hearn also flagged risk to Tyson's health during the fight and said, "Twenty years ago, Mike Tyson retired from boxing, and was shot to pieces, right? I mean, completely shot."</p>

<p>"If anyone thinks that Mike Tyson should be in a ring at this age, you either have absolutely no emotional feelings toward the man, or you're an idiot. It shouldn't be happening," he added.</p>

<p>Hearn's rival promoter Frank Warren echoed those sentiments and said, "Mike Tyson is 58 years of age and he shouldn't be fighting."</p>

<p>"Anyone with an ounce of brains knows that it is ridiculous. You can be on a motorway stuck in a traffic jam and you get to the end of it and all it is is people who have stopped to look at a crash -- and that's what this is," he added.</p>

<h3>Mike Tyson's Reply</h3>

<p>Mike Tyson, who US reports say is being paid around $20 million for Friday's contest, has brushed off the concerns for his well-being, insisting that critics from the boxing world are motivated by jealousy.</p>

<p>"I'm beautiful, that's all I can say," he said earlier this year. "The people who said that wish they were up here. No-one else can do this."</p>

<p>At an open workout in Texas this week, Tyson declared that a gruelling training camp had left him with the conviction "that I'm tougher than I believed I was."</p>

<p>"When I agreed to this fight and started training, I thought 'What was I thinking of?' But I've finished the process. The fight is the party. All the hard work is done."<br />

       <description><![CDATA[German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Friday urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to engage in peace talks with Ukraine, in the first call between the leaders in almost two years.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Friday urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to engage in peace talks with Ukraine, in the first call between the leaders in almost two years.</p>

<p>In the call, Scholz "condemned Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and called on President Putin to end it and withdraw troops", the chancellor's spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said.</p>

<p>The German leader "urged Russia to show willingness to negotiate with Ukraine with the aim of achieving a just and lasting peace", Hebestreit added in a statement.</p>

<p>Scholz also stressed "Germany's unwavering determination to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression for as long as necessary".</p>

<p>The call comes at a crucial juncture in the war. Ukrainian troops are coming under pressure and the election of Donald Trump in the United States has cast doubt over Washington's continued support for Kyiv.</p>

<p>The Kremlin said Putin had a "detailed and frank exchange of views over the situation in Ukraine" with Scholz, with the call initiated by the German side.</p>

<p>Putin told Scholz that any agreement to end the war in Ukraine "should take into account the security interests of the Russian Federation" the Kremlin added.</p>

<p>An accord should "proceed from the new territorial realities and, most importantly, address the root causes of the conflict".</p>

<p><strong>Ukraine contact</strong></p>

<p>Before picking up the phone to Putin, Scholz spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Scholz's spokesman said.</p>

<p>The German and Ukrainian leaders spoke "beforehand and will do so again after the conversation with the Russian president", the spokesman said.</p>

<p>The call between Scholz and Putin was the first time the two have been in contact since December 2022.</p>

<p>During the hour-long call, Scholz "particularly condemned the Russian air strikes against civilian infrastructure in Ukraine", said a German government source.</p>

<p>"He made it clear that sending North Korean soldiers to Russia for combat missions against Ukraine would lead to a serious escalation and expansion of the conflict," the source added.</p>

<p>Berlin would keep NATO and European Union allies informed over the talks, while the German and Russian leaders had "agreed to remain in contact".</p>

<p>Scholz's December 2022 call with Putin was the last known phone call between the Kremlin chief and the leader of a major Western country.</p>

<p>Putin has spoken to few NATO and Western leaders since 2022, when the EU and the US imposed massive sanctions on Russia for launching its shock Ukraine offensive.</p>

<p>Within the NATO bloc, Putin maintains contact with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban -- who is critical of Western policy on Russia -- and with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.</p>

<p><strong>Trump factor</strong></p>

<p>Ukraine is bracing for the most difficult winter so far in the war, which began in February 2022 when Russia launched its full-scale invasion.</p>

<p>Much of Ukraine's energy infrastructure has been destroyed by Russian bombardments and Kyiv's troops are increasingly on the back foot.</p>

<p>Germany has been one of Ukraine's biggest military supporters, second only to the United States in the aid it has sent to Kyiv.</p>

<p>But the election of Trump, who criticised aid to Ukraine on the campaign trail, has called into question Washington's continued support.</p>

<p>Trump said on the campaign trail that he could end the fighting within hours and has indicated he would talk directly with Putin.</p>

<p>The Kremlin has denied reports that Putin and the president-elect of the United States recently discussed the Ukraine conflict by phone.</p>

<p>Scholz, who did speak with Trump following his election win, told the German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Friday that the incoming US leader had a "more nuanced" position on the conflict than was commonly thought.</p>

<p>Following the Putin-Scholz call, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said he had been updated by the German leader on the discussion.</p>

<p>Tusk was "satisfied" that Scholz had "reiterated the Polish position: 'Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine'," he said on social media platform X.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lawsuit accusing Elon Musk of rigging dogecoin is ending.</p>

<p>Investors in the cryptocurrency who said the world's richest person and his electric car company Tesla committed fraud and insider trading are withdrawing their appeal from an Aug. 29 dismissal of their case.</p>

<p>They are also withdrawing a bid to sanction Musk's lawyers for allegedly interfering with the appeal, including by demanding payment of their hefty legal fees.</p>

<p>Musk and Tesla, meanwhile, withdrew their motion to sanction the investors' lawyer for allegedly pursuing a "frivolous" case with ever-changing legal theories to "extort a quick handout."</p>

<p>A stipulation dismissing the appeal and both sides' motions was filed on Thursday night in federal court in Manhattan. It requires approval by US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein.</p>

<p>Lawyers for the investors and Musk did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Investors accused Musk of using Twitter posts, an appearance on NBC's "Saturday Night Live" and other stunts to trade dogecoin at their expense, including by timing trades to Musk's public statements and activities.</p>

<p>In the Aug. 29 dismissal, Hellerstein said reasonable investors could not prove securities fraud from relying on Musk's tweets, including that dogecoin was the future currency of Earth and could be flown to the moon by his company SpaceX.</p>

<p>The judge also said he did not understand the investors' related market manipulation and insider trading claims.</p>

<p>Investors originally sought $258 billion, and amended their complaint four times in two years.</p>

<p>Musk bought Twitter in 2022 and rebranded it X.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, President-elect Donald Trump picked Musk and biotechnology company founder Vivek Ramaswany to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, whose acronym echoes dogecoin's name.</p>

<p>The case is Gorog et al v. Musk et al, US District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 22-05037.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prince Harry is continuing his lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch's News Group Newspapers (NGN) over alleged unlawful activities by journalists and private investigators despite dozens of others settling their cases, his lawyer said on Friday.</p>

<p>Harry, 40, the younger son of King Charles, is suing the publisher of the Sun and the now-defunct News of the World at the High Court in London, alleging NGN unlawfully obtained private information about him from 1996 until 2011.</p>

<p>The royal's case was one of about 40 lawsuits against NGN, but all but one other litigant - Tom Watson, the former deputy leader of Britain's now-governing Labour Party - have now settled, Harry's lawyer David Sherborne told the court.</p>

<p>Those who have agreed to settle include Spice Girl Melanie Brown, former BBC executive Alan Yentob, "Game of Thrones" actor Alfie Allen and Ted Beckham, the father of former England soccer captain David Beckham.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk expanded his lawsuit against ChatGPT maker OpenAI, adding federal antitrust and other claims and adding OpenAI's largest financial backer Microsoft as a defendant.</p>

<p>Musk's amended lawsuit, filed on Thursday night in federal court in Oakland, California, said Microsoft and OpenAI illegally sought to monopolize the market for generative artificial intelligence and sideline competitors.</p>

<p>Like Musk's original August complaint, it accused OpenAI and its chief executive, Samuel Altman, of violating contract provisions by putting profits ahead of the public good in the push to advance AI.</p>

<p>"Never before has a corporation gone from tax-exempt charity to a $157 billion for-profit, market-paralyzing gorgon - and in just eight years," the complaint said. It seeks to void OpenAI's license with Microsoft and force them to divest "ill-gotten" gains.</p>

<p>OpenAI in a statement said the latest lawsuit "is even more baseless and overreaching than the previous ones." Microsoft declined to comment.</p>

<p>"Microsoft's anticompetitive practices have escalated," Musk's attorney Marc Toberoff said in a statement. "Sunlight is the best disinfectant."</p>

<p>Musk has a long-simmering opposition to OpenAI, a startup he co-founded and that has since become the face of generative AI through billions of dollars in funding from Microsoft.</p>

<p>Musk has gained new prominence as a key force in U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration. Trump named Musk to a new role designed to cut government waste, after he donated millions of dollars to Trump's Republican campaign.</p>

<p>The expanded lawsuit said OpenAI and Microsoft violated antitrust law by conditioning investment opportunities on agreements not to deal with the companies' rivals. It said the companies' exclusive licensing agreement amounted to a merger lacking regulatory approvals.</p>

<p>In a court filing last month, OpenAI accused Musk of pursuing the lawsuit as part of an "increasingly blusterous campaign to harass OpenAI for his own competitive advantage."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A video, purportedly shot by an alleged pro-Khalistan supporter, has gone viral on social media in which a person can be heard calling Canadians "invaders" and asking them to "go back to England and Europe".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After targeting India, Khalistan extremists and separatists in Canada have found a new enemy - White Canadians. A video, reportedly shot by an alleged Khalistan sympathiser, has gone viral on social media in which an extremist can be heard calling Canadians "invaders" and asking them to “go back to England and Europe”.</p>

<p>The two-minute clip was reportedly shot during a <em>'Nagar Kirtan'</em> procession in the Surrey area of Canada's British Columbia. It shows several people slowly marching in one direction as songs are played in the background. Several men can also be seen waving so-called Khalistan flags in the video.</p>

<p>The man filming the procession can be heard asking for "likes and shares" while shouting inflammatory slogans. He is heard saying, “White people are invaders” and “We are owners of Canada”. He then goes on to ask white Canadians to “go back to England and Europe."</p>

<p>“This is Canada, our own country. You [Canadians] go back," he said further.</p>

<p>The video of the procession was posted on X (formally Twitter) by a user by the name of Daniel Bordman, who wrote: “Khalistanis march around Surrey BC and claim “we are the owners of Canada” and “white people should go back to Europe and Israel. How are we allowing these r*tards to shape our foreign policy?”</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Khalistanis march around Surrey BC and claim “we are the owners of Canada” and “white people should go back to Europe and Israel”.<br />
How are we allowing these r*tards to shape our foreign policy? <a href="https://t.co/9VmEnrVlGP">pic.twitter.com/9VmEnrVlGP</a></p>
— Daniel Bordman (@DanielBordmanOG) <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielBordmanOG/status/1856837451697844720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The video surfaced amid heightened tensions between India and Canada. The ties between the two countries have come under severe strain following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of a “potential involvement" of Indian agents in the killing of Khalistan terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who held a Canadian passport.</p>

<p>New Delhi rejected Trudeau's charges as “absurd”. India has maintained that the main issue between the two countries is that of Canada giving space to pro-Khalistan elements operating from Canadian soil with impunity.</p>

<p>The row has escalated to a point where both countries have expelled each other's top diplomats.</p>

<p>In recent times, there has also been an increase in incidents of violence against Hindu devotees in Canada.&nbsp;On November 3, extremists carrying so-called 'Khalistani' flags clashed with devotees at a Hindu Sabha temple and disrupted an event co-organised by the temple authorities and the Indian Consulate at Brampton, a city in Ontario's Greater Toronto Area.</p>

<p>India condemned the attack with an expectation that those indulging in violence "will be prosecuted".<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday promised a "strong military", as he repeated his pledge to end the war between Russia and Ukraine.</p>

<p>Trump, who campaigned on an "America First" foreign policy, has said previously that he wanted to strike a deal between Kyiv and Moscow, without giving details, and end bloodshed in the Middle East.</p>

<p>"We have to get back to a great country with low taxes and a strong military. We're going to fix our military, we did once and now we're going to have to do it again," he said Thursday at a gala organized by the America First Policy Institute at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.</p>

<p>"We're going to work on the Middle East and we're going to work very hard on Russia and Ukraine. It's got to stop," Trump added.</p>

<p>He also criticized the "big chunk" of US spending on Afghanistan, from where American troops withdrew in 2021 after two decades of fighting an insurgency by the Taliban, which returned to power that year.</p>

<p>Trump's re-election has the potential to upend the almost three-year conflict between Russia and Ukraine, throwing into question Washington's multibillion-dollar support for Kyiv, which is crucial to its defense.</p>

<p>The Republican said on the campaign trail that he could end the fighting within hours and has indicated he would talk directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>Trump has not said how he intends to strike a peace deal on Ukraine or what terms he would propose.</p>

<p>Trump has nominated Fox News host and National Guard veteran Pete Hegseth to lead the world's most powerful military as defense secretary, despite a slim CV.</p>

<p>If confirmed by the Senate, Hegseth would command around 3.4 million soldiers and civilians, and oversee an annual budget of about $850 billion.</p>

<p>The president-elect has entrusted Elon Musk, the world's richest man, with the task of proposing cuts of $2 trillion from the federal government's $7 trillion budget.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A senior Hamas official on Friday said the group is "ready for a ceasefire" in Gaza, urging US President-elect Donald Trump to "pressure" Israel as it continued to pound the Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>It comes nearly a week after Qatar, which hosts much of the Palestinian group's political bureau, announced it was suspending its role as a mediator in the war and urging all parties to show "seriousness".</p>

<p>"Hamas is ready to reach a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip if a ceasefire proposal is presented and on the condition that it is respected" by Israel, Doha-based Hamas political bureau member Bassem Naim told AFP.</p>

<p>"We call on the US administration and Trump to pressure the Israeli government to end the aggression."</p>

<p>On Saturday, Qatar announced it was suspending its role as a mediator in indirect talks towards a ceasefire and hostage release deal in the Gaza war that has ground on for more than a year.</p>

<p>"Qatar would resume those efforts... when the parties show their willingness and seriousness," Doha's foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al Ansari said in a statement.</p>

<p>Friday's announcement by Hamas came as Israel continued to strike Gaza, with residents of the central city of Deir el-Balah searching through the rubble of their destroyed homes after overnight strikes.</p>

<p>"I woke up to the bombing at 2:30 am and was surprised by the rubble and glass falling on me and my children," said Mohamed Baraka, one of the residents, adding that the strike "resulted in three martyrs and 15 injuries".</p>

<p>"Put an end to this war... because there are innocent people who are losing defenceless children who have nothing to do with this," he said.</p>

<p><strong>Hostage video</strong></p>

<p>The war erupted with Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel which resulted in 1,206 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed 43,764 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable.</p>

<p>Militants also kidnapped 251 hostages during the attack, 97 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 34 whom the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Earlier Friday, the Hamas-allied militant group Islamic Jihad released a new clip of Israeli hostage Sasha Trupanov, after issuing a first video earlier this week.</p>

<p>Trupanov, 29, is a dual Russian-Israeli citizen who was abducted with his girlfriend, Sapir Cohen, from the Nir Oz kibbutz near the Gaza border.</p>

<p>Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called for the release of Trupanov and another hostage, Maxim Herkin, in comments made before the release of the latest clip.</p>

<p>Fears surged over the fate of the hostages after Qatar announced its withdrawal from mediating talks -- the latest blow in a protracted negotiation process that has hit repeated impasses.</p>

<p><strong>Lebanon strikes</strong></p>

<p>Israel on Friday also continued to strike Lebanon, where it intensified in September its air offensive and later sent in ground troops following a year of low-intensity cross-border exchanges with the Iran-backed Hezbollah group.</p>

<p>A building in Beirut's southern suburbs collapsed in a gigantic cloud of smoke and dust, an AFP photographer reported, as two strikes attributed to Israel hit the Hezbollah bastion.</p>

<p>A series of images from the strike captures a falling projectile slamming into the lower floors of the building, which erupt in a huge fireball, causing the structure to collapse.</p>

<p>Lebanon's state-run National News Agency (NNA) reported a "heavy raid carried out by aircraft of the Israeli enemy" in the Ghobeiri area of southern Beirut.</p>

<p>It said the raid had been preceded by two missile strikes on the same target by an Israeli drone.</p>

<p>The strikes followed a call by the Israeli military to evacuate the area. The evacuation call posted on X by Israeli army spokesman Avichay Adraee told residents to leave, warning of imminent strikes.</p>

<p>"All residents in the southern suburbs, specifically ... in the Ghobeiri area, you are located near facilities and interests affiliated with Hezbollah," Adraee said in an Arabic-language post on X.</p>

<p>"For your safety and the safety of your family members, you must evacuate these buildings and those adjacent to them immediately."</p>

<p>Later in the morning, a second strike hit the Bourj al-Barajneh area of the southern suburbs, an AFP journalist reported.</p>

<p>NNA said two missiles had been fired by an "enemy aircraft".</p>

<p>Lebanese authorities say more than 3,380 people have been killed since October last year, when Hezbollah and Israel began trading fire.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Sylvester Stallone praised President-elect Donald Trump as the "second George Washington" during a speech at the America First Policy Institute Gala at Mar-a-Lago.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Legendary Hollywood star Sylvester Stallone has praised US President-elect Donald Trump, likening him to America's founding father, George Washington, and his own iconic film character, Rocky Balboa. The 78-year-old actor and filmmaker made these statements last night when he was giving a glowing introduction of President-elect Donald Trump at the America First Policy Institute Gala held at the Mar-A-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida.</p>

<p>Stallone called Trump the "second George Washington," emphasising his historic role following a decisive electoral win, as captured in a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/cspan/status/1857244641206177952">C-SPAN video </a>posted to X (formerly known as Twitter).</p>

<p>"We're in the presence of a really mythical character," he said during his speech. "I love mythology. And this individual does not exist on this planet. Nobody in the world could have pulled off what he pulled off, so I'm in awe." Stallone continued, touting Trump as the "second George Washington."</p>

<p>"When George Washington defended his country, he had no idea that he was going to change the world. Because without him, you could imagine what the world would look like. Guess what? We got the second George Washington."</p>

<p>Trump's landslide victory over Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris marked a significant shift in US politics. He became the first Republican since George W. Bush to secure both the presidency and the popular vote.</p>

<p>During his speech, Stallone also drew parallels between Trump and Rocky Balboa, the underdog boxer he famously portrayed in the 1976 classic. The actor's comments were met with enthusiastic applause from the audience, underscoring his strong support for the president-elect.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Suzanne Karkaba and her father Ali were both civil defence rescuers whose job was to save the injured and recover the dead in Lebanon's war.</p>

<p>When an Israeli strike killed him on Thursday and it was his turn to be rescued, there wasn't much left. She had to identify him by his fingers.</p>

<p>Karkaba then rushed back to the bombed civil defence centre to search for her fellow first responders under the rubble.</p>

<p>Israel struck the centre, the main civil defence facility in the eastern Baalbek area, while nearly 20 rescuers were still inside, said Samir Chakia, a local official with the agency.</p>

<p>At least 14 civil defence workers were killed, he said.</p>

<p>"My dad was sleeping here with them. He helped people and recovered bodies to return them to their families... But now it's my turn to pick up the pieces of my dad," Karkaba told AFP with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>Unlike many first-responder facilities previously targeted during the war, this facility in Douris, on the edge of Baalbek city, was state-run and had no political affiliation.</p>

<p>Israel's military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Friday morning, dozens of rescuers and residents were still rummaging through the wreckage of the centre. Two excavators pulled broken slabs of concrete, twisted metal bars and red tiles.</p>

<p>Wearing her civil defence uniform at the scene, Karkaba said she had been working around-the-clock since Israel ramped up its air raids on Lebanon's east in late September.</p>

<p>"I don't know who to grieve anymore, the (centre's) chief, my father, or my friends of 10 years," Karkaba said, her braided hair flowing in the wind.</p>

<p>"I don't have the heart to leave the centre, to leave the smell of my father... I've lost a part of my soul."</p>

<p><strong>'Now we are targets'</strong></p>

<p>Beginning on September 23, Israel escalated its air raids mainly on Hezbollah strongholds in east and south Lebanon, as well as south Beirut after nearly a year of cross-border exchanges of fire.</p>

<p>A week later Israel sent in ground troops to southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>More than 150 rescuers, most of them affiliated with Hezbollah and its allies, have been killed in more than a year of clashes, according to health ministry figures from late October.</p>

<p>Friday morning, rescuers in Douris were still pulling body parts from the rubble, strewn with dozens of paper documents, while Lebanese army troops stood guard near the site.</p>

<p>Civil defence worker Mahmoud Issa was among those searching for friends in the rubble.</p>

<p>"Does it get worse than this kind of strike against rescue teams and medics? We are among the first to... save people. But now, we are targets," he said.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Lebanon's health ministry said more than 40 people had been killed in Israeli strikes on the country's south and east.</p>

<p>The ministry reported two deadly Israeli raids on emergency facilities in less than two hours that day: the one near Baalbek, and another on the south that killed four Hezbollah-affiliated paramedics.</p>

<p>The ministry urged the international community to "put an end to these dangerous violations".</p>

<p>More than 3,400 people have been killed in Lebanon since the clashes began last year, according to the ministry, the majority of them since late September.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

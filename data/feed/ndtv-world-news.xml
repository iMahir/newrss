       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China warned on Tuesday that "no one will win a trade war" after US President-elect Donald Trump vowed to impose sweeping tariffs on goods from China and elsewhere in response to illegal drug trade and immigration.</p>

<p>"China believes that China-US economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial in nature," Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for China's embassy in the United States, said in an email to AFP.</p>

<p>In a series of posts to his Truth Social account, Trump on Monday vowed to hit some of the United States' largest trading partners with duties on all goods entering the country.</p>

<p>He said he would also be slapping China with a 10 percent tariff, "above any additional Tariffs," in response to what he said was its failure to tackle fentanyl smuggling.</p>

<p>Asked on Tuesday whether Beijing had reached out to Trump's team for talks, foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said: "As a principle, we are open to maintaining dialogue and communication."</p>

<p>Tariffs are a key part of Trump's economic agenda, with the Republican vowing wide-ranging duties on allies and adversaries alike while he was on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>Washington has long accused Beijing of complicity in the deadly fentanyl trade that has ravaged communities across the country.</p>

<p>The embassy in Washington's Liu rebuffed those claims in his statement, detailing steps that Beijing was taking to help curb the trade.</p>

<p>"All these prove that the idea of China knowingly allowing fentanyl precursors to flow into the United States runs completely counter to facts and reality," he said.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[A new study by scientists from the Universities of Geneva and Toulouse has found a small inconsistency in Einstein's general relativity predictions.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Albert Einstein's general relativity theory has been a pillar of contemporary physics for more than a century. But according to a recent study, there is a little discrepancy between Einstein's predictions and how the Universe has behaved during various cosmic eras.</p>

<p>In order to better understand the Universe's accelerated expansion, which was found 25 years ago, researchers from the University of Geneva and Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier examined data from the Dark Energy Survey. When applied on a global scale, the analysis revealed variances that cast doubt on Einstein's equations, especially for extrasolar occurrences.</p>

<p>These results, titled<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-53363-6"><em> "Measurement of the Weyl potential evolution from the first three years of dark energy survey data,"</em></a> which were published in <em>Nature Communications,</em> lead to fresh debates on the validity of general relativity and the forces influencing the universe. The results point to gaps in our knowledge of space-time and dark energy, but they do not refute Einstein's theories.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.unige.ch/medias/en/2024/les-equations-deinstein-se-heurtent-aux-mysteres-de-lunivers"><em>Albert Einstein's theory, </em></a>the Universe is deformed by matter, like a large, flexible sheet. These deformations, caused by the gravity of celestial bodies, are called ''gravitational wells''. When light passes through this irregular framework, its trajectory is bent by these wells, similar to the effect of a glass lens. However, in this case, it is gravity, not glass, that bends the light. This phenomenon is known as ''gravitational lensing''.</p>

<p>Observing it provides insights into the components, history, and expansion of the Universe. Its first measurement, taken during a solar eclipse in 1919, confirmed Einstein's theory, which predicted a light deflection twice as large as that predicted by Isaac Newton. This difference arises from Einstein's introduction of a key new element: the deformation of time, in addition to the deformation of space, to achieve the exact curvature of light.</p>

<p>"Until now, Dark Energy Survey data have been used to measure the distribution of matter in the Universe. In our study, we used this data to directly measure the distortion of time and space, enabling us to compare our findings with Einstein's predictions," says Camille Bonvin, associate professor in the Department of Theoretical Physics at the UNIGE Faculty of Science, who led the research.</p>

<p>"We discovered that in the distant past - 6 and 7 billion years ago - the depth of the wells aligns well with Einstein's predictions. However, closer to today, 3.5 and 5 billion years ago, they are slightly shallower than predicted by Einstein," reveals Isaac Tutusaus, assistant astronomer at the Institute of Research in Astrophysics and Planetology (IRAP/OMP) at Universite; Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier and the study's lead author.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the holiday season fast approaching, two flight attendants have shared their expert tips to help you survive the travel chaos. Hunter Smith-Lihas from Florida - a flight attendant on a major US airline - and Liz Simmons - an Australian flight attendant turned psychologist - know firsthand how hectic air travel can be during this time of year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From managing stress to staying comfortable on long flights, here are some valuable tips to help passengers as shared with <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/flight-attendants-secrets-surviving-holiday-travel/index.html " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">CNN</a>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Give Yourself Extra Time</strong><br />
Don't book flights last minute. Try to give yourself at least one buffer day between travel and the event you're attending. If your flight gets cancelled, you will have time to rebook.<br />
<br />
<strong>Choose Longer Layovers</strong><br />
Avoid tight connections. It is better to have a longer layover (around 90 minutes) to reduce the risk of missing your next flight.<br />
<br />
<strong>Book Flights Midweek</strong><br />
If you can, try flying on weekdays to avoid weekend crowds and possibly find cheaper flights.<br />
<br />
<strong>Check Your Passport</strong><br />
Make sure your passport is valid for at least six months beyond your travel dates, especially for international trips.<br />
<br />
<strong>Fly Early</strong><br />
Booking the first flight of the day helps avoid delays that can happen later. You'll also have time to rebook if something goes wrong.<br />
<br />
<strong>Plan Flights Around Kids' Nap Times</strong><br />
If you're flying with kids, choose flights during their nap times to keep them calm and avoid meltdowns.<br />
<br />
<strong>Ask for an Upgrade</strong><br />
It doesn't hurt to ask the gate agent about upgrades, especially if you have loyalty points. But don't expect it to always work, especially during the busy holiday season.<br />
<br />
<strong>Wipe Down Surfaces</strong><br />
While aeroplane air filters are designed to combat germs, flight attendants recommend wiping down your seat and tray table for extra safety. Some airlines even provide sanitising wipes, so make use of them.<br />
<br />
<strong>Make Your Seat Your Own</strong><br />
Bring your own travel essentials like a blanket, eye mask, pillow, and headphones. Download movies or books to keep yourself entertained. Having snacks on hand is also a good idea since delays can affect meal timing.<br />
<br />
<strong>Never Encroach Into Someone Else's Seat</strong><br />
While it's okay to make your seat more comfortable, be mindful of your neighbours. Avoid spreading out into someone else's space or using bright, light-up travel mirrors. Respect others' need for rest, especially on long flights.<br />
<br />
<strong>Be Considerate of Fellow Passengers</strong><br />
Holiday travel can bring increased stress and anxiety. If you find yourself frustrated, take a deep breath and remember that everyone is trying to get home. Small gestures of kindness, like offering a smile or patience, can make a big difference.<br />
<br />
<strong>Create Your Own ‘Bubble of Peace'</strong><br />
Don't let other passengers' negativity impact your holiday mood. Focus on your own comfort and well-being during the flight, and keep your holiday spirit intact.<br />
<br />
<strong>Show Appreciation to Flight Attendants</strong><br />
Flight attendants work hard, especially during the busy holiday season. Small acts of kindness, like a smile or a small gift, can help lift their spirits. Flight attendants appreciate gestures, though they may not accept cash. A simple thank you can go a long way.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A former officer in Russia's nuclear forces is among the rare few to speak out about his experiences at one of the country's most secretive military bases.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former officer in Russia's nuclear forces is among the rare few to speak out about his experiences at one of the country's most secretive military bases. His testimony to the BBC is about the chilling readiness of Russia's nuclear arsenal at the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022.<br />
<br />
On that fateful day, Mr Anton was stationed at a nuclear weapons base where his unit was put on full combat alert. “Before that, we had only exercises. But on the day the war started, the weapons were fully in place,” he recalls. “We were ready to launch the forces into the sea and air and, in theory, carry out a nuclear strike.” Russia prepared for the worst.<br />
<br />
Mr Anton served as an officer at a highly secretive nuclear weapons facility, an environment with limited insight into its operations. Documents provided to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dl2pv0yj0o " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">BBC</a> confirmed his rank, unit, and base. Three days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin announced that the country's nuclear forces were placed on high alert. Mr Anton confirmed that the alert was in place from day one, and he and his colleagues were confined to the base, with access only to Russian state TV. They were not involved in combat but were tasked with guarding the nuclear weapons. The heightened alert status lasted two to three weeks before it was finally lifted.<br />
<br />
Mr Anton gave a rare glimpse into the inner workings of Russia's nuclear forces. All personnel are professional soldiers, with no conscripts, and undergo regular checks and lie-detector tests. The pay is significantly higher, and the troops are not sent to war. Instead, their role is to either defend or execute a nuclear strike.<br />
<br />
Life on the nuclear base was strictly controlled, with no personal phones allowed and visitors requiring approval from the FSB months in advance. Mr Anton worked in the security unit, part of a rapid-response force with a two-minute reaction time.<br />
<br />
Things took a turn when he was given an order he couldn't follow. He was told to teach his troops that Ukrainian civilians should be treated as combatants and destroyed. Anton refused, calling it a war crime and rejecting the “propaganda.”<br />
<br />
His refusal led to severe consequences. He was reprimanded by senior officers and transferred to a regular assault brigade, units often sent into battle as the “first wave.” Mr Anton, in an act of defiance, signed a statement refusing to participate in the war, resulting in a criminal case opened against him. “I showed them documents confirming my transfer to the assault brigade and details of the criminal case,” Mr Anton explained.<br />
<br />
Before being sent to the front lines, Mr Anton decided to flee Russia with the help of a volunteer organisation that helps deserters. He explained if he had tried to escape from the nuclear forces base, the FSB Security Service would have responded swiftly, making it nearly impossible for him to leave the country. However, since he had been transferred to a regular assault brigade, the high-level security clearance was no longer in effect, allowing him to escape.<br />
<br />
After escaping, Mr Anton joined the volunteer group “Idite Lesom” (meaning “Go by the Forest” or “Get Lost”), which helps deserters evade the Russian authorities. The group reports that the number of deserters seeking help has risen to 350 a month, with the risks for those fleeing escalating. Mr Anton is acutely aware of the dangers he faces, both in his past role and in his current actions. “I understand the more I do that, the higher the chances they could try and kill me.”<br />
<br />
He said that he no longer speaks to his former colleagues at the nuclear base to protect them from the repercussions of their contact with him. “They must take lie-detector tests, and any contact with me could lead to a criminal case.”<br />
<br />
Although he has left Russia, Mr Anton remains under threat. The Russian security services continue to look for him, and he now lives in hiding, taking extreme precautions to avoid detection. “I work off the books and I don't show up in any official systems,” he reveals.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Emily Calandrelli, an MIT-trained engineer and future Blue Origin astronaut, recently made history after she became the 100th woman to venture into space.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Emily Calandrelli, an MIT-trained engineer and future Blue Origin astronaut, recently made history after she became the 100th woman to venture into space. Her journey aboard Blue Origin's latest human spaceflight has solidified her position as a trailblazer in the space industry.</p>

<h2><strong>Passion For Space</strong></h2>

<p>Emily Calandrelli's fascination with space and science began at a young age. With a bachelor's degree in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from West Virginia University (WVU), she quickly made her mark in the world of aerospace. Her educational journey continued at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where she completed her Master's in Aeronautics and Astronautics, along with Technology and Policy.</p>

<p>Ms Calandrelli's <a href="http://https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilycalandrelli/details/experience/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a> describes her as an “MIT engineer turned Emmy-nominated science TV host, #1 New York Times bestselling author, Blue Origin astronaut, and TEDx speaker (x3).”</p>

<h2><strong>Engineer To TV Host</strong></h2>

<p>In addition to her technical expertise, Ms Calandrelli is a science communicator, known for making complex topics accessible to the public. She is the host and co-executive producer of Emily's Wonder Lab on Netflix, where she is known as ‘Space Gal.' Her work on the show, which encourages young minds to explore science through fun experiments, is just one example of her dedication to science education.</p>

<p>She has also featured as a correspondent on Netflix's Bill Nye Saves the World and serves as the executive producer and host of Xploration Outer Space, a FOX educational show on space exploration. She is also a regular contributor to TechCrunch, where she writes about developments in the space industry.</p>

<p>Ms Calandrelli's passion for science and technology is further reflected in her book series, <em>Ada Lace Adventures,</em> for kids aged 6-10. She has also authored a picture book,<em> Reach For The Stars,</em> in addition to the NYT bestseller, <em>Stay Curious And Keep Exploring.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Empowering Women In STEM</strong></h2>

<p>Emily Calandrelli is devoted to encouraging young girls and women of colour to pursue careers in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math). She believes that many young students, especially women and minorities, are unaware of the incredible opportunities available to them in STEM fields. Ms Calandrelli aims to change this through her work, hoping to make STEM more inclusive and accessible to everyone.</p>

<h2><strong>Overcoming Online Harassment</strong></h2>

<p>Ms Calandrelli has been the target of online harassment after her spaceflight. When she expressed her awe and excitement after crossing the Karman line - the boundary between Earth's atmosphere and space - her reaction was met with criticism from online trolls who sexualised her response. In a video shared by Blue Origin, Emily's emotional remarks were overshadowed by disparaging comments, prompting the company to remove the original video from social media and post an edited version.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Ms Calandrelli refused to let the negativity affect her. On social media, she shared a powerful message, saying, “I refuse to give much time to the small men on the internet. I feel experiences in my soul.” She added, “I will not apologize or feel weird about my reaction. It's wholly mine and I love it. When I can, I'll reshare it myself with all of you.”</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As sovereign debt investors concerned about climate change scrutinize national responses to rising global temperatures, they're increasingly finding that wealthier nations aren't doing their part to help address global warming.</p>

<p>Not one country is on track for a 1.5C future based on 2030 national pledges for cutting emissions, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ascorproject.org/#:~:text=ASCOR%20(Assessing%20Sovereign%20Climate%2Drelated,financial%20institutions%2C%20and%20relevant%20stakeholders." rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">the Assessing Sovereign Climate-related Opportunities and Risks Project</a>. What's more, the review of 70 countries' emissions and policies shows “no overwhelming trend” that wealthier countries are doing a better job of tackling climate change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Investors need to see more credible action by governments, said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/victoriabarron1/?originalSubdomain=uk" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">Victoria Barron</a>, chief sustainability officer at GIB Asset Management and ASCOR co-chair, in a statement. “Investors play a pivotal role in driving capital” and “these flows require robust and tangible national climate and energy policies,” she said.</p>

<p>Investors largely agree that climate risks aren't fully priced into markets, and academics are now studying what they're calling the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343524000010#bib10" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">climate-sovereign debt doom loop</a>&nbsp;to calculate the potential costs to countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ASCOR's findings come at a time when countries also increasingly find themselves the subject of legal threats for allegedly failing to protect their citizens from raging fires and floods. The&nbsp;<a href="https://webtv.un.org/en/asset/k1c/k1ce3oitwq#:~:text=The%20International%20Court%20of%20Justice%20(ICJ)%2C%20the%20principal%20judicial,the%20seat%20of%20the%20Court." rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">International Court of Justice</a>&nbsp;will hold&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/sites/default/files/case-related/187/187-20241108-pre-01-00-en.pdf" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">hearings</a>&nbsp;next month as it weighs in on the debate.</p>

<p>And prospects aren't improving in the US, the world's biggest economy, where President-elect Donald Trump is expected to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. He also nominated a fracking-company executive to head the Energy Department.</p>

<p>In Europe,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-09/esg-rules-draw-backlash-from-unilever-totalenergies-and-other-eu-businesses" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">corporate pushback</a>&nbsp;is testing policymakers' commitment to sustainability initiatives, already under attack because of what's seen as high administrative costs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ASCOR was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unpri.org/news-and-events/the-ascor-project-assessing-sovereign-climate-related-opportunities-and-risks/7681.article" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">created</a>&nbsp;three years ago to help investors measure, monitor and compare how countries are responding to climate change. Costa Rica and Angola stand out for being close to hitting their 1.5C benchmarks, the report said. Meanwhile, less than 20% of countries have committed to halt the approvals of new coal, oil and gas production and more than 80% don't have transparent and credible commitments to phase out fossil-fuel subsidies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Financing too is lagging behind. The report's authors concluded that more than 80% of wealthy countries aren't contributing their proportional share of an annual $100 billion international climate finance goal, which was increased to $300 billion at the COP29 climate summit in Baku.</p>

<p>Demand for more and consistent information led ASCOR to expand the project's scope beyond an initial 25 countries to the 70 countries. On the plus side, 40 countries now have in place legal frameworks for addressing climate change and three-fourths have plans for managing physical risks, the researchers said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The parachute was found on the property of a family connected to a prime suspect in the case, Richard Floyd McCoy II.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The decades-old mystery of DB Cooper, the elusive hijacker who vanished into the night with a ransom of $200,000, has taken a significant turn. The FBI has reopened its investigation after a parachute, potentially linked to the infamous crime, was discovered.</p>

<p>The parachute was found on the property of a family connected to a prime suspect in the case, Richard Floyd McCoy II. McCoy was arrested for a similar hijacking shortly after Cooper's daring escape, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newsweek.com/db-cooper-update-why-fbi-reopened-case-1991589" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>Newsweek </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>YouTube investigator Dan Gryder, who has been delving into the Cooper case for over two decades, played a crucial role in this development. He uncovered the parachute on the McCoy family property in North Carolina and shared his findings in a series of videos.</p>

<p>The FBI's renewed interest in the case is fueled by the potential significance of the discovered parachute. It could provide crucial evidence to shed light on one of aviation history's most enduring mysteries.</p>

<h3><strong>What Happened to DB Cooper?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>On November 21, 1971, a man known as D.B. Cooper purchased a one-way ticket to Seattle. During the Boeing 727 flight, he handed flight attendant Florence Schaffner a note claiming he had a bomb in his briefcase.</p>

<p>Schaffner, after inspecting what appeared to be a makeshift bomb- though its authenticity remains uncertain-alerted the plane's captain, William A. Scott. The typed note contained a demand for $200,000 in $20 bills and four parachutes.</p>

<p>Cooper communicated briefly with the flight crew through the plane's internal phone but stopped after a while. When the plane landed, he was gone. Authorities believe Cooper jumped from the rear of the aircraft mid-flight, parachuting away with the cash.</p>

<p>In the 1970s, airport security was far less stringent than today, and investigators were unable to determine the exact moment he exited the plane, making it difficult to identify his landing area.</p>

<p>To this day, D.B. Cooper remains officially unidentified and at large. The FBI launched an extensive investigation, interviewing over 800 suspects by 1976, but the case remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in aviation history.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google has filed a lawsuit against a former employee accusing him of stealing confidential company information related to its chip designs and leaking it online. <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/egpbjjxmzpq/GOOGLE%20TRADE%20SECRET%20LAWSUIT%20complaint.pdf " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">The lawsuit</a>, filed in a Texas federal court on Tuesday, claims that Harshit Roy, who worked at Google from 2020 to 2024 as an engineer, shared sensitive documents about Google Pixel devices on social media platforms X and LinkedIn.</p>

<p>Mr Roy took photographs of internal Google documents, including specifications for Pixel processing chips, before resigning from his position in February 2024, the complaint said. He reportedly moved from Bangalore to Austin, Texas, later that year to pursue a doctorate programme at the University of Texas.</p>

<p>The tech giant alleges that Mr Roy posted these confidential materials, along with "subversive text" that defied the terms of his confidentiality agreement. The posts, including images of trade secrets, were accompanied by provocative statements such as, "Don't expect me to adhere to any confidentiality agreement," and "I need to take unethical means to get what I am entitled to" and "remember that empires fall and so will you."</p>

<p>Google claims that Mr Roy ignored multiple takedown requests and continued to share its trade secrets on social media, even tagging competitors like Apple and Qualcomm. Several media outlets have reportedly published articles using the leaked information.</p>

<p>"We found that this former employee stole numerous documents, and we're pursuing legal action against them for the repeated and unauthorised disclosure of confidential company information," Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda told Reuters. "This behaviour is something we will simply not tolerate."</p>

<p>The company has asked the court for monetary damages and an order to prevent Mr Roy from using or disclosing its proprietary information. On Wednesday, a judge granted Google a temporary restraining order, barring Mr Roy from further sharing confidential details, as per <a href="https://www.chron.com/business/technology/article/google-lawsuit-pixel-secrets-leak-19937274.php" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">reports</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India on Tuesday condemned the arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, a Hindu priest and a religious minority leader in Bangladesh. In a statement, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) also urged the Bangladeshi authorities to ensure the safety and security of Hindus and all other minorities. Chandan Kumar Dhar, also known as Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, a prominent former leader of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) in Bangladesh,&nbsp;was arrested at a Dhaka airport&nbsp;on Monday afternoon. He was denied bail by a Dhaka court on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"We have noted with deep concern the arrest and denial of bail to Shri Chinmoy Krishna Das, who is also the spokesperson of the Bangladesh Sammilit Sanatan Jagran Jote. This incident follows the multiple attacks on Hindus and other minorities by extremist elements in Bangladesh," the statement read.</p>

<p>The MEA noted that there are several documented cases of arson and looting of minorities' homes and business establishments, as well as theft, vandalism and desecration of deities and temples in Bangladesh.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It is unfortunate that while the perpetrators of these incidents remain at large, charges should be pressed against a religious leader presenting legitimate demands through peaceful gatherings," MEA said.</p>

<p>Chinmoy Krishna Das, a leader of the Hindu group Sammilita Sanatani Jote, leader was first detained at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in connection with a sedition case filed against him in Chattogram, according to a report by&nbsp;The Daily Star.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sedition case against&nbsp;the religious leader and 18 others was&nbsp;filed on October 31 in Chattogram, the report said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The arrest follows protests led by the Hindu community in the city of Rangpur, located nearly 300 km north of Dhaka, demanding stronger legal protections and a ministry dedicated to minority affairs.</p>

<p>Chinmoy Krishna Das's arrest came amid tensions over minority rights in the South Asian country that has seen widespread political violence since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster.&nbsp;Hindus comprise approximately 8 per cent of Bangladesh's 170 million people. Since the ouster of former PM Sheikh Hasina, the new military-backed interim government led by Mohammed Yunus has faced criticism for failing to curb a spike in violence against minorities.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who is set to embark on a five-day visit to China on December 2, has stressed that no agreement on loan would be reached with Beijing during his upcoming tour. The development came amid reports of disagreement with Nepal's ruling coalition about signing Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects with loan components.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Oli, during recent a meeting with former PMs and foreign ministers, claimed the BRI deal signed with China was not a loan-based agreement and there was no need to discuss now whether or not to seek a loan from Beijing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We take loans or grants based on our national interests as and when we need them from any country or agency. We should not be swayed by the baseless rumour that a loan is being taken to entrap the country," Mr Oli clarified.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Irrespective of the country we chose for our first visit, we keep sovereignty, independence and freedom as well as national welfare along with global welfare in top priority," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Oli's remarks came amid speculations that Nepali Congress, led by Sher Bahadur Deuba, favours grants from China under BRI while the priority of Nepali Prime Minister's Communist Party of Nepal- Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) is to seek loans under the arrangement.</p>

<h2><strong>KP Oli's China Visit</strong></h2>

<p>In a departure from the tradition of Nepal's newly elected leaders visiting India first, which was seen as a nod to the close ties between Kathmandu and New Delhi, PM Oli chose China for his maiden visit since taking office. The Prime Minister's office justified the move saying the visit to Beijing was fixed recently, and that New Delhi has not extended an invitation to Mr Oli thus far.</p>

<p>However, Mr Oli is known for his pro-China stance. On multiple occasions over the past decade, Mr Oli and his CPN-UML have advocated for closer ties with China. In 2016, Mr Oli made his maiden visit to China as Prime Minister. Soon after, his administration sought to improve cross-border railroad connectivity, infrastructure development, trade, investment and tourism cooperation with China under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the agreement signed in 2017, is yet to be finalised, as China and Nepal have been unable to negotiate a loan under the BRI despite intense efforts from Beijing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[With 80% of American households meeting this threshold, the program aims to make higher education more accessible.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Studying at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a dream for many technology students, but being able to attend without paying any tuition is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. MIT, along with a few other universities, is offering this chance to families with annual incomes under $200,000.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This effort will give much-needed support, as the outrageous cost of higher education in the United States frequently puts families in debt or unable to pay for college. Although grants and scholarships benefit some students, they usually only benefit a small percentage of students. Many worthy students will undoubtedly benefit from this new program.</p>

<p>According to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/mit-tuition-undergraduates-family-income-1120"><em>news release by MIT,</em></a> Eighty percent of American households meet this income threshold. And for the 50 percent of American families with income below $100,000, parents can expect to pay nothing at all toward the full cost of their students' MIT education, which includes tuition as well as housing, dining, fees, and an allowance for books and personal expenses.</p>

<p>"MIT's distinctive model of education - intense, demanding, and rooted in science and engineering - has profound practical value to our students and to society," MIT President Sally Kornbluth says.</p>

<p>"The cost of college is a real concern for families across the board," Kornbluth adds, "and we're determined to make this transformative educational experience available to the most talented students, whatever their financial circumstances. So, to every student out there who dreams of coming to MIT: Don't let concerns about cost stand in your way."</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/mit-free-tuition.html"><em>New York Times,</em></a> MIT joins a long list of universities that have reduced their price tags for students from families of limited means. On Thursday, the University of Texas system approved a plan to wipe out tuition and associated costs for undergraduate students from families earning $100,000 or less a year beginning next fall. In 2004, Harvard began waiving tuition to families with incomes of $40,000 or less. It has since raised the cutoff to $85,000.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump vowed additional tariffs on China as well as US neighbors Canada and Mexico, roiling markets with his first specific threat to curb global trade flows since his election win.</p>

<p>Trump said he would impose additional 10% tariffs on goods from China and 25% tariffs on all products from Mexico and Canada in posts to his Truth Social network on Monday. The Canadian dollar fell to a four-year low on the news, while the peso traded close to its weakest since 2022. China's yuan edged lower offshore.</p>

<p>Trump cast the new levies as necessary to clamp down on migrants and illegal drugs flowing across borders. Trump accused China of failing to follow through on promises to institute the death penalty for traffickers of fentanyl, writing that "drugs are pouring into our Country, mostly through Mexico, at levels never seen before."</p>

<p>"Until such time as they stop, we will be charging China an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States of America," Trump said.</p>

<p>In another post, the incoming president also vowed to hit Mexico and Canada with a 25% tariff on "ALL products," saying he would sign an executive order to that effect on his first day in office.</p>

<p>"As everyone is aware, thousands of people are pouring through Mexico and Canada, bringing Crime and Drugs at levels never seen before," he said. "This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!"</p>

<p>Trump's tariff threats provide a sharp counter to expectations that he might temper his trade policies during a second term, despite concerns from some business leaders about the impact. It came just days after he tapped Scott Bessent to be the next US Treasury secretary, a move that was seen as a promising sign for those seeking a more measured tariff stance.</p>

<p>Representatives for Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland and the Mexican Foreign Affairs Ministry and Economy Ministry, as well as China's Foreign Ministry and Commerce Ministry, didn't immediately respond to requests to comment. Spokespeople for Trump didn't immediately answer a question about whether there would be exemptions from the duties.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden had a message for Americans at his final Thanksgiving turkey pardon ceremony on Monday before Donald Trump returns to the White House -- "keep calm and gobble on."</p>

<p>Biden, 82, spared birds Peach and Blossom from ending up on the dinner table in a quirky and time-honored tradition marking the upcoming US holiday.</p>

<p>In a series of quips to a large crowd on the presidential mansion's South Lawn, Biden remarked that Peach "lives by the motto 'keep calm and gobble on'" -- while Blossom's philosophy was "no fowl play."</p>

<p>He added that during their trip to Washington from the Minnesota farm where they were raised, the two feathered beasts "stayed calm and they gobbled on, and they're still gobbling."</p>

<p>But the Democrat's words -- through which the turkeys did indeed repeatedly make gobbling noises -- also struck a poignant note as he prepares to leave the White House on January 20.</p>

<p>Republican Trump, who defeated Biden's Vice President Kamala Harris in the November election, looks set to tear up many of Biden's policies.</p>

<p>Trump's promises of mass deportations, a gutting of the federal bureaucracy and huge tariffs on foreign imports have caused uncertainty at home and abroad.</p>

<p>Biden said he wanted to close his remarks on a "more serious note," pointing out that it was "my last time to speak here as your president during this season."</p>

<p>"Let me say to you, it's been the honor of my life, I'm forever grateful," said Biden, who dropped out of the election in July after a disastrous television debate against Trump.</p>

<h3><strong>Ruffled feathers</strong></h3>

<p>The outgoing president has however promised not to ruffle any feathers during the transition to Trump -- unlike his rival, who continues to falsely insist that his 2020 election defeat by Biden was fraudulent.</p>

<p>And while Trump refused to attend the Democrat's inauguration in 2021, Biden and First Lady Jill Biden will be at the Republican's swearing-in on January 20, the White House confirmed Monday.</p>

<p>"He views that as an important demonstration of commitment to our democratic values and to honoring the will of the people," Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates told reporters flying with Biden to a Thanksgiving event in New York.</p>

<p>As he nears the end of his single term in office, Biden's attention will soon turn to the human pardons that US presidents usually give before departing the White House.</p>

<p>"They tell me there's 2,500 people here today -- looking for a pardon," Biden quipped.</p>

<p>Biden has said that however there is one he will not give -- to his son Hunter Biden.</p>

<p>The younger Biden was convicted earlier this year of lying about his drug use when he bought a gun -- a felony -- and has also pleaded guilty in a separate tax evasion trial.</p>

<p>Hunter Biden, whose young son Beau was at the turkey pardoning ceremony, has yet to be sentenced in either case.</p>

<p>The White House said Monday it had nothing to add to Biden's previous comments on possible clemency for his son.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The petition further claims that UMG paid influencers to promote Not Like Us on social media to maximise its exposure.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian artist Drake has filed a lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG) and Spotify, accusing them of conspiring to boost interest in Kendrick Lamar's diss track,<em> Not Like Us</em>, while deliberately suppressing his own music, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/nov/26/drake-kendrick-lamar-umg-spotify-not-like-us-claims-ntwnfb" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>The Guardian </em></a>has reported.</p>

<p>In a petition submitted to the New York Supreme Court on Monday, attorneys for Drake's company, Frozen Moments LLC, alleged that UMG and Spotify orchestrated a campaign to "manipulate and saturate streaming services and airwaves," employing various tactics to amplify Lamar's track.</p>

<p>The petition further claims that UMG paid influencers to promote Not Like Us on social media and arranged pay-to-play deals with radio stations to maximise its exposure.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for UMG told the <em>Guardian</em>: "The suggestion that UMG would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue. We employ the highest ethical practices in our marketing and promotional campaigns. No amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments in this pre-action submission can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear." Spotify declined to comment.</p>

<p>The media outlet reported that both Drake and Lamar have been associated with UMG for their entire career: Drake via Republic Records and Lamar via Interscope.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The petition is not a formal lawsuit but a legal procedure under New York law allowing Drake's attorneys to request that the court order UMG and Spotify to preserve all relevant documents and information in anticipation of a potential lawsuit.</p>

<p>Drake's petition alleges that UMG lowered the licensing fees it charges Spotify in exchange for the platform promoting Kendrick Lamar's track <em>Not Like Us</em>, even to users searching for unrelated songs or artists. It also claims that UMG paid Apple to make its digital assistant Siri deliberately redirect users who requested Drake's music to instead play Not Like Us.</p>

<p>The petition further accuses UMG of orchestrating a "scheme" that resulted in Not Like Us being streamed 900 million times, making it the most-streamed diss track in Spotify's history. The track also reportedly set records for the biggest single-day streams for a hip-hop song (12.8 million) and the most weekly streams by a rapper (81.2 million).</p>

<p>Drake's attorneys argue that UMG's actions were "motivated, at least in part, by executives at Interscope seeking to maximize their profits." They allege that the success of Not Like Us boosted streams of Lamar's back catalogue, providing financial benefits to UMG.</p>

<p>The petition states that Drake made multiple attempts to resolve the issue with UMG, only for the company to refuse responsibility, instead suggesting that Drake take legal action against Lamar rather than UMG.</p>

<p>Drake's attorneys also claim to have evidence that UMG has been attempting to cover up its actions, including terminating employees associated with or perceived to be loyal to Drake.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A federal judge threw cold water on one of Alphabet Inc.'s key arguments in a Department of Justice lawsuit over allegations that Google monopolized advertising technology.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During closing arguments in the lawsuit against the tech giant, US District Judge Leonie Brinkema said that she disagreed with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/google-proposes-search-result-changes-in-europe-after-sites-get-low-traffic-7108416">Google's attempts to rely on an earlier antitrust case</a> involving American Express Co. The judge interrupted Google's lawyer Monday to say that she had carefully studied a 2018 Supreme Court decision in the older case.</p>

<p>"We're dealing with a completely different setup" here compared to Amex, she said on the closing day of the trial in Alexandria, Virginia.</p>

<p>The case is one of several against Google over antitrust issues. In another, the Justice Department is seeking to force Alphabet to sell off its Chrome browser after winning a landmark ruling that the company illegally monopolized online search.</p>

<p>In Monday's case, the Justice Department and a group of states sued Google in 2023, arguing the company illegally monopolized three separate markets for advertising technology: sell-side tools used by websites, called ad servers; advertising exchanges; and buy-side tools used by advertisers known as ad networks. The company has countered by saying that splitting its tools into those buckets is wrong and its business is better understood as a single market in which website publishers and advertisers transact.</p>

<p>Brinkema's interjection came as Google lawyers were citing the American Express case, where the Supreme Court ruled that judges should look at how a product or service impacts different groups of customers. Google argues that some of its conduct - which the Justice Department said harmed website publishers - can be justified because it was intended to help advertisers.</p>

<p>Brinkema said she has "problems" applying the ruling related to the credit card market to Google.</p>

<p>But Google's lawyer, Karen Dunn, argued that the company's ad tech tools serve a similar function to credit cards by seeking to "match" buyers and sellers of online ads.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tools act to "facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers," she said. You "can't look at one side in isolation."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Justin Teresi, who attended Monday's arguments, said he believes Brinkema will rule in favor of the government based on a different legal argument.</p>

<p>"A liability finding is likely on some claims - most notably those involving the publisher ad server and tying," said Teresi, who focuses on antitrust litigation and policy.</p>

<p>The Justice Department argued Monday that the Amex decision only applies to credit card transaction platforms, not all markets where a company does business with two sets of customers. For example, courts haven't held that for newspapers, which sell ads to advertisers and news to consumers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Google is once, twice, three times a monopolist," Justice Department lawyer Aaron Teitelbaum said. The company's "internal documents make clear it's three markets and not one."</p>

<p>Google's Dunn said that US antitrust law allows the company to decide whether to make its products work with that of competitors. Forcing Google to provide technology and resources to make ad tech work seamlessly with rival tools would stifle innovation, she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brinkema, who has previously said she plans to issue a decision by the end of the year, didn't give an update on timin</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Google has proposed more changes to its search results in Europe after some smaller rivals complained about lower traffic to their sites.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google has proposed more changes to its search results in Europe after some smaller rivals complained about lower traffic to their sites resulting from previous tweaks by the Alphabet unit and as EU antitrust regulators consider levying charges against the company under new EU tech rules.</p>

<p>Under the Digital Markets Act, Google is prohibited from favouring its products and services on its platform. The Act kicked in last year and is aimed at reining in the power of Big Tech.</p>

<p>The world's most popular internet search engine has since then tried to address conflicting demands from price-comparison sites, hotels, airlines and small retailers, among others. The latter three groups said their direct booking clicks have fallen by 30% due to recent Google changes.</p>

<p>"We have therefore proposed more changes to our European search results to try to accommodate these requests, while still meeting the goals set by the DMA," Google's legal director, Oliver Bethell, said in a blog post on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Changes include introducing expanded and equally formatted units allowing users to choose between comparison sites and supplier websites, new formats letting rivals show prices and pictures on their websites as well as new ad units for comparison sites.</p>

<p>"We think the latest proposal is the right way to balance the difficult trade-offs that the DMA involves," Bethell said.</p>

<p>For its search results in Germany, Belgium and Estonia, Google also plans to remove the map showing the location of hotels and the results beneath the map, similar to its old "ten blue links" format from years ago, as part of a short test to gauge users' interest.</p>

<p>"We're very reluctant to take this step, as removing helpful features does not benefit consumers or businesses in Europe," Bethell said.</p>

<p>Google has been in the European Commission's crosshairs since March. DMA violations can cost companies as much as 10% of their annual global turnover.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The number of new HIV infections and deaths has fallen across the world, marking significant progress in the fight against the disease. But HIV is far from being stamped out, health experts warn ahead of World AIDS Day on Sunday.</p>

<h3><strong>Uneven progress</strong></h3>

<p>During the 2010s, the number of HIV infections across the world declined by a fifth, according to a major study published in The Lancet HIV journal on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Deaths related to HIV, which are generally caused by other diseases during the late stages of AIDS, fell by about 40 percent to below a million a year, the study said.</p>

<p>The decline was mainly driven by improving rates in sub-Saharan Africa, which is by far the hardest-hit region in the global epidemic.</p>

<p>However, infections did not go down everywhere. Other regions, such as Eastern Europe and the Middle East, saw HIV numbers increase.</p>

<p>And the world remains far from the United Nations target of virtually eradicating AIDS-related deaths by 2030, the researchers said.</p>

<p>"The world has made remarkable global progress to significantly reduce the number of new HIV infections," said lead study author Hmwe Kyu of the US-based Institute For Health Metrics and Evaluation.</p>

<p>"More than a million people acquire a new HIV infection each year and, of the 40 million people living with HIV, a quarter are not receiving treatment," she said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Effective tools -&nbsp;<br />
Preventative treatments called Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) have proven to be a powerful tool in the fight against HIV.</p>

<p>These daily pills reduce the risk of getting HIV from sex by around 99 percent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They have helped drive down HIV rates in many countries. In some, such as France, health authorities are urging PrEP to be made more available to more people, rather than just men who have sex with men.</p>

<p>"It is something that can be used by anyone who needs it at some point in their sexual life," French infectious disease specialist Pierre Delobel told a press conference.</p>

<p>For people who have been infected with HIV, antiretroviral therapy can reduce the amount of the virus in their blood to undetectable levels.</p>

<p>An undetectable viral load means that there is less than a one percent chance that breastfeeding mothers pass HIV onto their babies, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>

<h3><strong>New drug raises hopes</strong></h3>

<p>These tools have worked well in wealthier countries but the high costs have meant that poorer countries -- such as in Africa -- have often been left behind.</p>

<p>There are fears that this history could repeat for a new drug that has been hailed as a potential game-changer in the battle against HIV.</p>

<p>Early trials have found that the antiretroviral treatment lenacapavir is 100 percent effective in preventing HIV infection. And it only needs to be injected twice a year, making the drug far easier to administer than current regimens requiring daily pills.</p>

<p>US pharmaceutical giant Gilead has been charging around $40,000 per person per a year for the treatment in several countries.</p>

<p>But researchers have estimated the drug could be made for as little as $40, calling on Gilead to allow for cheaper access in hard-hit nations.</p>

<p>Last month, Gilead announced it had signed licensing deals with six generic drugmakers to produce and sell lenacapavir in lower-income countries.</p>

<p>While experts largely welcomed the move, some noted that millions of people with HIV live in countries not included in the deal.</p>

<p>The twice-yearly injection is also hoped to help get around another problem for administering HIV drugs -- the stigma that comes along with having the disease.</p>

<h3><strong>What about a vaccine?</strong></h3>

<p>Despite decades of effort, a vaccine for HIV remains elusive.</p>

<p>But the lenacapavir shot is "like having a vaccine basically", Andrew Hill, a researcher at the UK's Liverpool University, told AFP earlier this year.</p>

<p>A handful of patients have also been effectively cured of HIV.</p>

<p>But these cures happen only after a patient endures a brutal stem cell transplant for their leukaemia, so is not an option for almost all people living with HIV.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Lyle and Erik Menendez have been in prison since a blockbuster trial in the 1990s that became almost compulsory viewing for millions of Americans.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Family of Lyle and Erik Menendez told a judge Monday they want the men freed from the life sentences they are serving for the shotgun murders of their parents, as their court case suffered a delay. The pair have been in prison since a blockbuster trial in the 1990s that became almost compulsory viewing for millions of Americans.</p>

<p>Television audiences were riveted by the gruesome details of the slayings of Jose and Kitty Menendez at the family's luxury Beverly Hills mansion.</p>

<p>The two men, who have spent more than three decades behind bars, had been due to appear by videolink at a hearing in Los Angeles, their first court appearance in 28 years as a campaign to set them free gathers pace.</p>

<p>But technical difficulties scuppered the appearance and the hearing was pushed back to the end of January.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Judge Michael Jesic called the two men's elderly aunts to the stand to hear them plead for the brothers to be freed.</p>

<p>"I would like to be able to hug them and see them," Jose Menendez's older sister Terry Baralt, 85, said.</p>

<p>"I would like them to come home."</p>

<p>Kitty's sister, Joan Vander Molen, echoed that.</p>

<p>"No child should go through what Erik and Lyle went through," she said.</p>

<p>"They never knew if tonight will be the night when they would be raped."</p>

<p>Prosecutors painted the crime as a cold-hearted bid by the then-young men -- Lyle was 21 and Erik was 18 -- to get their hands on their parents' $14 million fortune.</p>

<p>But their attorneys described the 1989 killings as an act of desperate self-defense by young men subjected to years of sexual abuse and psychological violence at the hands of an abusive father and a complicit mother.</p>

<p>The case saw a huge surge of renewed interest this year with the release of the Netflix hit "Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story."</p>

<p>The hearing comes after a campaign to secure their release, supported by Kim Kardashian and other celebrities.</p>

<p>"Set them free before the Holidays!" wrote Tammi Menendez, Erik's wife, on social media last week.</p>

<p>Public interest was such that the court held a lottery for the 16 seats in the public gallery.</p>

<p>Nick Bonanno, a former high school classmate of Erik's, was the first to arrive at the court, taking his place at the head of the line at 4:30 am (1230 GMT).</p>

<p>"I wanted to show support to... Eric and Lyle," he told AFP ahead of the hearing.</p>

<p>"It's all about supporting and healing, not just for the families, but for us as a culture."</p>

<p>Elena Gordon, 43, said she wanted "to witness a part of our local history."</p>

<h3><strong>'It's really awesome'</strong></h3>

<p>The hearing was intended as a starting point for lawyers working on three routes to free Erik Menendez, 53, and Lyle Menendez, 56.</p>

<p>Attorney Mark Geragos has filed a writ of habeas corpus, an attempt to effectively vacate the brothers' first-degree murder conviction, which could free the brothers immediately.</p>

<p>Another route is an effort to get the men re-sentenced on the same conviction, which would open the way for them to request parole.</p>

<p>Finally, Geragos has submitted a clemency request to California Governor Gavin Newsom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Journalist Robert Rand, who wrote a book about the case, and who is in regular touch with the brothers, said the family was optimistic.</p>

<p>But, he said, no one was expecting any quick fixes.</p>

<p>"They're hopeful," he said. "They don't know what's going to happen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I believe this could take much longer than was originally anticipated. It could be six months, could be eight months, could be a year, but eventually they will get out."</p>

<p>With excitement over the case near fever pitch, tourists are regularly making pilgrimages to the Beverly Hills home where the killings took place.</p>

<p>Australian Christian Hannah, who was born almost two decades after the double murders, made sure the home was a stop on his tour of celebrity hotspots, because of his fascination with the Netflix show.</p>

<p>"It's really awesome seeing it in person," he told AFP last week.</p>

<p>"It's just because you see it on TV and you see it in person, just feels really cool."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Trump, 78, was accused of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election he lost to Joe Biden and mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's legal troubles -- or at least most of them -- will not follow him back to the White House.</p>

<p>Special Counsel Jack Smith, who brought two federal cases against the former president, moved on Monday to drop both cases against the now president-elect.</p>

<p>Not because of a lack of evidence, Smith was careful to emphasize, but rather because of a long-standing Justice Department policy of not indicting or prosecuting a sitting president.</p>

<p>"The Government's position on the merits of the defendant's prosecution has not changed," he said.</p>

<p>"But the circumstances have," the prosecutor added in a nod to Trump's November 5 election victory over Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Smith did leave open the possibility of Trump being tried after he leaves office -- he asked Judge Tanya Chutkan to dismiss the election interference case "without prejudice," meaning it can be refiled at some point.</p>

<p>Chutkan granted the request, noting that "the immunity afforded to a sitting President is temporary, expiring when they leave office."</p>

<p>"Of course there may be no appetite (for prosecution) in 2029, but this preserves that option," said Barbara McQuade, a law professor at the University of Michigan.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, was accused of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election he lost to Joe Biden and mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House.</p>

<p>A Trump-appointed judge in Florida dismissed the classified documents case on the grounds that Smith was unlawfully appointed.</p>

<p>Smith appealed the decision by Judge Aileen Cannon but dropped his appeal on Monday, citing Trump's election and the Justice Department policy.</p>

<p>The election interference case never came to trial, as it was delayed at every turn by Trump's attorneys as he sought re-election as the Republican presidential candidate.</p>

<p>The US Supreme Court eventually ruled in July that an ex-president has broad immunity from prosecution for acts committed in his official capacity, forcing Smith to bring the case to a new grand jury and issue a new indictment.</p>

<p>As president, Trump could have made the two federal cases disappear and could potentially prevent them from being brought again by attempting to preemptively pardon himself before leaving the White House.</p>

<p>Trump pledged during the election campaign to fire Smith "within two seconds" of taking office.</p>

<p>Trump was accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding -- the session of Congress called to certify the Biden victory which was violently attacked on January 6, 2021 by a mob of Trump supporters.</p>

<p>Trump was also accused of seeking to disenfranchise US voters with his false claims that he won the 2020 election.</p>

<h3><strong>State cases</strong></h3>

<p>Trump also faces two state cases -- in New York and Georgia.</p>

<p>He was convicted in New York in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels on the eve of the 2016 election to stop her from revealing an alleged 2006 sexual encounter.</p>

<p>Trump was scheduled to be sentenced in July but his lawyers asked that his conviction be tossed out in light of the Supreme Court immunity ruling.</p>

<p>Trump was to have been sentenced Tuesday, but last week judge Juan Merchan postponed the sentencing indefinitely.</p>

<p>Trump, the first former president convicted of a crime, faces up to four years in prison on each count. As a first-time offender, however, he was considered far more likely to receive a fine and probation -- and that was before his White House win.</p>

<p>In Georgia, Trump faces racketeering charges over his efforts to subvert the 2020 results in the southern state, but that case will likely be frozen while he is in office.</p>

<p>The case has also been bogged down in accusations of impropriety by the Fulton County district attorney, Fani Willis, who acknowledged having had an intimate relationship with the man she hired to be a special prosecutor.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Liam Payne, the former One Direction star, fell to his death after an apparent attempt to escape from his hotel room in Buenos Aires, Argentina, according to a report in TMZ.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Liam Payne, the former <em>One Direction </em>star, fell to his death after an apparent attempt to escape from his hotel room in Buenos Aires, Argentina, according to a report in <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/11/25/liam-payne-left-in-room-by-hotel-workers-and-tried-to-scale-balcony/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">TMZ</a>. It suggests the singer was intoxicated when he tried to leave his room at the CasaSur Palermo Hotel, and the staff were aware of his intentions to use the balcony as a means of escape.</p>

<p>Surveillance footage from the hotel shows Payne being escorted through the lobby by hotel employees, visibly struggling and resisting their efforts to bring him back to his room. The staff used a master key to enter the room and placed Liam back inside. According to a police report obtained by TMZ, they also removed a mirror from the wall outside his room, likely to prevent any potential damage.</p>

<p>Moments later, a hotel staff member contacted emergency services, expressing concern that Payne might harm himself while attempting to use the balcony. According to a 911 transcript, the hotel employee said, “I don't know whether his life may be in danger. He is in a room with a balcony, and, well, we're a little afraid.”</p>

<p>Despite these warnings, the hotel made the decision to leave the 31-year-old singer alone in his room, which ultimately led to the fatal fall.</p>

<p>Authorities later discovered Payne's body on the ground, along with a bag he was not carrying earlier, suggesting he gathered his belongings before the fall. A&nbsp;hat was also found near the scene. Payne was not wearing it when staff last interacted with him.</p>

<p>Initial investigations indicate that the 31-year-old was trying to move from his third-floor balcony to the second-floor balcony in an apparent attempt to get closer to the ground before jumping.</p>

<p>Two days after Liam Payne's death, a hotel worker found a brown leather bag on the second-floor balcony containing pills and a bottle of whiskey with “for Liam” written on it. It's believed that Payne threw the bag down to the second floor, intending to retrieve it after making his way there, according to TMZ.</p>

<p>The coroner suggested that Payne may have been unconscious when he fell, although he appeared to be conscious moments before the fall as he was seen gathering his personal items.</p>

<p>Reports also suggest that Payne previously used hotel balconies to escape, including a similar incident in Florida, where his bodyguard locked him in his room due to concerns over his drug use.</p>

<p>Payne's toxicology report revealed a dangerous mix of drugs, including crack and “pink cocaine,” a combination of ketamine and other substances.</p>

<p>According to TMZ, a source with direct knowledge claims that Argentinian authorities are attempting to shield the hotel, which is why three people — a friend, a waiter, and a former hotel employee who is said to have supplied Liam with drugs — are facing charges. The source reportedly said the hotel prioritised avoiding disruptions in the lobby and safeguarding its property over ensuring Liam's safety.</p>]]></content:encoded>

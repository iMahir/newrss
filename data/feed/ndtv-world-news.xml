       <description><![CDATA[Two in five Britons think they are worse off since Labour Party came to power in July, earlier this year.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A petition calling for fresh general election in the UK has reached over 1.7 million signatures as the Labour government faces widespread disapproval regarding its policies and post-poll work. Even Tesla boss Elon Musk chimed in on the issue by reposting a message about the success of the petition. According to the guidelines, any petition that asks for a change to the law or to policies gets a response from the government after 10,000 signatures. After 100,000 signatures, petitions are considered for debate in the parliament.</p>

<p>"I would like there to be another General Election. I believe the current Labour Government have gone back on the promises they laid out in the lead up to the last election," the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/700143" rel="noindex, nofollow">petition </a>description reads.</p>

<p>As of the last update, the petition had raked up 1,771,423 signatures and counting. The petition was started by Michael Westwood who runs Britain's 'cheapest pub'. He said he did not imagine in his wildest dreams that Mr Musk would quote post his petition.</p>

<p>"The General Election petition has now DESTROYED the 200k target within 6 hours-just after midnight in Britain. The British people are about to completely humiliate the Labour Party," read the post shared by Mr Musk.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Meanwhile, Mr Westwood, the owner of the <em>Wagon and Horses </em>pub where pints are sold for $2.90, said the Labour government's actions looked "nothing like what was promised" in the manifesto.</p>

<p>"I think people have had enough, people have seen what's happened over in America as well, and I think that's had a knock-on effect that, actually, if people stand together and vote then we can make a change," Mr Westwood told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1979997/election-petition-Michael-Westwood-interview" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Express</em></a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Dwindling popularity</strong></h3>

<p>According to an <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/two-five-britons-think-they-are-worse-labour-was-elected" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Ipsos </em></a>poll, the Labour government has seen its fortunes dwindle rapidly after the general elections earlier this year with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's popularity taking a nosedive as well. Almost half (49 per cent) of the public views the Labour Party unfavourably which trails three points behind the Conservative Party. Meanwhile, two in five Britons think they are worse off since Labour came to power.</p>

<p>A significant majority (56 per cent) believes that Britain was heading in the wrong direction, compared to just 19 per cent who feel things are on the right track -- suggesting there was widespread public pessimism.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
At least six people were killed and 10 wounded early Sunday in an armed attack at a bar in the city of Villahermosa, in the southeastern Mexican state of Tabasco, local authorities said.</p>

<p>"Armed persons" entered the bar "looking for a specific person" and the shots hit those nearby, state deputy prosecutor Gilberto Melquiades said at a press conference, adding that an investigation was ongoing.</p>

<p>At least five people were found dead at the scene, a venue known as "DBar," while another died after being taken to hospital, the official said.</p>

<p>Five of the wounded had been identified, he added.</p>

<p>The shooting occurred two weeks after a similar attack in the city of Queretaro, a region of central Mexico that until now had been spared from violence linked to organized crime.</p>

<p>That attack left 10 dead and seven wounded.</p>

<p>Federal Public Security Secretary Omar Garcia Harfuch said on Sunday that the government of President Claudia Sheinbaum "is in coordination" with local authorities to clarify what happened in Tabasco.</p>

<p>The southeastern state, home to oil production facilities, has seen an increase in violence in recent months.</p>

<p>Between January and October of this year there were 715 murders in Tabasco, compared to 253 in all of 2023, according to official statistics.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump's top security advisor called on Sunday for an end to the escalation of the war between Ukraine and Russia, and for both parties to come to the negotiating table.</p>

<p>"We need to bring this to a responsible end. We need to restore deterrence, restore peace, and get ahead of this escalation ladder, rather than responding to it," said Mike Waltz, Trump's pick for the influential role of US national security advisor (NSA).</p>

<p>In recent days, Washington has authorised Kyiv to use US-supplied missiles to strike targets in Russian territory and agreed to supply it with landmines, prompting Moscow to respond with the use of an experimental medium-range ballistic missile.</p>

<p>Waltz, a noted foreign policy hawk and former US special forces officer, has been critical of Russia but has, like Trump, opposed increasing aid to Ukraine.</p>

<p>"President Trump has been very clear about the need to end this conflict," he told US media outlet Fox News on Sunday.</p>

<p>"We need to be discussing who's at that table, whether it's an agreement, an armistice, how to get both sides to the table and then what's the framework of a deal?"</p>

<p>Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, with the United States and others coming to Kyiv's aid in its fight to hold its territory in the east of the country.</p>

<p>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has in the past ruled out ceding any territory to Russia, and told Fox News on Tuesday that Ukraine would lose the war if Washington pulls funding.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden's administration has promised a smooth transition to Trump, who has pledged major shake-ups on both foreign and domestic policy.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Waltz said he had met Biden's NSA Jake Sullivan and warned adversaries abroad against thinking they could gain an advantage in the months before Trump takes office in January.</p>

<p>"For our adversaries out there that think this is a time of opportunity that they can play one administration off the other. They're wrong... we are hand in glove."</p>

<p>Waltz also lauded "the strength and the grit" of Israel in its offensive against Hamas, which has killed at least 44,211 people in Gaza, the majority civilians, according to local authorities.</p>

<p>The war was triggered by the assault on Israel by Hamas militants on October 7, 2023, a cross-border raid that resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>"Now is a moment to craft some type of arrangement that doesn't just put a pause for future October 7th's (but) truly brings stability to the Middle East," said Waltz.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[When Ali Fakhro lays out a row of pistachio-filled chocolate bars in the morning at his bakery in Berlin, he knows they will be gone in a matter of hours.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Ali Fakhro lays out a row of pistachio-filled chocolate bars in the morning at his bakery in Berlin, he knows they will be gone in a matter of hours.</p>

<p>Inspired by the viral success of the crunchy delicacy known as "Dubai chocolate", Fakhro, 32, hunted down a recipe and began making his own version two months ago.</p>

<p>"On the first day I made 20 bars, but they went fast. The next day, I made 50 -- all gone too," he said.</p>

<p>So-called Dubai chocolate was invented in 2021 by British-Egyptian entrepreneur Sarah Hamouda, who is based in Dubai.</p>

<p>The chunky treat consists of a blocky, hand-decorated chocolate bar with various quirky fillings -- the signature flavour being a rich pistachio cream.</p>

<p>The treat went viral when TikTok food influencer Maria Vehera posted a video of herself eating a bar in her car, which has since been viewed more than 100 million times.</p>

<p>The real thing is only available to local customers in limited quantities, but the trend has led to an explosion of copycat versions of the chocolate around the world.</p>

<p><strong>- Queueing in the cold -</strong></p>

<p>Fakhro, who runs Abu Khaled Sweets in Berlin, experimented "several times" with different recipes before finally landing on the right ingredient to give the pistachio cream its famous crunch -- a finely shredded Middle Eastern pastry known as kataifi.</p>

<p>Germans have been scrambling to get their hands on the chocolate with bars selling for over 100 euros ($104) on the internet.</p>

<p>Last week, a 31-year-old man was caught by customs attempting to smuggle 45 kilograms of the sweet treat into Germany from Switzerland.</p>

<p>When Swiss manufacturer Lindt launched its own version of the Dubai chocolate in Germany this month, customers queued for hours in the cold to get their hands on a bar.</p>

<p>At up to 20 euros per bar, the delicacy is far more expensive than your average chocolate bar -- but that didn't seem to be putting anyone off.</p>

<p>"I waited 10 hours. I've been here since midnight just to taste this chocolate," 18-year-old student Leon Faehnle told AFP outside a Lindt shop in Stuttgart.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Easy money' -</strong></p>

<p>Lindt launched the chocolate in Germany with 1,000 numbered bars in 10 shops, a spokesman for the group told AFP, and is planning a similar launch in Austria on November 30.</p>

<p>Dubai chocolate has also been a hit in France, with a version by chocolatier Jeremy Bockel on show at the Salon du Chocolat in Paris earlier this month.</p>

<p>Yannick Burkhard, 21, queued for three hours in Stuttgart to get his hands on the chocolate -- but is not planning to eat any of it himself. Instead, he will sell it on the internet.</p>

<p>"I would never pay that much for this. It's quick and easy money," he said with a smile.</p>

<p>"This bar cost 15 euros, but it can sell for almost 100 euros... There are lots of offers on eBay, up to 300 euros," said a customer who gave his name only as Lucas, 24.</p>

<p>Faehnle had a more wholesome plan for his bars as he exited the shop in Stuttgart beaming with pride at his purchase.</p>

<p>"Now I'm going to go home and share them with my grandparents," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The widening rift between the two most powerful political families in the Philippines became public after the Southeast Asian nation's Vice President Sara Duterte said that she would have President Ferdinand Marcos Jr assassinated.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The widening rift between the two most powerful political families in the Philippines became public after the Southeast Asian nation's Vice President Sara Duterte said that she would have President Ferdinand Marcos Jr assassinated if she were to be killed. Mr Duterte is the daughter of former president Rodrigo Duterte.</p>

<p>Now, the law and order authorities in the Philippines are "investigating" the threats made by their Vice President, and Ms Duterte could be prosecuted if evidence is found supporting her claim.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Duterte's threats are now under investigation and may lead to charges," the Presidential Communications Office said, citing the justice ministry.</p>

<p>"If the evidence warrants, this could lead to eventual prosecution," Mr Marcos' office said in a statement.</p>

<p>The Philippines' security council has also taken cognisance matter and is "verifying" the alleged assassination threat. National Security Adviser Eduardo Ano said the government considers all threats to the president as "serious", vowing to closely work with law enforcement and intelligence communities to investigate the threat and possible perpetrators.</p>

<p>"Any and all threats against the life of the president shall be validated and considered a matter of national security," Mr Ano said in a statement.</p>

<h2><strong>VP's Threat &amp; Response</strong></h2>

<p>Addressing a press conference on Saturday morning, Ms Duterte said, "I have spoken to someone. I told them, if I am killed, go and kill BBM [Marcos], [First Lady] Liza Araneta, and [Speaker] Martin Romualdez. No joke. No joke."</p>

<p>"I said, do not stop until they are dead, and the person agreed," said added, as quoted by news agency Reuters.</p>

<p>Duterte's threat stemmed from an order by lawmakers to transfer her chief-of-staff to jail for allegedly impeding its probe over the vice president's alleged misuse of public funds.</p>

<p>In response to Duterte's threat, Marcos' presidential security command said it had tightened its protocols in guarding the Philippine leader and the national police chief had ordered an investigation.</p>

<h3><strong>Rife Between Philippines's Political Families</strong></h3>

<p>Sara Duterte, the daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte, and Mr Marcos were once political partners who won an overwhelming mandate to lead the nation's top two offices in 2022. The alliance crumbled this year over policy differences, including foreign policy and the elder Duterte's deadly war on drugs.</p>

<p>Marcos' congressional allies are separately investigating Rodrigo Duterte's campaign which led to more than 6,000 killed in anti-drug operations and alleged corruption over Sara Duterte's use of public funds during her tenure as education secretary. Both have denied wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Ms Duterte resigned from the Marcos cabinet in June while remaining vice president, signalling the collapse of a formidable political alliance that helped her and Mr Marcos, son and namesake of the late authoritarian leader, to secure their 2022 electoral victories by wide margins.</p>

<p>Following this, Speaker Romualdez, a cousin of Mr Marcos, slashed the vice presidential office's budget by nearly two-thirds.</p>

<p>Ms Duterte's outburst is the latest in a series of startling signs of the feud at the top of Philippine politics. In October, she accused Mr Marcos of incompetence and said she had imagined cutting the president's head off.</p>

<h3><strong>Philippines' System Of Governance</strong></h3>

<p>In the Philippines, the vice president is elected separately from the president and has no official duties. Many vice presidents have pursued social development activities, while some have been appointed to cabinet posts.</p>

<p>The country is gearing up for mid-term elections in May, seen as a litmus test of Mr Marcos' popularity and a chance for him to consolidate power and groom a successor before his single six-year term ends in 2028.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Voters in South America's laid-backUruguay, known for its beaches, legalized marijuana and stability, will head to the polls on Sunday in a second-round presidential race between moderates that closes out a bumper year of elections.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Voters in South America's laid-back&nbsp;Uruguay, known for its beaches, legalized marijuana and stability, will head to the polls on Sunday in a second-round presidential race between moderates that closes out a bumper year of elections.</p>

<p>The vote in the small nation of 3.4 million people sees opposition center-left candidate Yamandu Orsi take on continuity conservative runner, Alvaro Delgado, who has the backing of a third-placed ally.</p>

<p>Final opinion polls suggest the Nov. 24 runoff promises to be razor tight, with fewer than 25,000 votes potentially separating the frontrunners.</p>

<p>Unlike sharp right-left divides in recent elections in Argentina, Brazil or Mexico,&nbsp;Uruguay's political arena is relatively tension-free, with significant overlap between the conservative and liberal coalitions vying for office, taking some of the sting out of Sunday's final result.</p>

<p>Ballot stations open at 8 a.m. (1100 GMT) and close at 7:30 p.m. local time, with first results expected two hours later.</p>

<p>Mr Orsi, who has pledged a "modern left" policy approach, won 43.9% of the October vote for the Broad Front and will face Delgado, who secured 26.8% but also has the backing of the conservative Colorado Party that together with his National Party made up almost 42% of votes. The two parties did the same in 2019, winning the election.</p>

<p>Mr Orsi has sought to reassure&nbsp;Uruguayans that he does not plan a sharp policy shift in the traditionally moderate and relatively wealthy nation.</p>

<p>Mr Delgado meanwhile has asked voters to "re-elect a good government," seeking to capitalize on the popularity of President Lacalle Pou, who constitutionally cannot run for immediate re-election.</p>

<p>Neither coalition has an absolute majority in the lower house following October's elections. But Mr Orsi's Broad Front won 16 of 30 Senate seats. He argues his senate majority places him in a better position to lead the next government.</p>

<p>Both contenders on Sunday are hoping to attract the roughly 8% of first-round voters who went for smaller, unaligned parties, as well as those who failed to turn out in October.</p>

<p>But neither has made new pledges in the final weeks to appeal to them, and pollsters say a televised debate on Nov. 17 appears to have had little effect.</p>

<p>"I don't know who I'm voting for," said Rosario Gusque, 42, from the region of Canelones where Orsi was previously mayor. "Even less so after seeing the debate."</p>

<p>One question as the biggest year for elections in history comes to an end is whether&nbsp;Uruguay&nbsp;will buck a global trend of incumbent parties losing vote share compared with the previous election. Voters hurt by inflation and high living costs have punished parties in power, including in Britain, Japan and the United States.</p>

<p>A robust&nbsp;Uruguayan economy though could help Delgado on Sunday: "There are few indications that voters are clamoring for significant political change," said&nbsp;Uruguayan analyst Nicolas Saldias of the Economist Intelligence Unit.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran plans to hold talks about its disputed nuclear programme with three European powers on Nov. 29 in Geneva, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported on Sunday, days after the UN atomic watchdog passed a resolution against Tehran.</p>

<p>Iran reacted to the resolution, which was proposed by Britain, France, Germany and the United States, with what government officials called various measures such as activating numerous new and advanced centrifuges, machines that enrich uranium.</p>

<p>Kyodo said Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian's government was seeking a solution to the nuclear impasse ahead of the inauguration in January of US President-elect Donald Trump.</p>

<p>A senior Iranian official confirmed that the meeting would go ahead next Friday, adding that "Tehran has always believed that the nuclear issue should be resolved through diplomacy. Iran has never left the talks".</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the Swiss foreign ministry directed questions to the countries named in the report.</p>

<p>In 2018, the then-Trump administration exited Iran's 2015 nuclear pact with six major powers and reimposed harsh sanctions on Iran, prompting Tehran to violate the pact's nuclear limits, with moves such as rebuilding stockpiles of enriched uranium, refining it to higher fissile purity and installing advanced centrifuges to speed up output.</p>

<p>Indirect talks between President Joe Biden's administration and Tehran to try to revive the pact have failed, but Trump said in his election campaign in September that "We have to make a deal, because the consequences are impossible. We have to make a deal".</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Bangladeshi mystic sect promoting religious tolerance has cancelled their popular music festival after Islamist threats, the latest victim of turbulent religious relations since a student-led August revolution.</p>

<p>The overthrow of long-time autocratic prime minister Sheikh Hasina has seen a spate of protests in Muslim-majority Bangladesh, including a surge in Islamist groups emboldened to take to the streets after years of being suppressed.</p>

<p>In the immediate chaotic days following Hasina's ouster, there were a string of reprisals on Hindus -- seen by some as disproportionate supporters of her regime -- as well as attacks on Muslim Sufi shrines by Islamic hardliners.</p>

<p>Devotees of Lalon Shah, a 17th-century Bengali social reformer whose moving songs of religious tolerance remain hugely influential, had organised a two-day festival or "mela" in the city of Narayanganj later this month.</p>

<p>More than 10,000 people attended the event last year, listening to musicians promoting the sect's philosophy -- &nbsp;a mix of Hinduism and Sufism rather than one specific religion -- which angered some Islamic hardliners.</p>

<p>Narayanganj Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Mahmudul Hoque said city authorities had not approved the programme due to concerns about potential violence after assessing security risks.</p>

<p>"This area is a stronghold of groups with opposing views," Mr Hoque said.</p>

<p>Festival organiser Shah Jalal said it was the first time he had to cancel.</p>

<p>Abdul Awal, a committee leader of Hefazat-e-Islam -- a coalition of Islamist organizations with significant influence -- led marches earlier this month demanding the festival be stopped.</p>

<p>"We cannot allow activities that contradict the true spirit of Islam," Mr Awal said.</p>

<p>"In the name of celebration, they promote indecency, with women singing and dancing, gambling, and the smoking of weed (cannabis)," he alleged.</p>

<p>Lalon's followers, ascetic "Baul" singers who wander on foot from town to town singing and begging for alms, are branded heretics by some Islamists.</p>

<p>"The cancellation of Lalon Mela is a bad omen for all of us," said cultural activist Rafiur Rabbi.</p>

<p>"It is disheartening that the government is yielding to majority pressure. Does this mean minorities will no longer have a voice?"</p>

<p>But the interim government's cultural affairs advisor, Mostofa Sarwar Farooki, said they were doing what they could.</p>

<p>"Sheikh Hasina's fall and her fleeing the country created a vacuum that led to a series of incidents, but we have managed to regain control," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A wayward emperor penguin was released into the&nbsp;Southern Ocean, 20 days after he swam over 2,000 miles away from his home in Antarctica. He was released from a Parks and Wildlife Service boat on Wednesday. Notably, the penguin affectionately named "Gus,"&nbsp;made international headlines after being found on an Australian beach. The young penguin, estimated to be around three feet tall, was discovered by surfers on Ocean Beach on November 1. He was discovered looking weary but alive, marking a rare sighting of the species so far north.</p>

<p>According to&nbsp;<i><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-22/gus-emperor-penguin-released-after-20-day-recovery/104636800" rel="nofollow, noindex">ABC News</a>,&nbsp;</i>Gus is believed to have swum thousands of kilometres, possibly carried off course by ocean currents. Gus&nbsp;was taken in by local wildlife caretaker Carol Biddulph, who nursed him back to health. He was severely underweight, weighing only 47 pounds, compared to the average weight of 88 pounds for an emperor penguin.</p>

<p>"I really didn't know whether he was going to make it to begin with because he was so undernourished. I'll miss Gus. It's been an incredible few weeks, something I wouldn't have missed," Ms&nbsp;Biddulph said in a video recorded before the bird's release.</p>

<p>Under Ms Biddulph's care, Gus regained his strength, and his weight increased to around 55 pounds. He was fed a diet of pilchard fish, and by the time of his release, he was eating around 20 fish three times a day.</p>

<p>After a 20-day rehabilitation, Gus was released back into the Southern Ocean on November 21. He was taken to an undisclosed location, where he was placed in a ventilated pet carrier with an ice pack. Once released, Gus belly-flopped into the water and swam away without looking back.</p>

<p>"Magnificent. He just knew where he was supposed to be, didn't give a backward glance and just disappeared. It's just amazing.&nbsp;… He was ready for it," Ms&nbsp;Biddulph said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Experts are still unsure how Gus ended up so far from home, but theories include getting caught in a current while searching for food or being blown off course by storms. While penguins are naturally curious and prone to wandering, they have never been known to travel as far as Gus did.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some also said the changing environmental conditions could have led to a scarcity of food and resources in Antarctica, forcing Gus to embark on an epic swim to Australia in search of sustenance.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Before the plane took off, a passenger alerted the crew to a snake on board, sparking panic.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Australian Disney star recently made headlines for an unusual mid-flight adventure when he removed a snake from a plane. The actor, who is known for his roles in Disney productions, stepped in when the flight crew discovered a small snake onboard. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/virgin-airlines-disney-andre-rerekura-snake-plane-b2652368.html">Independent</a></em>, the incident happened on November 21 when&nbsp;Andre Rerekura&nbsp;was on a Virgin Airlines flight from Broome to Perth. Before the plane took off, a passenger alerted the crew to a snake on board, sparking panic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"They pretty much shut the whole plane down and everyone was going to get disembarked and sent off the plane, which we weren't that keen on because everyone wanted to go home. It was a little bit of a weird story to think it was true, to hear that there was a snake on the plane, so I don't think a lot of people believed it," he told <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-21/snakes-on-a-plane-disrupts-virgin-flight/104631330">ABC News.</a></em></p>

<p>Mr Rerekura said a lady behind him screamed as it slithered by before ending up next to his foot. Calmly handling the situation, he removed the reptile and took it off the aircraft, ensuring the safety and comfort of fellow passengers.</p>

<p>"As soon as I saw it, I identified it pretty easily... so I knew it was safe [and] I knew it was just scared and super shy," he explained, adding that the snake was a Stimson's python.</p>

<p>His quick thinking and bravery didn't go unnoticed. As a token of appreciation, the airline offered him a complimentary drink during the flight, while passengers cheered for him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I think everyone was relieved that they didn't have to get off the plane and then a lot of people were happy that the snake was safe. The staff were awesome, they gave me a complimentary drink, and I had a soda water," he added. After a slight delay of 20 minutes, the plane took off and safely landed in Perth a few hours later.</p>

<p>Notably, Stimson's pythons are non-venomous and harmless and are commonly found in northern Australia, particularly during the warmer summer months.</p>

<p>Broome International Airport chief executive Craig Shaw told <em>ABC </em>he was "uncertain how the reptile came to be on board" and directed enquiries to the airline.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A building contractor in the Sicilian town of Altofonte discovered a severed horse head and a cow quartered with its bloodied dead calf on his property. The incident is being investigated as a possible mafia threat, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/23/europe/horse-head-mafia-threat-italy-intl/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">CNN</a> reported.</p>

<p>The grisly scene was found on the contractor's land near Palermo, with the animals kept on an adjacent property. Police have confirmed the discovery, describing it as deeply unsettling and similar to the 1972 film&nbsp;<em>The Godfather,</em> in which a character wakes up to find a decapitated horse's head in his bed.</p>

<p>The contractor, whose identity is being withheld for safety reasons, reported to authorities that he had not previously received any threats. He frequently carries out municipal construction work, but has not been approached by any groups demanding money or favours.</p>

<p>Police are treating the act as a mafia intimidation tactic. The gruesome discovery follows the recent release of 20 mafia members whose sentences expired, and whose potential for retaliation may be a factor, according to Maurizio de Lucia, the head of the Anti-Mafia Directorate.</p>

<p>Altofonte's mayor, Angela De Lucia, called the incident "barbaric" and said it "seems to take us back to the Middle Ages," as per CNN.</p>

<p>The use of dead animals as a form of intimidation has a long history in Sicily, where mafia groups like Cosa Nostra have used such tactics for decades. In 2023, similar incidents included a severed pig's head being found at a local police station and a business contractor discovering a goat's head on his garden gate.</p>

<p>Sicilian organised crime has deep roots, with Cosa Nostra's violent history reaching its peak in 1992, when two anti-mafia judges were assassinated. In recent years, however, mafia groups have shifted their focus from violence to infiltrating legitimate businesses, such as construction and sanitation. Extortion and protection money, known as "pizzo," continue to be common mafia activities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India has reiterated that it stands for freedom of navigation and overflight, unimpeded lawful commerce and adherence to international law for peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific. Speaking at the 11th ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting-Plus Forum at Vientiane, Laos, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said that the upcoming code of conduct for the regulation of maritime activity in the South China Sea needs to be consistent with international law.</p>

<p>The Defence Minister said the code should not prejudice the legitimate rights and interests of nations which are not party to these deliberations. "The code should be fully consistent with international law, in particular the UN Convention Law of Sea 1982," he added.</p>

<p>Singh said, "India believes that genuine, long-term solutions to global problems can only be achieved when nations engage constructively, respecting each other's perspectives and working toward shared goals in the spirit of cooperation."</p>

<p>Earlier this year, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, while addressing the 14th East Asia Summit Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Laos, also asserted that a "substantive and effective" code of conduct should be in place that is "consistent with international law and should not prejudice legitimate rights and interest of nations not party to the discussions". He also stressed that the Sea Lines of Communication (SLOC) passing through the South China Sea are crucial for the peace and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific Region.</p>

<h2><strong>DISPUTE ON SOUTH CHINA SEA</strong></h2>

<p>The South China Sea is a semi-enclosed water channel bordered on the west by Vietnam, on the east by the Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei Darussalam, on the south by Indonesia and Malaysia, and the north by China and Taiwan. It is located on the major international shipping route between the Indian Ocean and northeast Asia, including the ports of Korea, China, Russia and Japan, and approximately USD 5.3 trillion worth of goods transit through the South China Sea annually, according to a report by China Power.</p>

<p>The South China Sea also houses rich fishing grounds and over half of the world's fishing vessels operate in this area, according to a report by BBC. Countries surrounding the water body have wrestled over control of the territory with competing claims for centuries, but the tension has grown in recent years.</p>

<p>Countries have staked claims on islands and various zones in the sea, such as the Paracels and the Spratlys. Though largely uninhabited, the Paracels and the Spratlys may have reserves of natural resources around them.</p>

<h3><strong>CHINA's CLAIM</strong></h3>

<p>Of all the countries surrounding the South China Sea, China reportedly claims sovereignty over the largest portion of the territory and demarcates it by its so-called "nine-dash line". In 1947, Beijing issued a map detailing its claims and insisted its right to the area goes back centuries to when the Paracel and Spratly island chains were regarded as integral parts of the Chinese nation. The nine-dash line that appears on Chinese maps encompassing almost the entirety of the South China Sea includes no coordinates, as per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13748349" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">BBC</a> report.</p>

<p>Taiwan mirrors these claims and says South China Sea islands are part of the territory of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3><strong>DISPUTE ON CHINA's CLAIM</strong></h3>

<p>Vietnam disputes Beijing's account and says China had never claimed sovereignty over the islands before the 1940s. Accounting to Vietnam, both the Paracels and the Spratlys have been actively ruled by it since the 17th Century. It also claims to have documents to prove it.</p>

<p>The Philippines is also another major claimant to the area. The Philippines invokes its geographical proximity to the Spratly Islands as the main basis of its claim. The Philippines also lay claim to the Scarborough Shoal, which China calls its territory.</p>

<p>Malaysia and Brunei also lay claim to parts of the South China Sea that fall within their economic exclusion zones, as defined by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, or UNCLOS.</p>

<h3><strong>UN VERDICT AND CODE OF CONDUCT</strong></h3>

<p>In 2013, The Philippines turned to legal arbitration against China's claims over the South China Sea. On July 12, 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague ruled overwhelmingly in favour of the Philippines, determining that major elements of China's claims, including its nine-dash line, and recent land reclamation activities-were unlawful. The UN verdict was based on UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) - regarded as the global constitution for the seas signed by 162 nations including China.</p>

<p>Predictably, China refused to accept a UN verdict, maintaining it was "null and void."</p>

<p>Now, a "code of conduct" (COC) in the South China Sea is being discussed among six countries - the Philippines, China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei - that are party to the maritime boundary dispute.</p>

<p>Burma, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Singapore, and Thailand, which are also part of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) along with other member countries --Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Philippines, and Vietnam-- are part of the negotiations for the code.</p>

<p>Negotiations over a COC have waxed and waned for two decades. Last July, in a bid to expedite an agreement, a three-year deadline was agreed to conclude the talks, according to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/code-conduct-won-t-solve-south-china-sea-crisis" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">The Interpreter</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>WORLD's STAKE IN OUTCOME</strong></h3>

<p>The COC on the South China Sea will affect India and several other countries like the US, the UK, Japan and Australia. China's claims threaten sea lines of communication (SLOCs), which are important maritime passages that facilitate trade and the movement of naval forces.</p>

<p>To protect its political, security, and economic interests in the region, the United States has challenged China's assertive territorial claims and land reclamation efforts by conducting freedom of navigation operations and bolstering support for Southeast Asian partners.</p>

<p>To counter China's assertive presence, Japan has also sold military ships and equipment to the Philippines and Vietnam to improve their maritime security capacity and to deter Chinese aggression.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[As the marine environment deteriorates due to climate change and overfishing, many Bajau Laut families are abandoning their houseboats in favour of stilt houses.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For centuries, the Bajau Laut, an indigenous seafaring community in Southeast Asia, have lived a semi-nomadic lifestyle, relying on the ocean for sustenance and income. But with environmental pressures mounting, their traditional way of life is rapidly disappearing, leaving them to adapt to new realities on land.</p>

<p>Bilkuin Jimi Salih, a 20-year-old member of the Bajau Laut, reflects on his upbringing. Born on a houseboat known as a lepa off the coast of Semporna in Malaysian Borneo, Mr Salih learned to dive at a young age, a skill passed down through generations. "One of our specialties is that, because we live on the sea and we're always in the sea, we can dive in the water for a long time," he explained to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/climate/malaysia-bajau-indigenous-sea-nomads-land-c2e-spc/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">CNN</a>. "We learn by observing, and from there, we develop our own technique."</p>

<p>The Bajau Laut community is biologically adapted to life at sea, with larger spleens that help them hold their breath for extended periods, allowing them to dive for sea cucumbers, abalone, and spider conches. However, overfishing and environmental degradation are making it increasingly difficult to survive through traditional fishing practices. "We could easily get a bucket of abalone and sea cucumbers before, but now there's hardly any," said Mr Salih. "Other high-value fish are also available less. So for us to rely on the sea as a source of living is now very difficult, very challenging."</p>

<p>As the marine environment deteriorates due to climate change and overfishing, many Bajau Laut families, like Mr Salih's, are abandoning their houseboats in favour of stilt houses. The cost and complexity of maintaining lepas have made them unaffordable for many, and the shift to more sedentary living has reduced the community's ability to adapt. "We are less adaptable now, relying more on a specific island or reef," Mr Salih added.</p>

<p>The region, once a haven for marine life, has become increasingly vulnerable. Rising sea surface temperatures, ocean acidification, and coral bleaching are damaging fish habitats, worsening the challenges faced by coastal communities. "Coastal communities living by the sea are highly vulnerable to climate change phenomena," said Adzmin Fatta, programme manager at Reef Check Malaysia. "The worsening marine environment and scarcity of fish has made many low-income fishers desperate."</p>

<p>Illegal fishing practices, such as blast fishing and cyanide fishing, are common in the region as fish stocks dwindle. These methods not only harm the fish population but also cause significant damage to coral reefs. "Fish bombing is cheap and easy," said Mr Fatta. "A fish bomb costs around 15 Malaysian ringgit (Rs 665) but could provide 2,000-to-3,000-ringgit worth of fish (Rs 88,700 to Rs 1,33,050)."</p>

<p>Plastic pollution is another growing problem, with discarded water bottles, crisp packets, and flip-flops frequently spotted in the water. Robin Philippo, director of the Tropical Research and Conservation Centre (TRACC), believes tourism is largely to blame for the increasing waste. "The carrying capacity of Semporna compared to the waste that is being produced, I think that's the unsustainable factor," he explained.</p>

<p>Despite these challenges, the Bajau Laut community remains largely stateless, with many living in legal limbo without access to basic services like healthcare, education, and utilities. An estimated 28,000 Bajau Laut live in Sabah, and 78 percent of them are undocumented. This lack of formal citizenship excludes them from many conservation efforts, as their traditional knowledge is often undervalued.</p>

<p>Adzmin Fatta believes that one of the barriers to effective conservation is the "unequal opportunities" faced by the Bajau Laut. "Without formal citizenship, they often don't see themselves as having a role in conservation efforts," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New York Public Library employee, weighing 163 kg, has filed a lawsuit seeking $4.6 million in damages, alleging that being forced to work at an inadequately sized desk caused him physical and emotional trauma. William Martin, a 6-foot-2 library information assistant, claimed the desk at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Library on Fifth Avenue was too small for his frame.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a lawsuit filed in Brooklyn Federal Court, he described the first-floor service desk as "crampy" due to its swaying countertop with a 12-inch drop. “All I sought was just a service desk with the appropriate accommodation given my physical attributes,” Mr Martin said in his legal filing, as per the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/23/us-news/360-pound-library-worker-sues-for-4-6-million-over-too-small-desk/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">NY Post</a>.</p>

<p>Mr Martin's issues began in October 2021 when he was assigned to the desk in question. After raising concerns, his union intervened and arranged his reassignment to other desks. However, in June 2023, a new assistant director reportedly reassigned him to the same problematic desk.</p>

<p>The lawsuit claims this decision was “detrimental to his health and safety” and alleges that the director increased Mr Martin's desk assignments to intimidate him.</p>

<p>Mr Martin was later accused of sleeping on the job, which he denied, calling it a “false” claim. The suspension that followed led him to request a transfer and medical leave for anxiety and depression.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The lawsuit claims the emotional toll on Mr Martin has been severe. He reportedly “trembles” at the thought of returning to work, and his mental health has “been damaged to such an extent” that he can no longer function in his role.</p>

<p>Martin, who once ran a blog titled “300lbsofsportsknowledge,” is now asking the court to compel the library to grant his leave request and approve the monetary compensation.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the New York Public Library dismissed the lawsuit as “without merit,” saying, “We take employee accommodations and concerns with utmost seriousness and are dedicated to treating our staff across the Library with fairness and respect.”</p>

<p>The case remains ongoing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[After 24 years of legal battles spanning continents, the 'cursed' Bahia Emerald - a 397 kg pound gemstone reputed to be the world's largest - is finally set to return to Brazil.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After 24 years of legal battles spanning continents, the 'cursed' Bahia Emerald - a 397 kg pound gemstone reputed to be the world's largest - is finally set to return to Brazil. US District Judge Reggie B Walton ruled on Thursday that the emerald, worth an estimated $1 billion, should be sent back to its homeland, brushing aside claims from American investors who had long argued for its ownership.</p>

<p>"We're very happy with the decision," Boni de Moraes Soares, a federal prosecutor from Brazil, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/11/22/bahia-emerald-brazil/" rel="noindex,nofollow">The Washington Post.</a> "We're closer than ever to bringing the Bahia emerald back to the Brazilian people."</p>

<p>The story of the emerald dates back to 2001, when it was illegally mined from Brazil and smuggled into the US. Its journey has since seen accusations of fraud, criminal convictions, and ownership disputes, with the gemstone ultimately landing in the custody of the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, where it has languished for more than 15 years.</p>

<p>Considered 'cursed' due to its troubled history, the emerald survived a panther attack during its transport and flooding from Hurricane Katrina. Ownership battles raged for over a decade, with the Brazilian government and multiple parties fighting for control. Rumours also linked the emerald to criminal activities, including ties to the Brazilian Mafia and a questionable $197 million deal with Bernie Madoff.</p>

<p>Brazil has long claimed the emerald as a national treasure, saying that it was illicitly removed and calling for its return under a Brazilian court's forfeiture order. The US government, working under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, supported Brazil's efforts, leading to the decisive ruling by Judge Walton.</p>

<p>"The Court has concluded that the Intervenors' positions are insufficient to prohibit the return of the Emerald to Brazil," the judge wrote, referencing the claims of American gem speculators. "The Court must therefore enforce the Brazilian Forfeiture Judgment of the Bahia Emerald."</p>

<p>Among those contesting the ruling was Kit Morrison, an Idaho businessman who had invested $1.3 million in the emerald's sale. While he accepted the decision, Mr Morrison had no bitterness. "I don't have any feeling of defeat or loss," he said. "When you are an investor and entrepreneur, you do everything you can to protect, preserve, and improve the investment and opportunity. However, you cannot control the things that are out of your control."</p>

<p>Brazil is now ready to welcome the colossal gemstone back, likely to be displayed in a museum.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One-star Ginza Kitafuku in Tokyo serves the world's most expensive Michelin tasting menu at $2,130. While the visitors are served the best-tasting snow crab at the establishment, they must take off their shoes and sit on the floor. Diners must pay $2,130 per person for the restaurant's most expensive dish, made entirely of a snow crab so beloved by the Japanese royal family that it has its museum, reported the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/23/lifestyle/the-most-expensive-michelin-starred-restaurant-isnt-in-paris/" rel="noindex,nofollow">New York Post.</a></p>

<p>Visitors may watch the chef at Ginza Kitafuku cook a live crab in front of them before it is served. If this sight makes you uncomfortable, you might consider reserving on the sixth floor in a separate room. For $258, the restaurant serves a red king crab feast for customers on a tighter budget. According to a list compiled by food publication Chef's Pencil, Ginza Kitafuku is the most expensive Michelin-starred restaurant in the world in 2024.</p>

<p>The second most expensive restaurant on the list is Shanghai's three-star Ultraviolet by Paul Pairet. A meal at the establishment costs an astounding $1,230. The restaurant offers a "theatrical, multi-sensory dining experience featuring meticulously crafted dishes that blend French techniques with global influences," according to the outlet, which described it as "a captivating fusion of gastronomy and cutting-edge visual technology."</p>

<p>Third place goes to New York, where Caviar Russe on Madison Avenue has the priciest Michelin-starred tasting meal in the country. Here, the guests can taste an 11-course meal focused on caviar for $950.</p>

<p>Azabu Kadowaki in Tokyo and Masa in New York are two other eateries on the list. With a dinner that cost more than $950, Masa was the first restaurant in the USA to receive a Michelin star.</p>

<p>Other notable locations are Guy Savoy in Paris, Quince in San Francisco, and Alchemist in Copenhagen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's capital was put under a security lockdown on Sunday ahead of protests by supporters of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan calling for his release.</p>

<p>Highways leading to Islamabad through which supporters of Khan, led by members of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, are expected to approach the city and gather near the parliament, have been blocked.</p>

<p>Most major roads of the city have also been blocked by the government with shipping containers and large contingents of police and paramilitary personnel have been deployed in riot gear, while mobile phone services have been suspended.</p>

<p>Gatherings of any sort have been banned under legal provisions, the Islamabad police said in a statement.</p>

<p>Global internet watchdog NetBlocks said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that live metrics showed WhatsApp messaging services had been restricted ahead of the protests.</p>

<p>A key Khan aid, Ali Amin Gandapur, who is the chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and is expected to lead the largest convoy into Islamabad, called on people to gather near the entrance of the city's red zone, known as "D Chowk".</p>

<p>Islamabad's red zone houses the country's parliament building, important government installations, as well as embassies and foreign institutions' offices.</p>

<p>"Khan has called on us to remain there till all our demands are met," he said in a video message on Saturday.</p>

<p>The PTI's demands include the release of all its leaders, including Khan, as well as the resignation of the current government due to what it says was a rigged election this year.</p>

<p>Khan has been in jail since August last year and, since being voted out of power by parliament in 2022, faces a number of charges ranging from corruption to instigation of violence.</p>

<p>He and his party deny all the charges.</p>

<p>"These constant protests are destroying the economy and creating instability ... we want the political leadership to sit together and resolve these matters," Muhammad Asif, 35, a resident of Islamabad said in front of a closed market.</p>

<p>The last protest in Islamabad by PTI in early October turned violent with one policeman killed, dozens of security personnel injured and protesters arrested. Both sides accused the other of instigating the clashes.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces legal perils at home and abroad that point to a turbulent future for the Israeli leader and could influence the wars in Gaza and Lebanon, analysts and officials say.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces legal perils at home and abroad that point to a turbulent future for the Israeli leader and could influence the wars in Gaza and Lebanon, analysts and officials say.</p>

<p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) stunned Israel on Thursday by issuing arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his former defence chief Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the 13-month-old Gaza conflict.</p>

<p>The bombshell came less than two weeks before Netanyahu is due to testify in a corruption trial that has dogged him for years and could end his political career if he is found guilty. He has denied any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>While the domestic bribery trial has polarised public opinion, the prime minister has received widespread support from across the political spectrum following the ICC move, giving him a boost in troubled times.</p>

<p>Netanyahu has denounced the court's decision as antisemitic and denied charges that he and Gallant targeted Gazan civilians and deliberately starved them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Israelis get really annoyed if they think the world is against them and rally around their leader, even if he has faced a lot of criticism," said Yonatan Freeman, an international relations expert at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>"So anyone expecting that the ICC ruling will end this government, and what they see as a flawed (war) policy, is going to get the opposite," he added.</p>

<p>A senior diplomat said one initial consequence was that Israel might be less likely to reach a rapid ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon or secure a deal to bring back hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>"This terrible decision has ... badly harmed the chances of a deal in Lebanon and future negotiations on the issue of the hostages," said Ofir Akunis, Israel's consul general in New York.</p>

<p>"Terrible damage has been done because these organisations like Hezbollah and Hamas ... have received backing from the ICC and thus they are likely to make the price higher because they have the support of the ICC," he told Reuters.</p>

<p>While Hamas welcomed the ICC decision, there has been no indication that either it or Hezbollah see this as a chance to put pressure on Israel, which has inflicted huge losses on both groups over the past year, as well as on civilian populations.</p>

<h2><strong>In The Dock</strong></h2>

<p>The ICC warrants highlight the disconnect between the way the war is viewed here and how it is seen by many abroad, with Israelis focused on their own losses and convinced the nation's army has sought to minimise civilian casualties.</p>

<p>Michael Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States, said the ICC move would likely harden resolve and give the war cabinet licence to hit Gaza and Lebanon harder still.</p>

<p>"There's a strong strand of Israeli feeling that runs deep, which says 'if we're being condemned for what we are doing, we might just as well go full gas'," he told Reuters.</p>

<p>While Netanyahu has received wide support at home over the ICC action, the same is not true of the domestic graft case, where he is accused of bribery, breach of trust and fraud.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The trial opened in 2020 and Netanyahu is finally scheduled to take the stand next month after the court rejected his latest request to delay testimony on the grounds that he had been too busy overseeing the war to prepare his defence.</p>

<p>He was due to give evidence last year but the date was put back because of the war. His critics have accused him of prolonging the Gaza conflict to delay judgment day and remain in power, which he denies.</p>

<p>Always a divisive figure in Israel, public trust in Netanyahu fell sharply in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas assault on southern Israel that caught his government off guard, cost around 1,200 lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent campaign has killed more than 44,000 people and displaced nearly all Gaza's population at least once, triggering a humanitarian catastrophe, according to Gaza officials.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The prime minister has refused advice from the state attorney general to set up an independent commission into what went wrong and Israel's subsequent conduct of the war.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He is instead looking to establish an inquiry made up only of politicians, which critics say would not provide the sort of accountability demanded by the ICC.</p>

<p>Popular Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth said the failure to order an independent investigation had prodded the ICC into action. "Netanyahu preferred to take the risk of arrest warrants, just as long as he did not have to form such a commission," it wrote on Friday.</p>

<h2><strong>Arrest Threat</strong></h2>

<p>The prime minister faces a difficult future living under the shadow of an ICC warrant, joining the ranks of only a few leaders to have suffered similar humiliation, including Libya's Muammar Gaddafi and Serbia's Slobodan Milosevic.</p>

<p>It also means he risks arrest if he travels to any of the court's 124 signatory states, including most of Europe.</p>

<p>One place he can safely visit is the United States, which is not a member of the ICC, and Israeli leaders hope U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will bring pressure to bear by imposing sanctions on ICC officials.</p>

<p>Mike Waltz, Trump's nominee for national security advisor, has already promised tough action: "You can expect a strong response to the antisemitic bias of the ICC &amp; UN come January,” he wrote on X on Friday.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Israeli officials are talking to their counterparts in Western capitals, urging them to ignore the arrest warrants, as Hungary has already promised to do.</p>

<p>However, the charges are not going to disappear soon, if at all, meaning fellow leaders will be increasingly reluctant to have relations with Netanyahu, said Yuval Shany, a senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute.</p>

<p>"In a very direct sense, there is going to be more isolation for the Israeli state going forward," he told Reuters.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[This "cuffing season" has always been about finding a relationship for the winter, but in this case, it's not about genuine connection.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">As we approach Christmas, the cold weather brings along the rise of a peculiar dating trend: "sledging". Sledging refers to Gen Z singletons intentionally dragging someone along through the winter season, delaying a breakup to avoid being single during the coldest months of the year.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This "cuffing season" has always been about finding a relationship for the winter, but in this case, it's not about genuine connection. Instead, "sledgers" continue to date someone even though they aren't romantically interested, simply to avoid being alone during the chilly season.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Claire Rénier, a romance expert from the dating app Happn, warned Gen Z about this toxic dating <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/bizarre-make-up-trend-involving-hot-melted-glue-goes-viral-in-japan-7085805">trend</a>, reported the<a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/22/lifestyle/toxic-dating-trend-sledging-is-a-giant-red-flag-gen-z-look-out/" rel="nofollow noindex" target="_blank"> New York Post.</a> He added, “Gen Z should look out for signs that they're being ‘sledged. This can be toxic and a red flag. It plays with people's emotions and fosters short-term satisfaction.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to a survey conducted by Happn involving over 600 daters, 15% of Zoomers routinely string along their seasonal partners for sex, companionship, or to avoid those annoying "Why are you still single?" questions from nosy family members during the holiday season, the report added.</p>

<p dir="ltr">A shocking 25% of sledgers decide to end their relationship after Christmas as early as August, while 75% decide to do so in November.</p>

<p dir="ltr">What is the main reason for "sledging" someone during the winter season? 50% of sledgers stated that they wanted a companion to cuddle with in the winter, while 60% said that they wanted a partner with whom they could have sex. 40% claimed they wanted to avoid feeling lonely.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“People shouldn't be treated this way in what should be a loving and trusting relationship,” said Claire Renier. “Young people should find more authentic connections with people with shared locations and hobbies. This way they can find partners that are genuinely interested in them, and sustain a relationship to last beyond just the winter.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Israeli man who went missing in the United Arab Emirates has been found murdered, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said on Sunday, denouncing his death as a "heinous antisemitic terrorist act".</p>

<p>Zvi Kogan, a rabbi who worked in the UAE for an Orthodox Jewish group called Chabad, vanished on Thursday.</p>

<p>"The state of Israel will use all means at its disposal to bring the criminals responsible for his death to justice," the prime minister's statement said.</p>

<p>The UAE foreign ministry did not immediately comment on news the body of Kogan, who also held joint Moldovan nationality, had been discovered.</p>

<p>Chabad seeks to build links with non-affiliated and secular Jews or other sects of Judaism. The group's branch in the UAE supports thousands of Jewish visitors and residents, according to its website.</p>

<p>Israeli authorities reissued their recommendation against all non-essential travel to the UAE and said visitors currently there should minimize movement and remain in secure areas.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

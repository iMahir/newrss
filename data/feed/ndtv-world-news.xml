       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Singapore's Indian-origin former transport minister S Iswaran was handed a one-year jail sentence on Thursday after he pleaded guilty to five charges relating to corruption and blocking of justice in the High Court on September 24.</p>

<p>The sentence is more than the six to seven months asked for by the prosecution, which Justice Hoong considers "manifestly inadequate".</p>

<p>The higher the office held by the offender as a public servant, the higher his level of culpability, said Justice Hoong.</p>

<p>The former minister is the first person to be prosecuted under Section 165 in post-independent Singapore, reported The Straits Times.</p>

<p>Judge Vincent Hoong turns to the mitigating factors that the defence has highlighted, including Iswaran's public service to Singapore, his voluntary disgorgement to the benefits and his early plea of guilt.</p>

<p>Given that the rest of the 30 charges that were taken into consideration bear similarities with the proceeded charges where he received gifts, the judge said that these charges revealed the scale and repetition of offending over a significant period of time. This is a culpability-increasing factor, says Judge Hoong.</p>

<p>His public service and contributions to Singapore were at most a neutral factor, adds the judge.</p>

<p>Justice Hoong says he has difficulty believing that Iswaran was remorseful, as the latter had made public statements rejecting the charges as false.</p>

<p>He added that he is unable to accept the defence's submissions. The accused is only eligible for a sentencing discount of up to 10 per cent.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Next week's Nobel Prize announcements will crown achievements that made the world a better place, a glimmer of optimism amid a spiralling Middle East conflict, war in Ukraine, famine in Sudan and a collapsing climate.</p>

<p>The prize winners will be announced between October 7 and 14.</p>

<p>For the Peace Prize, the most prestigious of the six Nobels, experts say it is harder than ever to predict the Norwegian Nobel Committee's pick, to be revealed on October 11.</p>

<p>Swedish philanthropist Alfred Nobel created the prizes in his 1895 will, stipulating that they go to those who have "conferred the greatest benefit on humankind".</p>

<p>But given the bleak state of world affairs, perhaps no one should get the Peace Prize this year, suggested Dan Smith, the head of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.</p>

<p>"Maybe this is the time to say, 'Yes, many people are working very hard, but it's not getting there and we need more people and world leaders to wake up and realise that we are in an extremely dangerous situation,'" he said.</p>

<p>"We have now over 50 armed conflicts around the world. The lethality of those armed conflicts has increased dramatically in the past two decades," he said.</p>

<p><strong>'A worthy candidate'</strong></p>

<p>Not awarding a Peace Prize would be viewed as an acknowledgement of failure by the award committee, and is therefore deemed unlikely.</p>

<p>"I'm confident there will be a worthy candidate for the Peace Prize this year as well," the secretary of the committee, Olav Njolstad, told AFP.</p>

<p>Last year, the award went to jailed Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran.</p>

<p>A total of 286 nominations are known to have been submitted for the Peace Prize this year, though the committee keeps the names sealed for 50 years.</p>

<p>Those entitled to nominate are however allowed to reveal their picks.</p>

<p>Among those known to be on the list are some actors involved in the Middle East, such as the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA; Palestinian human rights group Al-Haq; its Israeli counterpart B'Tselem and the International Court of Justice.</p>

<p>Given the existential risks to humanity posed by weapons systems that can operate autonomously without human control, several Nobel-watchers have cited the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots as a possible laureate.</p>

<p>The Nobel Prize in Literature, to be announced on October 10, likewise generates frenzied speculation every year.</p>

<p>Several pundits believe Chinese author Can Xue will be the Swedish Academy's choice this year -- and she has the lowest odds on several betting sites.</p>

<p>An avant-garde fiction writer often likened to Kafka, her experimental style flips between utopia and dystopia and transforms the mundane into the surreal.</p>

<p>"I think it will be a woman from a language zone outside Europe," Bjorn Wiman, culture editor at Sweden's newspaper of record Dagens Nyheter, told AFP.</p>

<p>The last Chinese author to win was Mo Yan in 2012.</p>

<p><strong>Surprise name for literature?</strong></p>

<p>With no public shortlist, it is always difficult to predict which way the 18-member Swedish Academy is leaning.</p>

<p>Names making the rounds in Stockholm's literary circles include Australian novelist Gerald Murnane, Britain's Salman Rushdie, Antiguan-American writer Jamaica Kincaid, Canadian poet Anne Carson, Hungary's Laszlo Krasznahorkai, Mircea Cartarescu of Romania, Kenya's Ngugi wa Thiong'o and Japan's Haruki Murakami.</p>

<p>Last year, Norwegian playwright Jon Fosse took home the honour.</p>

<p>The Academy often shines a spotlight on relatively unknown writers.</p>

<p>"I think they've gone to great pains to find some writer that will catch the culture commentariat with their pants down," Wiman said.</p>

<p>The Nobel season kicks off on Monday with the Prize in Physiology or Medicine.</p>

<p>Analytics group Clarivate, which monitors potential science laureates, speculated that award could go to research on the genetics of lipid metabolism, which has led to new drugs to treat cardiovascular diseases.</p>

<p>Another candidate could be studies of the basal ganglia, which are parts of the brain associated with motor control and emotions.</p>

<p>Or the prize could go to the discovery of genomic imprinting, which has increased our understanding of epigenetics and mammalian development.</p>

<p>Last year, the Prize in Physiology or Medicine went to researchers Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman for their work on messenger RNA technology that paved the way for groundbreaking Covid-19 vaccines.</p>

<p>The Prize in Physics follows on Tuesday ahead of Wednesday's Prize in Chemistry. The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences then wraps up the 2024 Nobel season on Monday, October 14.</p>

<p>This year's laureates will take home the prized sum of 11 million kronor ($1 million) per discipline, to be shared if there is more than one winner.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A senior adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris met American Muslim and Arab leaders on Wednesday as Harris' presidential campaign seeks to win back voters angry at US support for Israel's wars in Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

<p>Harris' national security adviser, Phil Gordan, told the community leaders in the virtual meeting that the administration supports a ceasefire in Gaza, diplomacy in Lebanon and stability in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the vice president's office said.</p>

<p>Ali Dagher, a Lebanese-American attorney and community leader, said the outreach from Harris' office was not enough. "It's too little, too late," said Dagher, who did not participate in the meeting.</p>

<p>Harris, a Democrat, faces Republican former President Donald Trump on Nov. 5 in what polls show to be a tight presidential race.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden won most of the 2020 Muslim and Arab votes, but their backing of Democrats has fallen sharply during nearly a year that Israel has been fighting Hamas in Gaza. Activists say Biden and Harris have done too little to stop Israel's military campaign in the Palestinian enclave.</p>

<p>The Israeli military offensive in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, Palestinian health authorities say. Israel was responding to an Oct. 7, 2023 incursion by Hamas gunmen, who Israel says killed around 1,200 people and abducted about 250 hostages. Gaza has suffered a humanitarian crisis with nearly all its 2 million people displaced and widespread hunger in the enclave.</p>

<p>In Lebanon, more than 1,900 people have been killed and 9,000 wounded during almost a year of cross-border fighting between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah, with most of the deaths in the past two weeks, according to Lebanese government statistics.</p>

<p>Emgage, a Muslim-American advocacy group, recently endorsed Harris, while others have urged supporters to shun her. While they have not supported Trump, their choice not to vote or to vote for third-party candidates could hurt Harris, analysts say.</p>

<p>US support for Israel has led to large protests, especially in hotly contested swing states like Michigan that could decide the election. Harris has offered no substantive policy differences on Israel from Biden, who stepped aside as presidential candidate in July.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Miyazaki Airport in southwestern Japan resumed operations Thursday morning, a day after its closure due to the explosion of a wartime dud shell that damaged a section of its taxiway, local media reported.</p>

<p>A <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/japan-airport-shut-after-world-war-ii-bomb-explodes-near-runway-87-flights-cancelled-6701776">Japan Airlines plane to Fukuoka</a> departed at around 7:40 a.m. local time in the first flight since the airport was shut for safety checks on Wednesday, Xinhua news agency reported, citing Kyodo News.</p>

<p>The transport ministry office at Miyazaki Airport said Wednesday that a blast was heard on a taxiway shortly before 8 a.m. local time as air traffic controllers saw smoke rising from the site.</p>

<p>The airport office said the explosion created an oval-shaped hole measuring about 7 meters long, 4 meters wide and 1 meter deep on asphalt pavement near the taxiway.</p>

<p>No one was injured and a total of 87 flights to and from the airport were cancelled as of 2 p.m. local time as the runway was closed for the day.</p>

<p>Japan's Self-Defense Forces and authorities investigating the site have determined that the explosion was from a 500-pound that was dropped during World War II.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are entering the final one-month sprint to the most dramatic US presidential election in modern history, with both candidates warning the fate of a divided nation hangs on a result that is still too close to call.</p>

<p>The 2024 race has seen more twists than a Hollywood blockbuster, from the vice president's shock replacement of Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee, to the Republican former president riding out two assassination attempts as he eyes a sensational comeback to the White House.</p>

<p>Now the United States is bracing for a cliffhanger ending with Trump, 78, and Harris, 59, neck-and-neck in the polls -- and the Republican warning darkly of a repeat of the chaos that followed the 2020 election if he does not win this time around.</p>

<p>The world is meanwhile waiting with bated breath to see who ends up in the Oval Office, at a time when the Middle East slips ever closer to all-out war and Ukraine's fight for survival against Russia hinges on the US support that Trump has previously criticized.</p>

<p>"This is a tremendously important election," Peter Loge, director of George Washington University's School of Media and Public Affairs, told AFP.</p>

<p>"They (Trump and Harris) have both cast it in apocalyptic terms."</p>

<p><strong>Stark contrast -</strong></p>

<p>One thing is for sure: the next four weeks will see Harris and Trump -- along with their running mates, Democratic Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Republican Ohio Senator J.D. Vance -- relentlessly hitting the campaign trail.</p>

<p>America's idiosyncratic electoral college means they will end up fighting for a few thousand votes in seven key swing states that are expected to decide the election -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>And as America decides, Harris and Trump will be offering voters two starkly different visions.</p>

<p>With her slogan "We're Not Going Back," Harris promises to turn the page on an era of divisive politics. Trump pledges to "Make America Great Again" as he paints a picture of a dystopian nation that only he can fix.</p>

<p>In Harris, Democrats have a candidate who has smashed glass ceilings as America's first female, Black and South Asian vice president, and who promises to fight for abortion rights and what she calls an "opportunity economy."</p>

<p>But her meteoric rise means her character and policies remain an unknown quantity to many voters.</p>

<p>Trump is the first convicted felon to run for president, but one whose right-wing base laps up his insults of "Comrade Kamala," and his promises to boost the economy and lock up his political opponents.</p>

<p>Above all, he is hoping that the explosive issue of migration will help him win, with the billionaire doubling down on harsh rhetoric accusing migrants of "poisoning" American blood.</p>

<p>"Vice President Harris and Governor Walz are saying the American story is complicated, but we can make this right," said Loge.</p>

<p>Trump meanwhile had a "very compelling story... give the strongman a chance, let him clear the deck, we'll come back to democracy later. The problem is we can never come back to democracy."</p>

<h3><strong>'Pass the torch'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>US voters have also had to get their heads around a completely upended race.</p>

<p>Less than three months ago, they still faced a deeply unpopular rematch between Trump and the 81-year-old Biden for the title of America's oldest president.</p>

<p>Everything changed in the space of 90 stunning minutes as Biden imploded in his debate against Trump, crystallizing years of Democratic fears about his age.</p>

<p>A month later, Biden dropped out, saying it was time to "pass the torch" to Harris.</p>

<p>With dizzying speed, Harris wiped out Trump's lead in the polls, fired up huge rallies and raised piles of cash.</p>

<p>The Republican suddenly found himself facing a much younger -- and female -- candidate.</p>

<p>The turnaround was especially abrupt for Trump, coming just eight days after gunman opened fire at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, wounding the Republican in the ear.</p>

<p>Harris however insists she remains the "underdog" and the polls predict a nail-biting race.</p>

<p>A result could also take days or weeks if there are disputed counts or legal challenges as expected -- meaning the US election cliffhanger could last into January.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Melania Trump writes in her upcoming memoir that a woman has the right to an abortion, The Guardian newspaper reported on Wednesday, while her husband, Donald Trump, backs the ability for US states to restrict the procedure.</p>

<p>"Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body?" Melania Trump writes in her memoir that is due to be published four weeks before the Nov. 5 election, in which her husband faces Democrat Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>"Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life," she was reported as writing in the memoir.</p>

<p>The Guardian said it has obtained a copy of the book, titled "Melania," that is due to be published on Oct. 8. A spokesperson for the former first lady did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.</p>

<p>Donald Trump, a Republican, had previously signaled support for a national ban beyond 15 weeks of pregnancy but in April said political considerations were paramount in the first presidential election since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, ending a nearly 50-year federal right to the procedure.</p>

<p>Trump says abortion laws should be decided by the states and backs exceptions to a ban on abortion in the case of rape, incest and to protect the mother's life.</p>

<p>Polls show the presidential election is a tight race with seven battleground states likely to decide the outcome.</p>

<p>Democrats see abortion rights as a popular issue for Harris to use against Trump. A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted from August 21-28 found a majority of voters, including 34% of Republicans, want the next president to protect or increase abortion access.</p>

<p>“Sadly for the women across America, Mrs. Trump's husband firmly disagrees with her and is the reason that more than one in three American women live under a Trump Abortion Ban that threatens their health, their freedom, and their lives," a Harris campaign spokesperson said in an emailed statement.</p>

<p>Trump takes credit for the Supreme Court overturning the Roe v. Wade decision in 2022, which had protected a right to abortion at up to around 24 to 28 weeks, because justices appointed by Trump swung the vote.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Consulate General of India in Seattle said in a statement that a bust of Mahatma Gandhi was unveiled at the Seattle Centre. In a post on X, India's Consulate in Seattle said, "Gandhi ji Bust adorns iconic Seattle Center! The first bust of Mahatma Gandhi ji was unveiled in Seattle today. Located at base of Space Needle, which receives 12 million visitors annually, Gandhi ji's life and message now resonates in the US Pacific North West."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="und">(2/2) <a href="https://t.co/1bAdqVq6BG">pic.twitter.com/1bAdqVq6BG</a></p>
— India In Seattle (@IndiainSeattle) <a href="https://twitter.com/IndiainSeattle/status/1841620741764342055?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>In a unique addition to the city of Seattle landscape, a bust of Mahatma Gandhi was unveiled today at the iconic Seattle Centre, just below the base of the Space Needle and adjacent to the Chihuly Garden and Glass Museum. The unveiling marks the first installation of Gandhi's bust in a city known for its vibrant cultural landscape, the statement said.</p>

<p>The unveiling ceremony was attended by notable dignitaries, including Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell, Congressman Adam Smith, Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, Lt. Gen. Xavier Brunson, Commander of the US First Corps in Pacific Northwest, and Eddie Rye, Chair of the Martin Luther King-Gandhi Initiative, along with the Consul General of India, Prakash Gupta. It was also attended by eminent members of the Indian American community who offered their respects on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, the statement added.</p>

<p>October 2, which is Gandhi ji's birthday, is also recognised as the International Day of Non-Violence by the United Nations, the statement said. All dignitaries who spoke at the Gandhi Jayanti ceremony underscored the values of Ahimsa (Non-Violence), Satyagraha (truth force), and Sarvodaya (welfare for all) as being the defining need in contemporary times.</p>

<p>The Consulate General of India and the City of Seattle had worked in partnership to identify an appropriate venue for locating the bust of Mahatma Gandhi, and the iconic location of Seattle Centre, which draws more than 12 million visitors each year, was considered appropriate, given its location, accessibility, and commitment to promoting the values of peace and non-violence.</p>

<p>To mark the occasion, Governor of the State of Washington, Jay Inslee, issued an official proclamation acknowledging the Gandhi ji Bust as a lasting tribute to Gandhi's teachings and a powerful reminder of the impact of non-violence in driving change. Another special proclamation was also issued by the King County designating 2nd October as Mahatma Gandhi Day across all 73 cities of the Greater Seattle area, the statement said.</p>

<p>It may be recalled that the first Indian Consulate in Seattle commenced its operations in November 2023 with a consular jurisdiction in the US Pacific Northwest, covering the nine states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Alaska. The installation of the Mahatma Gandhi ji bust in Seattle (Washington) is one in a series of such initiatives that is gradually being implemented across its consular jurisdiction, as per the statement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Israel bombed central Beirut in the early hours of Thursday, killing at least six people, after its forces suffered their deadliest day on the Lebanese front in a year of clashes against Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Israel said it conducted a precise air strike on Beirut. Reuters witnesses reported hearing a massive blast, and a security source said it targeted a building in central Beirut's Bachoura neighbourhood close to parliament, the nearest Israeli strikes have come to Lebanon's seat of government.</p>

<p>At least six people were killed and seven wounded, Lebanese health officials said. A photo being circulated on Lebanese WhatsApp groups, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed a heavily damaged building with its first floor on fire.</p>

<p>Three missiles also hit the southern suburb of Dahiyeh, where Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed last week, and loud explosions were heard, Lebanese security officials said. The southern suburbs came under more than a dozen Israeli strikes on Wednesday.</p>

<p>A day after Iran fired more than 180 missiles into Israel, Israel said on Wednesday eight soldiers were killed in ground combat in south Lebanon as its forces thrust into its northern neighbour.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said regular infantry and armoured units joined its ground operations in Lebanon on Wednesday as Iran's missile attack and Israel's promise of retaliation raised concerns that the oil-producing Middle East could be caught up in a wider conflict.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said its fighters engaged Israeli forces inside Lebanon. The movement reported ground clashes for the first time since Israeli forces pushed over the border on Monday. Hezbollah said it had destroyed three Israeli Merkava tanks with rockets near the border town of Maroun El Ras.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a condolence video, said: "We are at the height of a difficult war against Iran's Axis of Evil, which wants to destroy us.</p>

<p>"This will not happen because we will stand together and with God's help, we will win together," he said.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry said Israeli air raids killed at least 46 people in the south and centre of the country over the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>Iran said on Wednesday its missile volley - its biggest ever assault on Israel - was over barring further provocation, but Israel and the United States promised to hit back hard.</p>

<p>U.S. President Joe Biden said he would not support any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites in response to its ballistic missile attack and urged Israel to act "proportionally" against its regional arch-foe.</p>

<p>Biden joined a call with Group of Seven major power leaders on Wednesday to coordinate a response, including new sanctions against Tehran, the White House said.</p>

<p>G7 leaders voiced "strong concern" over the Middle East crisis but said a diplomatic solution was still viable and a region-wide conflict was in no one's interest, a statement said.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it repelled Israeli forces near several border towns and also fired rockets at military posts inside Israel.</p>

<p>The paramilitary group's media chief Mohammad Afif said those battles were only "the first round" and that Hezbollah had enough fighters, weapons and ammunition to push back Israel.</p>

<p>Israel's addition of infantry and armoured troops from the 36th Division, including the Golani Brigade, the 188th Armoured Brigade and 6th Infantry Brigade, suggested that the operation might expand beyond limited commando raids.</p>

<p>The military has said its incursion is largely aimed at destroying tunnels and other infrastructure on the border and there were no plans for a wider operation targeting the Lebanese capital Beirut to the north or major cities in the south.</p>

<p><strong>1.2 MILLION LEBANESE DISPLACED</strong></p>

<p>Nevertheless, it issued new evacuation orders for around two dozen towns along the southern border, instructing inhabitants to head north of the Awali River, which flows east to west some 60 km (37 miles) north of the Israeli frontier.</p>

<p>More than 1,900 people have been killed and over 9,000 wounded in Lebanon in almost a year of cross-border fighting, with most of the deaths occurring in the past two weeks, according to Lebanese government statistics.</p>

<p>Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said that about 1.2 million Lebanese had been displaced by Israeli attacks.</p>

<p>Malika Joumaa, from Sudan, was forced to take shelter in Saint Joseph's church in Beirut after being forced from her house near Sidon in coastal south Lebanon with her husband and two children.</p>

<p>"It's good that the church offered its help. We were going to stay in the streets; where would we have gone?"</p>

<p>Iran described Tuesday's missile assault as a response to Israeli killings of militant leaders, including Nasrallah, attacks in Lebanon against the group and Israel's war against Palestinian Hamas militants in Gaza.</p>

<p>There were no casualties from the missile onslaught in Israel, but one person was killed in the occupied West Bank.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of two doctors charged in connection with the drug overdose death of "Friends" star Matthew Perry pleaded guilty in a US court on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Mark Chavez, 54, faces up to 10 years in prison after admitting to conspiring to distribute ketamine in the weeks before the actor was found dead in the pool of his Los Angeles home.</p>

<p>Appearing before US District Judge Sherilyn Peace Garnett in a Los Angeles court, the bespectacled Chavez answered a series of questions before entering his plea of "Guilty, your honor."</p>

<p>Perry's lengthy struggles with substance addiction were well-documented, but his death in October 2023 sent shockwaves through the global legions of "Friends" fans.</p>

<p>A criminal investigation was launched soon after an autopsy discovered the actor had high levels of ketamine -- an anesthetic -- in his system.</p>

<p>Two others caught in the dragnet -- a live-in assistant and an acquaintance -- have already pleaded guilty to their charges.</p>

<p>Another doctor -- Salvador Plasencia -- allegedly bought ketamine off Chavez and sold it to the desperate star at hugely inflated prices, musing "I wonder how much this moron will pay."</p>

<p>Jasveen Sangha, the alleged "Ketamine Queen" who supplied drugs to high-end clients and celebrities, is charged with selling Perry the dose that killed him.</p>

<p>Both Plasencia and Sangha face one count of conspiracy to distribute ketamine, as well as a raft of other charges, which they have denied.</p>

<p>Their trials have been set for March, and both face lengthy prison terms if found guilty.</p>

<p>Chavez admitted in his plea agreement to selling ketamine to Plasencia, including doses that he had diverted from his former ketamine clinic.</p>

<p>He was released on $50,000 bail on Wednesday and ordered not to practice medicine. He is expected to be sentenced in April.</p>

<p>Perry played Chandler Bing on the hit TV sitcom from 1994 to 2004 and talked openly of his decades-long battles with addiction.</p>

<p>He had been taking ketamine, a controlled drug, as part of supervised therapy.</p>

<p>Doctors and veterinarians use ketamine as an anesthetic, and researchers have explored its use as a treatment for depression.</p>

<p>Underground users take it for its hallucinogenic effects, though it can be addictive and dangerous for people with underlying health problems.</p>

<p>"Friends," which followed the lives of six New Yorkers navigating adulthood, dating and careers, drew a massive global following and made megastars of previously unknown actors.</p>

<p>Perry's role as the sarcastic man-child Chandler brought him fabulous wealth, but hid a dark struggle with addiction to painkillers and alcohol.</p>

<p>In 2018, he suffered a drug-related burst colon and underwent multiple surgeries.</p>

<p>In his 2022 memoir "Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing," Perry described going through detox dozens of times.</p>

<p>"I have mostly been sober since 2001," he wrote, "save for about sixty or seventy little mishaps."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A U.S. resident from Dearborn, Michigan, has been killed in Lebanon, the American government said on Wednesday, with the man's friend and neighbors saying he died in an Israeli airstrike.</p>

<p>"We are deeply saddened by the death of Kamel Ahmad Jawad and our hearts go out to his family and friends. His death is a tragedy, as are the deaths of many civilians in Lebanon," a White House spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, a State Department spokesperson, when asked about reports of an American's death in Lebanon, said: "It's our understanding that it was a legal permanent resident, not an American citizen (who got killed in Lebanon) but we obviously offer our sincerest condolences to the family."</p>

<p>Israel's recent military campaign in Lebanon has killed hundreds, wounded thousands and displaced over a million. Israel says it is targeting Iran-backed Hezbollah militants.</p>

<p>Jawad was in Lebanon taking care of his elderly mother, according to the Detroit News. His friend Hamzah Raza and local Dearborn groups said on social media that Jawad was killed in an Israeli air strike and called him "one of the kindest and most generous humans."</p>

<p>Reuters was unable to confirm the circumstances of Jawad's death.</p>

<p>Washington has faced criticism in some quarters for its support of its ally Israel, which is also waging a war in Gaza, including in Dearborn where there is a large Arab American population.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump launched a "private criminal effort" to subvert the 2020 US election and should not be shielded by presidential immunity, Special Counsel Jack Smith said in a court filing unsealed on Wednesday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump launched a "private criminal effort" to subvert the 2020 US election and should not be shielded by presidential immunity, Special Counsel Jack Smith said in a court filing unsealed on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Smith, in a 165-page motion arguing for the historic case against Trump to move forward, also provided new evidence of the former president's efforts to overturn the results of the election won by Democrat Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Trump, the Republican candidate in November's White House election, had been scheduled to go on trial in March but the case was frozen while his lawyers argued that a former president should be immune from criminal prosecution.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court ruled in July that an ex-president has broad immunity from prosecution for official acts conducted while in office, but can be pursued for unofficial acts.</p>

<p>Smith, in the filing unsealed by District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is hearing the case, said Trump should not escape prosecution because "at its core, the defendant's scheme was a private criminal effort."</p>

<p>"The defendant asserts that he is immune from prosecution for his criminal scheme to overturn the 2020 presidential election because, he claims, it entailed official conduct," Smith said. "Not so."</p>

<p>"Although the defendant was the incumbent President during the charged conspiracies, his scheme was fundamentally a private one."</p>

<p>Trump, acting as a candidate and not in his official capacity, "resorted to crimes to try to stay in office," the special counsel said.</p>

<p>"With private co-conspirators, the defendant launched a series of increasingly desperate plans to overturn the legitimate election results in seven states that he had lost," he said.</p>

<p>Trump's efforts allegedly included lying to state officials, manufacturing fraudulent electoral votes and seeking to get Vice President Mike Pence to obstruct Congressional certification of Biden's victory.</p>

<p>"When all else had failed," the special counsel said, Trump directed an "angry crowd" of supporters to the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Crazy' -</strong></p>

<p>Smith said there was abundant evidence that Trump knew his claims of electoral fraud were false because close advisers had told him so.</p>

<p>The former president even dismissed some of the most far-fetched fraud claims advanced by his supporters as "crazy," he said.</p>

<p>Smith said Trump -- frustrated with the failure of his election challenges -- engaged "a private attorney who was willing to falsely claim victory and spread knowingly false claims of election fraud."</p>

<p>The attorney, while not named in the filing, appeared to be former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani.</p>

<p>Chutkan has not set a date for a trial but it will not be held before the November 5 election between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Trump is accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding -- the session of Congress that was violently attacked by Trump supporters.</p>

<p>The former president is also accused of seeking to disenfranchise US voters with his false claims that he won the 2020 election.</p>

<p>Trump was convicted in New York in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels.</p>

<p>He also faces charges in Georgia related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic Vice Presidential candidate Tim Walz and his Republican rival JD Vance debated each other on Wednesday as millions of Americans tuned in to the first, and most-likely, only vice-presidential debate before the country votes on November 5.</p>

<p>Unlike the presidential debate, which saw personal attacks by the contenders, the vice presidential debate was calm, structured and surprisingly civil as Mr Vance and Mr Walz engaged in debating mostly policy issues.</p>

<p>Instead of indulging in slander, both candidates stuck to criticism of the opposing presidential candidate. The debate came as a surprise to most, especially after a months-long ugly and divisive election campaign - that saw personal attacks, derogatory language, racist slurs, inflammatory rhetoric and even assassination attempts.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><small><em>The US Vice Presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz was calm, structured and surprisingly civil.</em></small></p>
</div>

<p>Mr Vance and Mr Walz too, have in the past, attacked each other during the election campaign, but for the vice-presidential debate, they struck a respectful tone.</p>

<h2><strong>THE MOST HEATED EXCHANGE OF THE DEBATE</strong></h2>

<p>The debate was cordial and focused mostly on policy matters but saw some tense moments towards the end when a question was asked to the Republican candidate on whether he agrees that Donald Trump lost the 2020 US election.</p>

<p>During the debate Mr Vance, who has said that he would not have voted to certify the result of the previous presidential election, evaded the question when asked if he would challenge this year's vote if Donald Trump loses the election.</p>

<p>To this Mr Walz responded by blaming Donald Trump's false claims of voter fraud which had instigated a mob attack on the US Capitol in January, 2021, which was an attempt to prevent the certification of Joe Biden's election win in 2020.</p>

<p>Blaming Mr Vance, Mr Walz said, "He is still saying he (Tump) didn't lose the election,". He then directly questioned his rival by asking, "Did he (Trump) lose the 2020 election?" When the Republican candidate again dodged the question and went on to accuse Kamala Harris of pursuing online censorship of opposing views, the debate was at its most intense exchange.</p>

<p>"That's a damning non-answer," Mr Walz exclaimed.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Slamming JD Vance, Tim Walz said, &quot;He is still saying he (Tump) didnt lose the 2020 election&quot;." id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/d1ernbhk_tim-walz-vs-jd-vance-us-vice-presidential-debate-reuters_625x300_03_October_24.jpg" title="Slamming JD Vance, Tim Walz said, &quot;He is still saying he (Tump) didnt lose the 2020 election&quot;." /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><small><em>Slamming JD Vance, Tim Walz said, "He is still saying he (Tump) didn't lose the 2020 election".</em></small></p>
</div>

<p>The two candidates, with vastly divergent views on every subject, debated each other on a series of subjects - from inflation to immigration, from taxes to the economy, from abortion to gender issues, the West Asia crisis and even climate change.</p>

<h3><strong>PUNCHES AND COUNTER-PUNCHES</strong></h3>

<p>Picking on each other's presidential candidate and what they considered their vulnerabilities, both Mr Walz and Mr Vance dodged the verbal punches that came their way and responded with equal measure.</p>

<p>Describing Donald Trump as an "unstable" leader who puts the interest of billionaires before commoners, Mr Walz attacked Donald Trump over his policy on immigration. He slammed the former president for "pressuring the Republicans in Congress" to abandon the bipartisan bill on border security.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump had four years to do this. He promised you, Americans, saying how easy it will be."</p>

<p>Mr Vance took a jab at the Democrats over the problem of inflation and economy, and repeatedly questioned Kamala Harris on why she has not done enough to address these important issues in the four years that she was vice-president in the Biden Administration.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Vance and Walz also clashed on pressing global issues, especially the crises in Europe and West Asia." id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/hkhoif44_tim-walz-vs-jd-vance-us-vice-presidential-debate-reuters_625x300_03_October_24.jpg" title="Vance and Walz also clashed on pressing global issues, especially the crises in Europe and West Asia." /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><small><em>Vance and Walz also clashed on pressing global issues, especially the crises in Europe and West Asia.</em></small></p>
</div>

<p>"If Kamala Harris has such great plans for how to address middle-class problems, then she ought to do them now - not when asking for promotion, but in the job the American people gave her 3-1/2 years ago," Mr Vance said.</p>

<p>The two also clashed on pressing global issues, especially the crises in Europe and West Asia. Mr Walz called Donald Trump "too fickle" and "sympathetic" to strongmen like Putin and Netanyahu and said that Trump cannot be trusted to handle the conflict-prone region. Mr Vance rejected these claims and asserted that when Mr Trump was President, he had made the world "a more secure place" during his term in office.</p>

<p>Donald Trump, who was watching the debate live, was posting messages - mostly personal attacks - on his website 'Truth Social' in his trademark style. He attacked the moderators of the debate hosted by US television network CBS. He also called the Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz a man with "low IQ" and even called him "pathetic".</p>

<p>During the debate, Republican candidate JD Vance, who had once been a strong Trump basher, blamed the media for its reporting on Donald Trump, and tried to set the record straight by saying "I was wrong about Donald Trump".</p>

<p>He went on to explain that "I was wrong, first of all, because I believe some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record. But most importantly, Donald Trump delivered for the American people."</p>

<h3><strong>THE 'MINNESOTA NICE' DEBATE</strong></h3>

<p>The Vice Presidential debate was between Democratic candidate Tim Walz, 60, a former high school teacher and current Governor of Minnesota with liberal views, and his Republican rival JD Vance, 40, a former venture capitalist, bestselling author and conservative firebrand US senator from Ohio with some very conservative views on issues like abortion.</p>

<p>Though both candidates portrayed themselves as sons of America's Midwestern heartland, each had deeply opposing views on nearly every major issue that is gripping a vastly polarised United States of America.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="By and large both candidates appeared calm and courteous, demonstrating a Minnesota Nice attitude throughout the debate." id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/fl9r9nsc_tim-walz-vs-jd-vance-us-vice-presidential-debate-reuters_625x300_03_October_24.jpg" title="By and large both candidates appeared calm and courteous, demonstrating a Minnesota Nice attitude throughout the debate." /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><small><em>By and large both candidates appeared calm and courteous, demonstrating a 'Minnesota Nice' attitude throughout the debate.</em></small></p>
</div>

<p>While both candidates tried to outperform one-another while dealing the occasional blow to the rival, by and large both men appeared calm and courteous, demonstrating a 'Minnesota Nice' attitude throughout the debate, occasionally even thanking each other.</p>

<p>At the end of the debate, reports and polls suggested that neither candidate dealt a 'knockout punch' to the other, nor could one outshine the other, resulting in a balanced debate with no clear winner.</p>

<p>Political analysts believe that vice presidential debates generally do not alter the outcome of a presidential election. That said, even a slight shift in public opinion could prove decisive with the race on a razor's edge five weeks before election day.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday that he would not support any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites in response to its missile attack and urged Israel to act "proportionally."</p>

<p>Biden spoke a day after Iran fired more than 180 ballistic missiles at Israel in a move that he previously described as "ineffective." Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran would pay for the attack.</p>

<p>"We'll be discussing with the Israelis what they're going to do, but all seven of us (G7 nations) agree that they have a right to respond but they should respond proportionally," Biden told reporters before boarding Air Force One.</p>

<p>Some analysts said Israel's response would likely be sharper than when Iran fired missiles and drones at Israel in April, suggesting this time it could target Tehran's nuclear or oil facilities.</p>

<p>Asked whether the U.S. would back any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites, Biden told reporters: "The answer is no."</p>

<p>Biden said more sanctions would be imposed on Iran and that he would speak soon with Netanyahu.</p>

<p>"Obviously, Iran is way off course," he said.</p>

<p>U.S. Deputy Secretary Kurt Campbell said the administration was seeking to align its position with Israel on any response to Iran's attack but also recognizes the Middle East is on a "knife's edge" and a broader escalation could imperil both Israeli and U.S. interests.</p>

<p>Speaking at a virtual event hosted by Washington-based think tank Carnegie Endowment, Campbell repeated the U.S. view that what Tehran has undertaken was "deeply irresponsible" and that there must be a "return message."</p>

<p>"I think we tried to underscore our support for some of the actions that Israel has taken," he added. "We have real wariness about a extended or substantial ground set of operations in Lebanon," Campbell said.</p>

<p>The Israeli army is locked in combat at its northern border with Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah fighters. On Wednesday, eight Israeli soldiers were killed -- the deadliest suffered by Israel's military on the Lebanon front in the past year of border-area clashes between Israel and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Iran said on Wednesday its missile volley - its biggest ever assault on Israel - was over, barring further provocation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Russian troops are in complete control of the town of Vuhledar in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region that has resisted Russian assaults for more than two years, the SHOT Telegram channel and pro-Russian war bloggers said on Wednesday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian troops are in complete control of the town of Vuhledar in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region that has resisted Russian assaults for more than two years, the SHOT Telegram channel and pro-Russian war bloggers said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Here are some key points about the town and the battle.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT IS VUHLEDAR?</strong></p>

<p>Vuhledar - which means "gift of coal" - is a coal mining town in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region with a pre-war population of around 14,000 people, nearly all of whom have fled. It was built by the Soviet Union in the mid 1960s around a mine. There are two mines there now with significant coal reserves. Russians call the town, which sits on a flat plain and is comprised of high-rise apartment buildings and other structures, Ugledar.</p>

<p><strong>WHY DID RUSSIA WANT TO TAKE IT?</strong></p>

<p>Moscow says the Donetsk region is one of four Ukrainian regions it has annexed since 2022, a claim Kyiv rejects as illegal. Moscow saw taking control of Vuhledar as an important stepping stone to incorporating the entire region into Russia.</p>

<p>Control of the town - which Russians long regarded as one of Ukraine's toughest fortified positions to crack - is considered important by both sides because of its position on elevated ground and because it sits at the intersection of the eastern and southern battlefield fronts giving it added significance when it comes to supplying both sides' forces.</p>

<p>While Ukrainian forces were in full control of Vuhledar, they were able to use the town as a platform to shell Russian military supply lines in the area.</p>

<p>The town sits close to a railway line from Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, to Ukraine's industrialised Donbas region which comprises Donetsk and the eastern region of Luhansk, most of which Moscow controls.</p>

<p>Taking Vuhledar, which Russia portrays as one of the last Ukrainian strongholds in southern Donetsk, opens the way for Russian forces to advance on other places.</p>

<p><strong>HOW DID RUSSIA TAKE CONTROL OF VUHLEDAR?</strong></p>

<p>Russian forces trapped Ukrainian soldiers in the town in what they called a mini-cauldron, gradually encircling it from all sides and thus making it increasingly difficult for Ukrainian forces to resupply or rotate in and out of the town.</p>

<p>When such a cauldron closes, something Russian military bloggers say has already happened, there is no way in or out for the defenders who in this case were bombarded with devastating aerial glide bombs.</p>

<p>Russian forces had previously launched at least four major attempts to take Vuhledar, but had been repelled with Ukraine's 72nd Separate Mechanised Brigade mounting fierce resistance.</p>

<p>Neither side discloses losses, but Ukrainian officials said Russian losses sustained during previous failed attempts to take the town had been significant. Moscow says Ukraine also paid a high human price when trying to retain Vuhledar.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT DOES VUHLEDAR LOOK LIKE NOW</strong></p>

<p>Fierce fighting since 2022 has left much of the town devastated. Images of Russian forces waving their flag on the roof of an administrative building on Tuesday in the centre showed a structure which had been reduced to rubble in parts and whose blackened windows had all been blown out.</p>

<p>Maksym Verbovsky, the town's deputy mayor, told Ukrainian state media last year that every single building had been damaged along with the entire infrastructure. He said then that fewer than 500 civilians, including three children and many pensioners, remained. All children and most adults have since been evacuated.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Masoud Pezeshkian insisted Wednesday that Iran was "not looking for war" but pledged a stronger response if Israel retaliates for its missile attack.</p>

<p>"If it (Israel) wants to react, we will have a stronger response, this is what the Islamic Republic is committed to," Pezeshkian said in a joint press conference with Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, in Doha.</p>

<p>"We are not looking for war, it is Israel that forces us to react," he said.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian spoke a day after Iran fired about 200 missiles including hypersonic weapons towards Israel, sending frightened civilians into shelters.</p>

<p>Israel intercepted most of them, while medics reported two people lightly wounded by shrapnel. One of the missiles damaged a school building.</p>

<p>On Wednesday the Israeli military said several Iranian missiles fell inside air force bases without causing any damage.</p>

<p>"The dirty goal of the Zionist regime is to cause insecurity and spread crisis in the region," Pezeshkian said.</p>

<p>"What we want from US and European countries is to tell the entity they have planted in the region (Israel) to stop the bloodshed."</p>

<p>Sheikh Tamim warned that Israel was drawing the region to the "brink of the abyss" with its attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

<p>The emir also condemned ongoing Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip, saying Doha would press on with efforts to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas, whose October 7 attacks triggered the war.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

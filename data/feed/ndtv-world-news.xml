       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned on Tuesday, a day after acknowledging that the agency failed in its mission to prevent an assassination attempt against Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Cheatle was facing bipartisan calls to step down after a 20-year-old gunman wounded the former Republican president and current White House candidate at a July 13 campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>"It is overdue, she should have done this at least a week ago," Mike Johnson, the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, told reporters. "I'm happy to see that she has heeded the call of both Republicans and Democrats."</p>

<p>Cheatle appeared before a congressional committee on Monday and said the attack on Trump, who was slightly wounded in his right ear, represented a failure by the Secret Service.</p>

<p>She called it "the most significant operational failure of the Secret Service in decades."</p>

<p>Both Republicans and Democrats called on Cheatle to resign. She drew the ire of lawmakers from both parties by refusing to provide specific details about the attack, citing the existence of multiple active investigations.</p>

<p>The gunman opened fire on Trump with an AR-style assault rifle just minutes after he began speaking at the campaign event.</p>

<p>Perched on the roof of a nearby building, he was shot dead by a Secret Service sniper less than 30 seconds after firing the first of eight shots.</p>

<p>Investigators have concluded the young man, who lived in a town about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from Butler, acted alone, and have not been able to identify any strong ideological or political leanings.</p>

<p>Two rally attendees were seriously wounded and a 50-year-old Pennsylvania firefighter, Corey Comperatore, was shot dead.</p>

<p>Trump's former physician said over the weekend that the Republican candidate sustained a two-centimeter (almost one inch) gunshot wound on his right ear.</p>

<p>"The bullet passed, coming less than a quarter of an inch from entering his head, and struck the top of his right ear," said ex-White House physician Ronny Jackson.</p>

<p>Cheatle served as a Secret Service agent for 27 years before leaving in 2021 to become the head of security in North America for PepsiCo.</p>

<p>She was named to head the agency by President Joe Biden in 2022.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The crash occurred as Ms Georger was attempting to land the aircraft.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A young pilot died in a "fluke" accident shortly after a group of skydivers exited her plane in upstate New York.</p>

<p>The Niagara County Sheriff's Office confirmed that Melanie Georger, 26, was killed while flying her single-engine Cessna, which crashed on the Niagara Scenic Parkway, about 15 miles from Niagara Falls, on Saturday.</p>

<p>The crash occurred as Ms Georger was attempting to land the aircraft, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crash-skydiver-plane-new-york-b2583879.html"><em>The Independent</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Where it landed was just off the parkway. We look to the west near Fort Niagara, it's full of soccer players today." Michael Filicetti, the county sheriff said in an interview with WIVB on Sunday.</p>

<p>"We're lucky where it landed, but it is an unfortunate incident."</p>

<p>The National Transportation Safety Board is leading the investigation into the incident.</p>

<p>The victim was employed by Skydive the Falls in Youngstown, New York. One of the skydivers, Jeffrey Walker, reported that he exited the plane about 30 minutes before the crash occurred.</p>

<p>"Everything was great," he said. "It was great weather, low winds, very calm winds. Everybody was excited. Everybody was in a good mood."</p>

<p>The passenger stated that he suspected something had gone wrong when the plane rapidly crashed.</p>

<p>"It's not like skydiving planes once a week fall out of the sky and you just kind of dodge it," he said. "This is a fluke accident. Something went wrong."</p>

<p>"For some reason, God left me on Earth and I'm just blessed to still be around," Walker told the TV station. "It's just an eerie feeling that I was on that plane literally a half-hour before it crashed. Why didn't it crash with us on it? Why didn't it crash with more people on it? It's surreal."</p>

<p>Mr Walker described Ms Georger as a good pilot who was great at her job.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I really feel bad for the business and the company she was working for, because they're a great company," he added. "I thought they did a great job training."</p>

<p>Georger's father, Paul Georger, issued a statement on Facebook following her death.</p>

<p>"Friends and family, my life as I know it ended today. My beloved daughter, my best friend and one of the two lights of my life passed away suddenly today," he wrote.</p>

<p>The tribute continued: "Melanie was a pilot, on the cusp of realizing her dream to fly for the airlines. She was doing what she loved, flying for a local skydiving company when her plane crashed. She had discharged her passengers and was flying back to pick another load when she crashed. Kelli, Tim and I are devastated. She was only 26."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hollywood star George Clooney -- one of the first high-profile Democratic activists to urge Joe Biden not to seek reelection -- on Tuesday announced his backing for Kamala Harris, while hailing Biden's exit.</p>

<p>"President Biden has shown what true leadership is. He's saving democracy once again. We're all so excited to do whatever we can to support Vice President Harris in her historic quest," Clooney said in a statement to CNN.</p>

<p>A major fundraiser for Democratic candidates and longtime Biden booster, Clooney broke ranks two weeks ago by openly calling on the 81-year-old president to give way to a younger candidate so that the party would have a better chance of beating Donald Trump in November.</p>

<p>"I love Joe Biden," Clooney wrote in The New York Times, shocking many. "I consider him a friend, and I believe in him... But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time."</p>

<p>With Biden at the top of the ticket, the Oscar-winner said, Democrats "are not going to win in November," will lose control of the Senate, and won't gain a majority in the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>After days of mounting pressure, Biden on Sunday abruptly announced he was leaving the race and endorsed his vice president. Harris has rapidly garnered overwhelming support from party leaders and raked in a huge quantity of donations from voters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>July 21 was the hottest day ever recorded globally, according to preliminary data from the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service.</p>

<p>The global average surface air temperature on Sunday reached 17.09 degrees Celsius (62.76 degrees Fahrenheit) - slightly higher than the previous record set last July of 17.08 C (62.74 F).</p>

<p>Heatwaves have scorched large swathes of the United States, Europe and Russia over the past week.</p>

<p>Copernicus confirmed to Reuters that the record daily temperature average set last year appeared to have been broken on Sunday.</p>

<p>Last year saw four days in a row break the record, from July 3 through July 6, as climate change, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, drove extreme heat across the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

<p>Every month since June 2023 - 13 months in a row - has now ranked as the planet's hottest since records began, compared with the corresponding month in previous years, Copernicus said.</p>

<p>Some scientists have suggested 2024 could outrank 2023 as the hottest year since records began, as climate change and the El Nino natural weather phenomenon - which ended in April - have pushed temperatures ever higher this year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Pete Buttigieg, who earlier made history as the first openly gay Cabinet member, is being looked upon as the potential running mate for Kamala Harris.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden on Sunday announced his decision to withdraw from the US Presidential race and endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee. And now the next question on everyone's mind is, "Who will be Kamala Harris' running mate?"</p>

<p>Pete Buttigieg, the US Secretary of Transportation, is said to be one of the front-runners to become Kamala Harris' deputy, should she get elected to the White House come November 5.</p>

<p><strong>Here are five key facts about Pete Buttigieg</strong></p>

<p>1. Born on January 19, 1982, he is the son of Joseph Buttigieg, who immigrated to the US from Malta, and Jennifer Anne Montgomery. Pete Buttigieg is a graduate of Harvard College as well as the University of Oxford, where he was a Rhodes Scholar. He has completed a degree in philosophy, politics, and economics.</p>

<p>2. Pete Buttigieg earlier served as an officer in the US Navy Reserve between 2009 and 2017. He was reportedly deployed to the war in Afghanistan for around seven months in 2014.&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. Pete Buttigieg earlier made history as the first openly gay Cabinet member after President Biden brought him into the administration as Transportation Secretary. He is married to Chasten Buttigieg, an American teacher, author and activist. The couple have two children.</p>

<p>4. Currently serving as the 19th Secretary of Transportation, after being sworn in on February 3, 2021, Buttigieg was earlier the mayor of his hometown, South Bend, Indiana for two terms (2012-2020). His efforts led to an increase in household income, while the poverty rate came down and unemployment was reportedly cut in half in the region.&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. Popularly known as 'Mayor Pete,' Buttigieg rose to prominence when he ran in the 2020 presidential race. However, he soon dropped out of the Democratic race and ended his roller-coaster campaign. This time, Buttigieg has extended full support to Kamala Harris for the presidential race and said that he "will do all that I can to help elect Kamala Harris the next President of the United States."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In what was his first meeting in the framework of the diplomatic visit to Washington, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with the families of the Israeli-American hostages held in the custody of Hamas, earlier on Tuesday, India time.</p>

<p>"I am doing everything in my power to combine the necessary humanitarian objective and the imperative to return the hostages, and at the same time, preserve the existence of the State of Israel," Netanyahu said after the meeting.</p>

<p>"I am not prepared in any way to give in on the victory over Hamas. If we give up on this, we will be in danger in the face of Iran's entire axis of evil," he added.</p>

<p>Several representatives of the families of the hostages who accompanied the Israeli PM on flight to Washington and soldiers who fought on October 7, and who have fought in Gaza, also participated in the meeting which was also attended by Netanyahu's wife Sara.</p>

<p>Representatives of bereaved families who have lost their sons in the fighting in Gaza and the Western Negev were also present at the meeting.</p>

<p>"We are determined to return them all. The conditions for returning them are becoming ripe, for the simple reason that we are putting very strong pressure on Hamas. We see a certain change, and I think that this change will increase," said Netanyahu.</p>

<p>The Israeli PM said that his visit to the US was an important one, one which will give "the opportunity to bring before the representatives of the American people, and the American people themselves the importance of their support".</p>

<p>Israel's top officials, including the Director of the National Security Council, the Director General of the Prime Minister's Office, the Cabinet Secretary, the Prime Minister's Military Secretary and the Coordinator for the Hostages and the Missing, also participated in the meeting.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A top WHO official said Tuesday he was "extremely worried" over possible outbreaks in war-torn Gaza after poliovirus was detected in the sewage, warning that communicable diseases could cause more deaths than injuries.</p>

<p>United Nations agencies said last week that the Global Polio Laboratory Network found vaccine-derived type-2 poliovirus in six environmental samples collected from the sewage in the Gaza Strip on June 23.</p>

<p>Ayadil Saparbekov, the World Health Organization's head of health emergencies in the occupied Palestinian territories, stressed that "we have not yet collected human samples" so it remains unclear if anyone has actually been infected with the virus.</p>

<p>But he acknowledged to reporters in Geneva via video-link from Jerusalem, "I am very much worried".</p>

<p>A type of vaccine against polio -- a crippling and potentially fatal viral disease that mainly affects children under the age of five -- contains small amounts of weakened but live polio which can occasionally cause outbreaks.</p>

<p>Oral polio vaccine (OPV) replicates in the gut and can be passed to others through faecal-contaminated water -- meaning it won't hurt the child who has been vaccinated, but could infect their neighbours in places where hygiene and immunisation levels are low.</p>

<p>While epidemiological studies and risk assessments are continuing, Saparbekov said he was deeply concerned at the prospect of any diseases spreading in Gaza, which is facing a towering humanitarian crisis after more than nine months of war following Hamas's deadly October 7 attack inside Israel.</p>

<p>"I'm extremely worried about outbreaks happening in Gaza," he said, pointing to the confirmation late last year that hepatitis A was spreading, "and now we may have polio".</p>

<p>"With the crippled health system, lack of water and sanitation, as well as lack of access of the population to health services... this is going to be a very bad situation," he warned.</p>

<p>"We may have more people dying of different communicable diseases than from the injury-related diseases."</p>

<p>That says something in Gaza where more than 39,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in the war, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign followed Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The operatives also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 44 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Saparbekov on Tuesday described a dire situation in Gaza, with only 16 of the territory's 36 hospitals even partially functional.</p>

<p>WHO has long stressed the urgent need for medical evacuations from Gaza for the seriously sick and wounded.</p>

<p>While the WHO in recent months has said around 10,000 people were waiting to leave, Saparbekov suggested the number had surged to "up to 14,000 people who may need to seek medical treatment outside of the Gaza Strip".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after President Joe Biden pulled out of the Presidential race, his deputy Kamala Harris became the front-runner to replace him as the Democratic nominee for the November 5 polls. Apart from President Biden himself, leading party figures are rallying behind her. If Harris wins the nomination, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro is favoured to join her on the ticket.</p>

<p>Betting markets put Shapiro at 7/4 odds, followed by North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper at 3/1 and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear at 5/1.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Who is Josh Shapiro?</strong></p>

<p>1. Josh Shapiro was born on June 20, 1973, and grew up in Pennsylvania. His mother was an educator, and his father was a paediatrician. He studied political science at the University of Rochester and later earned a law degree from Georgetown University in Washington, DC. He now lives in Montgomery County with his wife, Lori, and their four children - three school-age sons and a daughter who attends the University of Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>2. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 2004, serving the 153rd District for eight years. He then served as Chairman of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners from 2011 to 2017. In 2016, Shapiro was elected Pennsylvania Attorney General and reelected in 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. During his tenure as Attorney General, Josh Shapiro exposed the Catholic Church's decades-long cover-up of child sexual abuse, identifying 301 predator priests and thousands of victims. He protected healthcare access for nearly 2 million Pennsylvanians and defended reproductive rights and a woman's right to choose. He also held over 100 corrupt officials accountable for breaking the law, regardless of party affiliation. He worked with law enforcement to arrest thousands of drug dealers and remove thousands of illegal guns from the streets. He also supported LGBTQ+ marriage rights. During the 2020 presidential election, Shapiro safeguarded the right to vote and defended Pennsylvania's election results, winning dozens of court cases before and after Election Day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. In January 2021, Josh Shapiro began his second term as Attorney General. During this time, he continued to combat the opioid crisis, arresting over 8,000 drug dealers and holding pharmaceutical companies and their CEOs accountable for their role in the COVID-19 epidemic. He secured over $328 million in relief for Pennsylvanians, including seniors, students, and workers, who had been exploited by private lenders and employers.</p>

<p>5. Josh Shapiro also worked on criminal justice reform, creating a database to track police misconduct. He brought together activists and law enforcement to make this happen. In 2022, he made history, receiving the most votes ever in a Pennsylvania governor's race.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 US Presidential elections, social media has been abuzz with rumours that his health is deteriorating which is why he's been avoiding the public eye.</p>

<p>"Where's Joe" is among the top trends on X (formerly Twitter) globally with people wondering why the US President hasn't made a public appearance in the last five days. The truth: Biden has tested positive for Covid and is isolating, the White House said in a statement last week.</p>

<p>But that hasn't stopped social media users from coming up with theories about the 81-year-old. Several posts claiming that "Joe Biden is in hospice care and unlikely to survive the night" have gone viral on the social platform.</p>

<p>Another theory was floated by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance. The two leaders hit out at the Democratic party for a "coup" against President Biden to push him out of the race.</p>

<p>When asked if Biden's dropping out of the election was a "coup against Joe Biden," Donald Trump said "Sort of," before Vance jumped in.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I think it is. I mean, look, there's a constitutional process, the 25th Amendment. If Joe Biden can't run for president, he can't serve as president," Vance said in an interview with Fox News.</p>

<p>Biden's decision came after internal pressure by the Democratic Party mounted following a widely criticised debate against Trump on June 27. Vice-President Kamala Harris has won the support of the party's lawmakers to take Biden's place in the Presidential elections.</p>

<p>Joe Biden, after his shock announcement Sunday that he was dropping out of the race to the White House, urged his fellow Democrats on Monday to rally around Harris' candidacy.</p>

<p>"She's the best," he said, his voice still hoarse from Covid.</p>

<p>Harris has less than four months to convince the American public she has what it takes for highest office.</p>

<p>Donald Trump was in the lead in polls in the state against Joe Biden, but it is still too early to know whether he will maintain that lead against Kamala Harris.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Former US President Donald Trump on Monday said he refused to use the stretcher after being injured in the shooting at his rally in Pennsylvania.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/trump-says-nobody-warned-him-of-a-problem-before-assassination-attempt-6164525" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a> on Monday said he refused to use the stretcher after being injured in the shooting at his rally in Pennsylvania. He was shot in the ear during an assassination attempt by 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13.</p>

<p>"Well, they wanted to put me on a stretcher. They had a stretcher and they wanted to put me on a stretcher, and I said I'm not going on a stretcher because I just felt it was the ear," Trump told Fox News.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There was a lot of blood. But I understood. They thought I was hit elsewhere...I said, 'I'm telling you I'm OK, I'm fine. I'm going to get up. I want to get up. I'm not going to be taken out on a stretcher,'" he added.</p>

<p>Crooks opened fire on Trump with an AR-style assault rifle just minutes after the Republican US presidential candidate began speaking at the campaign event in Butler.</p>

<p>Crooks was perched on the roof of a nearby building with a clear sightline of the stage and was shot dead by a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/secret-service-chiefs-most-serious-lapse-admission-over-trump-shooting-6164861" target="_blank">Secret Service</a> sniper about 26 seconds after firing the first of eight shots.</p>

<p>A 50-year-old firefighter, Corey Comperatore, was shot dead in the shooting, while two other rally attendees were seriously injured.</p>

<p>Investigators have concluded that the 20-year-old, who lived in a town about 80 kilometers from Butler, acted alone.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump-Biden's Conversation</strong></h3>

<p>In his interview with Fox News, Donald Trump also spoke about his conversation with US President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-what-led-to-joe-bidens-sudden-exit-from-us-presidential-race-6168072" target="_blank">Joe Biden</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You're lucky you turned to the right," Trump said Biden told him, referring to the head tilt half a second before the bullet, which was aimed at his head, grazed his right ear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I said, 'I think so'," he added, calling his chat with Biden a "nice conversation".</p>

<p>He also said the embattled Secret Service chief, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/what-trump-said-on-secret-services-plan-ahead-of-assassination-attempt-6169428" target="_blank">Kimberly Cheatle</a>, came to see him after the shooting. She is under fire after the Secret Service failed in its mission to prevent the assassination attempt on Trump.</p>

<p>"She came to see me. And, well, I mean, it went very nicely. She was very nice, I thought. But, you know, somebody should have made sure there was nobody on that roof," Trump told Fox News.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cheatle served as a Secret Service agent for 27 years before leaving in 2021 to become the head of security in North America for PepsiCo. She was then named to head the agency by Biden in 2022.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Hamas announced Tuesday it had signed an agreement in Beijing with other Palestinian organisations including rivals Fatah to work together for "national unity", with China describing it as a deal to rule Gaza together once the war ends.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas announced Tuesday it had signed an agreement in Beijing with other Palestinian organisations including rivals Fatah to work together for "national unity", with China describing it as a deal to rule Gaza together once the war ends.</p>

<p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who hosted senior Hamas official Musa Abu Marzuk, Fatah envoy Mahmud al-Aloul and emissaries from 12 other Palestinian groups, said they had agreed to set up an "interim national reconciliation government" to govern post-war Gaza.</p>

<p>"Today we sign an agreement for national unity and we say that the path to completing this journey is national unity. We are committed to national unity and we call for it," Abu Marzuk said after meeting Wang and the other envoys.</p>

<p>The announcement comes more than nine months into a war sparked by Hamas's October attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The operatives also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 44 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.</p>

<p>The relentless fighting has plunged Gaza into a severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p>China has sought to play a mediator role in the conflict, which has been rendered even more complex due to the intense rivalry between Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, and Fatah, which partially governs the occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>Israel has vowed to keep fighting until it destroys Hamas, and world powers including key Israeli backer the United States have scrambled to imagine scenarios for the governance of Gaza once the war ends.</p>

<p>Neither Israel nor the United States would sanction any post-war plan that includes Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Washington.</p>

<p>While it is unclear whether the deal announced in Beijing on Tuesday can hold, it does indicate that the only world power that can engineer a rapprochement between the Palestinian rivals is China.</p>

<p>As Tuesday's meeting wrapped up in Beijing, Wang said the groups had committed to "reconciliation".</p>

<p>"The most prominent highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government around the governance of post-war Gaza," Wang said after the factions signed the "Beijing Declaration" in the Chinese capital.</p>

<p>"Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community," Wang said.</p>

<p>Fatah official Mahmoud al-Aloul thanked China for its "unending support" for the Palestinian cause.</p>

<p>"To China, you have our love, you have all our friendship, from all the Palestinian people," he said.</p>

<p>Notably, he did not mention whether any agreement had been reached with Hamas and the other factions.</p>

<p>Also present at Tuesday's meeting were envoys from Egypt, Algeria and Russia, according to Wang.</p>

<p>Egypt, which neighbours Israel and Gaza, is a key mediator in the conflict.</p>

<p>Algeria is a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council and has drafted resolutions on the war.</p>

<p>And while Western powers have sought to isolate Russia over its Ukraine invasion, China has maintained its strategic partnership with Moscow.</p>

<h3><strong>'Peace and stability'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>China, Wang said, was keen to "play a constructive role in safeguarding peace and stability in the Middle East".</p>

<p>He also called for a "comprehensive, lasting and sustainable ceasefire", as well as efforts to promote Palestinian self-governance and full recognition of a Palestinian state at the UN.</p>

<p>Hamas and Fatah have been bitter rivals since Hamas fighters ejected Fatah from the Gaza Strip after deadly clashes that followed Hamas's resounding victory in a 2006 election.</p>

<p>Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which has partial administrative control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>Several reconciliation bids have failed, but calls have grown since the Hamas October attack and nine-month war in Gaza, with violence also soaring in the West Bank where Fatah is based.</p>

<p>China hosted Fatah and Hamas in April but a meeting scheduled for June was postponed.</p>

<p>China has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and supportive of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

<p>China has positioned itself as a more neutral actor on the Israel-Palestinian conflict than its rival the United States, advocating for a two-state solution while also maintaining good ties with Israel.</p>

<p>It has sought to play a greater role in the Middle East in recent years, facilitating last year's historic rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Violence against women and girls in England and Wales is a "national emergency" with almost 3,000 offences recorded daily, police warned in a new report published on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The study, commissioned by two law enforcement bodies, estimates that at least one in every 12 women will be a victim every year, with the exact number expected to be much higher.</p>

<p>"Violence against women and girls is a national emergency," senior police chief Maggie Blyth said in comments accompanying the report.</p>

<p>The study found that more than one million violent crimes against women and girls were recorded by police in 2022-2023.</p>

<p>They accounted for just under a fifth of all police-recorded crime excluding fraud in England and Wales between April 2022 and March 2023.</p>

<p>The report said violence against women and girls had increased 37 per cent between 2018-2019 and last year, with domestic abuse being one of the biggest demands on policing.</p>

<p>One in 20 adults in England and Wales, or 2.3 million people, will be perpetrators of crimes against women and girls annually, the study added.</p>

<p>"These are cautious estimates as we know much crime goes unreported and in policing, we often only see the tip of the iceberg," Blyth said.</p>

<p>She warned that violence against females in the two countries had "reached epidemic levels" and called for government intervention in the "overwhelmed" criminal justice system.</p>

<p>Child sexual abuse and exploitation offences meanwhile jumped by 435 per cent between 2013 and 2022, the report estimated -- from just over 20,000 to nearly 107,000.</p>

<p>Offenders are getting younger, with the average age of a suspect now 15, it said.</p>

<p>The report said stalking and harassment accounted for 85 per cent of online-related offences.</p>

<p>Britain's interior ministry declared violence against women and girls a national threat to public safety in February last year.</p>

<p>More than 4,500 new officers have been trained to investigate rape and serious sexual offences over the last year, with the report detailing a 38-percent increase in charges for adult rape from the year ending December 2022 to the year ending December 2023.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump narrowly escaped death when a 20-year-old shot a 5.56 mm bullet from an AR-15 rifle at a rally in Pennsylvania's Butler on July 13. Mr Trump was shot in the ear, with blood spattered on his face, followed by a first pump. The picture is one of the most iconic frames in modern American political history.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking to Fox News, the former President mentioned his conversation with Secret Service Chief, Kimberly Cheatle, after the shooting, but he said that there should have been a guard on the roof from where Thomas Matthews Crooks, the 20-year-old shooter, fired.</p>

<p>"She came to see me. And, well, I mean, it went very nicely. She was very nice, I thought. But, you know, somebody should have made sure there was nobody on that roof," Mr Trump told<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/trump-rally-shooting-fbi-investigation-attempted-assassination-july-22"> Fox News</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Cheatle acknowledged that the US Secret Service, the premier agency that protects serving and former Presidents, failed in its mission to prevent the assassination attempt. The testimony came during a hearing of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The Secret Service chief said that the roof from the shooter fire was identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.</p>

<p><strong>'130 Yards Is Like A One-Foot Putt'</strong></p>

<p>Talking about the shooter's position, which came up during Trump's conversation with the Secret Service chief, the former President said, "That roof was a dead aim right onto the stage. And they said they didn't have the manpower for it, which is crazy. They said, 130 yards (130 metres) is like sinking a one-foot putt. It's considered close.</p>

<p>The Secret Service chief's admission to the "most significant operational failure in decades" comes after questions were raised on the agency's response to the threat. Ms Cheatle in her testimony admitted that the people in the rally alerted the Secret Service "two to five times" about a man on the roof but he was "not immediately classified as a threat".</p>

<p><strong>'Biden Called Me'</strong></p>

<p>In his interview with Fox News, Mr Trump talked about his conversation with US President Joe Biden, who said, "You're lucky you turned to the right", referring to the head tilt half a second before the bullet, which was aimed at his head, grazed his right ear, saving the former President.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump called his chat with Joe Biden a "nice conversation". He added that the Secret Service agents wanted to carry him off the stage on a stretcher, to which he refused. "They wanted to put me on a stretcher," Trump said. "They had a stretcher, and they wanted to put me on a stretcher. And I said, 'I'm not going on a stretcher."</p>

<p>Ronny Jackson, former White House physician, now a lawmaker in Texas, gave the first detailed account of Trump's injury. Mr Jackson said, "The bullet passed, coming less than a quarter of an inch from entering his head, and struck the top of his right ear."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Former US President Donald Trump, in a recent interview with Fox News, shared details of a phone call he had with President Joe Biden following the assassination attempt on him at an election campaign rally in Pennsylvania.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump, in a recent interview with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/trump-rally-shooting-fbi-investigation-attempted-assassination-july-22">Fox News</a>, shared details of a phone call he had with President Joe Biden following the assassination attempt on him at an election campaign rally in Pennsylvania. Trump, who survived the attempt unscathed, recounted how Biden told him he was "lucky" to have turned his head at the critical moment.</p>

<p>The incident occurred on July 13 during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when a 20-year-old gunman, identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks, shot at Trump. The 78-year-old narrowly escaped injury by turning to look at a chart displayed on a screen just as the shots were fired. Secret Service agents quickly subdued the attacker and shielded Trump.</p>

<p>Reflecting on his chat with Biden, Trump described it as "a nice conversation." He revealed, "He [Biden] said, 'You're lucky you turned to the right.' So... obviously, somebody briefed him. But, he did say that to me. He said, 'You're lucky you turned to the right.' I said, 'I think so.'"</p>

<p>In the interview, Trump mentioned that Secret Service agents were ready to place him on a stretcher due to the initial fear that he had been shot in the abdomen. However, Trump insisted that he was only grazed on the ear, despite the considerable amount of blood that alarmed the agents.</p>

<p>"I just felt it was the ear," Trump said, explaining his refusal to be carried out on a stretcher. "There was a lot of blood," he said, which led to a brief argument with the agents. "I said, 'I'm telling you, I'm OK. I'm fine. I'm going to get up. I want to get up. I'm not going to be taken out on a stretcher.'"</p>

<p>Trump also suggested the need for an investigation into Biden's physical and mental fitness for office. He questioned whether the White House was being fully transparent about Biden's health, hinting at a possible cover-up. "I think somebody has to look at it," Trump said. "Look, you had people that lied to the American public. And I tell you what, you ought to take a look at his doctors because his doctors keep giving him this wonderful report."</p>

<p>The former president also disclosed that he had met with Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle following the assassination attempt. "She came to see me, actually," Trump said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new "vaccine-like" HIV drug that currently costs over $40,000 per person a year could be made for as little as $40, researchers estimated on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The antiretroviral drug Lenacapavir, developed by US pharmaceutical giant Gilead, has been hailed as a potential game-changer in the fight against HIV.</p>

<p>Early trials have found the treatment is 100 per cent effective in preventing HIV infection. And it only needs to be injected twice a year, making the drug far easier to administer than current regimens requiring daily pills.</p>

<p>"It's like having a vaccine basically," Andrew Hill, a researcher at the UK's Liverpool University, told AFP.</p>

<p>The treatment currently costs patients over $40,000 a year in a range of countries including the United States, France, Norway and Australia.</p>

<p>New research, which Hill presented at the International AIDS Conference in Munich on Tuesday, looked into how much the cost of making the drug could come down if Gilead allowed for cheaper generic versions to be manufactured.</p>

<p>A year's worth of the drug could be made for as little as $40 -- 1,000 times less than the current price -- according to the research, which has not been peer-reviewed.</p>

<p>This price was based on production volumes equal to treating 10 million people.</p>

<p>If the drug was given to people at high risk of contracting HIV -- such as gay or bisexual men, sex workers, prisoners or notably young women in Africa -- it could "basically shut down HIV transmission," Hill emphasised.</p>

<p>"We could actually control the epidemic."</p>

<p>There were 1.3 million new HIV infections last year, while 39 million people are living with the virus, according to the World Health Organization.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Opportunity to save the world'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>To estimate the cost, the researchers studied shipments of raw materials of the drug, and spoke to large generic manufacturers in China and India that already make its "building blocks," Hill said.</p>

<p>The international team of researchers has been proven right about similar estimates in the past, he added.</p>

<p>A decade ago, the team said that the cost of making Gilead's hepatitis C drug -- then priced at $84,000 a patient -- could plummet to $100 if generics were allowed.</p>

<p>"Now it costs just under $40 to cure Hepatitis C," Hill said.</p>

<p>The new research was announced a day after UNAIDS chief Winnie Byanyima called on Gilead to "make history" by opening up Lenacapavir to the UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool, which would allow generics to be sold under licence in low- and middle-income nations.</p>

<p>"Gilead has an opportunity to save the world," she told AFP.</p>

<p>The firm has previously said it is in talks with governments and organisations "as we work to reach our access goals".</p>

<p>The firm has not revealed how much it will charge in developing countries -- or which nations could eventually get access to generic versions of the drug</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The number of arrests in days of violence in Bangladesh passed the 2,500 mark in an AFP tally on Tuesday, after protests over employment quotas sparked widespread unrest.</p>

<p>At least 174 people have died, including several police officers, according to a separate AFP count of victims reported by police and hospitals.</p>

<p>What began as demonstrations against politicised admission quotas for sought-after government jobs snowballed last week into some of the worst unrest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's tenure.</p>

<p>A curfew was imposed and soldiers deployed across the South Asian country, and a nationwide internet blackout drastically restricted the flow of information, upending daily life for many.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the Supreme Court pared back the number of reserved jobs for specific groups, including the descendants of "freedom fighters" from Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.</p>

<p>The student group leading the demonstrations suspended its protests Monday for 48 hours, with its leader saying they had not wanted reform "at the expense of so much blood".</p>

<p>The restrictions remained in place Tuesday after the army chief said the situation had been brought "under control".</p>

<p>There was a heavy military presence in Dhaka, with bunkers set up at some intersections and key roads blocked with barbed wire.</p>

<p>But more people were on the streets, as were hundreds of rickshaws.</p>

<p>"I did not drive rickshaws the first few days of curfew, But today I didn't have any choice," rickshaw driver Hanif told AFP.</p>

<p>"If I don't do it, my family will go hungry."</p>

<p>The head of Students Against Discrimination, the main group organising the protests, told AFP in his hospital room Monday that he feared for his life after being abducted and beaten, and the group said Tuesday at least four of its leaders were missing, asking authorities to "return" them by the evening.</p>

<h3><strong>'Killed at random'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The authorities' response to the protests has been widely criticised, with Bangladeshi Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus urging "world leaders and the United Nations to do everything within their powers to end the violence" in a statement.</p>

<p>The respected 83-year-old economist is credited with lifting millions out of poverty with his pioneering microfinance bank but earned the enmity of Hasina, who has accused him of "sucking blood" from the poor.</p>

<p>"Young people are being killed at random every day," Yunus told AFP. "Hospitals do not reveal the number of wounded and dead."</p>

<p>Diplomats in Dhaka also questioned the government's actions, with US Ambassador Peter Haas telling the foreign minister he had shown a one-sided video at a briefing to diplomats.</p>

<p>Government officials have repeatedly blamed the protesters and opposition for the unrest.</p>

<p>More than 1,200 people detained over the course of the violence -- nearly half the 2,580 total -- were held in Dhaka and its rural and industrial areas, according to police officials who spoke to AFP.</p>

<p>Almost 600 were arrested in Chittagong and its rural areas, with hundreds more detentions, tallied in multiple districts across the country.</p>

<h3><strong>'Sheikh Hasina never flees'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>With around 18 million young people in Bangladesh out of work, according to government figures, the June reintroduction of the quota scheme -- halted since 2018 -- deeply upset graduates facing an acute jobs crisis.</p>

<p>With protests mounting across the country, the Supreme Court on Sunday curtailed the number of reserved jobs from 56 per cent of all positions to seven per cent, mostly for the children and grandchildren of "freedom fighters" from the 1971 war.</p>

<p>While 93 per cent of jobs will be awarded on merit, the decision fell short of protesters' demands to scrap the "freedom fighter" category altogether.</p>

<p>Late Monday, Hasina's spokesman told AFP the prime minister had approved a government order putting the Supreme Court's judgement into effect.</p>

<p>Critics say the quota is used to stack public jobs with loyalists to Hasina's ruling Awami League.</p>

<p>Hasina, 76, has ruled the country since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.</p>

<p>Her government is also accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including by the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Joe Biden publicly announced his exit from the presidential race on Sunday and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor. ]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After weeks of criticism and scrutiny, US President Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential race. On Sunday, the president shared his decision to end his reelection campaign in a social media post from his beach house in Delaware while recovering from COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Never before has an incumbent president dropped out of a reelection bid so close to Election Day. The decision came after almost a month of questions surrounding his health and pressure following a lacklustre performance in the June 27 debate against former President Donald Trump. Despite initially standing firm, calls for his exit began to gain traction.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pressure within the Party</strong></p>

<p>Democratic leaders, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, questioned whether Biden's performance was a temporary setback or a sign of deeper issues. The situation worsened when Rep Lloyd Doggett publicly urged Biden to withdraw.</p>

<p>Biden's team attempted to address these concerns through public appearances and statements. However, their efforts were largely unsuccessful. The president's July 5 interview with ABC News, where he stated only the "Lord Almighty" could convince him to leave the race, did little to ease concerns and even angered some Democrats.</p>

<p>Up until his departure, Biden and his team consistently maintained he would remain in the race. He appeared in a high-profile interview with NBC News' Lester Holt, acknowledging his debate shortcomings but criticised media focus on his gaffes instead of Trump's falsehoods. Biden said that only a "medical condition" could force him to reconsider his bid.</p>

<p><strong>Party division</strong></p>

<p>On July 10, actor George Clooney, in an opinion piece published in the New York Times, criticised Biden's performance and urged him to consider withdrawing. Former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's reluctance to endorse Biden only deepened the divisions within the party.</p>

<p>By July 11, the situation reached a tipping point. Biden's public comments and verbal slip-ups, including confusing Vice President Kamala Harris with Trump and referring to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as Russian President Vladimir Putin, raised further doubts about his readiness for another term. This only solidified the view that it was in the best interest of both Democrats and America to have an alternative to Biden.</p>

<p><strong>Joe Biden's exit</strong></p>

<p>Ultimately, the combination of internal pressure, poor polling numbers, and the president's declining public performance led to Biden's decision to withdraw.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Sunday, he publicly announced his exit and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, with just 107 days before the election, this sudden shift presents both risks and opportunities for the party.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tanzania President Samia Suluhu Hassan has fired two senior ministers, including the head of the foreign ministry, in a mini-cabinet reshuffle.</p>

<p>The move comes ahead of expected national elections next year, with the sacked information minister caught in a viral video last week saying "winning in elections is not always determined by the number of votes in the ballot box".</p>

<p>"Mahmoud Thabit Kombo has been appointed a member of parliament and the new minister for foreign affairs and East African cooperation to replace January Makamba whose appointment is revoked," according to a presidency statement issued late Sunday, which did not detail the reasons for the dismissals.</p>

<p>Jerry Silaa -- previously Lands, Housing and Settlement Development -- was appointed to replace Nape Nnauye, Minister for Information, Communications and IT, the statement said.</p>

<p>A viral clip of Nnauye emerged last week in which he said: "Winning in elections is not always determined by the number of votes in the ballot box but depends on who counts and announces the results."</p>

<p>The video attracted widespread criticism from both the opposition and the ruling party, which said the remarks did not reflect its stance.</p>

<p>Nnauye apologised for the clip, saying his comments were meant as a joke and he had been quoted out of context.</p>

<p>But local media reported opposition politician John Mnyika saying the statement "indicates what has been planned within the government and the ruling party".</p>

<p>The reshuffle has also left analysts speculating about the 2025 election, which Hassan is expected to contest.</p>

<p>"I think it's a power play towards the general election next year," said University of Dar es Salaam lecturer Abel Kinyondo.</p>

<p>The move follows her decision in early July to appoint a new intelligence chief.</p>

<p>"Suleiman Abubakar Mombo was sworn to replace Ali Idi Siwa who retired," the presidency said.</p>

<p>Hassan, then deputy president, took office in 2021 after the death of John Magafuli.</p>

<p>Since taking the helm, Hassan has moved away from Magafuli's authoritarian policies and embarked on political reforms, including relaxing some restrictions on the media and the opposition.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 44,000 people, led by black women, logged onto a Zoom call to support US Vice President Kamala Harris and raised more than $1.5 million for her campaign in three hours as she aims for the Oval Office in the west wing of the White House, the Washington Post <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/22/kamala-harris-black-women-zoom/">reported</a>. The presidential bid could make Ms Harris the first woman president of the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Harris today expressed her gratitude for the "overwhelming support" and reaffirmed her commitment to the Democratic presidential nomination, just two days after President Joe Biden, who was seeking re-election, announced his decision to step aside. "When I announced my campaign for President, I said I intended to go out and earn this nomination. Tonight, I am proud to have secured the broad support needed to become our party's nominee, and as a daughter of California, I am proud that my home state's delegation helped put our campaign over the top. I look forward to formally accepting the nomination soon," she said in a statement.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Tonight, I am proud to have earned the support needed to become our party's nominee.<br />
<br />
Over the next few months, I'll be traveling across the country talking to Americans about everything on the line. I fully intend to unite our party and our nation, and defeat Donald Trump. <a href="https://t.co/Bsq3N6pMAi">pic.twitter.com/Bsq3N6pMAi</a></p>
— Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) <a href="https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1815602762870116359?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 23, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Jotaka Eaddy, founder of 'Win With Black Women', which describes itself as a collective of intergenerational, intersectional Black women leaders, said, "Anybody that does not think that Black and Brown women are the backbone of this party (Democratic), they don't know us."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Black women are a key Democratic voting bloc. The call, which attracted several celebrities and political figures, was conducted off the record, with participants speaking in their personal capacities. Attendees described it as feeling like church or a family reunion.</p>

<p>Ms Eaddy has been organising such calls since August 2020. Her organisation aims to elect Black women nationwide and speaks out against racism and sexism. During the 2020 election, the most attendees she had on one Zoom call was 1,500 people but Sunday's call saw more than 40,000 attending.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the large volume of people posed its own challenges for Zoom. The video communications platform has a 1,000-person capacity. When that limit was reached, members of Ms Eaddy's organisation contacted Zoom which upgraded the group to a webinar format, allowing unlimited attendees. "I am forever grateful to the leadership of Zoom for what they did," Ms Eaddy said.</p>

<p>"What happened last night was historic," Ms Eaddy added. "It really is the culmination of so many Black women for years and years and years that have been working, cultivating and creating for this moment. And last night was also a homage, a work to them and their sacrifice."</p>

<p>Notable speakers included Bernice King, the youngest child of Martin Luther King Jr and 85-year-old Democratic Senator Maxine Waters, the most senior Black woman in the US House.</p>]]></content:encoded>

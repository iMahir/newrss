       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French President Emmanuel Macron told a podcast episode shown on Monday that both the far right National Rally (RN) party and the left-wing New Popular Front coalition - front runners in the parliamentary election- risked bringing "civil war" to France.</p>

<p>Macron told the podcast "Generation Do It Yourself" that the manifesto of the RN party - which election pollsters put in first place - and their solutions to deal with fears over crime and immigration were based upon "stigmatisation or division".</p>

<p>"I think that the solutions given by the far right are out of the question, because it is categorising people in terms of their religion or origins and that is why it leads to division and to civil war," he told the podcast.</p>

<p>Macron made the same criticism of the France Unbowed (LFI) extreme left-wing party, which forms part of the New Popular Front coalition.</p>

<p>"But that one as well, there is a civil war behind that because you are solely categorising people in terms of their religious outlook or the community they belong to, which in a way is a means of justifying isolating them from the broader national community and in this case, you would have a civil war with those who do not share those same values," said Macron.</p>

<p>Asked to respond to Macron's civil war comments, RN president Jordan Bardella - seen as a possible prime minister if the RN wins the most votes in the election - replied to M6 TV: "A President should not say that."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky replaced a high-ranking army official leading troops in the country's embattled east on Monday after he was accused of incompetence and abuse of power during the Russian invasion.</p>

<p>The move came as Kyiv has struggled to hold back Moscow's forces in the east for months, almost two and half years into the war. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"I have decided to replace the Commander of the Joint Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Yuriy Sodol, with Brigadier General Andriy Gnatov," Zelensky said in his daily evening address.</p>

<p>He gave no details on the reasons for the dismissal but the decision came after criticism from a commander of the Azov brigade, known for its links with the far right.</p>

<p>The Azov commander, Bogdan Krotevych, had a day earlier filed a complaint to the SBU security service, calling for an investigation into Sodol.</p>

<p>According to media reports, Krotevych accused Sodol of incompetence and blamed him for the death of Ukrainian soldiers at the front.</p>

<p>Ukraine -- outgunned and outmanned by Russia -- has been on the back foot for months, with Moscow's forces claiming new villages in the east almost every week, but without making a major breakthrough.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>European Union (EU) regulators on Monday opened a new investigation into Apple's support for alternative iOS marketplaces in Europe under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), adding that the App Store's "steering" policies violate the DMA meant to encourage competition.</p>

<p>Margrethe Vestager, who heads competition policy in Europe, said their preliminary position is that Apple does not fully allow steering.</p>

<p>"Steering is key to ensure that app developers are less dependent on gatekeepers' app stores and for consumers to be aware of better offers," she said in a statement.</p>

<p>The EU regulators said they are concerned as Apple's new business model makes it too hard for app developers to operate as alternative marketplaces and reach their end users on iOS.</p>

<p>"We will look into Apple's new business model - the commercial terms Apple imposes on app developers who want to reach end users on the iOS platform," said the regulators.</p>

<p>The regulators also said that they have adopted their first preliminary findings in a case of non-compliance.</p>

<p>"And it is again about Apple. About the many ways in which their new terms fall short of the DMA requirements regarding steering users to options outside the Apple App Store. As they stand, we think that these new terms do not allow app developers to communicate freely with their end users, and to conclude contracts with them," they added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new study has provided genetic evidence linking a common condition of the blood vessels in brain to dementia and Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p>Known as white matter hyperintensity (WMH), the condition marked by lesions in the brain, is a common feature of the cerebral small-vessel disease, which involves the narrowing of the blood vessels thereby obstructing blood flow, potentially resulting in strokes.</p>

<p>By damaging blood vessels, cerebral small-vessel disease is thought to be the main contributor to cognitive decline and dementia, in which one's memory and ability to think is affected, thereby impacting daily activities and living. Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia.</p>

<p>According to the study's authors, led by those at the University of Texas, US, "causal evidence" of WMH lesions leading to stroke and dementia has been limited. Although previous studies have found that these lesions, which appear as bright areas in MRI brain scans, increase the risk of such neurologically deteriorative conditions.</p>

<p>The study, published in The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Network Open, showed genetic evidence of blood vessel-related (vascular) damage in the brain can result in dementia.</p>

<p>The researchers first estimated the genetic risk of developing WMH, stroke and blood pressure in an individual. In the second stage, they compared these risks with people actually developing dementia, data for which were taken from population-level studies published between 1979 and 2018. The two-year-long analysis included up to 75,000 dementia cases with European ancestry.</p>

<p>"As vascular disease is a treatable contributor to dementia risk, our findings have broad significance for prevention strategies of Alzheimer's and dementia as a whole," first author Muralidharan Sargurupremraj, an assistant professor at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center, said.</p>

<p>With about 75 million people around the world expected to develop dementia by 2030, the researchers said that devising strategies to prevent or delay its occurrence is a major public health priority.</p>

<p>Future studies could examine whether their findings can be applied more widely to non-European populations, the authors said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A homeless man found a wallet containing around 2,000 euros ($2,100) on an empty train at Amsterdam station and handed it to the police, receiving a gift voucher for his honesty.</p>

<p>Hadjer Al-Ali, who has been homeless for 18 months, found the wallet at Amsterdam central station while he was "doing his rounds" looking for empty plastic bottles to exchange for cash.</p>

<p>Police said the 33-year-old turned in the wallet with "approximately 2,000 euros... but unfortunately no identity papers or anything that would allow us to contact the owner."</p>

<p>"Because we think that honesty should pay, he got a 'silver thumb' prize that we sometimes give to citizens and a gift voucher worth 50 euros," authorities added.</p>

<p>If the money is not claimed within one year, it will go to the finder.</p>

<p>In a video posted on local media De Stentor, Al-Ali said: "No matter what I find, I always give it back."</p>

<p>"Maybe the owner has a business and can give me work, maybe a building I can live it. You never know what can happen."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's deadliest executioner died Monday a year after he was released from prison where he hanged some of the country's notorious serial killers, opposition politicians convicted of war crimes and coup plotters, police said.</p>

<p>Since he was released from prison last June, Shahjahan Bouya, 70, wrote a top-selling book narrating his experiences as a hangman, briefly married a young girl 50 years younger than him, and in recent weeks took TikTok by storm with short clips with teenage girls.</p>

<p>He felt chest pain on Monday morning at his home in Hemayetpur, an industrial town outside the capital Dhaka, and was rushed to Dhaka's Suhrawardy Hospital, police said.</p>

<p>"He was brought in dead -- doctors haven't ascertained the actual cause of his death," Sajib Dey, a police station chief in Dhaka, told AFP.</p>

<p>"He had breathing difficulties," Abul Kashem, Bouya's landlord, told AFP. "He rented one of our rooms only 15 days ago. He lived alone".</p>

<p>Bouya had been serving a 42-year-old jail term over a murder.</p>

<p>But the dozens of hangings he did in the jails helped reduce his sentence leading to his release from Dhaka's top jail last year.</p>

<p>Bangladesh ranks third in the world for death sentences passed according to rights group Amnesty International, and assigns convicts to carry out the hangings.</p>

<p><strong>'So much power'</strong></p>

<p>A well-read Marxist revolutionary, Bouya in the 1970s joined the outlawed Sarbahara rebels trying to topple a government they saw as puppets of neighbouring India.</p>

<p>He was convicted for the 1979 death of a truck driver in crossfire with police.</p>

<p>In custody during his trial -- a glacial 12-year process -- he noticed the "first class" treatment afforded to executioners, watching one being massaged by four other inmates.</p>

<p>"A hangman has so much power," he said to himself, and volunteered his services.</p>

<p>Prison authorities put Bouya's total at 26 executions, but he says he participated in 60.</p>

<p>Those to die at his hands included military officers found guilty of plotting a 1975 coup and killing the country's founding leader, the father of current Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>Activists say that Bangladesh's criminal justice system is deeply flawed, but Bouya shrugged off their criticisms, even though he believes at least three of those he executed were innocent.</p>

<p>In February, his book on his years as a hangman was published and became a best-seller at Bangladesh's largest book annual book fair.</p>

<p>His 96-page book narrates the procedures of hanging by ropes the country inherited from the British colonial rulers.</p>

<p>He described the process nonchalantly, never wading into the debates over the abolition of executions.</p>

<p>He also dwelled on the final moments of some of the country's controversial figures and serial killers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations Palestinian refugee agency was sued on Monday by dozens of Israelis who accused it of aiding and abetting the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel.</p>

<p>In a complaint filed with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the plaintiffs said the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) spent more than a decade helping Hamas build what they called the "terror infrastructure" and personnel needed for the attack.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages for what they allege was UNRWA's "aiding and abetting Hamas' genocide, crimes against humanity, and torture," which they said violated international law and the federal Torture Victim Protection Act.</p>

<p>UNRWA declined to comment, saying it had yet to be served with the lawsuit.</p>

<p>The agency has said it takes accusations of staff misconduct seriously, and terminated 10 staff members accused by Israel of involvement in the attack. Two others died, it has said.</p>

<p>UNRWA's commissioner-general, Philippe Lazzarini, and several current and former agency officials are also defendants.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs include 101 people who survived the attack or had relatives who were killed.</p>

<p>While many of their accusations have been made by Israel's government, the plaintiffs want UNRWA held liable for allegedly funneling more than $1 billion from a Manhattan bank account to benefit Hamas, including for weapons, explosives and ammunition.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs accuse UNRWA of providing "safe harbor" to Hamas in its facilities, and letting its schools use Hamas-approved textbooks to indoctrinate Palestinian children to support violence toward and hatred of Jews and Israel.</p>

<p>They also said the attack was "foreseeable" to the defendants, regardless of whether they knew the specifics.</p>

<p>"We are talking about people who have been killed, lost family members and lost homes," Avery Samet, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an interview. "We expect damages will be substantial."</p>

<p>WARNING FROM UNRWA CHIEF</p>

<p>The Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants killed 1,200 people, while about 250 other people were abducted, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>More than 37,000 Palestinians have since been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, health officials in the Hamas-ruled enclave have said.</p>

<p>Several countries including the United States halted funding to UNRWA after Israel alleged that staff members were involved in Hamas' attack.</p>

<p>In April, Norway called on international donors to resume funding UNRWA, after a UN-authorized independent review found that Israel had not provided evidence supporting its accusations that hundreds of UNRWA staff were members of terrorist groups.</p>

<p>On Monday, Lazzarini urged resistance to Israeli efforts to disband UNRWA.</p>

<p>"If we do not push back, other U.N. entities and international organizations will be next, further undermining our multilateral system," Lazzarini said at a meeting of the agency's advisory commission in Geneva.</p>

<p>Established in 1949 after the first Arab-Israeli war, UNRWA provides schooling, healthcare and humanitarian aid in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. It is funded almost entirely by U.N. member states.</p>

<p>The case is Estate of Kedem et al v United Nations Relief and Works Agency et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 24-04765.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Convicted UK baby killer Lucy Letby said on Monday she has never intended or tried to harm any baby in her care, when giving evidence at a retrial for attempted murder.</p>

<p>The former nurse, 34, is accused of trying to kill a baby girl, referred to in court as Child K, at the Countess of Chester Hospital's neo-natal unit on February 17, 2016.</p>

<p>Manchester Crown Court in northwest England has been told that Letby was convicted at a trial that ended last year of murdering seven babies at the unit and the attempted murders of six more between 2015 and 2016.</p>

<p>Reporting restrictions prevent publication of the identities of the surviving and dead children in the case.</p>

<p>The jury has been told that the panel in the first trial could not reach a verdict on the attempted murder charge relating to Baby K, leading to the retrial.</p>

<p>Appearing in the witness box on Monday, Letby responded "no" when asked by her lawyer if she had attempted to murder or harm Child K, or whether she had ever intended to hurt or harm any baby in her care.</p>

<p>The prosecution alleges that a consultant paediatrician walked into the unit's intensive care nursery room and saw Letby standing next to the incubator "doing nothing", as the infant's blood oxygen levels dipped.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Nick Johnson alleged that Letby had displaced the tiny infant's breathing tube.</p>

<p>Child K was transferred to a specialist hospital later the same day because she was born extremely prematurely.</p>

<p>She died there three days later, although the prosecution does not allege Letby caused her death.</p>

<p>Letby, from Hereford, western England, denies one count of attempted murder.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's military claimed on Monday that it killed a senior Hamas weapons expert in the Gaza Strip while the offensive in Rafah city is continuing.</p>

<p>In an update, the military said that an airstrike killed Muhammad Salah, identified as being in charge of projects and development in Hamas' weapons manufacturing headquarters, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>"Salah was part of a project to develop strategic weaponry" and commanded several squads that worked on developing weapons, according to the military.</p>

<p>The military also said that troops were "continuing intelligence-based, targeted operations in the Rafah area", adding that operations were continuing in central Gaza as well.</p>

<p>Israel has been carrying out a large-scale offensive in the Gaza Strip in retaliation for a Hamas rampage on October 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 were taken hostage.</p>

<p>The Israeli assault caused a severe humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian enclave and killed about 37,600 people, according to the health authorities in Gaza.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new pill that slowly releases ketamine could treat people with severe depression without giving them the psychedelic side effects of the often-misused drug, early trial results suggested on Monday.</p>

<p>First developed in the 1960s as an anaesthetic, ketamine's hallucinogenic and dissociative effects led to it becoming a party drug dubbed "Special K".</p>

<p>However, mounting research has demonstrated that ketamine is effective for the roughly quarter of people suffering from depression who see little benefit from common anti-depressant drugs.</p>

<p>In many countries, ketamine has been prescribed for depression for years.</p>

<p>US billionaire Elon Musk told CNN in March that he regularly uses a small amount of prescribed ketamine because it is "helpful for getting one out of the negative frame of mind".</p>

<p>The drug has long been administered intravenously in clinics, but more recently a nasal spray using a derivative called esketamine has increased in popularity.</p>

<p>Both can cause patients to have side effects such as dissociation, high blood pressure and an elevated heart rate.</p>

<p>There are also fears that medical use of the drug could slide into abuse.</p>

<p>The pill described in the journal Nature Medicine on Monday takes more than 10 hours to break down in the liver, lead study author Paul Glue told AFP.</p>

<p>"The really interesting feedback from patients is the lack of side effects -- no euphoria, no dissociation," said the researcher at New Zealand's University of Otago.</p>

<p>"I don't think these tablets would appeal to people who are abusing ketamine."</p>

<p><strong>Electro-shock alternative</strong></p>

<p>The phase 2 trial involved more than 270 people with depression who had previously tried an average of four different anti-depressant drugs.</p>

<p>More than half taking the ketamine pill went into remission for their depression, while 70 percent of the placebo group relapsed after 13 weeks, the study said.</p>

<p>Julaine Allan, an expert on mental health and addiction at Australia's Charles Sturt University who was not involved in the study, praised the trial while emphasising that more research is needed.</p>

<p>Ketamine does not work for everyone, and the "positive effects may wear off over time," she told AFP.</p>

<p>Michel Hoffmann, a psychiatrist at Geneva University Hospitals, said there is "real enthusiasm" in the medical community for ketamine's potential for treating depression.</p>

<p>"For patients who don't respond to conventional drugs, ketamine offers a way to avoid electro-shock therapy," he told AFP.</p>

<p>This last-resort treatment, which involves sending electric currents through the brain, has been proven to be effective.</p>

<p>But it can cause memory loss -- and some patients fear the procedure after seeing depictions of it in films such as "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest".</p>

<p><strong>Fears of 'opioid style crisis'</strong></p>

<p>Some psychiatrists remain hesitant to prescribe ketamine for depression, fearing their patients could end up misusing the drug.</p>

<p>Last year, "Friends" actor Matthew Perry became the latest high-profile death from a ketamine overdose.</p>

<p>US police are investigating how Perry obtained the doses that caused his death -- he had reportedly not had a supervised infusion session for several days.</p>

<p>One potential benefit of quick-acting ketamine seen in previous research is that it could help patients considering suicide.</p>

<p>But there is "the plausible concern that the widespread use of ketamine might trigger a new opioid style crisis," Oxford researcher Riccardo De Giorgi said in a 2022 BMJ editorial.</p>

<p>By ridding ketamine of the side effects sought by some partygoers, the slow-release pill could alleviate some of these concerns.</p>

<p>There were still some side effects from the pill, the most common being headaches, dizziness and anxiety.</p>

<p>More research including phase 3 trials is needed before the drug can be reviewed by national medicine agencies, meaning it will be at least two or three years before patients could potentially access the pills, Glue said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The device, emitting a continuous pulse of current, aims to block or disrupt these abnormal signals.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a world-first trial, a 12-year-old boy named Oran Knowlson from Somerset received a new epilepsy device implanted in his skull. The device, a neurostimulator, sends electrical signals to his brain, significantly reducing his daily seizures by 80%. Oran suffers from Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy that began at age three.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His mother, Justine, told the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg33kgd81mvo"><em>BBC </em></a>that Oran has shown dramatic improvement and described him as "happier" and finally having "a much better quality of life."</p>

<p>Previously, Oran's epilepsy dominated his life. Justine explained last year, "It has robbed him of all of his childhood." The seizures, ranging from dozens to hundreds daily, involved violent shaking, falling, and even loss of consciousness requiring emergency resuscitation.</p>

<p>Oran has autism and ADHD, but Justine says his epilepsy is by far the biggest hurdle: "I had a fairly bright three-year-old, and within a few months of his seizures commencing he deteriorated rapidly, and lost a lot of skills."</p>

<p>Oran's treatment is part of a research project (CADET) testing deep brain stimulation for severe epilepsy. The project involves several hospitals (Great Ormond Street, UCL, King's College, and Oxford) and uses a device with a neurotransmitter made by Amber Therapeutics (UK).</p>

<p>Epileptic seizures result from abnormal bursts of electrical activity in the brain.</p>

<p>The device, emitting a continuous pulse of current, aims to block or disrupt these abnormal signals.</p>

<p>Before the operation, Justine expressed her hope: "I want him to rediscover himself through the haze of seizures. I'd like to have my boy back."</p>

<p>The surgery, lasting approximately eight hours, was conducted in October 2023.</p>

<p>Under the leadership of consultant paediatric neurosurgeon Martin Tisdall, the team inserted two electrodes deep into Oran's brain, precisely reaching the thalamus-a crucial relay station for neuronal information.</p>

<p>The margin of error for placing the electrodes was less than a millimetre.</p>

<p>The ends of the electrodes were connected to the neurostimulator, a device measuring 3.5cm square and 0.6cm thick, which was positioned in a gap in Oran's skull where bone had been removed.</p>

<p>The neurostimulator was then secured into the surrounding skull by screws to anchor it in place.</p>

<p>Previously, deep brain stimulation for childhood epilepsy involved placing neurostimulators in the chest, connected to the brain by wires extending upward. However, this approach is now evolving.</p>

<p>Martin Tisdall told the BBC: "This study is hopefully going to allow us to identify whether deep brain stimulation is an effective treatment for this severe type of epilepsy and is also looking at a new type of device, which is particularly useful in children because the implant is in the skull and not in the chest.</p>

<p>"We hope this will reduce the potential complications."</p>

<p>Steps are taken to lower the risk of postoperative infections and ensure the device's long-term functionality.</p>

<p>After a month of recovery from the surgery, Oran's neurostimulator was activated. Fortunately, it's completely painless and wirelessly rechargeable through headphones, allowing him to enjoy activities like watching TV without any disruption to his daily life.</p>

<p>We visited Oran and his family seven months post-op to see how they were getting on. Justine told us there had been a massive improvement in Oran's epilepsy, "He is more alert and with no drop seizures during the day."<br />
His night-time seizures are also "shorter and less severe".</p>

<p>"I'm definitely getting him back slowly," she said.</p>

<p>Martin Tisdall said: "We are delighted that Oran and his family have seen such a huge benefit from the treatment and that it has dramatically improved his seizures and quality of life."</p>

<p>Oran is now learning riding lessons.</p>

<p>As part of the trial, three more children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome will be fitted with the deep brain neurostimulator.</p>

<p>Currently, Oran gets a constant electrical stimulus from his device.</p>

<p>The Picostim neurotransmitter is made by UK company Amber Therapeutics. It sits under the skull and sends electrical signals deep into the brain, reducing his daytime seizures The CADET pilot will now recruit three additional patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, with a view to 22 patients being recruited to take part in a full trial.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A cyberattack on Indonesia's national data centre compromised hundreds of government offices and caused long delays at the capital's main airport, with the hacker demanding an $8 million ransom, officials said Monday.</p>

<p>Long queues formed at immigration gates at Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport last week after systems went down in the attack, carried out using software developed by Russian ransomware outfit LockBit, an official from the communications ministry said.</p>

<p>The attack "affected 210 institutions at the national and local levels," senior official Semuel Abrijani Pangerapan told reporters on Monday, adding a dark web hacker had demanded a $8 million ransom.</p>

<p>He added that immigration services were returning to normal on Monday morning and work was being done to restore other affected services.</p>

<p>Authorities are still investigating the ransomware, known as Brain Cipher, which made government data inaccessible due to encryption, he said.</p>

<p>LockBit and its affiliates have targeted governments, major companies, schools and hospitals, causing billions of dollars of damage and extracting tens of millions in ransoms from victims.</p>

<p>Typically, their programmes -- once inserted by the ransomware operator into a target's IT systems -- are manipulated to freeze, via encryption, the target's files and data.</p>

<p>The United States, Britain and Australia last month unveiled sanctions against the leader of LockBit, which they accuse of extorting billions of dollars from thousands of victims.</p>

<p>The group was responsible for a quarter of all ransomware attacks worldwide last year, and has extorted "over $1 billion from thousands of victims globally," according to the UK government.</p>

<p>The top five countries hit by LockBit were the United States, Britain, France, Germany and China, according to Europol, the European Union's law enforcement agency.</p>

<p>Indonesia has a weak cyber security record, with poor online literacy and frequent leaks.</p>

<p>In 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic, researchers for encryption provider vpnMentor revealed the data of 1.3 million users of a government test-and-trace app had been compromised.</p>

<p>The reveal came just months after the data of more than 200 million participants of the National Health Care and Social Security Agency (BPJS Kesehatan) was allegedly leaked by hackers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Princess Anne, sister of King Charles III, was in hospital on Monday after sustaining "minor injuries and concussion" following an incident at her country home Gatcombe Park, Buckingham Palace said.</p>

<p>"Her Royal Highness remains in Southmead Hospital, Bristol, as a precautionary measure for observation and is expected to make a full and swift recovery," said the statement, adding that the incident occurred late on Sunday.</p>

<p>"The king has been kept closely informed and joins the whole royal family in sending his fondest love and well-wishes to the princess for a speedy recovery," it added.</p>

<p>The 73-year-old royal will remain at the hospital in southwest England "unless or until her medical team advise otherwise".</p>

<p>The princess, a keen horsewoman who competed at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, has taken on extra engagements as the king and his daughter-in-law Catherine, Princess of Wales, both recover from cancer.</p>

<p>But her engagements for the week ahead will be postponed, said Buckingham Palace, including her planned attendance at Tuesday's state banquet for the emperor and empress of Japan.</p>

<p>The grounds of Gatcombe Park are renowned for hosting the Festival of British Eventing every year, which attracts the world's best equestrian stars.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's Princess Anne, the sister of King Charles III, is in hospital after sustaining minor injuries and concussion after an incident in Bristol, Buckingham Palace said on Monday.</p>

<p>The Princess Royal, 73, sustained the injuries at the Gatcombe Park estate on Sunday evening and remains in Bristol's Southmead Hospital as a “precautionary measure”. It is believed there were horses on the estate and the senior royal is likely to have sustained minor head wounds in an incident involving one of the horses.</p>

<p>“The Princess Royal has sustained minor injuries and concussion following an incident on the Gatcombe Park estate yesterday evening,” the palace statement said.</p>

<p>“Her Royal Highness remains in Southmead Hospital, Bristol, as a precautionary measure for observation and is expected to make a full and swift recovery. The King has been kept closely informed and joins the whole royal family in sending his fondest love and well-wishes to the princess for a speedy recovery,” the statement said.</p>

<p>The palace stressed that Princess Anne, one of the senior-most working royals as the monarch's sister, is “recovering well” and is in a comfortable condition.</p>

<p>“On doctors' advice, Her Royal Highness's engagements for the week ahead will be postponed. Her Royal Highness sends her apologies to any who may be inconvenienced or disappointed as a result,” it said, which implies a trip to Canada scheduled for the end of this week is now off.</p>

<p>The Princess will also be unable to attend tomorrow's state banquet organised by her brother in honour of Japanese Emperor Naruhito, who will be visiting the UK this week alongside his wife, the Empress Masako.</p>

<p>Princess Anne was accompanied by husband Sir Tim Laurence, daughter Zara Tindall and her brother Peter Phillips on the estate at the time. Laurence is said to have accompanied his wife to the hospital.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine a future where your phone pings with a message that your dead father's "digital immortal" bot is ready. This promise of chatting with a virtual version of your loved one - perhaps through a virtual reality (VR) headset - is like stepping into a sci-fi movie, both thrilling and a bit eerie.</p>

<p>As you interact with this digital dad, you find yourself on an emotional rollercoaster. You uncover secrets and stories you never knew, changing how you remember the real person.</p>

<p>This is not a distant, hypothetical scenario. The digital afterlife industry is rapidly evolving. Several companies promise to create virtual reconstructions of dead individuals based on their digital footprints.</p>

<p>From artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots and virtual avatars to holograms, this technology offers a strange blend of comfort and disruption. It may pull us into deeply personal experiences that blur the lines between past and present, memory and reality.</p>

<p>As the digital afterlife industry grows, it raises significant ethical and emotional challenges. These include concerns about consent, privacy and the psychological impact on the living.</p>

<p>What is the digital afterlife industry? VR and AI technologies are making virtual reconstructions of our loved ones possible. Companies in this niche industry use data from social media posts, emails, text messages and voice recordings to create digital personas that can interact with the living.</p>

<p>Although still niche, the number of players in the digital afterlife industry is growing.</p>

<p>HereAfter allows users to record stories and messages during their lifetime, which can then be accessed by loved ones posthumously. MyWishes offers the ability to send pre-scheduled messages after death, maintaining a presence in the lives of the living.</p>

<p>Hanson Robotics has created robotic busts that interact with people using the memories and personality traits of the dead. Project December grants users access to so-called "deep AI" to engage in text-based conversations with those who have passed away.</p>

<p>Generative AI also plays a crucial role in the digital afterlife industry. These technologies enable the creation of highly realistic and interactive digital personas. But the high level of realism may blur the line between reality and simulation. This may enhance the user experience, but may also cause emotional and psychological distress.</p>

<p>Digital afterlife technologies may aid the grieving process by offering continuity and connection with the dead. Hearing a loved one's voice or seeing their likeness may provide comfort and help process the loss.</p>

<p>For some of us, these digital immortals could be therapeutic tools. They may help us to preserve positive memories and feel close to loved ones even after they have passed away.</p>

<p>But for others, the emotional impact may be profoundly negative, exacerbating grief rather than alleviating it. AI recreations of loved ones have the potential to cause psychological harm if the bereaved ends up having unwanted interactions with them. It's essentially being subjected to a "digital haunting".</p>

<p>Other major issues and ethical concerns surrounding this tech include consent, autonomy and privacy.</p>

<p>For example, the dead may not have agreed to their data being used for a "digital afterlife".</p>

<p>There's also the risk of misuse and data manipulation. Companies could exploit digital immortals for commercial gain, using them to advertise products or services. Digital personas could be altered to convey messages or behaviours the dead would never have endorsed.</p>

<p>We need regulation To address concerns around this quickly emerging industry, we need to update our legal frameworks. We need to address issues such as digital estate planning, who inherits the digital personas of the dead, and digital memory ownership.</p>

<p>The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) recognises post-mortem privacy rights, but faces challenges in enforcement.</p>

<p>Social media platforms control dead users' data access, often against heirs' wishes, with clauses like "no right of survivorship" complicating matters. Limited platform practices hinder the GDPR's effectiveness. Comprehensive protection demands reevaluating contractual rules, aligning with human rights.</p>

<p>The digital afterlife industry offers comfort and memory preservation, but raises ethical and emotional concerns. Implementing thoughtful regulations and ethical guidelines can honour both the living and the dead, to ensure digital immortality enhances our humanity.</p>

<p>What can we do? Researchers have recommended several ethical guidelines and regulations. Some recommendations include: Obtaining informed and documented consent before creating digital personas from People before they die Age restrictions to protect vulnerable groups Clear disclaimers to ensure transparency And strong data privacy and security measures.</p>

<p>Drawing from ethical frameworks in archaeology, a 2018 study has suggested treating digital remains as integral to personhood, proposing regulations to ensure dignity, especially in re-creation services.</p>

<p>Dialogue between policymakers, industry and academics is crucial for developing ethical and regulatory solutions. Providers should also offer ways for users to respectfully terminate their interactions with digital personas.</p>

<p>Through careful, responsible development, we can create a future where digital afterlife technologies meaningfully and respectfully honour our loved ones.</p>

<p>As we navigate this brave new world, it is crucial to balance the benefits of staying connected with our loved ones against the potential risks and ethical dilemmas.</p>

<p>By doing so, we can make sure the digital afterlife industry develops in a way that respects the memory of the dead and supports the emotional wellbeing of the living.(The Conversation)</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The inherent strength of India-Bangladesh relationship was once again in evidence as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bangladesh-pm-sheikh-hasina-arrives-on-2-day-visit-to-india-5938786">Sheikh Hasina, decided to visit New Delhi</a> days after attending the swearing-in ceremony of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/videos/pm-sheikh-hasina-invites-pm-modi-to-bangladesh-806486">Prime Minister Narendra Modi</a>. The ease with which the top leadership in Delhi and Dhaka now interact and engage each other is a tribute to the manner in which Modi and Hasina have managed to build this important partnership over the last decade, often under very difficult circumstances. If Modi had to contend with the opposition at the state level in West Bengal, where the ruling party decided to veto the Teesta Pact, Hasina had to face the anti-India constituency in Bangladesh. Despite this, both leaders stood firm in their belief that building resilience in this partnership is important for not only bilaterally but also regionally.</p>

<h2><strong>"Trusted Friend"</strong></h2>

<p>On her first official overseas visit to any country since she returned to power earlier this year in January, Hasina underlined: "India is our major neighbour, trusted friend and regional partner. Bangladesh-India relations are growing at a fast pace." Modi reciprocated by highlighting the special nature of this visit: "Because she is our first state guest after our government returned to power for the third term."</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/unilateral-discussions-mamata-banerjee-to-pm-on-bangladesh-talks-5959096">Also Read |&nbsp;"Unilateral Discussions...": Mamata Banerjee To PM On Bangladesh Talks</a></strong></p>

<p>The visit saw the signing of 10 Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs), which covered areas as diverse as digital and green partnerships, maritime cooperation, and, notably, the 'Shared Vision for India-Bangladesh Rail Connectivity'. The joint statement outlined a shared bilateral and regional vision for peace, prosperity and development, driven by connectivity, commerce and collaboration. In that spirit, some important new initiatives were announced, including e-visa for patients from Bangladesh, new train and bus services, joint technical committee for Ganga Water Treaty, visit of an Indian technical team to Bangladesh for a mega project to conserve and manage the Teesta river, export of 40 MW of power from Nepal to Bangladesh through Indian grid, and training of Bangladeshi police officers. Building Bangladesh's defence capability has also emerged as a priority, with the two nations deciding "to explore defence industrial cooperation for modernisation of the Armed Forces of Bangladesh".</p>

<h2><strong>Identifying Opportunities, Counterbalancing China</strong></h2>

<p>Hasina will be visiting China in July. It is a sign of a new maturity in India-Bangladesh relations that the two nations continue to work closely together even as they develop their ties with other nations. New Delhi has not stopped Dhaka from its engagement with China but it has some concerns that Hasina has always ensured are addressed. Since 2020, China has been regularly expressing an interest in the $1 billion project to develop the Teesta river. Last year, Beijing submitted a formal proposal.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/tripura-chief-minister-gifts-500-kg-of-queen-pineapples-to-bangladesh-pm-5952493">Also Read |&nbsp;Tripura Chief Minister Gifts 500 Kg Of Queen Pineapples To Bangladesh PM</a></strong></p>

<p>For Bangladesh, this has been a long-standing priority. The Manmohan Singh government had an agreement in place in 2011, which could not be taken forward due to the opposition from the Chief Minister of West Bengal. For Hasina, the situation had become unsustainable, with the opposition clamouring for a response amidst moves by the Chinese. Her visit before going to China was a wise move to ensure that New Delhi had a chance to respond, and India has done well to respond to the initiative. The decision to send an Indian technical team to Dhaka for talks on the conservation and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-bangladesh-agree-on-mega-project-to-conserve-teesta-river-5947924">management of Teesta river</a> is an indication that New Delhi is not willing to cede its strategic space in the neighbourhood despite domestic challenges. The decision to commence technical negotiations for the renewal of the 1996 Ganga Water Treaty is also a timely move to respond to the concerns in Dhaka on an issue that is a priority for the Hasina government.</p>

<h2><strong>Rock-Solid Ties</strong></h2>

<p>For India, the importance of Bangladesh cannot be overstated as New Delhi seeks to emerge as an Indo-Pacific player with the Bay of Bengal as the regional epicentre. For Bangladesh, a partnership with India remains key to realising its full potential as a critical economic and strategic player in the region. As the two nations become more ambitious in defining their strategic outlooks, their bilateral partnership will continue to be a key enabler in shaping their behaviour.</p>

<p>The China factor, while important, should not be overstated. India-Bangladesh ties today stand on their own merit. Hasina and Modi have ensured that by focusing concrete tangible outcomes for the people of both nations, they have redefined the contours of what an ideal partnership between two neighbours should look like. Mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity have made this relationship an exemplar for all others.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twenty-two people were killed -- including 18 Chinese nationals -- in a massive fire at a South Korean lithium battery factory, the fire department said Monday, one of the country's worst factory disasters in years.</p>

<p>Over 100 people were working in the factory when workers heard a series of explosions from the second floor, where lithium-ion batteries were being inspected and packaged, firefighter Kim Jin-young told media.</p>

<p>In the massive blaze that ensued, twenty-two people were killed, including 20 foreign nationals -- 18 Chinese, one from Laos, and one of unknown nationality, he said.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">?? At least 21 people have died in a fire at a lithium battery plant in South Korea. <a href="https://t.co/kzQKnhbOYf">pic.twitter.com/kzQKnhbOYf</a></p>
— Lord Bebo (@MyLordBebo) <a href="https://twitter.com/MyLordBebo/status/1805187422428315651?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 24, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"Most of the bodies are badly burned so it will take some time to identify each one," he added.</p>

<p>Firefighters are still searching for one more person who remains unaccounted for, he said, adding that they had managed to contain the largest blaze at the plant and get inside.</p>

<p>Firefighters were "doing cooling operations to prevent the fire from expanding to nearby factories," Kim said.</p>

<p>Dozens of fire trucks were lined up outside the factory, an AFP reporter saw, with rescue workers carrying bodies, covered by blue blankets, out of the building on stretchers.</p>

<p>Images shared by Yonhap after the fire broke out showed huge plumes of billowing grey smoke rising into the sky above the factory, with orange flames inside the building.</p>

<p>The vast factory had an estimated 35,000 battery cells on the second floor in storage, with more batteries stored in other areas.</p>

<p>Lithium batteries burn hot and fast, and are difficult to control with conventional fire extinguishing methods.</p>

<p>"Due to fears of additional explosions, it was difficult to enter," Kim said, describing the tricky rescue operation.</p>

<p>"As it is a lithium battery manufacturer, we (had) determined that spraying water will not extinguish the fire, so we (used) dry sand," he added.</p>

<p>The lithium battery plant is owned by Aricell, a South Korean primary battery manufacturer. It is located in Hwaseong city, just south of the capital Seoul.</p>

<p>Shares of Aricell's parent company, S-connect, plunged by over 20 percent on the Seoul exchange by close Monday. S-connect owns 96 percent of Aricell.</p>

<p>Lithium batteries are used in everything from laptops to electric vehicles -- but can be highly explosive, with airlines, for example, imposing strict regulations on checking devices containing them.</p>

<p><strong>'Mobilise all personnel'</strong></p>

<p>South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol issued emergency instructions to authorities, telling them to "mobilise all available personnel and equipment to focus on searching for and rescuing people," his office said.</p>

<p>The president also warned authorities that they should "ensure the safety of firefighters considering the rapid spread of fire".</p>

<p>Authorities in Hwaseong sent out a series of alerts to residents warning them to stay inside.</p>

<p>"There is a lot of smoke due to factory fires. Please pay attention to safety, such as refraining from going out," one alert sent by text message said.</p>

<p>"Factory fire. Please detour to surrounding roads and nearby citizens please close windows," another one read.</p>

<p>South Korea is a major producer of batteries, including those used in electric vehicles.</p>

<p>Its battery makers supply EV makers around the world, including Tesla.</p>

<p>The fire is one of South Korea's worst factory disasters in years.</p>

<p>Previously, it's worst chemical plant accident was in 1989 at the Lucky Chemical factory in Yeosu, Southern Jeolla Province, which resulted in 16 deaths and 17 injuries.</p>

<p>A fire at a warehouse in Icheon in 2020 killed 38 people.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video showing a Ukrainian drone destroying a Russian drone using a stick has gone viral on social media platform X. Posted by the user Special Kherson Cat, it shows the unmanned aerial vehicle hovering a few metres above the ground and another one - claimed to be Russian - moving up. A stick is seen hanging from Ukraine's Mavic drone, which is at a higher altitude. As the Russian drone comes closer, the Ukrainian military piece swings the stick sending the Russian drone crashing to the ground.</p>

<p>"Sustainable warfare, what more could you wish for," commented one user. "This is not exactly what was referred to as fighting with sticks and stones, but here we are," said another.</p>

<p>Others mocked the Ukrainian military for using such primitive weapons to fight a modern warfare.</p>

<p>Drones have become a key piece of technology for both sides in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. According to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-focuses-drone-warfare-military-creates-new-unmanned/story?id=111046806"><em>ABC News</em></a>, Ukraine launched its Unmanned Systems Forces, a new branch of its military focused on drone warfare, in April this year.</p>

<p>Colonel Vadym Sukharevskyi was announced as the new branch's commander.</p>

<p>The DJI Mavic drones were initially used for reconnaissance and dropping grenades. But gradually, they switched to first-person view drones to attack enemy personnel and vehicles.</p>

<p>Shortly after announcing the new defence department, the Ukraine's Ministry of Defence</p>

<p>In the last two years, Ukraine has developed a series of different kinds of aerial, land and water drones to help to fight against the Russians when it doesn't have enough heavy weapons, artillery and jets.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine a future where your phone pings with a message that your dead father's “digital immortal” bot is ready. This promise of chatting with a virtual version of your loved one – perhaps through a virtual reality (VR) headset – is like stepping into a sci-fi movie, both thrilling and a bit eerie.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>As you interact with this digital dad, you find yourself on an emotional rollercoaster. You uncover secrets and stories you never knew, changing how you remember the real person.</p>

<p>This is not a distant, hypothetical scenario. The <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/05/240508201408.htm">digital afterlife industry</a> is rapidly evolving. Several companies promise to create virtual reconstructions of deceased individuals based on their digital footprints.</p>

<p>From artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots and virtual avatars to holograms, this technology offers a strange blend of comfort and disruption. It may pull us into deeply personal experiences that blur the lines between past and present, memory and reality.</p>

<p>As the digital afterlife industry grows, it raises significant <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0335-2">ethical</a> and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-brain-and-value/202009/the-psychology-the-digital-afterlife">emotional challenges</a>. These include concerns about consent, privacy and the psychological impact on the living.</p>

<h2>What is the digital afterlife industry?</h2>

<p>VR and AI technologies are making virtual reconstructions of our loved ones possible. Companies in this niche industry use data from social media posts, emails, text messages and voice recordings to create digital personas that can interact with the living.</p>

<p>Although still niche, the number of players in the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/digital-afterlife">digital afterlife industry</a> is <a href="https://observer.com/2024/05/generative-ai-griefbot-privacy-issue/">growing</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hereafter.ai/">HereAfter</a> allows users to record stories and messages during their lifetime, which can then be accessed by loved ones posthumously. <a href="https://www.mywishes.co.uk/">MyWishes</a> offers the ability to send pre-scheduled messages after death, maintaining a presence in the lives of the living.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hansonrobotics.com/">Hanson Robotics</a> has created robotic busts that interact with people using the memories and personality traits of the deceased. <a href="https://projectdecember.net/">Project December</a> grants users access to so-called “deep AI” to engage in text-based conversations with those who have passed away.</p>

<p>Generative AI also plays a crucial role in the digital afterlife industry. These technologies enable the creation of highly realistic and interactive digital personas. But the high level of realism may blur the line between reality and simulation. This may enhance the user experience, but may also cause emotional and psychological distress.</p>

<h2>A technology ripe for misuse</h2>

<p>Digital afterlife technologies may aid the <a href="https://www.insights.uca.org.au/can-digital-afterlife-technology-help-us-grieve/">grieving process</a> by offering continuity and connection with the deceased. Hearing a loved one's voice or seeing their likeness may provide comfort and help process the loss.</p>

<p>For some of us, these digital immortals could be therapeutic tools. They may help us to preserve positive memories and feel close to loved ones even after they have passed away.</p>

<p>But for others, the emotional impact may be profoundly negative, exacerbating grief rather than alleviating it. AI recreations of loved ones have the potential to cause psychological harm if the bereaved ends up having unwanted interactions with them. It's essentially being subjected to a “<a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/call-for-safeguards-to-prevent-unwanted-hauntings-by-ai-chatbots-of-dead-loved-ones">digital haunting</a>”.</p>

<p>Other <a href="https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/university/news-and-publications/university-of-tuebingen-magazine-attempto/digital-afterlife/">major issues</a> and <a href="https://www.devx.com/news/ethical-dilemmas-surface-with-digital-afterlife-technology/">ethical concerns</a> surrounding this tech include consent, autonomy and privacy.</p>

<p>For example, the deceased may not have agreed to their data being used for a “digital afterlife”.</p>

<p>There's also the risk of misuse and data manipulation. Companies could exploit digital immortals for commercial gain, using them to advertise products or services. Digital personas could be altered to convey messages or behaviours the deceased would never have endorsed.</p>

<h2>We need regulation</h2>

<p>To address concerns around this quickly emerging industry, we need to update our legal frameworks. We need to address issues such as digital estate planning, who inherits the digital personas of the deceased, and digital memory ownership.</p>

<p>The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/">recognises</a> post-mortem <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/">privacy rights</a>, but <a href="https://verfassungsblog.de/data-after-life/">faces challenges in enforcement</a>.</p>

<p>Social media platforms control deceased users' data access, often against heirs' wishes, with clauses like “<a href="https://verfassungsblog.de/data-after-life/">no right of survivorship</a>” complicating matters. Limited platform practices hinder the GDPR's effectiveness. Comprehensive protection demands reevaluating contractual rules, aligning with human rights.</p>

<p>The digital afterlife industry offers comfort and memory preservation, but raises ethical and emotional concerns. Implementing thoughtful regulations and ethical guidelines can honour both the living and the dead, to ensure digital immortality enhances our humanity.</p>

<h2>What can we do?</h2>

<p>Researchers have recommended several <a href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:c059841d-a702-4218-8c1b-39ff49dc6c65/files/mea9feef37e1943dd8446a4013f81d169">ethical guidelines</a> and <a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202403/1308620.shtml">regulations</a>. Some recommendations include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>obtaining informed and documented consent before creating digital personas from people before they die</li>
	<li>age restrictions to protect vulnerable groups</li>
	<li>clear disclaimers to ensure transparency</li>
	<li>and strong data privacy and security measures.</li>
</ul>

<p>Drawing from ethical frameworks in archaeology, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0335-2">a 2018 study</a> has suggested treating digital remains as integral to personhood, proposing regulations to ensure dignity, especially in re-creation services.</p>

<p>Dialogue between policymakers, industry and academics is crucial for developing ethical and regulatory solutions. Providers should also offer ways for users to respectfully terminate their interactions with digital personas.</p>

<p>Through careful, responsible development, we can create a future where digital afterlife technologies meaningfully and respectfully honour our loved ones.</p>

<p>As we navigate this brave new world, it is crucial to balance the benefits of staying connected with our loved ones against the potential risks and ethical dilemmas.</p>

<p>By doing so, we can make sure the digital afterlife industry develops in a way that respects the memory of the deceased and supports the emotional wellbeing of the living.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

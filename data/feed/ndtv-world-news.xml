       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Osama Ahmed's life took a dramatic turn one night in October when the small boat that was to carry him and his father to the English coast sank shortly after setting out from France.</p>

<p>The 20-year-old Syrian was rescued but when he woke up in hospital and asked about his dad nobody knew anything.</p>

<p>Since that moment, Osama has been looking frantically for his father with whom he had hoped to start a new life in Britain.</p>

<p>Beyond the tragically long list of deaths in the Channel of migrants trying to cross, another statistic is also growing fast: Missing people.</p>

<p>"I live in hope of finding him," Osama told AFP in a house in Calais on the French coast where an association, La Margella, put him up. He rejected any idea that his dad may not have survived. "God willing, I will find him," he said.</p>

<p>On the night between October 22 and 23 father and son tried to make it across the water, like 30,000 other migrants this year alone. It was their third attempt.</p>

<p>They were part of a group of around 60 people hiding in the dunes who, at the signal of the people smugglers, rushed to the small boat waiting for them in the water.</p>

<p>But barely one kilometre (1,000 yards) into the journey, water began to seep in.</p>

<p>The group turned the boat around, but the smugglers on the beach pushed them back out to sea, Osama said.</p>

<p>He said they had been promised lifejackets that failed to materialise because, the smugglers claimed, they had been damaged.</p>

<p>The boat's air chambers became completely deflated soon after departure, and everyone on board tumbled into the sea.</p>

<p>For half an hour Osama and his father managed to cling to each other, but when the boat began to disintegrate amid the panic and darkness they were separated.</p>

<p>Two ferries passed without stopping, and eventually, rescue services arrived.</p>

<p>French maritime authorities reported finding three bodies, one woman and two men, after the drama that occurred two kilometres (1.2 miles) off the French coast.</p>

<p>Forty-five people were rescued but survivors reported that there had been more people on board, suggesting that a number had gone missing.</p>

<p>'World's nicest man'</p>

<p>The drama was followed by other, similar incidents, in the Channel and authorities have since found nine bodies floating in the sea or washed up on northern French beaches, none of them the young Syrian's dad.</p>

<p>Osama, who was treated in hospital for burns caused by saltwater and fuel, has been to every police station, hospital and Red Cross office in the area in search of his father, in vain.</p>

<p>He told officials what clothes his dad wore last, and about the ring in which his name is engraved. Police took a sample of Osama's DNA.</p>

<p>Every time a body is found along the coast, Osama fears it could be his father. As the excruciating wait lingers, his life plans are on hold.</p>

<p>His family fled from Syria 13 years ago, to settle in Turkey. Two of Osama's brothers are already in England, having made the journey also in small boats.</p>

<p>He flashed a big smile as he described his dad, "the world's nicest man" and his "role model".</p>

<p>On his phone he has a picture of him, a man in his 50s wearing a white shirt and a jacket, and sporting a grey moustache.</p>

<p>French associations say the authorities should do more to help survivors locate their loved ones after failed crossings.</p>

<p>"People go missing and their families find it very hard to access services that might assist them in their search," said Jeanne Bonnet, co-founder of La Margelle which tries to help migrants navigate French officialdom.</p>

<p>"We sometimes get the feeling that we're being given the runaround," she said.</p>

<p>Osama, she said, was offered no accommodation when he left hospital, injured and traumatised, so he went back to the same camp he had stayed in previously. That's where La Margella took charge of him.</p>

<p>Braving cold temperatures and fog, close to 1,200 migrants have reached England onboard small boats since the beginning of November, according to British official figures.</p>

<p>Sixty people have been confirmed dead this year -- not counting the most recently-discovered bodies and missing people -- a record number since such Channel crossings started in 2018.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The first cargo ship is likely to reach Sri Lanka's Adani-John Keells Holding (JKH) West Container Terminal (WCT) in Colombo Port in the first quarter of 2025, Srilankan news website The Morning Online reported.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first cargo ship is likely to reach Sri Lanka's Adani-John Keells Holding (JKH) West Container Terminal (WCT) in Colombo Port in the first quarter of 2025, Srilankan news website The Morning Online reported quoting JKH chairperson Krishan Balendra.</p>

<p>The vessel's arrival will add 1.5 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) to the port capacity, Mr Balendra said.</p>

<p>The first phase of the WCT is likely to be operational in Q1 of 2025, which will add 1.5 million TEUs to the 8 million TEU capacity at Colombo Port, he said at the JKH investor webinar for Q2 of fiscal 2025.</p>

<p>The first batch of quay and yard cranes for WCT arrived in September, and the cranes' commissioning is expected to be completed by Q4 of 2024, he added.</p>

<p>The JKH quarterly report said the quay length in the first phase will enable simultaneous servicing of two large vessels, which will enable a higher throughput once the first phase is complete.</p>

<p>"The remainder of the terminal is expected to be completed by mid-2026," the report said.</p>

<p>Mr Balendra said the timeframe for operationalising the Sri Lanka Port Authority-run East Container Terminal (ECT) is unclear. Even if ECT becomes operational, only a part of the terminal will become operational, of which the capacity addition to the Colombo Port would not be material, he added.</p>

<p>The ECT project is expected to add a maximum of 2.4 million TEUs capacity to the Colombo Port once fully operationalised.</p><br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has a distinct approach to time and explained why he chooses not to wear a watch. Speaking at a tech event, Mr Huang, whose company Nvidia has seen its valuation skyrocket in recent years, emphasized the value of living in the present moment.</p>

<p>"Very few people know this, but I don't wear a watch. The reason I don't is that now is the most important time. You might be surprised, but I'm not particularly ambitious. I don't aspire to do more; I want to do better at what I'm currently doing. I'm not striving for more-I wait for the world to come to me. Those who know me are aware that Nvidia doesn't have a long-term strategy. We have no grand plan. Our definition of a long-term plan is simply: What are we doing today?"</p>

<p>An Instagram account, @entrepreneursonig, shared a video of Huang discussing his philosophy at the event, with the caption: "Doing more is easy; doing less is hard. Jensen Huang, CEO and co-founder of NVIDIA, shares how he and his company focus on the present, ultimately shaping their future."</p>

<p>In 2023, Huang shared a story from a conversation with a Japanese gardener, which shaped his perspective on the subject. The billionaire recounted meeting a gardener who "lovingly tended to a temple in Kyoto" and managed to maintain the garden's mossy perfection despite the heat, the garden's size, and his small tools. When asked how he did it, the gardener replied, "I have plenty of time."</p>

<p>Huang reflected, "This is the best career advice I can give: Now is the most important time-just focus on the present. I'm rarely chasing things... I'm focused on now. I'm enjoying my job."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Kremlin said Sunday that it saw "positive signals" from US president-elect Donald Trump's position on Ukraine, while warning it was hard to predict how he would behave in office.</p>

<p>"The signals are positive. Trump during his election talked about how he perceives everything through deals, that he can make a deal that can lead to peace," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with state media published Sunday.</p>

<p>But Peskov said it was hard to predict "to what extent he's going to stick to statements that he made on the campaign trail".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In August, it announced plans to reduce its workforce by 15,000 through voluntary separations and layoffs.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Intel is set to resume free coffee and tea for employees following substantial layoffs as part of broader cost-cutting measures. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2024/11/intel-brings-back-workers-free-coffee-seeking-to-stem-declining-morale.html" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>The Oregonian</em></a>, the chip giant shared in an internal message that in-office beverages would return to boost employee morale.</p>

<p>"Although Intel still faces cost challenges, we understand that small comforts play a significant role in our daily routines," the message, seen by <em>The Oregonian</em>, stated. "We know this is a small step, but we hope it is a meaningful one in supporting our workplace culture."</p>

<p>However, free fruit, a perk employees had come to expect, will not be returning, the report noted.</p>

<p>Intel, once a leader in the tech industry, has faced several setbacks that have affected its position. While it played a major role in the PC boom of the 1990s, its focus on personal computers left it trailing in the mobile chip market, enabling Apple to take the lead with the iPhone.</p>

<p>In 2013, former Intel CEO Paul Otellini admitted to regretting his decision to pass on a deal with Apple to produce chips for the iPhone, as Intel had assumed the volume wouldn't justify the costs.</p>

<p>Another missed opportunity came in 2017 and 2018, when Intel declined to invest in OpenAI, now a front-runner in artificial intelligence. OpenAI had sought Intel's backing to reduce dependence on Nvidia's chips and create its own infrastructure. Former CEO Bob Swan reportedly doubted the market viability of generative AI models, contributing to Intel's decision to forgo the investment.</p>

<p>Intel has also faced delays in manufacturing, such as setbacks in 2020 with its 7-nanometer chips, which allowed competitors like Samsung and TSMC to pull ahead.</p>

<p>As its valuation dropped, Intel ramped up cost-cutting measures. In August, it announced plans to reduce its workforce by 15,000 through voluntary separations and layoffs. That month, the company shared a presentation detailing cuts to employee benefits, including reductions in reimbursements for internet, phone, and commuting costs.</p>

<p>In September, Intel informed employees in at least one Oregon office that free beverages and fruits would be discontinued.</p>

<p>"That's petty, right? How much does one piece of fruit per day cost?" a former Intel employee told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/intel-says-its-bringing-back-free-office-coffee-to-boost-morale-after-a-rough-year/articleshow/115064835.cms" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>Business Insider</em></a>.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a tragic incident last week, a married couple in Washington State fatally wounded each other during a violent confrontation in their home while their 11-year-old son played video games in another room, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/09/us-news/parents-brutally-killed-each-other-as-son-11-played-video-games-in-another-room-officials/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>New York Post </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to officials, the boy, wearing earbuds, was unaware of the argument unfolding on Halloween night as his parents fought in the home. He only realized what had happened when he later found their bodies.</p>

<p>The incident occurred on October 31 in Longview, Washington, about 50 miles north of Portland, Oregon. Investigators have been unable to determine which of the two was the primary aggressor, the media outlet reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The victims, identified as Juan Antonio Alvarado Saenz, 38, and Cecilia Robles Ochoa, 39, both suffered fatal injuries. Police reported that Alvarado Saenz died from multiple stab wounds to the chest, while Robles Ochoa had both stab and gunshot wounds, according to the Cowlitz County Sheriff's Office.</p>

<p>After discovering his parents in the kitchen, the boy called 911. Emergency responders arrived but were unable to revive the couple. Authorities confirmed that the boy was the only other person present in the home at the time.</p>

<p>Detectives have since uncovered that Alvarado Saenz and Robles Ochoa had ongoing relationship issues and were planning to separate, according to statements from the sheriff's office.</p>

<p>A knife and a gun were recovered at the scene. The firearm was later confirmed to have been stolen from Alvarado Saenz's employer and had not been reported missing until after the incident.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian troops recently suffered their worst month for casualties since the country's war with Ukraine began almost three years ago, the head of Britain's armed forces said on Sunday.</p>

<p>An average of around 1,500 Russian soldiers were killed or injured per day in October, UK Chief of the Defence Staff Tony Radakin told the BBC.</p>

<p>Russia does not reveal the number of its war dead, but Radakin said last month's toll was the heaviest since Moscow launched the full-scale invasion of its neighbour in February 2022.</p>

<p>"Russia is about to suffer 700,000 people killed or wounded -- the enormous pain and suffering that the Russian nation is having to bear because of (President Vladimir) Putin's ambition," he added.</p>

<p>The armed forces chief acknowledged that Russia was territorial making gains, but said the losses were "for tiny increments of land".</p>

<p>He said the Russian government was spending more than 40 per cent of public expenditure on defence and security, putting "an enormous strain" on the state.</p>

<p>The UK has been one of Ukraine's strongest backers in its fight against Russian aggression, providing Kyiv with billions of pounds in military aid, as well as weapons and troop training.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has reiterated Britain's "ironclad" support for Ukraine, after Donald Trump's US presidential election win raised concerns about western countries' future commitment to backing Kyiv's war effort.</p>

<p>Radakin repeated that the UK would support Ukraine for "as long as it takes".</p>

<p>"That's the message President Putin has to absorb and the reassurance for (Ukrainian) President (Volodymyr) Zelensky," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's capital Dhaka remains tense on Sunday as several Awami League supporters were reportedly beaten following the party's decision to hold a protest march at Shaheed Noor Hossain Square in commemoration of Noor Hossain Day.</p>

<p>The incident took place in front of Sheikh Hasina's party's central office on Bangabandhu Avenue, local media reported.</p>

<p>A political activist and leader of Awami League's youth front, the Jubo League, Noor Hossain was killed on November 10, 1987 during the anti-Ershad movement.</p>

<p>The Awami League's announcement to hold a rally on Sunday afternoon to mark the occasion was its first significant decision since the government led by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was brought down by an uprising on August 5.</p>

<p>In a social media post, the party invited common people and activists, who believe in the "values of the Liberation War and democratic principles", to join the march at Noor Hossain Chattar (Zero Point). It also called for removal of anti-democratic forces and the reestablishment of democratic governance under the leadership of the Bangladesh Awami League.</p>

<p>Immediately after the announcement, Bangladesh's interim government led by Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus made it clear that it will not grant permission to hold the protest rally.</p>

<p>"The Awami League in its current form is a fascist party. There is no way this fascist party will be allowed to hold protests in Bangladesh," said Yunus' Press Secretary Shafiqul Alam.</p>

<p>The anti-discrimination student movement is also holding a counter-gathering at the same venue, demanding trial of the Awami League leaders.</p>

<p>Anticipating violence, the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) said that 191 platoons of the border security forces have been deployed in the country's capital and across the country to maintain law and order on Noor Hossain Day.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[With Donald Trump set to become the next US president after the recently closely contested presidential polls, India and other Asian countries are expected to benefit due to rising US-China tensions and potential investment restrictions.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With Donald Trump set to become the next US president after the recently closely contested presidential polls, India and other Asian countries are expected to benefit due to rising US-China tensions and potential investment restrictions in strategic sectors, as per Moody's Ratings.</p>

<p>"In the Asia-Pacific region, trade and investment flows might be further diverted away from China as the US tightens investments in strategic sectors, which would negatively affect China's economy and consequently dampen regional growth. However, this shift might benefit India and ASEAN countries," the global rating agency said.</p>

<p>The global agency anticipated a significant shift under the Trump administration across fiscal, trade, climate, and immigration issues, departing from the approach of the administration of the current US President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>The rating agency added that Trump could have both legislative and executive avenues to advance his agenda on every front.</p>

<p>It further added that as a candidate, Trump promised tax reform, with plans to make the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, lower the corporate tax rate, and implement income tax relief. These initiatives, along with targeted and broad tariffs, including steep tariffs on Chinese imports, are expected to increase federal deficits.</p>

<p>It highlighted that the US under Trump will adopt a protectionist trade policy, which would be more disruptive and increase the risks to global growth.</p>

<p>"Protectionist measures could disrupt global supply chains and negatively affect sectors that rely on imported materials and goods, such as manufacturing, technology, and retail," it added.</p>

<p>Trump's trade policy approach would likely bring immediate impacts to the manufacturing sector, the credit rating agency said, adding that although a divided Congress might slow down or adjust the scope of such measures.</p>

<p>The climate initiatives of the US are also likely to see reversals as Trump seeks to boost fossil fuel production under the banner of "American energy dominance."</p>

<p>Reduced funding for clean energy projects and a possible withdrawal from the Paris Agreement would undermine the US's commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>While federal support for green technologies may wane, private-sector initiatives and state-level mandates, particularly in renewable energy, are expected to partially offset this shift.</p>

<p>Some industry experts believe market-driven growth in wind and solar could continue, as these energy sources have become cost-competitive in many parts of the country.</p>

<p>"The shift would likely result in renewed support for the fossil fuel industry, reduced funding for clean energy and green technologies, and loosened environmental regulations, including the Environmental Protection Agency's efforts to reduce emissions in the power and auto sectors. It is likely that the Trump administration will withdraw from the Paris Agreement again and reverse commitments to meeting net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050," the agency said.</p>

<p>On the regulatory front, Trump is expected to pursue a lighter approach, as per the Moody's, which will include relaxed rules for small and midsized banks, potentially reducing their capital requirements but also exposing creditors to higher risks.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian police have arrested a 35-year-old Brampton resident on charges of assault with a weapon during a violent demonstration at a Hindu temple in the city, authorities said.</p>

<p>On November 3, a protest occurred at the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton and unverified videos circulating on social media appeared to show demonstrators holding Khalistani flags. The videos showed fistfights and people striking each other with poles on what appears to be the grounds surrounding the temple.</p>

<p>The Peel Regional Police responded to the altercation during the demonstration at the mandir. As tensions between opposing sides increased, the demonstrations became physical and assaultive, a statement said on Saturday.</p>

<p>Police began investigating several offences that occurred during the demonstration, many of which were captured on video; including individuals using flags and sticks to assault people, it said.</p>

<p>Investigators from the 21 Division Criminal Investigations Bureau and Strategic Investigation Team (SIT) have arrested and charged Inderjeet Gosal of Brampton, the Peel Police statement said.</p>

<p>Gosal is the Canada coordinator for the banned group Sikhs for Justice, the Toronto Star reported.</p>

<p>On November 8, 2024, he was arrested and charged with assault with a weapon. He was released on conditions and is to appear at the Ontario Court of Justice in Brampton at a later date, it said.</p>

<p>A SIT dedicated to investigating incidents of criminality during the November 3 and 4 incidents has since been formed.</p>

<p>On November 3, the protesters carrying Khalistani flags clashed with people and disrupted a consular event co-organised by the temple authorities and the Indian Consulate.</p>

<p>The Sunday incident was condemned by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who said every Canadian has the right to practise their faith freely and safely.</p>

<p>India condemned the attack with an expectation that those indulging in violence "will be prosecuted".</p>

<p>In a statement, the Ministry of External Affairs said that New Delhi remains "deeply concerned" about the safety and security of Indian nationals in Canada.</p>

<p>The relations between India and Canada came under severe strain following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of a "potential" involvement of Indian agents in Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing. New Delhi rejected Trudeau's charges as "absurd".</p>

<p>India has been maintaining that the main issue between the two countries is that of Canada giving space to Khalistani elements operating from Canadian soil with impunity.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Afghan Taliban officials will attend a major United Nations climate conference that starts next week, the Afghan Foreign Ministry said on Sunday, the first time they have attended since the former insurgents took power in 2021.</p>

<p>The COP29 climate summit in Azerbaijan's capital Baku will be among the highest-profile multilateral events attended by Taliban administration officials since they took control in Kabul after 20 years of fighting NATO-backed forces.</p>

<p>The UN has not allowed the Taliban to take up Afghanistan's seat at the General Assembly, and Afghanistan's government is not formally recognised by U.N. member states, largely due to the Taliban's restrictions on women's education and freedom of movement.</p>

<p>Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi said officials from the National Environmental Protection Agency had arrived in Azerbaijan to attend the COP conference. The Taliban took over the agency when they returned to power as U.S.-led forces withdrew.</p>

<p>Taliban officials have taken part in U.N.-organised meetings on Afghanistan in Doha, and Taliban ministers have attended forums in China and Central Asia in the past two years.</p>

<p>But the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change's Bureau of the COP has deferred consideration of Afghanistan's participation since 2021, in effect freezing the country out of the talks.</p>

<p>Afghan NGOs have also struggled to attend climate negotiations in recent years.</p>

<p>Host Azerbaijan invited the Afghan environment agency officials to COP29 as observers, enabling them to "potentially participate in periphery discussions and potentially hold bilateral meetings," a diplomatic source familiar with the matter told Reuters.</p>

<p>Because the Taliban are not formally recognised within the U.N. system as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, the source said, the officials cannot receive credentials to take part in the proceedings of full member states.</p>

<p>Azerbaijan's presidency declined to comment.</p>

<p>The Taliban has closed schools and universities to female students over the age of around 12. It also announced a set of wide-ranging morality laws this year that require women to cover their faces in public and restrict their travel outside the home without a male guardian.</p>

<p>The Taliban says it respects women's rights in accordance with its interpretation of Islamic law.</p>

<p>Afghanistan is considered one of the countries worst affected by climate change. Flash floods have killed hundreds this year, and the heavily agriculture-dependent country has suffered through one of the worst droughts in decades. Many subsistence farmers, who make up much of the population, face deepening food insecurity.</p>

<p>Some advocates have criticised international isolation of the Taliban, saying it only hurts the Afghan people.</p>

<p>"Afghanistan is one of the countries that is really left behind on the needs that it has," said Habib Mayar, deputy general secretary of the g7+, an intergovernmental organisation of countries affected by conflict.</p>

<p>"It is a double price that they are paying," Mayar said. "There is lack of attention, lack of connection with the international community, and then there are increasing humanitarian needs."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gunmen attacked a bar in central Mexican city of Queretaro killing 10 people on Saturday, a local security official said. The attackers opened fire inside the Los Cantaritos bar in the city's historic district, according to the head of Queretaro's public security department Juan Luis Ferrusca.</p>

<p>"Emergency services arrived at the scene and confirmed that at least four people armed with long weapons had arrived on board a pickup truck," he said in a video posted on social media.</p>

<p>"Inside, 10 people were reported dead and at least seven more were injured so far," he added.</p>

<p>One suspect was detained and the vehicle used in the attack was found abandoned and set on fire, Ferrusca said.</p>

<p>Queretaro is considered one of the safer cities in Mexico, where spiralling violence, much of it linked to drug trafficking and gangs, has seen more than 450,000 people murdered since 2006.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ukraine's biggest drone strike on the Russian capital since the start of the war forced flights to be diverted from three of the city's major airports.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine attacked Moscow on Sunday with at least 32 drones, the biggest drone strike on the Russian capital since the start of the war in 2022, forcing flights to be diverted from three of the city's major airports and injuring at least one person.</p>

<p>Russian air defences shot down 32 drones flying towards Moscow over the Ramenskoye and Kolomensky districts of the Moscow region, as well as in Domodedovo city, home to one of the city's biggest airports, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said.</p>

<p>"32 drones flying to Moscow have been destroyed," Sobyanin said. He reported no major damage, though Russia's federal air transport agency said the airports of Domodedovo, Sheremetyevo and Zhukovo had diverted flights.</p>

<p>One person was injured.</p>

<p>The airports have since resumed their operations, Russia's aviation watchdog Rosaviatsia said.</p>

<p>Moscow and its surrounding region, with a population of at least 21 million people, is one of the biggest metropolitan areas in Europe, alongside Istanbul.</p>

<p>The Ramenskoye district, some 45 km (30 miles) southeast of the Kremlin, was last targeted in September in what was then Ukraine's biggest attack on the Russian capital, when Russian air defence units destroyed 20 drones.</p>

<p>Unverified video posted on Russian Telegram channels showed drones buzzing across the skyline. Russian officials reported multiple Ukrainian drone attacks in other regions, among them the Kaluga, Bryansk and Orlov regions.</p>

<p>The 2-1/2-year-old war in Ukraine is entering what some officials say could be its final act after Moscow's forces advanced at the fastest pace since the early days of the war and Donald Trump was elected 47th president of the United States.</p>

<p>Trump, who takes office in January, said during campaigning that he could bring peace in Ukraine within 24 hours, but has given few details on how he would seek to do this.</p>

<p>When Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called Trump to congratulate him on his presidential election victory, Tesla CEO and Trump supporter Elon Musk joined the call, according to media reports. Musk owns SpaceX, which provides Starlink satellite communication services that are vital for Ukraine's defense effort.</p>

<p>MOSCOW 'UMBRELLAS'</p>

<p>Kyiv, itself the target of repeated mass drone strikes from Russian forces, has tried to strike back against its vastly larger eastern neighbour with repeated drone strikes against oil refineries, airfields and even the Russian strategic early-warning radar stations.</p>

<p>While the 1,000 km (620 mile) front has largely resembled grinding World War One trench and artillery warfare for much of the war, one of the biggest innovations of the conflict has been drone warfare.</p>

<p>Moscow and Kyiv have both sought to buy and develop new drones, deploy them in innovative ways, and seek new ways to destroy them - from using farmers' shotguns to advanced electronic jamming systems.</p>

<p>Moscow has developed a series of electronic "umbrellas" over Moscow, with additional advanced internal layers over strategic buildings, and a complex web of air defences which shoot down the drones before they reach the Kremlin at the heart of the Russian capital.</p>

<p>Both sides have turned cheap commercial drones into deadly weapons while ramping up their own production. Soldiers on both sides have reported the visceral fear of drones - and both sides have used macabre video footage of fatal drone strikes in their propaganda.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has sought to insulate Moscow from the grinding rigours of the war, has called Ukrainian drone attacks that target civilian infrastructure such as nuclear power plants "terrorism" and has vowed a response.</p>

<p>Moscow, by far Russia's richest city, has boomed during the war, buoyed by the biggest defence spending splurge since the Cold War.</p>

<p>There was no sign of panic on Moscow's boulevards. Muscovites walked their dogs while the bells of the onion-domed Russian Orthodox churches rang out across the capital.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[During the campaign trail, Donald Trump heavily focused on slashing taxes on tips as well as other social security benefits.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">In the recently concluded US presidential election 2024, economic problems were a driving factor for voters, resulting in Donald Trump's return to the White House.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Now, experts have predicted that the President-elect may put more money into the pockets of the Americans through major <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/factbox-what-new-proposals-did-trump-make-during-his-economic-speech-6501352">tax code changes</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">During his campaign trail, Mr Trump put major emphasis on slashing taxes on tips as well as other social security benefits, suggesting a total overhaul of income taxes with the hope of replacing the revenue with tariffs.</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/09/us-news/trump-plans-ambitious-tax-agenda-with-insiders-revealing-how-it-could-put-more-money-in-americans-pockets/" rel="nofollow,noindex">New York Post</a>, the extension and expansion of tax changes are high on Donald Trump's agenda.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Among the wish-list items of the expanded tax cut program, the key focus would be on cutting down corporate tax rates. Earlier, Mr Trump had slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% in 2017. He now plans to bring it down to 15%.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“When you reduce the corporate rate by 2% wages go up 1%, corporations have more money to invest for workers,” the report quoted Grover Norquist, an activist and president of Americans for Tax Reform, as saying.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Not just that, Mr Trump has even promised his voters to reverse a provision of his 2017 <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/president-donald-trump-tax-overhaul-under-intensifying-fire-as-congress-readies-bill-1768800">tax cut package</a> — the $10,000 cap on the famous state and local tax deductions, known as 'SALT'.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This cap majorly targets residents of high-tax 'blue' states wherein the soaring state and local taxes support bloated state bureaucracies. Hence, the promise by Donald Trump to repeal this has the potential to be an early bipartisan win, the New York Post report said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Long Island Democratic Representative Tom Suozzi, a critic of the cap, said he takes Donald Trump at his word, holding him accountable for the promise to eliminate the SALT cap.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"I will work with him and anyone to get things done on behalf of the people,” Mr Suozzi was quoted as saying.</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, insiders have suggested that this repeal can be a significantly heavier lift. “The major problem is it pits high tax states against low tax states. Phil Magness, an economic historian at the Independent Institute, said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Noting that regions like New York, California and New Jersey have high state and local tax rates, Magness said it gives those who live there an advantage in their deductions against the ones who are residing in low-tax areas like Florida or Texas.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A 24-year-old American YouTuber, named Johnny Somali, has apologised after getting involved in a highly controversial incident in Korea.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Mr Somali sparked massive outrage when he kissed the statue of a girl, symbolising Korean victims of wartime sexual slavery, during his visit to Changdong History and Culture Park in Seoul's Dobong district, <a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2024/11/113_385960.html" rel="nofollow noindex">The Korea Times</a> reported.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The apology was shared on the YouTube channel Company on Thursday. In the video, Mr Somali can be seen standing next to the girl's statue and apologising to the Korean public.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"I want to apologise to Koreans. I didn't understand the significance of the statue," Mr Somali said.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Further, Mr Somali explained that his actions were to entertain his viewers in the US. While bowing down, he added in Korean, "I'm truly sorry for being disrespectful."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Mr Somali has also expressed his interest in learning more about the history of Japan's wartime sex slavery and the victims, who are also known as the "comfort women". In the video, Mr Somali shared his willingness to meet the survivors in person and interview them to learn more about their history.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Despite the apology many viewers have expressed doubt on Mr Somali, noting that he has shared multiple controversial photographs and videos on his social media accounts.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Several people have highlighted that Mr Somali hasn't deleted the images and videos of his controversial actions from social media.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">This is not the first time when Mr Somali faced criticism for his actions. A while back, he shared a photograph of himself holding an image of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and said, "I defeated Koreans for you, Shinzo Abe."&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">While the post on YouTube was later deleted, it continued to be visible on Instagram with the caption, "RIP Shinzo Abe, I defeated the Koreans for you!"</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some Asian countries stand to gain if US president-elect Donald Trump pushes ahead with his promised massive tariffs on China and triggers a new wave of factory relocations to the rest of the region.</p>

<p>But a trade war between the world's biggest economies would also destabilise markets everywhere, with Asia -- which contributes the largest share of global growth -- the most affected.</p>

<p>Trump, who won a crushing presidential victory this week, vowed during his campaign to slap 60 per cent tariffs on all Chinese goods entering the United States in an attempt to balance trade between the two nations.</p>

<p>Analysts however question whether the new president will stick to such a high figure, and dispute the blow such tariffs could inflect on the Chinese economy, estimating GDP could be lowered by between 0.7 per cent and 1.6 per cent.</p>

<p>The cooling effect would also make waves throughout Southeast Asia, where production chains are closely linked to China and enjoy significant investment from Beijing.</p>

<p>"Lower US demand for Chinese goods due to higher tariffs on China will translate into lower demand for ASEAN exports, even if there aren't US tariffs levied directly onto those economies," said Adam Ahmad Samdin, of Oxford Economics.</p>

<p>Indonesia is particularly exposed through its strong exports of nickel and minerals, but China is also the top trading partner of Japan, Taiwan and South Korea.</p>

<p>In addition to China, Donald Trump has also warned of an increase of 10 to 20 per cent on duties for all imports, as part of his protectionist policies and fixation that other countries take advantage of the US.</p>

<p>"The extent of these effects likely depends on the direct exposure of each economy to the US," said Samdin, who added that America accounts for a 39.1 per cent share of Cambodian exports, 27.4 per cent from Vietnam, 17 per cent from Thailand and 15.4 per cent from the Philippines.</p>

<h3><strong>India to be targeted?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Trump first slapped China with heavy tariffs in 2018 during his first administration, leading to the emergence of "connector countries", through which Chinese companies passed their products to avoid American taxes.</p>

<p>Those countries could be in the line of fire now.</p>

<p>"Vietnam's electronics exports to the US could also be targeted by Trump, in a bid to halt the diversion of Chinese electronic products to the US via Vietnam since 2018," said Lloyd Chan, a senior analyst at MUFG, Japan's largest bank.</p>

<p>"This is not inconceivable. Trade rewiring has notably gained traction in the region's electronics value chain."</p>

<p>"India could itself become a target of protectionist measures by the US due to the large share of Chinese components in Indian products," added Alexandra Hermann, an economist with Oxford Economics.</p>

<p>Trump could also impose higher tariffs on Indian goods in sectors such as "automobiles, textiles, pharmaceuticals and wines, which could make Indian exports less competitive in the US", said Ajay Srivastava of the New Delhi-based Global Trade Research Initiative.</p>

<p>A trade war would be dangerous for India, said Ajay Sahai, director of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations.</p>

<p>"Trump is a transactional person. He may target higher tariffs on certain items of Indian exports so he can negotiate for lower tariffs for US products in India," he told AFP.</p>

<h3><strong>Supply chain rejig&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In the medium term, these negative effects could be counterbalanced by establishing factories outside China to escape the fallout.</p>

<p>The "China+1" strategy initiated during Donald Trump's first term saw production shifts to India, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.</p>

<p>With its geographical position and cheap skilled labour, Vietnam has already been one of the main beneficiaries.</p>

<p>The country has notably received investments from Taiwanese Apple subcontractors Foxconn and Pegatron and South Korea's Samsung, becoming the second-largest exporter of smartphones in the world behind China.</p>

<p>"The likelihood increases that even more businesses will want to... have a second, or third, production base outside China," said Bruno Jaspaert, chairman of the European Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam.</p>

<p>Chinese firms themselves are investing massively from Vietnam to Indonesia in sectors including solar, batteries, electric vehicles and minerals.</p>

<p>"American companies and investors are very interested in opportunities in Vietnam and this will continue under the incoming Trump Administration," said Adam Sitkoff, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi.</p>

<p>But whether it is low-end or high-tech production, China's competitive advantage in terms of price, scale and quality is difficult to reproduce, warns Nomura Bank.</p>

<p>A reorganisation of production chains could lead to a "loss of efficiency" and increased prices, "with a negative impact on global growth", Thomas Helbling, deputy director of the IMF for Asia, recently explained to AFP.</p>

<p>Asian countries could therefore gain export market share but ultimately see their situation deteriorate amid weakening global demand.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A political analyst in the US called Donald Trump's victory ‘magic realism'. Intellectuals in America are in shock. They are aghast to see the margin of Trump's victory and are trying to figure out the reason. They are struggling to understand if it is the defeat of elite politics or a rejection of democracy as was being played out in America. But what surprised me more was the reaction of certain sections in India. Instead of mourning the defeat of an Indian-origin candidate, they are celebrating the victory of an American Christian, supported by an evangelical church. These are the same people who were angry when Hindus were targeted in Bangladesh and in Canada by the ‘forces of evil'.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kamala Harris is the daughter of a Hindu mother. She is proud of her Hindu origin. A Hindu woman who went on to become the Vice President of America and finally a candidate for the post of president, is a remarkable story. Unlike Hillary Clinton, she is not the product of entitlement or member of American establishment; she is an outlier who rose from humble background to become the Vice President of America by sheer grit, talent and hard work.</p>

<h2><strong>Why Are Indians Happy?</strong></h2>

<p>But why are these people happy in her defeat? Is it because she did not pay any lip service to Bangladeshi Hindus, like Trump did? Or is it because the politics of Kamla Harris—she is not divisive and she talks about democracy and constitutionalism—makes these people uncomfortable? Is it because she does not support the politics of majoritarianism? Or that she speaks for people of all faiths and does not discriminate between people on the basis of their race and gender? Or is it because she does not crack crass and sexist jokes like Trump does?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Those who are celebrating Trump assuming that he is a friend of India and that India will benefit from his presidency are living in a fool's paradise. They are victims of false consciousness and prisoners of a fantasy. It is important to remember that Trump is an American and the President of the United States. His promise is to make America great again—not India. Any steps Trump takes to fulfil his promise of making America great again will likely come at India's expense, as well as that of the rest of the world. If taking strong measures against India becomes necessary, he will not hesitate to do so.</p>

<h2><strong>Trump Politics Is Transactional</strong></h2>

<p>We must remember that his politics is not doctrinaire but purely transactional. India will soon face the impact of his cynicism. He will likely impose restrictions on the entry of Indians into the United States, with the H1B visa program being the first casualty. Trade with the US will become more challenging as he will pressure the Indian government to "cut tariffs" and may even "impose higher tariffs on Indian goods". Even before his election, he had grouped India with Brazil and China on the issue of tariffs and called India a "very big abuser of tariffs". If he follows through on his promise to expel immigrants—a major commitment to his American voters—Indians will not be exempt.</p>

<p>However, the situation would have been similar with Kamala Harris too. Had she been elected president, she would have also prioritised America's interests, despite her Indian heritage. Therefore, regardless of who wins, India has no reason to celebrate. India must focus on protecting its national interests, and it is always preferable to deal with a leader who is predictable and stable. Trump, however, is an unpredictable figure with an unstable character and did not have a clean record during his first term as president.</p>

<h2><strong>Trump's Biggest Supporters?&nbsp;Conservative Christians&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>I am sure those who are rejoicing Trump's victory must be aware that Trump represents a revival of ‘Christian nationalism', which many like Bishop Michael Curry called a ‘threat to America's soul'. The&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em> reported, “He (Trump) says he will affirm that God made only two genders, male and female. He will create a task force to fight anti-Christian bias. And he will give enhanced access to conservative Christian leaders, if they elect him.” He says, “We have to save religion.” The New York Times writes, “And for nearly a decade, right-wing Christian power has intensified, largely under Mr Trump's watch. He won the White House in 2016 promising that “Christianity will have power.”</p>

<p>Trump's strongest support comes from Middle America, a bastion of conservative Christians. In this election, evangelical churches were especially active among Latin American Christians—who traditionally vote for the Democratic Party—convincing them to support Trump. And they succeeded. More than 40% of Latinos backed Trump, contributing significantly to his substantial victory margin.</p>

<p>Does this mean that those in India who champion Hindu nationalism are now endorsing the rise of Christian nationalism? If so, why do proponents of Hindutva decry Christianity, alongside Islam, as an inimical force threatening India's unity and integrity, alleging that it channels millions of dollars to convert Hindus to Christianity?</p>

<h2><strong>What Golwalkar Said</strong></h2>

<p>It is worth remembering that long ago, Golwalkar, a father figure of Hindutva, named Christians as one of the three enemies of India and accused Christian missionaries of working under the guise of humanitarian aid to make India a Christian land. He wrote, “Such is the role of Christian gentlemen residing in our land today, out to demolish not only the religious and social fabric of our life but also to establish political domination in various pockets and, if possible, all over the land.” He further stated, “Wherever they have stepped, they have drenched those lands with the blood and tears of the natives and liquidated whole races. Do we not know the heart-rending stories of how they annihilated the natives in America, Australia, and Africa?”</p>

<p>I don't know whether the RSS has changed its stance on Christian missionaries or their ideology. Nor do I know if the RSS has reached some form of truce with Christian nationalism. The undeniable fact is that Trump's America subscribes to the notion of a clash of civilisations and champions Christian causes. Despite its best intentions, Hindu nationalism cannot align with Trump's Christian nationalism without undermining the very ideology of Hindutva. This raises the question: why is there so much support for Trump?</p>

<p>Is it not ironic that, on one hand, followers of Hindutva issue a clarion call in India for Hindu unity, while on the other, they are unwilling to support a woman of Hindu origin who has achieved significant success abroad—something that should inspire pride among Hindus? Does this not point to a kind of ideological confusion and contradiction within the movement that claims to make India great and position it as a&nbsp;<i>Vishwaguru</i>? This deserves serious contemplation.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Many people believe that the White House is named after its 'white' colour.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The White House, one of the most iconic buildings worldwide, has served as the official residence and workplace of the US President for more than 200 years. President-elect Donald Trump will be moving into the White House with his family in January next year. The 78-year-old defeated Democrat Kamala Harris in the November 5 elections.</p>

<p dir="ltr">A question that keeps doing rounds is why this famous building has been termed as "The White House"? While many believe that it must be due to its white colour, this does not fully explain the logic.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>War of 1812</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">There is a misconception that the building was painted white for the first time to cover the marks left by British soldiers, who had burned it down on August 24, 1814, two years after the war broke out.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The often-told story suggests that the building was painted white to hide these marks. Though it looks like an interesting story, it is not true.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The colour of the White House has been white since the very beginning when the first US President George Washington selected the location for the White House in 1791. The cornerstone was laid the following year with its design being given by Irish-born architect James Hoban. After eight years of construction, President John Adams and his wife Abigail became the first to move in -- though it was still unfinished at that time.</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to the White House Historical Association, the building received a lime-based whitewash in 1798 to protect its "sandstone exterior from moisture and cracking during winter freezes."&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Official name</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">While there was no official name for the building in the beginning, the term “White House” was occasionally used by many throughout the nineteenth century, besides other names like “President's House” and the “Executive Mansion.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">This term became official on October 17, 1901, when then US President Theodore Roosevelt's secretary George Cortelyou sent a letter to Secretary of State John Hay.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">On Roosevelt's direction, the official was asked to change headings or date lines of all official papers and documents requiring the president's signature, from ‘Executive Mansion' to ‘White House'.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Since then, the 'White House' has been the official name of the US President's residence, which after multiple expansions now has 132 rooms, 35 bathrooms as well as six levels.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tens of thousands of people demonstrated in the eastern Spanish city of Valencia on Saturday over regional authorities' handling of devastating floods that killed more than 220 people in one of Europe's worst natural disasters for decades.</p>

<p>In the latest demonstration over the floods, protesters filled the centre of Valencia demanding the resignation of regional government leader Carlos Mazon and chanting "Killers!".</p>

<p>"Our hands are stained with mud, yours with blood," read one banner. Some demonstrators dumped dirty boots outside the government building while others plastered it with mud.</p>

<p>Residents in stricken areas accuse Mazon of issuing an alert too late, at 8 p.m. on Oct. 29, well after water was already pouring into many nearby towns and villages.</p>

<p>The Valencian leader has said he would have issued an earlier alarm earlier if authorities had been notified of the seriousness of the situation by an official water monitoring body. Mazon did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.</p>

<p>"We want to show our indignation and anger over the poor management of this disaster which has affected so many people," said Anna Oliver, president of Accio Cultural del Pais Valenciano, one of about 30 groups that organised the protest.</p>

<p>Though the demonstration was largely peaceful, police charged stone-throwing protesters at one point and objects hurled at the city council building caused minor damage.</p>

<p>Following days of storm warnings from the national weather service from Oct. 25 onward, some municipalities and local bodies raised the alarm much earlier than the regional government.</p>

<p>For example, Valencia University told its staff on Oct. 28 not to come to work. Several town halls suspended activities, shut down public facilities and told people to stay home.</p>

<p>Weather service AEMET raised its threat level for heavy rains in the area to a red alert at 7:36 a.m. on Oct. 29.</p>

<p>Nearly 80 people are still missing in what is the most deadly deluge in a single European country since floods in Portugal in 1967 killed around 500.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moscow called on the United States Sunday to "take stock" of its "policies of incitement to hatred", while using the assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump to denounce support for Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Addressing "those who vote in the United States to supply arms" to Kyiv, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova denounced support for Kyiv, which she said stoked "attacks against the Russian president".&nbsp;</p>

<p>She added that "perhaps it would be better to use this money to fund the American police and other services that are supposed to ensure law and order in the United States?"&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Trump victory in the November elections would put into question continued US support for Ukraine as it resists the Russian offensives launched in 2022.</p>

<p>The Republican Party candidate has suggested that he would end the conflict very quickly if he won back the presidency, which Kyiv fears would mean it would be forced to negotiate with Moscow from a weakened position.</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin has said he takes Trump's comments about ending the war "very seriously".</p>

<p>Zakharova added that "when other means of getting rid of troublesome president are exhausted, good old Lee Harvey Oswald comes into play", referring to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, a source of numerous conspiracy theories including that his death was ordered from within the US state apparatus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The JFK assassination commission concluded in 1964 that Lee Harvey Oswald, a former Marine who had lived in the Soviet Union, had acted alone.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's campaign team has announced plans to bolster security protocols to ensure his safety after the former US president was injured in a shooting incident at an election rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, was injured on Saturday after being shot in the ear during an apparent assassination attempt during a Republican Party campaign event in Butler, Pennsylvania. The 20-year-old male attacker was shot and killed by a member of the Secret Service.</p>

<p>Following the incident, Trump's campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said the campaign would be employing additional security measures, CNN reported.</p>

<p>Wiles and LaCivita told staffers in a new memo that they "remain horrified" at the attack. They added that they "hope that this horrendous act will bring our team, and indeed the nation, together in unity and we must renew our commitment to safety and peace for our country".</p>

<p>"We condemn all forms of violence, and will not tolerate dangerous rhetoric on social media," the memo said.</p>

<p>The campaign managers said the Republican National Convention will continue as planned in Milwaukee, "where we will nominate our President to be the brave and fearless nominee of our Party".</p>

<p>Republican delegates will nominate Trump as the party's candidate in the November 5 presidential election against the nominee of the Democratic Party, which till late last month was thought to be incumbent US President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>However, after his disastrous performance against Trump at the first presidential debate, pressure has mounted on 81-year-old Biden to quit the race and allow someone else from the party to contest against the former president.</p>

<p>"In moments of tragedy and horror, we must be resolute in our mission to reelect President Trump," the memo reads.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The shooting at an election rally in Pennsylvania's Butler last evening has left former US President Donald Trump injured and the Joe Biden administration red-faced. While several prominent voices from the US have questioned the security preparations at the rally venue, some Republican leaders have gone a step ahead and targeted Biden.</p>

<p>In his first response after the assassination attempt, Trump thanked the Secret Service and law enforcement authorities for their swift response, but added, "It is incredible that such an act can take place in our country." Trump has said a bullet pierced his right ear. One person in the audience was killed and two others critically injured in the shooting. The gunman, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, was gunned down.&nbsp;</p>

The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs.<br />

<p>Republican senator JD Vance, who could be Trump's running mate in the US election due later this year, said the shooting is "not just some isolated incident". "The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination," he said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Republican leader and Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene alleged that the Democrats want Trump and his supporters dead.</p>

<p>"Joe Biden told donors it's 'time to put Trump in a bull's eye,' and that is EXACTLY what happened. House Democrats, led by Bennie Thompson, introduced a bill to strip USSS protection from President Trump.</p>

<p>"The weaponized DOJ has done everything they can to make sure President Trump spends the rest of his life in PRISON, while sending non-violent J6ers (those involved in the Capitol attack on January 6,2021) to jail for years. They want President Trump and his supporters dead. We won't forget," she told a TV channel. In a separate post on X, she said, "The Democrats and the media are to blame for every drop of blood spilled today. For years and years, they've demonized him and his supporters."</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden has strongly condemned the incident. White House officials said he has also spoken to the Republican leader, his arch-rival in this election, after the shooting.</p>

<p>"There's no place in America for this kind of violence. It's sick. It's sick. It's one of the reasons why we have to unite this country... We cannot be like this, we cannot condone this," Biden told reporters in an emergency briefing after the attack on Trump.</p>

<p>"The idea that there's political violence, or violence in America like this, is just unheard of. It's just not appropriate. Everybody, everybody must condemn it. Everybody," Biden said.</p>

<p>Vice-President Kamala Harris too has slammed the shooting. "I have been briefed on the shooting at former President Trump's event in Pennsylvania. Doug and I are relieved that he is not seriously injured. We are praying for him, his family, and all those who have been injured and impacted by this senseless shooting."</p>

<p>We are grateful to the United States Secret Service, first responders, and local authorities for their immediate action. Violence such as this has no place in our nation. We must all condemn this abhorrent act and do our part to ensure that it does not lead to more violence," she said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Michael Whatley, chairman of the Republican National Committee, has said in a statement that the former President is doing well and is grateful to law enforcement and first responders.</p>

<p>"President Trump looks forward to joining you all in Milwaukee as we proceed with our convention to nominate him to serve as the 47th President of the United States. As our party's nominee, President Trump will continue to share his vision to Make America Great Again," he said in a statement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, fired shots, one of which grazed Trump in the ear at an outdoor rally in Butler. Thomas Matthew Cooks was planted on the roof of a manufacturing plant located over 300 feet away from the stage at Butler Farm Show grounds, the New York Post reported, citing sources.</p>

<p>The US Secret Service snipers shot him, and an AR-style rifle was later recovered. Bethel Park is a village 40 miles south of where Trump's rally was held in Butler. Crooks' motive behind firing on the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is unclear.</p>

<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is leading the investigation into the shooting incident at former US President Donald Trump's rally.</p>

<p>In a statement posted on X, Shapiro stated, "Under the protection of US Secret Service and with the assistance of the Pennsylvania State Police, former President Trump has now left the Butler area.

Federal law enforcement officials will continue to lead on the investigation into the shooting of former President Trump. Pennsylvania State Police will lead the investigation into the shooting of the other victims."</p>

<p>"I have been in regular communication with law enforcement on the ground in Pennsylvania and have spoken with President Biden who offered his full support. As we wait to learn more from the investigations, I am mindful of just how painful and shocking this event is to so many of our fellow Pennsylvanians. I respectfully ask that we treat our fellow Americans with respect and join together to universally condemn the unacceptable violence we witnessed earlier today in Butler," he added.</p>

<p>A shooting at a Pennsylvania rally on Saturday (local time) that injured Trump has heightened concerns about political violence and increased awareness regarding past attacks and assassination attempts against presidents and candidates, CBS News reported.</p>

<p>According to a 2008 report compiled by the Congressional Research Service, direct assaults against presidents, presidents-elect, and candidates have occurred on 15 separate occasions, with five resulting in death, according to CBS News. Of the 45 individuals serving as president, 13 have been subject to actual or attempted assassinations. The number does not include the shooting incident that involves Trump.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">SpaceX has confirmed that 20 satellites – blasted off the Flacon 9 rocket from California, US on Thursday — will crash back to Earth. The company said that there had been a liquid oxygen leak developed in the second stage.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">In a statement released on its <a href="https://www.spacex.com/launches/mission/?missionId=sl-9-3">official website</a>, the company said, “Falcon 9's second stage performed its first burn nominally, however a liquid oxygen leak developed on the second stage. After a planned relight of the upper stage engine to raise perigee – or the lowest point of orbit – the Merlin Vacuum engine experienced an anomaly and was unable to complete its second burn.”</p>

<p>SpaceX, in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter), shared details about its team's effort to contact the&nbsp;satellites. It said, “SpaceX has made contact with 5 of the satellites so far and is attempting to have them raise orbit using their ion thrusters.”</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">During tonight's Falcon 9 launch of Starlink, the second stage engine did not complete its second burn. As a result, the Starlink satellites were deployed into a lower than intended orbit.<br />

SpaceX has made contact with 5 of the satellites so far and is attempting to have them…</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>In a follow-up post, SpaceX said that the team was able to get in touch with 10 of the satellites. “The team made contact with 10 of the satellites and attempted to have them raise orbit using their ion thrusters, but they are in an enormously high-drag environment with their perigee, or lowest point of their elliptical orbit, only 135 km above the Earth.”</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Explaining the possible reasons behind the satellite failure, the company said, “Each pass through perigee removes 5+ km of altitude from the highest point in the satellite orbit. At this level of drag, our maximum available thrust is unlikely to be enough to successfully raise the satellites.”</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An "aggressive" United Airlines passenger was caught on camera biting a flight attendant after a plane departed from Miami this week.</p>

<p>United Flight 762 left Miami International Airport in Florida on Tuesday evening, bound for Newark, New Jersey, but had to make an unexpected diversion to Orlando after the unnamed female passenger started causing chaos on board.</p>

<p>United Airlines told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/united-airlines-passenger-bite-miami-plane-b2577946.html"><em>The Independent </em></a>in a statement that the passenger became "aggressive and disruptive," prompting the flight attendants to "work to de-escalate the situation and protect other customers."</p>

<p>Cellphone footage of the incident, obtained by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/07/10/woman-bites-flight-attendant-rips-vest-meltdown-united-flight-orlando/"><em>TMZ</em></a>, depicts a woman screaming and using profanity towards other passengers while flight crew members attempt to restrain her in the aisle.</p>

<p>Flight attendants are shown attempting to calm the situation by securing zip-ties around her wrists, but the footage also captures the woman attempting to bite the shirt of one of the crew members.</p>

<p>"Let go of me; I'm a f****** girl. What are you gonna do, kill me?" the woman appears to say in the footage.</p>

<p>"These people have an attitude problem, and they don't f****** do their jobs. They're handcuffing me. Why are you handcuffing me?' she yells.</p>

<p>In addition, the woman is heard shouting profanities and making threats toward someone off-camera in the video.</p>

<p>Later in the footage, police officers are seen boarding the plane and escorting the woman off, prompting applause from fellow passengers.</p>

<p>United Airlines told The Independent that the flight crew opted to divert to Orlando, where law enforcement awaited to remove the woman from the aircraft.</p>

<p>A spokesperson from the Orlando Police Department informed FOX 35 that the passenger was taken to a local hospital for a medical assessment, noting that no arrest had been made as of Wednesday.</p>

<p>The Independent has reached out to the Orlando Police Department for additional details.</p>

<p>The disruptive incident resulted in a three and a half hour delay for the flight, as a new crew had to be assembled in Orlando, according to WSVN.</p>

<p>The reason behind the woman's sudden onset of "aggressive" behavior during the flight remains unclear.</p>

<p>As of 2024, the Federal Aviation Administration has received 893 reports of unruly passengers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Those who attended Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania last night -- and were witnesses to a shocking assassination attempt -- were not allowed to carry purses and security checks took nearly two hours, a woman who was at the gathering has told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/13/2024-election-campaign-updates-biden-trump-rally/#author-box">The Washington Post</a>.</p>

<p>Fifty-one-year-old Melissa Shaffert is an English teacher and went to the rally at Butler with her boyfriend. She usually carried a concealed firearm and knife, but left them at home yesterday because she knew they wouldn't be allowed. Purses were not allowed and it took them 1-2 hours to get through the scanners, she has told the Post. "They took everything out and they took their time," she said.</p>

<p>About 50 feet from the stage, she said, were two tractors and giant combines. "I thought: 'I'm sure glad no one can get a weapon in here because someone could stand on the [equipment] and we'd be sitting ducks,'" she said hours after the former President was shot at. While Trump suffered a bullet injury in his right ear, one of those attending the rally died and two others were critically injured in the shooting.</p>

<p>Shaffert recounted that the Republican leader had started talking about illegal immigration when she heard loud, abrupt sounds and thought they were fireworks. She then heard "whistles" and "whizzes."</p>

<p>"I thought: That's bullets. I said: 'Get your head down!'"</p>

<p>She said that chaos broke out as the crowd realised that they were caught in a shooting and that she did not immediately realise that Trump was injured. "People were laying on the ground Then everyone was staying calm and helping each other get up. People were like: 'Are you OK? Are you OK?'" Shaffert said.</p>

<p>Shaffert and her boyfriend somehow managed to make their way to the car and left the spot. It's only when they reached home that they realised the extent of what had happened.</p>

<p>"It's devastating. That a presidential nominee has been shot is unbelievable," she told the Post. "It's very scary. I don't feel like proper precautions are being taken," she added.</p>

<p>The FBI, which is investigating the assassination attempt, has identified 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks as the shooter. He was gunned down soon after the shooting.</p>

<p>Asked how the gunman was able to fire several shots before he was neutralised, FBI Special Agent in Charge Kevin Rojek said it was "surprising". Asked about security, he said Secret Service "needs to answer that question."</p>

<p>"They do the initial security assessments and determine where the different security locations should be. And they're the ones who are in charge of securing the scene," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has identified <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-rally-shooting-who-was-thomas-matthew-crooks-man-who-tried-to-assassinate-donald-trump-6102487" target="_blank">Thomas Matthew Crooks</a> as the suspected shooter behind the attempted assassination of former US President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bullet-pierced-upper-part-of-my-right-ear-donald-trump-on-shooting-at-rally-6101088" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a>, it said in a statement today.</p>

<p>Crooks, 20, was killed by security officials when he allegedly opened fire at the 78-year-old Republican presidential candidate, injuring his ear, during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was registered as a Republican, according to the state's voter records.</p>

<p>"The FBI has identified Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, as the subject involved in the assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump on July 13, in Butler, Pennsylvania," the FBI said in a statement quoted by NBC and CBS.</p>

<p>Law enforcement officials earlier told reporters they had tentatively identified the suspected shooter but were not ready to do so publicly. They also said they had not yet identified the motive. The FBI,&nbsp;which is the lead federal law enforcement agency in the investigation,&nbsp;had said the shooting was being treated as "an assassination attempt" against the former president.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-assassination-attempt-donald-trump-shooting-on-identity-and-motive-of-donald-trump-rally-shooter-fbi-gives-an-update-6101826" target="_blank">Trump</a> was hit in the ear in the shocking shooting,&nbsp;which left a bystander dead and two others critically injured. He was quickly rushed off stage by the US Secret Service agents, with blood seen on his face.</p>

<p>The gunshots were heard when Trump had just started speaking at his final rally before the Republican National Convention.</p>

<p>Thousands of his supporters were in attendance when the shooting, which was captured live on news channels, happened.</p>

<h3><strong>Donald Trump Says Bullet Pierced Part Of Right Ear</strong></h3>

<p>Donald Trump, in his first account of being attacked during a rally, said, "I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear."</p>

<p>"I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin," Trump said on his Truth Social site.</p>

<p>"Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening," he added.</p>

<p>He also thanked the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/video-secret-service-snipers-in-action-after-shots-fired-at-donald-trump-6101405" target="_blank">Secret Service</a> and law enforcement for their "rapid response".</p>

<p>"It is incredible that such an act can take place in our country," he said.</p>

<p>The shocking incident occurred less than four months before the November 5 US presidential election, when Trump is set to face an election rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The world woke up to a shooting incident that took place during former US President Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. As per the 78-year-old's communications director Steven Cheung, he is "fine and is being checked out at a local medical facility.”</p>

<p>While world leaders have expressed their shock and condemned such an act of violence, a section of people on X (formerly Twitter) has tried to lighten the mood by referring the incident to the all-time hit show&nbsp;The Simpsons.&nbsp;For context,&nbsp;The Simpsons&nbsp;is known for its bizarre predictions.</p>

<p>It all started after a user claimed that Donald Trump's shooting incident was predicted by&nbsp;The Simpsons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sharing a set of screenshots from the episode, the user said, “Simpsons got some explaining to do.”</p>

<p>He added, “It is incredible that such an act can take place in our Country. Nothing is known at this time about the shooter, who is now dead.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Security agencies in the US have identified the shooter behind the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, but are yet to share details on the motive behind the crime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The FBI has identified 20-year-old&nbsp;Thomas&nbsp;Matthew&nbsp;Crooks as the "subject involved" in the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, the agency said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier, at a press briefing, FBI Special Agent Kevin Rojek said, "At this time, we are not prepared to identify who the shooter is. We are close to that identification. As soon as we are 100 per cent confident who that individual is, we will share it with the press."</p>

<p>The FBI official also said they are not yet sure of the motive behind the assassination attempt, that has also left one person dead and two others critically injured.</p>

<p>"We do not currently have an identified motive, although our investigators are working tirelessly to attempt to identify what that motive was," he said.</p>

<p>The FBI is the lead federal law enforcement agency in the investigation into the assassination attempt.</p>

<p>The agency has said the campaign venue at Butler continues to be an "active crime scene". "We are working closely with other federal agencies, our state partners and our local police partners as well."</p>

<p>Colonel Chris Paris, commissioner of Pennsylvania state police, told the media that they are working closely with the FBI in this investigation. "We are prepared to support this investigation in any way, shape or form. And we stand ready to participate in a full, fair, competent and thorough investigation," he said.</p>

<p>The FBI has also called upon the public for any information on the shooting. "We need the public's help, anyone who was on scene, who saw anything... please report that to the FBI," Special Agent Rojek said.</p>

<p>The assassination attempt on Trump, US President Joe Biden's biggest opponent in the US election later this year, has set alarm bells ringing through the country's security establishment.</p>

<p>Multiple rounds targeting the former President were fired at the Butler rally yesterday. Trump said one of the bullets pierced the upper part of his right ear. One person was killed and two others critically injured in the shooting. Visuals showed Secret Service operatives escorting the former President to safety after the shooting, bloodstains on his face.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden has strongly condemned the incident and also spoken to his arch rival after the shooting.</p>

<p>"There's no place in America for this kind of violence. It's sick. It's sick. It's one of the reasons why we have to unite this country... We cannot be like this, we cannot condone this," Biden told reporters in an emergency briefing after the attack on Trump.</p>

<p>"The idea that there's political violence, or violence in America like this, is just unheard of. It's just not appropriate. Everybody, everybody must condemn it. Everybody," Biden said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A moment of terrifying political violence at a Pennsylvania rally Saturday instantly turned into a piece of Donald Trump iconography that's likely to turbocharge his presidential bid.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Images of a defiant Trump - with his fist raised over his head and his bloody right ear, as Secret Service agents surround him and the American flag waving in the background - are blazing across social media and television.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Extraordinary.<br />
<br />
God bless President Trump. <a href="https://t.co/GEipCSwl6G">pic.twitter.com/GEipCSwl6G</a></p>
— Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) <a href="https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1812257101089235195?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 13, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>His supporters, many of whom viewed him as a movement figure and martyr long before the violence on Saturday, seized on the photos as a metaphor for the former president's resiliency.</p>

<p>A bullet pierced the upper part of his right ear, Trump said. The shooter is dead, as is a bystander, according to the Butler County district attorney.</p>

<p>Several vice presidential hopefuls and senators voiced their support and shared images from the scene, while billionaire Elon Musk posted a message on X that said: "I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery."</p>

<p>David Urban, an informal Trump adviser and lobbyist who helped to run his operation in Pennsylvania in 2016, said he expects the shooting to unify Americans behind Trump.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump is a fighter," Urban said. "That photo will be iconic."</p>

<p>Political Division<br />
The gunfire at the rally speaks to the divisiveness and contentiousness of this rematch of the 2020 presidential contest between Trump and President Joe Biden, as well as a looming sense of political violence that now permeates through the political discourse.</p>

<p>"I think we're all shocked," said 22-year-old Cooper Waldron, a registered Republican and Trump supporter from East Peoria, Illinois. "You never expect something like that to happen in an election in the US."</p>

<p>Half of swing state voters already said they feared violence around the election in a Bloomberg/Morning Consult poll taken in May.</p>

<p>David McCormick, a Republican candidate for Senate in Pennsylvania, was at the rally and near Trump when he was shot. Two people sitting behind him at the rally were also shot, according to a person familiar with the matter, bringing the specter of violence into not just a presidential campaign, but a down ballot campaign as well.</p>

<p>Several Republican lawmakers pinned blame Saturday for the shooting on the rhetoric of their political opponents, peppering social media with fiery statements and making unsubstantiated claims that Democrats incited the violence.</p>

<p>Prominent Democrats, including President Biden, rallied around Trump. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"I'm grateful to hear that he's safe and doing well," Biden said Saturday night. "There's no place for this kind of violence in America. We must unite as one nation to condemn it."</p>

<p>Many polls show Trump with a consistent lead over Biden in both national and swing state polling. Biden's disastrous debate performance last month was considered - by both sides - to have helped Trump's bid.</p>

<p>In the coming week, Trump is slated to both announce his pick for vice president and headline the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.</p>

<p>A huge chunk of the Trump campaign, including top advisers, were in Milwaukee at the time of shooting. It was unclear how the shooting would affect the security in Milwaukee, where thousands of Republicans are gathering for their once-every-four-years political convention</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tech billionaire Elon Musk said today he "fully" endorses Donald Trump after the Republican presidential candidate was shot at a campaign rally.</p>

<p>"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery," he wrote on X - which he owns - as he shared a video of Trump pumping his fist while being escorted away by Secret Service officials.</p>

<p>"Last time America had a candidate this tough was Theodore Roosevelt," he said in another post.</p>

<p>Shots were fired during the rally speech by Donald Trump early this morning, in an incident that investigators are treating as a possible assassination attempt on the former president.</p>

<p>The shooting took place shortly after Trump took the stage at his final campaign rally. 78-year-old Trump grimaced and clutched a hand to his right ear, with blood soon visible across his face.</p>

<p>He turned back to the crowd and repeatedly raised his fist as the security officials surrounded him to escort him off the stage, in what is set to become an iconic image.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden led the condemnation after his election rival Donald Trump was wounded in an apparent assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, in violence that also left a bystander dead.</p>

<p>"There's no place in America for this kind of violence. It's sick. It's sick. It's one of the reasons why we have to unite this country... We cannot be like this, we cannot condone this," President Joe Biden said.</p>

<p>Biden's former boss, Barack Obama, echoed his words in a statement, saying there was "absolutely no place for political violence in our democracy."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris today reacted to the shooting at former president Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania and said that "violence such as this has no place in our nation."</p>

<p>The incident took place about seven minutes into Trump's rally in Butler, in western Pennsylvania, today. Thousands of his supporters were attending the rally when the shooting, which was captured live on news channels, happened. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"Doug [her husband Douglas Emhoff] and I are relieved that he [Donald Trump] is not seriously injured. We are praying for him, his family, and all those who have been injured and impacted by this senseless shooting," Kamala Harris said.</p>

<p>"We are grateful to the United States Secret Service, first responders, and local authorities for their immediate action," she added.</p>

<p>"Violence such as this has no place in our nation. We must all condemn this abhorrent act and do our part to ensure that it does not lead to more violence," her statement read.</p>

<p>The incident occurred days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where Mr Trump will formally become the party's nominee.</p>

<p>Donald Trump, in his first statement after being shot at the rally, said, "I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear. I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin."</p>

<p>As per a statement issued by Trump Communications Director Steven Cheung, the 78-year-old is "fine and is being checked out at a local medical facility."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[While information about the incident is still sparse, at least one person interviewed by the BBC said he had tried to alert police and the US Secret Service, to no avail.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican lawmakers said they would launch swift investigations into how a sniper apparently managed to evade Secret Service agents and climb onto the roof of a building near where Donald Trump was speaking at an election rally and fire multiple shots before being killed.</p>

<p>While information about the incident is still sparse, early media reports said the shooter was outside the security perimeter of the rally venue in Butler, Pennsylvania. At least one person interviewed by the BBC said he tried to alert police and the Secret Service, to no avail, to the apparent sniper.</p>

<p>Trump supporters blasted the Secret Service, which has the primary responsibility for protecting Trump as a former US president. Billionaire ally Elon Musk called for the agency's leadership to resign.</p>

<p>"How was a sniper with a full rifle kit allowed to bear crawl onto the closest roof to a presidential nominee," asked conservative activist Jack Posobiec on social media site X.</p>

<p>Republican House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson said on social media that the House will have "Secret Service Director KIMBERLY CHEATLE and other appropriate officials from DHS (Department of Homeland Security) and the FBI appear for a hearing before our committees ASAP."</p>

<p>The Secret Service said shortly after the shooting that it has begun an investigation and briefed Democratic President Joe Biden, Trump's rival in the Nov. 15 election, though the agency did not immediately respond to additional requests for comment regarding its protocols.</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania State Police referred questions to the Secret Service, which did not immediately respond.</p>

<p>Attendee Ben Maser was outside the rally perimeter, listening to Trump, when he noticed two officers seemingly looking for someone. Maser, a 41-year old welder, started scanning the area too.</p>

<p>"I saw the guy on the roof. I told the officer that he was up there. He went about looking for him," said Maser.</p>

<p>The attack is certain to lead to a review of Trump's security, and going forward he will likely be provided with a level of protection more akin to a sitting president, said Joseph LaSorsa, a former Secret Service agent who served on the presidential detail.</p>

<p>"There will be an intensive review" of the incident and "there's going to be a massive realignment," LaSorsa said. "This cannot happen."</p>

<p>The Secret Service said in a statement that it had recently added "protective resources and capabilities" to Trump's security detail, without providing further details.</p>

<p>A retired agent who worked in protective services, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the incident should spark an internal review, and ideally an external one too.</p>

<p>"The gravity of the situation demands thorough scrutiny to prevent such failures in the future and to ensure accountability on all levels," said the former agent.</p>

<h3><strong>SECURING TRUMP RALLIES</strong></h3>

<p>During most of Trump's campaign stops, local police aid the Secret Service in securing the venue. Agents from other agencies within the Department of Homeland Security, such as the Transportation Security Administration, occasionally help.</p>

<p>It is no easy task. Many Trump rallies feature thousands of audience members, take place in the open air and last for hours.</p>

<p>Before the event, agents scan the venue for bombs or other threats, and Trump invariably arrives in a fortified motorcade.</p>

<p>Law enforcement officials typically put up barriers as a perimeter, and require all attendees to go through a metal detector to enter the venue. Armed protective agents search all attendees' bags and even wallets. Many rallygoers are patted down by hand.</p>

<p>Paul Eckloff, a former Secret Service agent who retired in 2020, said agents would have surveyed all the rooftops with a line of sight ahead of time.</p>

<p>"This person either concealed themselves until they became a threat, or were not a threat until they revealed their weapons," said Eckloff.</p>

<p>In the moments after Trump was injured, the former president was quickly surrounded by Secret Service personnel who formed a human shield, while heavily armed agents in body armor and toting rifles also took to the stage and appeared to scan the area for threats.</p>

<p>Trump was whisked by the agents to a black SUV, and taken to a local hospital, according to the campaign.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shots were fired during a rally speech by Donald Trump, in an incident that investigators are treating as a possible assassination attempt on the former president.</p>

<p>Including Abraham Lincoln and JFK, here are some notable examples of shootings involving US presidents or presidential candidates:</p>

<p><strong>- Ronald Reagan (1981) -</strong></p>

<p>President Reagan was shot and seriously wounded as he left an event at the Hilton hotel in Washington. The attacker was John Hinckley Jr, who was granted unconditional release in 2022.</p>

<p>Reagan spent twelve days in the hospital. The incident boosted Reagan's popularity, as he displayed humor and resilience during his recovery.</p>

<p><strong>- Gerald Ford (1975) -</strong></p>

<p>President Ford was left unscathed in two separate assassination attempts by women in September 1975, both in California and within a span of just 17 days.</p>

<p><strong>- George Wallace (1972) -</strong></p>

<p>While campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, Wallace was shot four times and paralyzed for life at a shopping mall in Laurel, Maryland.</p>

<p>The assassination attempt on Wallace, who was known for his segregationist views and populist appeal, highlighted the ongoing political tensions in the US and potential for domestic violence in the Vietnam war era.</p>

<p><strong>- Robert F. Kennedy (1968) -</strong></p>

<p>President John F. Kennedy's brother Robert, who was running for the Democratic presidential nomination, was shot and killed at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California.</p>

<p>The assassination had a profound impact on the 1968 presidential race and occurred just two months after the killing of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, adding to the political turmoil of the late 1960s.</p>

<p><strong>- John F. Kennedy (1963) -</strong></p>

<p>Riding in his motorcade with his wife Jackie, President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas by Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>The Warren Commission investigating the assassination concluded in 1964 that Lee Harvey Oswald, a former marine who had lived in the Soviet Union, had acted alone.</p>

<p>Many Americans believe the death of JFK began a more violent period in US politics and society, with the Vietnam War build up and the civil rights struggle as a backdrop.</p>

<p><strong>- Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933) -</strong></p>

<p>As president-elect, FDR was the target of an assassination attempt in Miami, Florida. He was unharmed, but Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak was killed in the attack.</p>

<p><strong>- Theodore Roosevelt (1912) -</strong></p>

<p>Like Trump, Teddy Roosevelt was running for the White House as a former president when he was shot in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p>

<p>The bullet, which remained lodged in his chest for the rest of his life, was slowed by the folded 50-page speech and steel eyeglass case in his breast pocket.</p>

<p>Famously, Roosevelt decided to deliver his scheduled speech despite being shot.</p>

<p><strong>- William McKinley (1901) </strong>-</p>

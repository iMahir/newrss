       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 100 Europeans were evacuated from Lebanon on a Belgian military plane on Thursday evening, most of them from Belgium, the Netherlands and France, the government in Brussels said.</p>

<p>The aircraft, which landed at Melsbroek military base near the Belgian capital was carrying "58 Belgians and dependents, 41 Dutch citizens, 11 from France and one from Luxembourg, a foreign ministry spokesman told AFP on Friday.</p>

<p>Over the past week nearly 150 of the 1,800 or so Belgians living in Lebanon have benefited from assistance to return to Belgium, he said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japanese organisation Nihon Hidankyo has been conferred with the Nobel Peace Prize 2024 for its efforts to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>The organisation is a grassroots movement of atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, also known as Hibakusha, which strives to "achieve a world free of nuclear weapons and for demonstrating through witness testimony that nuclear weapons must never be used again".</p>

<p>While announcing this year's <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-how-is-the-nobel-peace-prize-decided-6764236">Peace Prize</a>, the Norwegian Nobel Committee honoured the&nbsp;atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki for cultivating hope for peace through&nbsp;"their costly experience". "They help us to describe the indescribable, to think the unthinkable, and to somehow grasp the incomprehensible pain and suffering caused by nuclear weapons," the committee stated on X.</p>

<p>The committee also highlighted that no nuclear weapon has been used in war in nearly 80 years. Acknowledging&nbsp;Nihon Hidankyo's efforts towards the establishment of a nuclear taboo, the Nobel Committee also aid that the same is under pressure.</p>

<p>By&nbsp;drawing on personal stories, creating educational campaigns based on their own experience, and issuing urgent warnings against the spread and use of nuclear weapons, the organisation has helped consolidate opposition to nuclear weapons, said a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nobelprize.org/press-release-peace-2024/">Nobel Committee press release</a>.</p>

<p>"The nuclear powers are modernising and upgrading their arsenals, new countries appear to be preparing to acquire nuclear weapons, and threats are being made to use nuclear weapons in ongoing warfare. At this moment in human history, it is worth reminding ourselves what nuclear weapons are: the most destructive weapons the world has ever seen," a press release stated.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the 2024 <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/nobel-prize-in-chemistry-goes-to-scientists-david-baker-demis-hassabis-john-jumper-6751373">Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a> went to scientists David Baker, Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, while the&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/2024-nobel-prize-in-medicine-goes-to-us-scientists-victor-ambros-and-gary-ruvkun-6735227">Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</a> went to&nbsp;Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun for the discovery of microRNA and its role in gene regulation.</p>

<p>South Korean writer Han Kang, was awarded 2024 the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/nobel-prize-in-literature-goes-to-south-korean-author-han-kang-6759706">Nobel Prize in Literature,</a> "for her intense poetic prose that confronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life."</p>

<p>American John Hopfield and British-Canadian Geoffrey Hinton won the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/what-the-nobel-prize-for-physics-co-winner-fears-6744406">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> for pioneering work in the development of artificial intelligence. Shortly after the award's announcement,&nbsp;Hinton raised concerns about the technology he has created.</p>

<p>The prize comes with a gold medal, a diploma and a prize sum of $1 million (913,000 euro).</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media platform TikTok is laying off hundreds of employees from its global workforce, including a large number of staff in Malaysia, the company said on Friday, as it shifts focus towards a greater use of AI in content moderation.</p>

<p>Two sources familiar with the matter earlier told Reuters that more than 700 jobs were slashed in Malaysia. TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, later clarified that less than 500 employees in the country were affected.</p>

<p>The employees, most of whom were involved in the firm's content moderation operations, were informed of their dismissal by email late Wednesday, the sources said, requesting anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to media.</p>

<p>In response to Reuters' queries, TikTok confirmed the layoffs and said that several hundred employees were expected to be impacted globally as part of a wider plan to improve its moderation operations.</p>

<p>TikTok employs a mix of automated detection and human moderators to review content posted on the site.</p>

<p>ByteDance has over 110,000 employees in more than 200 cities globally, according to the company website.</p>

<p>The technology firm is also planning more retrenchments next month as it looks to consolidate some of its regional operations, one of the sources said.</p>

<p>"We're making these changes as part of our ongoing efforts to further strengthen our global operating model for content moderation," a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement.</p>

<p>The company expects to invest $2 billion globally in trust and safety this year and will continue to improve efficiency, with 80% of guidelines-violating content now removed by automated technologies, the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The layoffs were first reported by business portal The Malaysian Reserve on Thursday.</p>

<p>The job cuts occur as global technology firms face greater regulatory pressure in Malaysia, where the government has asked social media operators to apply for an operating licence by January as part of an effort to combat cyber offences.</p>

<p>Malaysia reported a sharp increase in harmful social media content earlier this year and urged firms, including TikTok, to step up monitoring on their platforms.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Japanese actor who was the voice of "Doraemon", a cartoon cat robot beloved by children in Japan and other countries has died, her agency said Friday. Nobuyo Oyama was 90.</p>

<p>For a quarter of a century until 2005, Oyama lent her endearingly hoarse voice to the titular blue feline from the 22nd century with his "magic pocket" and its supply of fantastical gadgets, including a door that lets you travel anywhere.</p>

<p>She "passed away on September 29 due to old age", her talent agency told AFP. Her funeral was attended by close relatives, it said.</p>

<p>"Doraemon" is still on air as one of the longest-running Japanese anime series, popular across Asia and farther afield.</p>

<p>While Oyama's successor has played the role for nearly two decades, her voice remains the definitive sound of the robot for many who grew up hearing it.</p>

<p>In "Doraemon", the cuddly robot cat with its huge smile travels back in time to help a lazy schoolboy called Nobita overcome the trials of everyday life.</p>

<p>Created by the artist Fujiko F. Fujio, the character first appeared in manga strips in 1969, making the transition to the small and big screen over the following decades.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris said on Thursday that Joe Biden's decision to drop out of the 2024 election race this summer was "one of the most courageous" any president has made.</p>

<p>"President Biden made a decision that I think history will show was probably one of the most courageous that a president could make, which is he decided to put country above his personal interest," Harris said during the Las Vegas event sponsored by Univision, a Spanish-language television network, according to press pool reporters. Her remarks were dubbed into Spanish on television.</p>

<p>"I believe that the stakes right now are extraordinarily high, and potentially, some might say, historians have said unprecedented."</p>

<p>The Democratic presidential nominee made the remarks when pressed by a voter who said he was leaning towards Trump and expressed concern about how Biden exited the race. The voter said he wanted clarity on why Harris became the nominee without going through a competitive primary.</p>

<p>Biden ended his re-election bid on July 21, after facing weeks of pressure from prominent Democratic elected officials and donors concerned about his age and fitness. Biden immediately endorsed Harris, who locked down the support of enough Democratic delegates to secure the party's nomination.</p>

<p>Harris said in an interview on ABC News' "The View" on Tuesday that there is "not a thing" she would have done differently from Biden as president. The remark was seized upon by Donald Trump's campaign, which wants voters to see the Republican ex-president as the 2024 candidate of change.</p>

<p>Harris said Biden, who is not making regular campaign appearances on her behalf, has been a key partner and supporter and that his decision to leave the race marked a sharp contrast with Trump, who never conceded his 2020 election loss.</p>

<p>"We are literally having a choice as the American people about choosing a path either that is about rule of law, democracy or something that is about admiring dictators," she said, according to the pool reporters.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[International Day Of Girl Child 2024: The report highlights that when "non-contact" forms of abuse - such as online harassment or verbal assault - are factored in, the number rises to 650 million, or 1 in 5.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new UNICEF report reveals that over 370 million women and girls - or 1 in 8 globally - have experienced sexual violence, including rape and assault, before the age of 18. The figures were released ahead of the International Day of the Girl Child on October 11, marking the first-ever comprehensive global and regional data on childhood sexual violence.</p>

<p>The<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/over-370-million-girls-and-women-globally-subjected-rape-or-sexual-assault-children"> report highlights </a>that when "non-contact" forms of abuse - such as online harassment or verbal assault - are factored in, the number rises to 650 million, or 1 in 5. The staggering statistics underscore the critical need for urgent and comprehensive strategies to prevent and address the widespread violation of children's rights.</p>

<p>"Sexual violence against children is a stain on our moral conscience," stated UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. "It inflicts deep and lasting trauma, often by someone the child knows and trusts, in places where they should feel safe."</p>

<p>The pervasive nature of childhood sexual violence spans across cultural, geographical, and economic divides. The report highlights Sub-Saharan Africa as the region with the highest number of victims, accounting for 79 million affected women and girls. Other affected regions include Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (75 million), Central and Southern Asia (73 million), Europe and Northern America (68 million), and Latin America and the Caribbean (45 million).</p>

<p>In regions marred by conflict and political instability, the situation is even more dire. Girls in fragile settings, such as refugee camps or areas under UN peacekeeping missions, face a higher risk, with sexual violence affecting more than 1 in 4 girls. "We are witnessing horrific sexual violence in conflict zones, where rape and gender-based violence are often used as weapons of war," Russell added.</p>

<p>The report points to a disturbing trend: most sexual violence against children occurs during adolescence, with a significant spike between ages 14 and 17. Victims are more likely to experience repeated abuse, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to break the cycle of trauma.</p>

<p>The long-term impacts of sexual violence can be devastating. Survivors often struggle with mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, and are at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections, substance abuse, and difficulty forming healthy relationships. The trauma is further compounded when survivors delay disclosing their abuse, or never report it at all.</p>

<p>While girls and women make up the majority of victims, the report also notes that boys are similarly affected. Between 240 and 310 million boys and men have experienced sexual violence during childhood, with the number rising to 530 million when non-contact forms of abuse are included.</p>

<p>As the Global Ministerial Conference on Violence Against Children approaches next month, UNICEF calls for urgent international action. Key recommendations include changing harmful social norms, equipping children with information to report abuse, ensuring victims have access to support services, and strengthening legal frameworks to protect children.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States still believes that Iran has not decided to build a nuclear weapon despite Tehran's recent strategic setbacks, including Israel's killing of Hezbollah leaders and two largely unsuccessful attempts to attack Israel, two US officials told Reuters.</p>

<p>The comments from a senior Biden administration official and a spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) added to public remarks earlier this week by CIA Director William Burns, who said the United States had not seen any evidence Iran's leader had reversed his 2003 decision to suspend the weaponization program.</p>

<p>"We assess that the Supreme Leader has not made a decision to resume the nuclear weapons program that Iran suspended in 2003," said the ODNI spokesperson, referring to Iran's leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>

<p>The intelligence assessment could help explain US opposition to any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear program in retaliation for a ballistic missile attack that Tehran carried out last week.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden said after that attack he would not support an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites, but did not explain why he had reached that conclusion. His remarks drew fierce criticism from Republicans, including former President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>US officials have long acknowledged that an attempt to destroy Iran's nuclear weapons program might only delay the country's efforts to develop a nuclear bomb and could even strengthen Tehran's resolve to do so.</p>

<p>"We're all watching this space very carefully," the Biden administration official said.</p>

<p>Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment but Tehran has repeatedly denied ever having had a nuclear weapons program.</p>

<p><strong>Key Iran ally weakened</strong></p>

<p>In the past weeks, Israel's military has inflicted heavy losses on Hezbollah, the most powerful member of the Iran-backed network known as the Axis of Resistance. The group's setbacks have included the killing of its leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike last month.</p>

<p>The weakening of a key Iranian ally has prompted some experts to speculate that Tehran may restart its efforts to acquire a nuclear bomb to protect itself.</p>

<p>Beth Sanner, a former US deputy director of national intelligence, said the risk of Khamenei reversing his 2003 religious dictum against nuclear weapons is "higher now than it has been" and that if Israel were to strike nuclear facilities Tehran would likely move ahead with building a nuclear weapon.</p>

<p>That would still take time, however.</p>

<p>"They can't get a weapon in a day. It will take months and months and months," said Sanner, now a fellow with the German Marshall Fund.</p>

<p>Iran is now enriching uranium to up to 60% fissile purity, close to the 90% of weapons grade, at two sites, and in theory it has enough material enriched to that level, if enriched further, for almost four bombs, according to a yardstick of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN watchdog.</p>

<p>The expansion in Iran's enrichment program has reduced the so-called breakout time it would need to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear bomb to "a week or a little more," according to Burns, from more than a year under a 2015 accord that Trump pulled out of when president.Actually making a bomb with that material would take longer. How long is less clear and the subject of debate.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Israeli attack</strong></p>

<p>Israel has not yet disclosed what it will target in retaliation for Iran's attack last week with more than 180 ballistic missiles, which largely failed thanks to interceptions by Israeli air defenses as well as by the US military.</p>

<p>The United States has been privately urging Israel to calibrate its response to avoid triggering a broader war in the Middle East, officials say, with Biden publicly voicing his opposition to a nuclear attack and concerns about a strike on Iran's energy infrastructure.</p>

<p>Israel, however, views Iran's nuclear program as an existential threat.</p>

<p>The conflicts in the Middle East between Israel and Iran and Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Gaza and Yemen have become campaign issues ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election, with Trump and his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, positioning themselves as pro-Israel.</p>

<p>Speaking at a campaign event last week, Trump mocked Biden for opposing an attack on Iran's nuclear sites, saying: "That's the thing you wanna hit, right?"</p>

<p>Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence officer and government official, said Iran still had space to compensate for setbacks dealt to its proxies and missile force without having to resort to developing a nuclear warhead.</p>

<p>"The Iranians have to recalculate what's next. I don't think at this point they will rush to either develop or boost the (nuclear) program toward military capacity," he said.</p>

<p>"They will look around to find what maneuvering space they can move around in."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first of two naval ships evacuating Turkish citizens and their families from war-torn Lebanon landed at a port in southern Turkey late on Thursday, an AFP correspondent at the scene said.</p>

<p>The TCG Bayraktar, which set sail from Beirut around 8:00 am (0500 GMT), pulled into the port of Mersin around 9:00 pm carrying the first batch of 966 people.</p>

<p>As it pulled into the port, a large group of journalists were waiting on the quayside.</p>

<p>A second boat carrying a similar number of passengers was set to dock around midnight, officials said.</p>

<p>Turkish officials said around 2,000 people had signed up to leave Lebanon on navy ships in the first such evacuation by sea.</p>

<p>Turkey, which is estimated to have 14,000 citizens registered with its consulate in Lebanon, announced the move on Tuesday because of the deteriorating security situation in the country.</p>

<p>Speaking to AFP in Beirut ahead of the boats' departure on Wednesday, Turkish ambassador in Lebanon Ali Baris Ulusoy told AFP the evacuation was a first and came after "a growing number of requests from our Turkish nationals living in Lebanon to be evacuated".</p>

<p>He said they were allowing close relatives "who are not necessarily Turkish nationals, like spouses, children or parents" to travel too.</p>

<p>Israel and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah have exchanged near-daily fire on the country's southern border since the start of the Gaza war a year ago.</p>

<p>But Israel has intensified its strikes against Hezbollah since September 23, killing more than 1,200 people in Lebanon and displacing more than a million from their homes.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the sidelines of the ASEAN-India Summit in Laos.</p>

<p>During the meeting, PM Modi extended his condolences on the loss of lives due to Hurricane Milton in the US and also discussed strengthening bilateral ties and cooperation in regional matters.</p>

<p>The meeting highlighted the strong diplomatic relationship between India and the US, reaffirming their commitment to working together on global and regional challenges.</p>

<p>Earlier on Thursday, PM Modi held bilateral meetings with his counterparts from Japan and New Zealand on the sidelines of the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-modi-calls-for-peace-in-eurasia-west-asia-this-is-not-the-era-of-war-6764956">ASEAN-India Summit</a> in Laos.</p>

<p>PM Modi congratulated the newly-appointed Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on his new responsibility and wished him success in leading Japan to greater heights. He also underscored that India will continue to accord the highest priority to its ties with Japan, a trusted friend and strategic partner.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister also met New Zealand PM Christopher Luxon which was the first meeting between the two leaders. PM Modi welcomed New Zealand's decision to join the International Solar Alliance and also extended an invitation to Luxon to visit India on mutually convenient dates, which he accepted.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday during the ASEAN summit, said that the 21st century is the "Asian century" of India and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries.</p>

<p>"I believe that the 21st century is the Asian century of India and ASEAN countries. Today, when there is a situation of conflict and tension in many parts of the world, the friendship, coordination, dialogue and cooperation between India and ASEAN remains very important," he remarked.</p>

<p>During the Summit, Prime Minister Modi announced a 10-point plan to strengthen connectivity and resilience based on Laos' theme as the 2024 ASEAN Chair and in celebration of 10 years of the 'Act East' policy.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Noting that conflicts in different parts of the world are having the most negative impact on the countries of the Global South, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday called for the restoration of peace and stability in Eurasia and West Asia.</p>

<p>Addressing the 19th East Asia Summit, PM Modi also asserted that solutions to problems cannot come from the battlefield.</p>

<p>He also said a free, open, inclusive, prosperous and rule-based Indo-Pacific is important for the peace and progress of the entire region.</p>

<p>Peace, security and stability of the South China Sea is in the interest of the entire Indo-Pacific region, he said.</p>

<p>“We believe that maritime activities should be conducted under the UN Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS). It is necessary to ensure freedom of navigation and air space. A strong and effective Code of Conduct should be created. And it should not curb the foreign policy of regional countries,” PM Modi said.</p>

<p>“Our approach should be one of developmentalism and not expansionism,” he said.</p>

<p>Noting that the conflicts going on in different parts of the world are having the most negative impact on the countries of the Global South, PM Modi said everyone wants whether it is Eurasia or West Asia, peace and stability should be restored as soon as possible.</p>

<p>“I come from the land of Buddha, and I have repeatedly said that this is not the era of war. Solutions to problems cannot come from the battlefield,” he said.</p>

<p>“It is necessary to respect sovereignty, territorial integrity and international laws. Keeping a humanitarian approach, dialogue and diplomacy will have to be given priority,” the prime minister asserted.</p>

<p>Fulfilling the responsibility of ‘Vishwabandhu', India will continue to contribute in every possible way in this direction, he added.</p>

<p>His remarks came amidst conflicts between Ukraine and Russia in Eurasia and the Israel-Hamas war in West Asia.</p>

<p>“Terrorism is also a serious challenge to global peace and security. To face it, forces believing in humanity will have to work together,” PM Modi said.</p>

<p>At the start of his address, he also expressed his deepest condolences to the people affected by “Typhoon Yagi”, a destructive tropical cyclone which impacted Southeast Asia and South China in September this year.</p>

<p>“In this difficult time, we have provided humanitarian assistance through Operation Sadbhav,” PM Modi said.</p>

<p>PM Modi also said India has always supported ASEAN Unity and Centrality and pointed out that ASEAN is also at the centre of India's Indo-Pacific vision and Quad cooperation.</p>

<p>“There are deep similarities between India's ‘Indo-Pacific Oceans' Initiative' and ‘ASEAN Outlook on Indo-Pacific',” he said.</p>

<p>“We support the ASEAN approach to the situation in Myanmar. We also support the Five-point Consensus. At the same time, we believe that it is important to maintain humanitarian assistance,” PM Modi said.</p>

<p>He called for appropriate steps for the restoration of democracy there.</p>

<p>“We believe that, for this, Myanmar should be engaged, not isolated,” he said.</p>

<p>As a neighbouring country, India will continue to fulfil its responsibility, he added.</p>

<p>The East Asia Summit is an important pillar of India's Act East Policy, he said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man, clinging to a cooler in the aftermath of Hurricane Milton, was saved by a Coast Guard helicopter crew on October 10, around 48 kilometres off Longboat Key. The <a href="https://www.news.uscg.mil/Press-Releases/Article/3933279/coast-guard-rescues-man-off-longboat-key-following-hurricane-milton/">rescue operation</a> took place around 1:30 pm and the man was airlifted to Tampa General Hospital for medical evaluation. He was found wearing a life jacket, which played a big role in his survival during the storm.</p>

<p>The Coast Guard's Air Station Miami launched the search mission on Thursday morning after receiving reports of a missing captain. The aircrew, alongside support from Air Station Clearwater, was positioned at the Aviation Training Center Mobile for storm avoidance during Hurricane Milton.</p>

<p>The captain, aboard the fishing vessel Capt. Dave initially contacted Coast Guard Sector St. Petersburg on the afternoon of October 7. He reported that he and a crew member were stranded about 32 kilometres&nbsp;off John's Pass. The Coast Guard promptly dispatched a rescue boat and a helicopter, bringing the pair to safety and then to Air Station Clearwater without injury. Capt. Dave was left adrift while salvage arrangements were made.</p>

<p>On October 9, the vessel's owner notified the Coast Guard that the captain went out to the boat for repairs in the early hours and had not been heard since. However, after a connection was re-established with the captain, he reported that his vessel's rudder had become fouled with a line, rendering the boat inoperable.</p>

<p>At the time, sea conditions were challenging, with 6 to 8-foot waves and winds of about 48 kmph. However, the weather rapidly worsened as Hurricane Milton approached. The Coast Guard instructed the captain to wear a life jacket and remain near the vessel's emergency position indicating a radio beacon. Unfortunately, communication was lost on the evening of October 9.</p>

<p>“This man survived in a nightmare scenario for even the most experienced mariner,” said Lt. Cmdr. Dana Grady, chief of the command centre at Sector St. Petersburg. “To understand the severity of the hurricane conditions, we estimate he experienced approximately 75-90 mph winds, 20-25 foot seas, for an extended period of time to include overnight. He survived because of a life jacket, his emergency position indicating locator beacon, and a cooler.”</p>

<p>Hurricane Milton made landfall on October 9 near Siesta Key, a barrier island located just south of Sarasota on Florida's central west coast. Initially, the storm struck as a formidable Category 3 hurricane, with sustained winds reaching approximately 193 kmph. However, as it moved inland, it weakened to a Category 2 storm.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk on Thursday unveiled what he said was a robotaxi capable of self-driving, predicting it would be available by 2027 -- about a decade after he first promised an autonomous vehicle.</p>

<p>The Tesla CEO said the fully electric car -- which has no steering wheel or pedals -- would be priced under $30,000, would be charged wirelessly with inductive technology and would be "10 to 20 times safer" than human-driven cars.</p>

<p>"You can think of the car in an autonomous world as being like just a little lounge," he told a crowd at the Warner Brothers Studio lot near Los Angeles.</p>

<p>"You're just sitting in a comfortable little lounge, and you can do whatever you want while you're in this comfortable little lounge, and when you get out, you will be at your destination."</p>

<p>Few details were given about the vehicle, whose gullwing doors are reminiscent of the Delorean made famous by the "Back to the Future" films, but Musk said Tesla already had 50 of them.</p>

<p>He said the company was expecting to begin "fully autonomous, unsupervised" driving in Texas and California next year with existing models, and then move on to production of what he called the "cybercab".</p>

<p>"I tend to be a little optimistic with time frames, but in 2026, so yeah, before 2027. Let me put it that way."</p>

<p><strong>Robovan and Optimus robot</strong></p>

<p>The evening, which started almost an hour late, was heavy on sunny visions of the future, but light on specifics.</p>

<p>But it also showcased a mass passenger vehicle that Musk called "The Robovan."</p>

<p>The vehicle, which looks like an enormous moving toaster, has no steering wheel, pedals or driver.</p>

<p>It can seat up to 20 people or could be converted to carry goods, Musk said.</p>

<p>He gave no details about production or any timeline.</p>

<p>Musk also brought out dancing humanoid robots called Optimus that he said would one day be able to do menial tasks, as well as offer friendship.</p>

<p>"I think this will be the biggest product ever of any kind," he said, adding that he expected the robot to retail for $20,000 to $30,000.</p>

<p>He gave no timeline on this, either, and it was not clear from the livestream what the robot's capabilities were, although it was shown walking amongst audience members, handing out plaques and serving drinks.</p>

<p><strong>Trump</strong></p>

<p>Musk's bullish pronouncements and dedicated fanbase have helped build Tesla into one of the world's most valuable companies.</p>

<p>While he was once the darling of the political left for his environmentalist moves towards electrifying transport, he has become increasingly controversial.</p>

<p>Since buying Twitter -- which he renamed X -- the free speech absolutist cut staffing on the platform, leading many long-time users and advertisers to abandon the forum.</p>

<p>And he's currently spending time and money promoting Republican Donald Trump, echoing the billionaire presidential candidate's dire warnings about migrants and a crumbling America, including during an exuberant appearance at a weekend Trump rally that was widely mocked.</p>

<p>Thursday night's robotaxi reveal was a long time coming.</p>

<p>Musk first said in 2016 a fully automated car was two years away; a year later he was touting a vehicle by 2019 so clever that customers would be able to sleep while it drove them around.</p>

<p>But as many automakers have found, self-driving is tricky.</p>

<p>While lots of cars nowadays have limited automation, theoretically allowing the driver to cede some of the boring bits of driving to an onboard computer, the person behind the wheel still has to pay attention and jump in if the car does something unpredictable.</p>

<p>That's because computers, unlike people, are not very good at reacting to unexpected events or situations they have never seen before.</p>

<p>Other companies, such as Google's Waymo and General Motors' Cruise, have operated heavily regulated and limited pilot robotaxi programs for a few years already.</p>

<p>Anything Tesla tries to put on the road will face the same kind of regulatory hurdles, as well as skepticism from the general public, many of whom have never seen a car without a driver.</p>

<p>Immediate reaction to the reveals was mixed.</p>

<p>"Delusional nonsense from a liar who has been promising a robotaxi every year for a decade," wrote user @goodandnormal on X.</p>

<p>Others on the platform were more enthusiastic, with some predicting that Tesla's share price will soar when US markets open.</p>

<p>"Tesla self-driving 'Robovan.' The future looks promising," wrote @CollinsEbot1.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Barack Obama cast the Republican nominee Donald Trump as a selfish businessman concerned only with his own accumulation of wealth and power, in contrast with Kamala Harris.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before Barack Obama's ascent to the White House, Diana Vahabzadeh was a registered Independent who had never voted for a Democrat in her life.</p>

<p>But the first Black president of the United States won the now 63-year-old over during his initial 2008 campaign and she's leaned left ever since.</p>

<p>He was back on the trail Thursday and so was she, along with thousands of people at a rally in Pittsburgh backing Kamala Harris, which kicks off Obama's stumping blitz across swing states vital to winning November's neck-and-neck election.</p>

<p>Vahabzadeh has "loved him for years," she said: "This is a great opportunity to be able to see him and also support the ticket."</p>

<p>A playlist of pop classics and TikTok hits spun in the university gym where the marquee speaker's "Yes We Can" slogan from 2008 was repurposed as "Yes She Can," a message emblazoned on both homemade posters and an electric scoreboard in the field house.</p>

<p>"We love you Barack!" shouted one rallygoer as he appeared, soundtracked by U2's "City of Blinding Lights," a frequent track during his own presidential bids.</p>

<p>Flashing his megawatt smile, Obama cast the Republican nominee <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/has-donald-trump-ever-changed-a-diaper-barack-obama-at-kamala-harris-rally-6764162">Donald Trump as a selfish businessman</a> concerned only with his own accumulation of wealth and power, in contrast with Harris, who he said "is as prepared for the job as any nominee for president as ever been."</p>

<p>"That's who Kamala is."</p>

<p>In closing, he tapped the crowd-rousing vigor that propelled him to the top of the Democratic party decades ago, his voice rapidly amplifying as he dropped his demands: "Do not just sit back and hope for the best -- get off your couch and vote."</p>

<p>"Put down your phone, and vote!" he shouted to cheers. "Vote for Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States."</p>

<p><strong>'Powerful'</strong></p>

<p>The energy hit for Tia Douglas, a 20-year-old college student who was on the cusp of primary-school age when Obama first won office.</p>

<p>"It felt so powerful to be able to hear him speak," she told AFP with bright eyes and a wide smile following the rally.</p>

<p>"Listening to him made me even more excited to get out there in the next 26 days."</p>

<p>The Harris campaign is hoping the 63-year-old former president -- who led the US from 2009 to 2017 -- can imbue their White House bid with star power and help fend off Trump's potential return.</p>

<p>Obama walked out to ardent applause at the Pittsburgh field house, which was packed with a crowd diverse in background and age.</p>

<p>"I love seeing and hearing his articulate self," said Valerie Brown, a 66-year-old retired public schoolteacher.</p>

<p>She told AFP she hopes his words "might stimulate some others who are reluctant" to vote Harris.</p>

<p>Vice President Harris enjoyed a honeymoon surge in the polls when she replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee over the summer, capturing the social media zeitgeist and raking in a reported billion dollars in fundraising.</p>

<p>But whether she ultimately can bat back Republican Trump, who is seeking a second term and still maintains a fervent base of support, remains anyone's guess, with key battleground states like Pennsylvania still vacillating between the candidates in the polls.</p>

<p>"I get it, why people are looking to shake things up," Obama said onstage, before drawing chuckles after riffing on his own former platform: "I mean, I'm the hopey-changey guy."</p>

<p>"I understand people feeling frustrated and people feeling we can do better," he continued. "What I cannot understand is why anybody would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you, Pennsylvania."</p>

<p><strong>'Lifetime icon'</strong></p>

<p>In the lead-up to the evening rally supporters snaked around the block of the University of Pittsburgh field house hoping for a spot inside.</p>

<p>To see Harris and Obama "join forces for the greater good," Douglas said, "I think is really amazing."</p>

<p>Douglas's friend Julia Palchikoff, a 20-year-old journalism major, said maturing in the Trump era made her appreciate Obama even more.</p>

<p>"Being in a swing state in an election like this, it's just a historical moment, and I feel like I have to do my part," said the Alaska native who moved to Pennsylvania for school.</p>

<p>"When I heard Obama was coming here, I was, like, I loved him as a kid -- and Kamala, honestly, it just feels like we're on the precipice of something really great."</p>

<p>Was it the Obama she expected?</p>

<p>"It totally was," she said, before lavishing a little more praise on the former leader: "Lifetime icon."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Serbian artist Marina Abramovic and German artist Ulay started from opposite ends of the Great Wall to meet and marry, but their trek, titled The Lovers, ended as a symbol of their separation.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two renowned performance artists embarked on a unique journey along the Great Wall of China in 1988. Serbian performance artist Marina Abramovic and German artist Frank Uwe Laysiepen, known as Ulay, started from opposite ends, to meet in the middle and marry in what would be a symbol of their enduring love and artistic collaboration. However, their ambitious trek, titled <em>The Lovers</em>, became a metaphor for their separation.<br />
<br />
Abramovic and Ulay met in Amsterdam in 1976 on their shared birthday, November 30, and there was an instant connection. Ulay described Abramovic&nbsp;as “witchy and otherworldly,” while she found him “wild and exciting.” They became inseparable, referring to themselves as a “two-headed body.”<br />
<br />
They spent years performing together, often in physically demanding and extreme situations, the Guardian reported. One of their famous performances, <em>Rest Energy</em>, involved Ulay holding a drawn bow aimed at Abramovic's heart. Meanwhile, the tension in their performances mirrored the tension in their relationship.<br />
<br />
For years, the couple lived a nomadic life, travelling in a van and performing in small towns and villages. As their relationship deepened, they envisioned<em> The Lovers</em> as their ultimate artistic expression – a journey of emotional and physical endurance, culminating in a symbolic wedding at the centre of the Great Wall. But that didn't go as planned.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However, the project was fraught with challenges from the start. Chinese bureaucracy slowed the process as the couple faced years of delays. They were forced to repeatedly apply for permissions, deal with visa rejections and convince the Chinese authorities that walking the Great Wall as an art project was indeed a legitimate endeavour. By the time the walk was finally approved in 1988, five years had passed. Both Abramovic and Ulay had changed.<br />
<br />
When the walk began on March 30, 1988, Abramovic started her trek from the Bohai Sea, known as the “dragon's head,” while Ulay began from the Gobi Desert at the “dragon's tail”. Abramovic's journey was arduous, with treacherous terrain, steep mountains, and occasional near-death experiences. She walked through remote villages, seeking out local legends from the elders, many of which revolved around dragons. Ulay walked through desert landscapes. His journey was also not without its own challenges.<br />
<br />
When the two finally met after 90 days and roughly 2,000 km each, it was not for a wedding, but for a breakup. On a stone bridge in Shenmu, Shaanxi province, they embraced but the affection was bittersweet.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Both changed during the long wait for the journey to begin. They both had affairs, communication broke down and the pressures of fame affected them in different ways. Abramovic embraced the success and recognition their work was getting, while Ulay, a self-described anarchist, shunned the commercialisation of their art.<br />
<br />
Their reunion came years later, in 2010, during Abramovic's retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, titled <em>The Artist Is Present.</em> In the performance, Abramovic sat silently for 750 hours, inviting visitors to sit across from her and share a moment of silent connection.<br />
<br />
On the opening night, Ulay made a surprise appearance and sat across from each other for the first time in over two decades. They locked eyes, smiled and started crying. In a break from the rules of the performance, Marina Abramovic reached out and took Ulay's hands.&nbsp;<br />

After 22 years apart, their silent interaction, filled with emotion, touched millions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One person died and a dozen people remain trapped deep in a disused Colorado gold mine after the shaft's elevator system malfunctioned during a tour Thursday, local police said.</p>

<p>The incident occurred during the Mollie Kathleen Gold Mine Tour, which takes visitors 1,000 feet (300 meters) underground in the western US state.</p>

<p>A group of visitors were on board the elevator trolley system when the mechanical failure occurred, killing one person and injuring four.</p>

<p>Officials did not release further details about what went wrong, citing an active investigation.</p>

<p>"We did have one fatality that occurred during this issue at 500 feet," Teller County sheriff Jason Mikesell told a press conference.</p>

<p>The other 11 people on board the elevator at the time, including two children, were brought safely to the surface with the assistance of the mine operators and fire department officials.</p>

<p>Aside from the fatality, the four people hurt in the incident suffered only minor injuries, said Mikesell.</p>

<p>A further 12 people remain in a tunnel at the bottom of the mine.</p>

<p>They are safe and are accompanied by a mine employee, but cannot be moved until the elevator system is cleared as safe to be used again, said Mikesell.</p>

<p>Emergency officials with ropes are standing by in case they are required.</p>

<p>Chairs, blankets, and water have been provided to those in the mine.</p>

<p>"The atmospherics are good inside the tunnel," said Mikesell.</p>

<p>Those still inside the mine have not been informed of the fatality.</p>

<p>"We're just trying to keep down the worry of what's going on, so that nobody gets excited," added Mikesell.</p>

<p>The mine outside the small city of Cripple Creek, around 100 miles south of Denver, offers a chance to "Experience the 'Old West' as it was for hard rock gold miners of 'The World's Greatest Gold Camp,'" according to its official website.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As gushing water from <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hurricane-milton-destroys-homes-leaves-2-million-without-power-in-florida-6758554">Hurricane Milton</a> flooded their Florida apartment, Lidier Rodriguez and Sandra Escalona rushed upstairs to safety -- a scene of danger and drama in a normally staid senior living facility.</p>

<p>Hours later, after the powerful storm hit Wednesday evening, they watched as the same emergency crews who rescued them at their residence -- a series of two-story apartment buildings -- helped other older people get out.</p>

<p>The complex is on a low-lying and now flooded street near Tampa Bay on Florida's west coast. Police and firefighters went from building to building in boats on Thursday, helping people get to dry land.</p>

<p>"We lost everything," said Rodriguez, a 54-year-old Cuban man who has been living in Florida for 20 years. "But at least we are alive. That is all we have left."</p>

<p>Outside their homes, dozens of residents look confused and shellshocked -- like they did not know what to do next.</p>

<p>They carried bags with the few belongings they were able to salvage, and in some cases their pet dogs and cats.</p>

<p>No one expected so much flooding in a neighborhood that was not part of the many mandatory evacuation zones that Florida officials declared in the second major hurricane in as many weeks.</p>

<p>The neighborhood was not damaged at all when Hurricane Helene hit late last month.</p>

<p>Milton killed at least 11 people as it churned across the state and then out to the Atlantic. But Floridians heaved a sigh of relief because the storm surge, catastrophic damage and loss of life that many people feared did not materialize in the end.</p>

<p><strong>Now, what?</strong></p>

<p>When Escalona saw a few inches of water on the floor of her home, she first thought a neighbor had left the water running, but soon realized something was very wrong.</p>

<p>"It all happened very quickly. The water rushed in suddenly, it was strong, with a lot of current," Escalona recalled.</p>

<p>"We grabbed some papers and the dog and left. We spent the night outside the door of the neighbors upstairs," she said.</p>

<p>Now she and her husband are wondering what to do and where to go.</p>

<p>"It is not easy to think you have everything and suddenly you have nothing," said Rodriguez.</p>

<p>"We dont know where to go. We have been in this country for nearly 20 years and have no family. It's her, me, and the dog," he said, pointing to their chihuahua Tito.</p>

<p><strong>Relief replaces fear</strong></p>

<p>Even though Milton was a powerful Category 3 hurricane on a five-level scale, in the end Florida was not hit nearly as hard as officials had feared.</p>

<p>In fact, most of the 11 fatalities from the storm happened on the east coast, away from where the storm made landfall, due to tornados that spun off from the storm.</p>

<p>In Sarasota, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) south of Clearwater and near where the hurricane made landfall, streets were gradually getting back to normal.</p>

<p>Emergency crews cleared many streets before dawn, but there were still downed trees in some places, along with broken glass and other damage.</p>

<p>Near the marina in Sarasota, dozens of people walked around taking pictures of the storm damage with their cell phones.</p>

<p>They looked at a speedboat that had rammed into a boat rental office because of Milton's powerful winds.</p>

<p>Many people expressed relief that the city was not as badly damaged as they had expected.</p>

<p>"I think it could have been a lot worse," said retiree Donna Pickup.</p>

<p>That feeling of relief is shared in Punta Gorda, 100 kilometers (60 miles) southeast of Sarasota.</p>

<p>In that town, hit hard by Hurricane Ian in 2022, the storm surge that rushed in Wednesday night flooded seaside areas and left several yachts stranded on the oceanfront promenade.</p>

<p>But here, too, the damage was not as bad as many had feared.</p>

<p>"Thank God," said David Cardoso, "a lot of houses are in pretty good tack".</p>

<p>He added: "It was supposed to hit us worse."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 20 miners were killed and eight others were injured early Friday when unidentified armed men attacked their coal mines in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province.</p>

<p>The incident occurred in the Dukki area of the province, Dunya News reported.</p>

<p>The attack is the latest in a string of violence in Pakistan. It comes less ahead of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation's summit to be held in the national capital.</p>

<p>According to District Chairman Dukki Haji Khair Ullah Nasir, the attackers used hand grenades and rocket launchers in the attack. He said that there are ten coal mines located in the area.</p>

<p>Nasir said that the attackers also set ablaze mining machinery before fleeing the scene.</p>

<p>At least 20 miners were killed and eight others were wounded.</p>

<p>Police, paramilitary Frontier Corps (FC) and rescue teams rushed to the spot after the attack.</p>

<p>Police sources said that the death toll may rise as some injured minors were in critical condition.</p>

<p>SHO Dukki Hamanyan Khan said the armed men first gathered the miners in different groups and then sprayed bullets on them.</p>

<p>Heavy contingents of police and FC have cordoned off the area and launched a search operation to arrest the culprits.</p>

<p>Pakistan has witnessed a worrying surge in terrorist attacks in the ongoing year with fatalities in the first three quarters surpassing the numbers recorded in all of 2023.</p>

<p>As per the third Quarterly Report (Q3) issued by the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), the number of fatalities rose to at least 1,534 in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to 1,523 in 2023.</p>

<p>Balochistan, bordering Iran and Afghanistan, is home to a long-running violent insurgency. Baloch insurgent groups have previously carried out several attacks targeting CPEC projects.</p>

<p>The banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) accuses China and Islamabad of exploitation of the resource-rich province, a charge rejected by the authorities. It has fought a long-running insurgency for a separate homeland.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, two Chinese nationals were killed and 17 people injured in a suicide attack by a Baloch insurgent group that targeted a convoy of Chinese workers near Pakistan's busiest airport in Karachi. PTI SH NSA NSA</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's army said Friday it had killed Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad's top commander for the Nur Shams refugee camp in the occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>The military said Mohammad Abdullah was "eliminated" on Thursday after Israeli aircraft struck the camp in Tulkarem.</p>

<p>An additional "terrorist" was killed in the operation, which recovered M-16 rifles and vests, it added.</p>

<p>Abdullah was the successor of Muhammad Jabber, also known as Abu Shujaa, who was killed in an Israeli strike in late August. Islamic Jihad is an ally of Hamas, with both groups battling Israeli forces in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Violence has soared in the West Bank since Hamas launched its unprecedented attack on Israel in October last year.</p>

<p>Israeli troops or settlers have killed at least 705 Palestinians in the West Bank since, according to the Ramallah-based health ministry. Israeli officials say at least 24 Israelis, civilians or members of the security forces, have been killed in attacks carried out by Palestinian militants or in Israeli military operations over the same period in the West Bank.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Hurricane Milton: Florida grappled with flooding and power outages from a milder than expected storm that many had feared would be catastrophic.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 11 people died as Hurricane Milton sent tornadoes spinning across Florida, officials said Thursday as the state grappled with flooding, power outages and other issues from a milder than expected storm that many had feared would be catastrophic.</p>

<p>The hurricane blasted across the state late Wednesday before roaring into the Atlantic, leaving behind roads blocked by downed trees and power lines. It shredded the roof of a baseball stadium. Some three million homes and businesses were without power.</p>

<p>So far, though, it appeared that tornadoes, rather than floodwaters, have been responsible for the storm's deaths.</p>

<p>"It was pretty scary," said Susan Stepp, a 70-year-old resident of Fort Pierce, a city on Florida's east coast where four people in a senior living community died after a tornado spawned by Milton struck Wednesday.</p>

<p>"They did find some people just outside dead, in a tree," she told AFP. "I wish they would have evacuated."</p>

<p>The deaths are five in St. Lucie County, three in Volusia County two in the city of St. Petersburg and one in the city of Tampa, local authorities said. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters the deaths were caused by the tornadoes.</p>

<p>In Tampa, police found a woman in her early 70s trapped under a large tree branch and pronounced her dead, saying her death "is believed to be related to restoration efforts post Hurricane Milton."</p>

<p>In Polk County, a member of a road crew was struck and killed by a colleague's vehicle as he removed a downed tree.</p>

<p>Stepp's husband Bill said a tornado "picked up my 22-ton motor home and threw it across the yard."</p>

<p>"Scary and heartbreaking at the same time, to see much damage and all things you really love just gone, but it's only things and we're still here," the 72-year-old said.</p>

<p>The southeastern US state was able to avoid the level of catastrophic devastation that officials had feared.</p>

<p>"The storm was significant, but thankfully this was not the worst-case scenario," Florida Governor Ron DeSantis told a news conference.</p>

<p>Milton made landfall on the Florida Gulf Coast as a major Category 3 storm, with powerful winds smashing communities still reeling from Hurricane Helene which hit only two weeks ago, killing 237 people in Florida and other southeast states.</p>

<p>The National Weather Service issued 126 tornado warnings across the state Wednesday, the most ever issued for a single calendar day for the state in records dating back to 1986, wrote hurricane expert Michael Lowry.</p>

<p>In Sarasota Bay, Kristin Joyce, a 72-year-old interior designer who did not evacuate either, took photos of tree branches snapped by the wind.</p>

<p>"There is no question it needs to be a serious wake-up call for everyone in terms of climate change," she told AFP, surveying the damage.</p>

<p>Scientists say extreme rainfall and destructive storms are occurring with greater severity and frequency as temperatures rise due to climate change. As warmer ocean surfaces release more water vapor, they provide more energy for storms as they form.</p>

<p><strong>Biden fury at Trump</strong></p>

<p>President Joe Biden, who said he spoke with DeSantis Thursday, urged people to stay inside in the aftermath of the storm, with downed power lines and debris creating dangerous conditions.</p>

<p>In a video posted on social media, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he and his wife Melania were praying for Florida residents affected by the storm and urged them to vote for him.</p>

<p>"Hopefully, on January 20th you're going to have somebody that's really going to help you and help you like never before," the former president said, referring to the presidential inauguration date.</p>

<p>Hurricane Helene struck Florida late last month, and the back-to-back storms have become election fodder as Trump spreads conspiracy theories claiming Biden and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris are abandoning victims.</p>

<p>That prompted a furious response from Biden who on Wednesday called Trump "reckless, irresponsible."</p>

<p><strong>'Lucky'</strong></p>

<p>In Cocoa Beach, on Florida's east coast, one tornado swept in from the ocean, blowing out almost all the windows of a hair salon and tearing a chunk of roof off a bank.</p>

<p>Katherine and Larry Hingle said they were on their porch, watching water from a nearby river rise, when the tornado came through Wednesday evening.</p>

<p>"I said 'it sounds like a train's coming,'" Katherine, 53, told AFP while out to walk their dog and survey the damage.</p>

<p>In Sarasota, resident Carrie Elizabeth expressed the feelings of many -- that despite the violent night, Milton was not quite as bad as had been feared.</p>

<p>"I feel that we're very lucky," she said. "It'll take a long time to clean up, but it could have been much worse."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

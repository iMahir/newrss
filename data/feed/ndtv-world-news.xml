       <description><![CDATA[Passengers will have the opportunity to explore international destinations at sea, with the cruise line promising an easy, carefree experience.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A luxury cruise line has introduced a unique, four-year voyage designed for travellers interested in "skipping ahead" in time, especially those looking to sit out a second Trump term.&nbsp;According to<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://fortune.com/2024/11/11/villa-vie-residences-4-year-skip-ahead-cruise-second-trump-term/" rel="nofollow, noindex"> Fortune,&nbsp;</a></em>Florida-based<em>&nbsp;</em>Villa Vie Residences is offering a 4-year "Skip Forward" voyage for Americans looking to escape the country following Donald Trump's re-election. This unique package allows passengers to travel the world in style, visiting iconic destinations, and essentially "skipping" the next presidential term.</p>

<p>According to a press release from Villa Vie Residences, residents have the flexibility to join their customised journey at any port during the continuous global adventure for up to 4 years. The package is available for a one-time payment of $159,999 for double-occupancy rooms or $255,999 for single-occupancy cabins.&nbsp;Passengers will have the opportunity to explore international destinations at sea, with the cruise line promising an easy, carefree experience.</p>

<p>Villa Vie Residences stressed that its "Skip Forward" package is designed for travellers of all backgrounds and political affiliations. Although launched following the 2024 US presidential election, the package's purpose is to provide a unique travel experience, not to promote any political agenda.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Villa Vie CEO Mikael Petterson told&nbsp;<i>Fox News</i>, ''Although the campaign was put together before the results of the election, we feel we have a perfect product for those who said they'd leave the country if XYZ wins the election. We may have differing political views, but our community comes together through our passion for exploring the world in a very real way that goes far beyond politics.''</p>

<p>He also explained to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-cruise-world-travel-retire-digital-nomad-1984726">Newsweek</a></em> that the marketing campaign was conceived before the election results were known, anticipating that half of the population might feel dissatisfied regardless of the outcome. He emphasised that the company holds no political stance and simply wanted to offer an option for those feeling unsettled to have a way to get away.</p>

<p>For those hesitant to commit to a four-year cruise, Villa Vie Residences also offers alternative options. Travellers can choose from a one-year "Escape from Reality" journey, a two-year "Mid-Term Selection" voyage, or a three-year "Everywhere but Home" cruise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''Villa Vie offers a unique one-of-a-kind way to see the whole world at a slow pace where you have enough time to experience the cultural vibe of every port. Your villa is your bedroom, and the ship is your home, she'll take you across the globe to endless horizons,''&nbsp;said Anne Alms, head of sales for <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/villa-vie-residences-releases-tour-la-vie--the-4-year-world-cruise-302298810.html">Villa Vie Residences in a statement.&nbsp;</a></p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan TikTok star Imsha Rehman has deactivated her social media accounts after her obscene video went viral. She faced a lot of backlash from social media users, who accused her of intentionally making her private videos public to gain attention online. She, however, appears to be a victim of data breach. This is the second such case after Minahil Malik whose private video with her boyfriend recently surfaced online. Her followers too had accused it a publicity stunt. Malik had reportedly quit Instagram after the controversy.</p>

<h3><strong>Imsha Rehman's response to the controversy</strong></h3>

<p>Before deactivating her account, the young influencer talked about dealing with negative comments, according to local media. She called the backlash "overwhelming".</p>

<p>Several screenshots from her private video have been circulating on social media, and even turned into memes.</p>

<p>Another screenshot, reportedly from Rehman's TikTok account, is making rounds on the internet in which quotes her as saying "<em>Jab tak video viral hai maine ne ID off kar di hai</em> (Till the time video is viral, I have deactivated my account)."</p>

<h3><strong>Who is Imsha Rehman?</strong></h3>

<p>She is very famous in Pakistan and is known for her peppy and engaging content. Apart from TikTok, Rehman has presence on other social media platforms too.</p>

<p>In interviews to local channels, Rehman has said that she was born on October 7, 2002. She was born and brought up in Lahore.</p>

<h3><strong>What happened with Minahil Malik?</strong></h3>

<p>Malik also faced a similar controversy after a video showing her in an intimate moment with her partner went viral on social media in October. She claimed the video was "fake" and lodged a complaint with Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).</p>

<p>However, Malik faced intense trolling since social media users accused her of intentionally leaking the video. Pakistani actress Mishi Khan released a video in which she criticised influencers "stooping to the lowest level" for fame. She did not directly name Malik, but the references were said to be directed towards her.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's net worth has taken a $300 million hit following a dip in the shares of Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social. The company's stock saw a decline of 8% on November 12, continuing a downtrend that began after an initial post-election surge, according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2024/11/12/donald-trumps-net-worth-sheds-300-million-as-truth-social-parents-shares-slide/">Forbes</a>.<br />
<br />
By 2:40 pm EST on November 12, Trump Media's stock fell below $31, down from a high of $33.41 on November 11. This drop comes after a two-day rally that saw the stock rise by 20.6%. As a result, Trump's 57% ownership stake in Trump Media — equating to 114.75 million shares — has seen its value decrease from just over $3.8 billion on November 11 to around $3.5 billion. This represents a significant fall from a peak of $5.2 billion when the stock reached $45.77 on November 6, reported Forbes.</p>

<p>The initial rally in the company's stock price followed a statement from Trump on Truth Social last week. He dismissed rumours of his intention to sell his stake in Trump Media, describing them as “fake, untrue and probably illegal claims,” although it remains unclear what specific allegations he was referring to.</p>

<p>According to the latest Forbes estimates, Trump's current net worth is valued at $5.6 billion, making him the 591st wealthiest individual globally. His fortune has experienced fluctuations due to the volatility of Trump Media's stock. A surge in October briefly pushed his net worth above $8 billion for the first time since the company went public earlier this year.</p>

<p>Although Trump has repeatedly stated he would not sell his stake in Trump Media, other company executives have made plans to sell shares. Earlier this month, Trump Media CFO, Phillip Juhan, announced intentions to sell shares worth around $13.4 million by December 2025, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.<br />
<br />
Trump Media has faced significant volatility since its public listing in March 2024 through a reverse merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp. The company's stock has been subject to fluctuations linked to both Trump's political campaign and the financial performance of the business itself.<br />
<br />
According to Forbes, in its third-quarter earnings report, Trump Media revealed a net loss of $19 million, citing legal expenses and costs associated with its TV streaming services. The stock spiked following Trump's debate with President Joe Biden and an attempt on his life in July but it dropped sharply after his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris in September.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Known for his no-nonsense articulation of India's position on geopolitical issues, External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar had a sharp response when an Australian journalist asked him if New Delhi recognises Canberra's "angst" over its ties with Russia.</p>

<p>Dr Jaishankar was speaking to Sky News Australia's Sharri Markson in an interview during his recent visit. When Ms Markson asked him if India recognises the "angst" its relationship with Russia causes Australia, he replied, "I don't think we have given cause for any angst. In this day and age, countries don't have exclusive relationships."</p>

<p>The minister then drew a Pakistan parallel. "If I were to use that logic, I would say so many countries have relationship with Pak. Look at the angst it should cause me," he said.</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tl0Y1Gyy2c8?si=CdhuQD_zlgbzJFDK" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>Dr Jaishankar then proceeded to explain how India's close ties with Russia is in the interest of the international community. Referring to Delhi's decision to buy Russian oil despite the West and other counties sanctioning Moscow after the Ukraine war broke out, the minister said,</p>

<p>"If we had not made the moves we had, the energy markets would have taken a completely different turn and precipitated a global energy crisis, it would have caused inflation across the world."</p>

<p>He said India's ties with Russia enables it to play a role in bringing the conflict to the talks table. "The fact that we have a good relationship with Russia allows us to be a country in between which has the ability to talk to both Russia and Ukraine and try to find some intersection in those conversations. i think the world, including Australia, needs such a country that will help bring this conflict back to the conference table," he said, adding, "Conflicts rarely end on battlefield, mostly they end in negotiations."</p>

<p>Australia has backed Ukraine in its conflict with Russia and supplied Kyiv with weapons. When the conflict began in 2022, then Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison had said Russia should be seen as a "pariah state" and no country should have anything to do with them.</p>

<p>As the West imposed sanctions on Russia, India decided to continue buying oil from Moscow. This raised eyebrows and Dr Jaishankar countered the West's questions regarding India's decision. The former diplomat had then sharply said that Europe needs to grow out of the mindset that Europe's problems are the world's problems but the world's problems are not Europe's problems. He had said India has a right to prioritise its energy needs. Later, speaking at NDTV World Summit, Dr Jaishankar had underlined that Moscow never done anything to impact India's interests negatively.</p>

<p>On the Ukraine conflict, the Narendra Modi government has refused to take sides, with the Prime Minister stressing that this is not an era of war. The Prime Minister recently travelled to both Ukraine and Russia. India, he has said, is not neutral, but on the side of peace.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Two money-making education apps that are part of the troubled Byju's software empire were wrongly transferred away from US lenders and must be returned to a court-supervised bankruptcy trustee, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two money-making education apps that are part of the troubled Byju's software empire were wrongly transferred away from US lenders and must be returned to a court-supervised bankruptcy trustee, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.</p>

<p>A "rogue officer" manipulated Apple Inc. into changing the ownership - and the revenue stream - of two apps that bring in about $1 million a month, according to the trustee, who controls three of Byju's US units.</p>

<p>The apps are used by parents to download education materials for their children, Catherine Steege, a lawyer for the US units said Tuesday during a virtual hearing. The transfer happened shortly after the trustee took control of the bankrupt units: Epic! Creations, Neuron Fuel, and Tangible Play.</p>

<p>Since the trustee, Claudia Springer, was given control of the three units by a federal judge, unknown people directed by Byju's, which is based in India, have been grabbing cash, moving source code away from cloud systems managed by Apple and Alphabet Inc.'s Google and changing the names of various online accounts, Steege said.</p>

<p>"These bad actors began a game of 'catch me if you can'," Steege told US Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey in Wilmington, Delaware. They are "trying to stay one step ahead of the trustee."</p>

<p>Dorsey ordered Apple to return ownership of the apps to the US units. A lawyer for an Indian firm that had been wrongly given ownership of the apps unsuccessfully tried to persuade Dorsey to delay making any ruling.</p>

<p>The dispute is the latest clash between Byju's and its US lenders. After Byju's, whose formal name is Think &amp; Learn Private Ltd., defaulted on more than $1.2 billion in debt, US lenders took control of one Byju's shell company and forced three smaller, US subsidiaries into bankruptcy.</p>

<p>A representative for Byju's did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Byju's bought the firms just a few years ago for $820 million according to court records. Springer is preparing to hold an auction for at least two of the unit in order to raise money to repay Byju's creditors, including the US lenders.</p>

<p>Lenders have been fighting Byju's in state and federal courts in the US for more than a year. Byju's is facing an insolvency proceeding in India, where a court-appointed professional has been tasked with raising money to repay creditors. That professional, Pankaj Srivastava has asked the US court to take no action related to the three US units because they are owned by Byju's and could be used to repay creditors in India.</p>

<p>Dorsey has rejected those requests, saying the units are US-incorporated entities that are subject to American bankruptcy courts.</p>

<p>Company founder Byju Raveendran has denied wrongdoing, saying his actions were justified in response to overly aggressive tactics used by lenders who specialize in squeezing money out of distressed companies.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Albania is seeing a rebirth of its communist-era military structures. No, not to prepare for a war. The country has turned old bunkers and barracks into tourist destinations. Once symbols of isolation and fear under the iron grip of dictator Enver Hoxha, these buildings are now being repurposed by entrepreneurs and returning émigrés, offering a glimpse into Albania's complex past while helping the country embrace a more prosperous future.</p>

<p>For decades, Albania's legacy of over 220,000 bunkers — built to fortify the country against potential invasions during Hoxha's regime — served as grim reminders of a nation consumed by fear. During the height of his rule, Hoxha's government shut off the country from the outside world, creating an atmosphere of surveillance, paranoia and control. Thousands were imprisoned or executed for attempting to flee, while the population was subjected to a brutal, Stalinist regime.<br />
<br />
But today, this dark history is being revisited through a new lens. Instead of remaining relics of a repressive past, many of these structures are now thriving as part of Albania's tourism boom, which has gained momentum in recent years. Many of the country's former military outposts have been transformed into art galleries, hotels, and restaurants, offering visitors a unique opportunity to connect with Albania's history unexpectedly.</p>

<p>One such transformation is found just outside Tirana, where the former military barracks of Kazerma e Cerenit have been reborn as a popular restaurant and agritourism destination, reported <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/albania-communism-bunkers-cold-war/index.html">CNN</a>. The idea came from Ismet Shehu, a chef who trained in the UK and worked with royalty before returning to Albania to open a series of restaurants. His latest venture, Kazerma, opened its doors just a year and a half ago. The building, once used for housing military trucks and equipment, now serves as a farm-to-table dining experience.</p>

<p>Shehu said, “When people come here, they say, ‘Wow!', this place used to be for soldiers, it used to be for tanks, TNT and grenades.”</p>

<p>At Kazerma, guests enjoy traditional Albanian dishes served in military-style canteens, with waiters dressed in military uniforms. The restaurant's decor features original memorabilia, including trays and pans from military field kits used to serve duck, alongside former military bunkers now repurposed for wine and cheese tastings.</p>

<p>Just a short drive away, another reminder of the past is Bunk'Art 2, a nuclear-grade bunker now serving as one of Albania's most important museums. Bunk'Art 2 chronicles the political atrocities of Hoxha's rule, housing exhibitions on the Sigurimi — Albania's local surveillance police. Among the objects on display is a wooden broomstick that has a listening device covertly placed in its head, allowing neighbours to spy on one another.</p>

<p>Eni Koco, a local tour guide who lived through the years of communist control, recalls how Albania was effectively cut off from the rest of the world, with borders sealed tight to prevent any form of escape. “We became compared with North Korea because the government created a cult of personality, telling us they were gods and we needed to worship them, creating a system to control the borders and killing anyone trying to escape or enter the country,” said Koco.</p>

<p>The Ottoman-era town of Gjirokaster, Hoxha's birthplace, offers another layer to the country's history. While the building where Hoxha was born is now the Ethnographic Museum, efforts are also underway to preserve the history of Albania's communist period. Then in the farming village of Fishte, agritourism has breathed new life into another former communist-era site. The Mrizi i Zanave restaurant, set in a compound that was once a prison, now serves as a hub for local traditions and food.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Exactly 28 years after the jury convicted the Menendez brothers, the house was sold for $17 million in March 2024.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the Hindenburg crash site in New Jersey to the spooky hiking trails in Colorado, a lot of places historically associated with death and tragedy have now become popular spots for "dark tourism" in the United States. A new addition to the list is a Beverly Hills mansion in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The house came into the spotlight after the release of Netflix's popular show Monsters and the documentary <em>The Menendez Brothers</em>. Now, the mansion has been transformed into a huge tourist destination, with tour buses and rental vehicles continuously stopping by to catch a sight of the place, reported <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/travel-news-mendendez-brothers-mansion-beverly-hills/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN</a>.</p>

<p>Netflix's true crime anthology series Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, based on the Menendez brothers case, was released in September. A month later, the streaming giant released a two-hour documentary called The Menendez Brothers, which included fresh audio conversations with the siblings. A new generation was exposed to a case that had their parents and grandparents glued to television screens during the trials in 1993.</p>

<p>The trial was one of the first of its kind to be televised. The country was captivated by the story of two charming but disturbed young men who appeared to have it all before they suddenly snapped and killed their parents with shotguns.</p>

<p>Since the release of the Netflix series and documentary, TikTokers have turned the house's resurrected celebrity status into a treasure trove of viral material, filming the mansion and replaying the graphic details of the murder scene for viewers online. In recent months, tourists have begun pouring onto the crime scene.</p>

<p>CNN interviewed visitors who travelled from near and far to see the house. Toni Ricci, who owns a dance class in the area, claimed she came with her five coworkers who followed the case. But the neighbours aren't as thrilled with the influx of people.</p>

<p>A local, who spoke to CNN, is eager for the hype to subside but is aware that it won't happen anytime soon. He said, "We're probably now going to have to wait another decade or two for it to calm down again, and hopefully there won't be another documentary in 20 years' time."</p>

<p>The Menendez family no longer owns the mansion. Exactly 28 years after the jury convicted the brothers, the house was sold for $17 million in March 2024, according to the Realtor. The names of buyers have not been disclosed.</p>

<p>Currently unoccupied, the mansion is being renovated. However, that hasn't hindered its appeal at home or abroad.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, received around 400 million Amazon shares as part of her divorce settlement in 2019.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MacKenzie Scott, billionaire philanthropist and ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has further cut down her Amazon stake. A November 8 filing revealed that Scott sold 11 per cent of her Amazon shares valued at over $8 billion on September 30.</p>

<p>The latest transaction brings her total Amazon share sales and gifts to 255 million shares, amounting to around $37 billion at the time of the disposals. With this, Scott, who received around 400 million Amazon shares as part of her divorce settlement with Bezos in 2019, has sold or donated two-thirds of those holdings in less than six years.</p>

<p>This makes her one of the five most generous living donors in the US, with at least $17.3 billion donated to non-profit organisations, according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/phoebeliu/2024/11/11/billionaire-philanthropist-mackenzie-scott-sold-donated-more-amazon-shares/">Forbes</a>.</p>

<p>Currently, Forbes estimates Scott's net worth at $30 billion, a drop from $38 billion just a week ago, and significantly down from her peak of $59 billion in 2021. Had she not given away her Amazon shares, her wealth would have been closer to $82 billion, placing her among the top 20 richest people globally and making her the second richest woman.</p>

<p>While Scott has never publicly discussed her philanthropic efforts in great detail, she regularly updates her <a href="https://yieldgiving.com/essays/bridges-and-barriers">Yield Giving website</a> and lists grants made to various causes. In one of her essays in December 2022, Scott wrote, “Information from other people – other givers, my team, the non-profit teams I've been giving to – has been enormously helpful to me.” She also reflected on the challenges of creating a platform that properly conveys her philanthropic intentions.</p>

<p>Scott has recently given $1.5 million to the Mni Sota Fund, a non-profit organisation that builds wealth for urban Native people in Minnesota. Then Access to Capital for Entrepreneurs in Georgia received $10 million in August from her. Additionally, Coastal Enterprises, an organisation focused on rural economic development in Maine, was given $15 million in October 2024, marking a rare second donation to the same organisation from Scott, according to Forbes.</p>

<p>Scott often opts not to publicise her donations unless requested by the recipients. Each year, Scott unveils new grants through her Yield Giving platform, usually at the end of the calendar year. It's likely that some of the Amazon shares sold in this recent filing were directed to non-profit groups as part of her ongoing charitable commitments.</p>

<p>Of the $37 billion in Amazon shares Scott has offloaded so far, she has announced donations of $17.3 billion to more than 2,300 organisations. The remaining value from the sales is likely held in donor-advised funds or other charitable accounts, with some funds possibly already being sold.</p>

<p>Scott's unique approach to philanthropy has garnered attention for its simplicity and effectiveness. She does not actively solicit requests for grants, except for her Open Call initiative, which awarded $640 million to 361 organisations earlier this year. Her unrestricted cash grants, which are often larger than an organisation's annual budget, have made a significant impact on many smaller charities. For instance, Dianne Calvi, CEO of Village Enterprises, a non-profit tackling poverty in rural Africa, noted that Scott's $7 million donation last year significantly boosted the organisation's reputation, leading to additional funding.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bus carrying guests home from a wedding plunged into a river in northern Pakistan killing at least 14 people, officials said Wednesday, with the bride so far the only known survivor.</p>

<p>"There were 25 people on the bus and so far 14 dead bodies have been recovered while 10 are still missing," said Wazir Asad Ali, a rescue official in Gilgit-Baltistan.</p>

<p>"The bride is out of danger and she is being treated in a Gilgit hospital," Ali added. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Naik Alam, a senior police official from the area, told AFP the driver appeared to have been speeding when he lost control at a curve. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The groom's family had travelled from Punjab, more than 500 kilometres (300 miles) away, for the wedding and were returning home when the accident happened.</p>

<p>Road accidents with high fatalities are common in Pakistan, where safety measures are lax, driver training is poor, and transport infrastructure is often decrepit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Balochistan in August, 12 men died when their bus crashed into a ravine on the Makran Coastal Highway. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In another accident that month, 24 people on board a bus were killed when it plunged into a ravine near the town of Azad Pattan on the border between Punjab province and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. &nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media sensations Peanut, the squirrel, and Fred, the raccoon, were marked for death and decapitation days before they were seized from their owner in New York, a county official has confirmed. The two pets also tested negative for rabies, the official added.<br />
<br />
The state agents picked them up from their owner in a raid on October 30, sparking major outrage on social media and accusations of government overreach.<br />
<br />
The state officials advised the county to euthanise <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/new-york-authorities-euthanise-instagram-squirrel-star-6927159">Peanut</a> and Fred seven days before they were taken into custody by the authorities from their 'unofficial' caretaker Mark Longo.</p>

<p>The Department of Environmental Conservation said the squirrel bit an agent at the time of the raid, sparking the need for a rabies test.<br />
<br />
“Wildlife cannot be confined like domestic animals, and if there was an exposure, the animals would need to be tested for rabies,” the State Department of Health wrote to the county on October 23.<br />
<br />
The message sealed Peanut and Fred's fates as the rabies test required decapitation so that their heads could be opened for their brain samples.<br />
<br />
The timeline shows that after a few days on October 29, the Department of Environmental Conservation came up with plans to raid Longo's residents. At the same time, it was coordinating the animals' euthanisations with Elmira Animal Control.<br />
<br />
This contradicts the earlier claim that the squirrel prompted his own euthanisation.<br />
<br />
When shown the timeline, Longo told The New York Post, "I'm in utter shock... I'd like to give you a proper statement, but for now, I'll just say ‘Wow.'”<br />
<br />
Longo, who earlier claimed the two animals were rabies-free, said he was yet to receive any word from the officials about them. The operation by DEC was set in motion when it got four complaints about Longo keeping two animals without a license.<br />
<br />
“DEC is aware of an individual in Chemung County who is known to illegally possess an adult grey squirrel and at least four young raccoons. They may also be in possession of other illegal wildlife species,” the DEC earlier said.</p>

<p>With more than five lakh followers on Instagram, the domesticated black squirrel had fans around the world.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[At least three airlines cancelled flights between Australia and Bali this week after a volcano eruption in eastern Indonesia spewed a vast plume of volcanic ash into the air.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">At least three airlines <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-13/flights-to-and-from-bali-cancelled-due-to-volcanic-ash/104593698">cancelled flights between Australia and Bali</a> this week after a volcano eruption in eastern Indonesia spewed a vast plume of volcanic ash into the air.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>But while would-be holiday makers are naturally <a href="https://7news.com.au/sunrise/volcanic-eruption-in-indonesia-forces-airlines-to-cancel-flights-to-bali-stranding-frustrated-passengers-c-16732486">upset</a> at having their plans disrupted, it's worth remembering it's not safe to fly planes through volcanic ash.</p>

<p>So, how do airlines decide it's not safe to fly when a volcano erupts? And why is volcanic ash so dangerous for aircraft, anyway?</p>

<h3><strong>What does volcanic ash do to a plane?</strong></h3>

<p>Volcanic ash particles are very, very abrasive. They can cause permanent damage to windscreens in the aircraft and can even make windscreens look opaque – like someone has gone over them with sandpaper.</p>

<p>Imagine getting spectacles and scraping them over and over with sandpaper – that's what you'd see if you were sitting in the cockpit.</p>

<p>Volcanic ash can also clog or damage external sensors, leading to erroneous readings, and can infiltrate an aircraft's ventilation system. This can affect cabin air quality and lead to potential respiratory issues.</p>

<p>But the main issue, in fact, is the impact volcanic ash has on engines.</p>

<p>A jet engine works by drawing in air, compressing it, mixing it with fuel and igniting it. This creates high-pressure exhaust gases that are expelled backward, which pushes the engine (and the aircraft) forward.</p>

<p>The correct balance of fuel and airflow is crucial. When you disrupt airflow, it can cause the engine to stall.</p>

<p>Ash particles that get inside the engines will melt and build up, causing disruption of the airflow. This could cause the engine to “flame out” or stall.</p>

<p>Volcanic ash has a lot of silica in it, so when it melts it turns into something similar to glass. It won't melt unless exposed to very high temperatures – but inside a jet engine, you do get very high temperatures.</p>

<p>There was a famous incident in 1982 where a <a href="https://theaviationgeekclub.com/the-story-of-british-airways-flight-9-the-boeing-747-that-lost-all-four-engines-due-to-volcanic-ash-yet-it-landed-safely/">British Airways Boeing 747 plane</a> was flying in the vicinity of Indonesia and lost all four engines after it encountered volcanic ash spewing from Java's Mount Galunggung.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the pilot was able to <a href="https://simpleflying.com/gallunggung-glider-the-story-of-british-airways-flight-9/">restart the engines and land safely</a>, although the pilots were unable to see through the front windscreens.</p>

<h3><strong>How do airlines decide it's not safe to fly when a volcano erupts?</strong></h3>

<p>The decision is made by each airline's operational staff. Each airline's operational team would be looking at the situation in real time today and making the decision based on their risk assessment.</p>

<p>Every airline has a process of risk management, which is required by Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority.</p>

<p>Different airlines may tackle risk management in slightly different ways; you might have some cancelling flights earlier than others. But, in broad terms, the more sophisticated airlines would come to similar conclusions and they are likely all communicating with each other.</p>

<p>Mostly, they make the call based on the extent of the plume – how big the cloud of ash is and where it's going, bearing in mind that winds vary with altitude. As you get stronger winds with altitude, the ash can drift quite far from the source.</p>

<p>There is also a United Nations agency called the <a href="https://www.icao.int/Pages/default.aspx">International Civil Aviation Organization</a>, which issues guidance on volcanic ash hazards. Various meteorological agencies around the world work together and liaise with aviation authorities to spread the word quickly if there is an eruption.</p>

<p>For airlines to resume flights, the ash needs to clear and there needs to be a low probability of further eruptions.</p>

<h3><strong>Passenger safety is the priority</strong></h3>

<p>The underpinning reason behind these flight cancellations is safety. If you lose engines and you can't see out the window, the risk to passenger safety is obvious.</p>

<p>Naturally, people are upset about their holiday plans being held up. But it's actually in passengers' best interests to not fly through volcanic ash.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <description><![CDATA[A marble bust bought for &#163;5 (around Rs 540) and long used as a doorstop may soon fetch over &#163;2.5 million (Rs 2.68 crore).]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A marble bust bought for £5 (around Rs 540) and long used as a doorstop may soon fetch over £2.5 million (Rs 2.68 crore). The sculpture, known as the Bouchardon Bust, was made in the early 18th century by renowned French sculptor Edmé Bouchardon and depicts the late Scottish landowner and politician John Gordon. Acquired by Invergordon Town Council in 1930 to honour Gordon, considered the town's founder, the bust was meant to be displayed in the local town hall. But after surviving a fire at a 19th-century castle, the sculpture was misplaced. It ended up being used to open a shed door in an industrial park until its rediscovery in 1998.</p>

<p>After the local government that owns the bust requested permission from Tain Sheriff Court in the Scottish Highlands to sell it, no objections were raised during the hearing, a spokeswoman for the Highland Council told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/12/style/marble-bust-doorstop-auction-intl-scli/index.html" rel="nofollow noindex">CNN.</a></p>

<p>This decision allows the council to proceed with the sale, which had been recommended by a council committee following a public consultation earlier this year. By June, the full council agreed to move forward with the sale.</p>

<p>The bust has attracted interest from a private overseas buyer, who has offered more than £2.5 million through Sotheby's, a renowned auction house. The buyer also pledged to fund a museum-quality replica of the bust for local display.</p>

<p>The sculpture's high value has kept it out of local exhibitions, though it has made appearances abroad, including at the Louvre in Paris in 2016 and the Getty Museum in Los Angeles in 2017.</p>

<p>The spokeswoman told CNN that following court approval last week, a legal review to determine if the bust qualifies as a “national treasure” — under the Waverley Criteria, which restricts certain items from being exported overseas — will “almost certainly be triggered.” When asked by CNN whether an auction would be held, the spokeswoman did not give any confirmation.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[In leaning on hawks Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz, Donald Trump is setting the stage for an existential battle against China -- although, as always, the president-elect's knack for dealmaking may intervene.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In leaning on hawks Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz, Donald Trump is setting the stage for an existential battle against China -- although, as always, the president-elect's knack for dealmaking may intervene.</p>

<p>Trump, who rhetorically at least has long broken with the historic bipartisan consensus in Washington for an assertive US global role, tapped two Florida politicians who still believe in traditional US engagement with the world.</p>

<p>But Rubio, a senator said to be tapped for secretary of state, and Waltz, a congressman named national security advisor, differ sharply from President Joe Biden's vision of internationalism.</p>

<p>Rubio in a speech last year said that the United States was already in a broad global conflict with China, which "doesn't just seek to be the most powerful nation in the world, they seek to reorient the world."</p>

<p>The Biden administration also described China as the top long-term adversary of the United States and ramped up sanctions, but tensions have markedly eased recently, with Biden's top diplomat Antony Blinken focusing on dialogue to prevent unintentional conflict.</p>

<p>The Biden administration believed the United States "should compete with China as effectively as it can on each issue in ways that may be to China's detriment," said Robert Daly, director of the Wilson Center's Kissinger Institute on China and the United States.</p>

<p>"Now we see people who are longtime proponents of the view that the Chinese Communist Party is an existential threat to the United States."</p>

<p>Chinese officials "will tend to see these appointments as proof of what they see anyway: that no matter what they do -- cut a trade deal -- they are facing a United States that is committed to the destruction of the Communist Party," Daly said. "And that will change the nature of the competition."</p>

<p>Trump frequently speaks in terms of dealmaking and has boasted of his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>

<p>But it will ultimately be up to Rubio and Waltz, not Trump, to set the day-to-day "strategic scheme" for US policy, Daly said.</p>

<h3><strong>'Best pick' for traditionalists?</strong></h3>

<p>Rubio, like Waltz, is a fervent supporter of Israel, as is Trump's nominee for US ambassador to Israel, evangelical former governor Mike Huckabee.</p>

<p>The son of working-class Cuban immigrants, Rubio is also a vociferous critic of Latin American leftists.</p>

<p>But the senator, unlike many Trump allies, has also backed international causes alongside Democrats, including supporting development assistance to Africa and US global funding to fight HIV/AIDS.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Trump isn't picking anyone who hasn't pledged fealty to him. That said, Rubio is probably the best pick that conservative internationalists could have realistically hoped for," said Matthew Waxman, a senior State Department official under former president George W. Bush.</p>

<p>Waxman, now a professor at Columbia Law School, said that Rubio "doesn't suck up to autocrats like some in his party, most importantly the president-elect."</p>

<p>"Republicans are split between internationalists, who believe in exercising American leadership around the world, and isolationists who want to pull out from that role," Waxman said.</p>

<p>"Rubio is much more the former, and his choice will likely disappoint the latter, who brand him as too hawkish."</p>

<h3><strong>Allure of the deal</strong></h3>

<p>In a preemptive nod to Trump, Rubio, a longtime critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has said that Ukraine is at a stalemate against Moscow's invasion, backing a negotiated solution.</p>

<p>Trump churned through aides in his first term, naming four national security advisors and two secretaries of state as he soured on his team.</p>

<p>His new appointees are certain to know where they stand and how they risk being pushed aside if they disagree, said Allison McManus, managing director for national security and foreign policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress.</p>

<p>Trump, she said, is likely less concerned about ideology than dealmaking, including on two priorities that eluded Biden -- ending the Gaza war and winning Saudi recognition of Israel.</p>

<p>Trump has even spoken of reaching an agreement with Israel's arch-nemesis Iran, despite walking away from a major diplomatic deal with the country during his first term, which had been negotiated under Barack Obama.</p>

<p>Trump would likely brush aside aides if he believed he can "one-up Biden," McManus said.</p>

<p>"We know that for Trump, his north star is cutting a deal -- especially a better deal than whoever the president was before him," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Disturbing footage of an attempted child kidnapping on a New York City sidewalk over the weekend has emerged on social media. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/11/us-news/masked-maniac-caught-on-video-trying-to-abduct-jewish-boy-is-arrested/" rel="nofollow, noindex">New York Post,</a></em> the incident occurred Saturday at approximately 3:30 p.m. in Brooklyn, according to the New York Police Department. The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/NotICE_724/status/1856173921067835424">chilling video</a> shows a masked individual crossing the street and approaching a father walking hand-in-hand with two children. The suspect suddenly lifts one of the children off the ground, but the quick-thinking father springs into action, pushing the man away and foiling the alleged kidnapping attempt.</p>

<p>"They were approached by an unknown individual who picked up the 6-year-old male and unsuccessfully attempted to separate him from his father before walking away," police said in a statement.</p>

<p>Following the incident, police took 28-year-old Stephan Stowe into custody on Sunday. He now faces multiple charges of second-degree attempted kidnapping, first-degree harassment and endangering the welfare of a child.</p>

<p>Speaking with <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://abc7ny.com/post/nyc-crime-man-arrested-community-edge-after-attempted-kidnapping-crown-heights-brooklyn/15535090/">WABC,</a></em> the mother of the young victim revealed that Stephan Stowe is their neighbour. She emphasised the incident's lasting impact on her child, who is now receiving therapy to address the trauma.</p>

<p>''He's very scared, traumatized. For the past two nights, he hasn't been sleeping,'' said the boy's mother.&nbsp;The mother also praised her husband and son's bravery, saying, "They held on tight and didn't let go."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Stowe's close friends shared insights with <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://pix11.com/news/local-news/brooklyn/man-allegedly-tries-to-kidnap-child-walking-with-father-police/">PIX11 News,</a></em> revealing his struggles with mental illness. They defended his character, stating that kidnapping a child would be out of character for him and also expressed sympathy for the affected child and family.&nbsp;According to his friends, Stowe has a history of hospitalisations for his mental health issues and stressed that Stowe requires professional help.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of people queued up in the city of Geelong, south of Melbourne in Australia, to catch a glimpse of what's once-in-a-decade occurrence -- the blooming 'corpse flower'. Amorphophallus Titanum, often shortened to Titan Arum, is popular as the 'corpse flower' in the region for the putrid stench that comes out of it when it blooms to attract beetles and flies, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/geelong-australia-corpse-flower-intl-hnk/index.html">CNN</a> reported.</p>

<p>What makes the plant unique is that it blooms once in 10 years and lasts 24-48 hours, making it a highly coveted event, drawing in large crowds.</p>

<p>“It smells like a dead possum,” a child said, describing the plant.</p>

<p>Geelong Botanic Garden received this plant as a gift from the State Herbarium in Adelaide, South Australia, in 2021. For years, horticulturalists have been waiting for the signs of a nascent bud. Reese McIlvena, the park's manager, said the plant started blooming on Monday (November 11) after several days of anticipation.</p>

<p>On the first day, nearly 5,000 people arrived at the venue to see it. Most visitors described its smell as similar to a dead mouse or stinky pond.</p>

<p>As the garden was scheduled to remain open until Tuesday evening, when the bloom was expected to end, the authorities even offered a live stream of the 'corpse flower' to those interested in watching it but were somehow unable to make it in person.</p>

<p>According to local media, tens of thousands of people, not just from Australia, but from other parts of the world, watched it on the livestream.</p>

<p>Not only that, some visitors have returned to the site multiple times to see the plant in its various stages of blooming.</p>

<p>The 'corpse flower' is native to Indonesia and has been listed as “endangered” under the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Its native habitat of Sumatran forest was devastated by land degradation and deforestation. Most of its land has been converted into plantations for timber, paper or oil palm, IUCN said.</p>

<p>This plant survives for roughly 30 to 40 years and only blooms a handful of times during its lifetime. As per IUCN estimates, only a few hundred of them are left in the wild now.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Samantha Harvey's "Orbital" is the second-shortest novel to win the award and the first to be set in space.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British writer Samantha Harvey won the prestigious Booker Prize on Tuesday for her short novel following six astronauts as they contemplate Earth from the International Space Station.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Spanning the course of a single day, Harvey's "Orbital" tracks astronauts from Japan, Russia, the United States, Britain and Italy as they observe and reflect on their home planet, touching on themes of mourning, desire and the climate crisis.</p>

<p>The Booker, which comes with a 50,000 pound ($64,000) cash prize, has launched careers and courted controversy since its creation in 1969.</p>

<p>Past laureates include Margaret Atwood, Ian McEwan, Julian Barnes and Kazuo Ishiguro.</p>

<p>"I was not expecting that," Harvey said upon learning of her win, the first by a woman since Atwood was recognised in 2019 for "The Testaments" alongside Bernardine Evaristo for "Girl, Woman, Other".</p>

<p>In her acceptance speech, Harvey dedicated the prize to "everybody who does speak for and not against the Earth; for and not against the dignity of other humans, other life; and all the humans who speak for and call for and work for peace".</p>

<p><strong>'Everyone and no one'</strong></p>

<p>Just 136 pages long, "Orbital" is the second-shortest novel to win the award and the first to be set in space, according to the Booker Prize Foundation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is the 49-year-old Harvey's fifth novel, winning 15 years after her debut book "The Wilderness" was longlisted for the prize.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Edmund de Waal, chair of the judges, described "Orbital" as "a book about a wounded world" with "everyone and no one" as the subject.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"With her language of lyricism and acuity Harvey makes our world strange and new for us," he added.</p>

<p>Harvey described her work as a "space pastoral" in an interview with prize organisers after she was named to the Booker longlist.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I wanted to write about our human occupation of low earth orbit for the last quarter of a century -- not as sci-fi but as realism," she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Could I evoke the beauty of that vantage point with the care of a nature writer? Could I write about amazement? Could I pull off a sort of space pastoral? These were the challenges I set myself."&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Historic shortlist</strong></p>

<p>A record five women were in the running for the prize, which was announced at a ceremony in London.</p>

<p>The others were Rachel Kushner for "Creation Lake", Anne Michaels for "Held", Yael van der Wouden for "The Safekeep" and Charlotte Wood for "Stone Yard Devotional".</p>

<p>Percival Everett rounded out the shortlist with his novel "James".</p>

<p>Everett and Kushner had been considered the two favourites for this year's prize.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Booker is seen as a talent spotter of names not necessarily widely known to the general public.</p>

<p>It is open to works of fiction by writers of any nationality, written in English and published in the UK or Ireland between October 1, 2023 and September 30, 2024.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's impending White House return poses questions once again about conflicts of interest related to his business empire, with new cryptocurrency and other ventures raising fresh concerns.</p>

<p>The billionaire's stunning political comeback is "rocket fuel for the Trump Empire," said Mark Hass, an Arizona State University marketing professor.</p>

<p>After almost a decade of making headlines around the globe, Trump's "brand is... sort of the Nike or Apple of politics," he said.</p>

<p>Everybody in the world knows what it stands for.</p>

<p>Trump no longer holds an executive title at the Trump Organisation, which has been run by his two eldest sons since his 2016 election win.</p>

<p>However, the 78-year-old has retained his stake in the family business via a trust, which during his first term in office was managed by a third party.</p>

<p>After he left the White House, Trump made himself a co-administrator of the trust. He has yet to say if he will relinquish the position when he takes office again in January.</p>

<p>Regardless, according to Hass, Trump's association with his businesses will persist.</p>

<p>"Maybe he does not have a direct role in it, but you couldn't get as close to the business without directly running it, than having your sons run it and to have your name on it," he said.</p>

<p>Tim Calkins, a Northwestern University marketing professor, said that Trump's victory has likely revived the family's brand.</p>

<p>"Brands are associations and at the moment the Trump brand is associated with winning, comebacks and momentum," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"Trump is still a very polarizing brand, but the election outcome has strengthened the positive associations," he said.</p>

<p>Since Trump's last term in office, the family business has struck substantial deals overseas, with several linked to Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>The Trump Organization has partnered with Saudi developer Dar Global on a high-rise apartment complex in the Red Sea city of Jeddah, a luxury building in Dubai and a hotel complex in Oman.</p>

<p>It has also signed an agreement with LIV Golf, controlled by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, and has hosted several LIV events on Trump-owned golf courses.</p>

<p>Haas said that such partners understand the contracts give them "influence" over Trump, and will ultimately produce financial benefits for him.</p>

<h3><strong>Stock price</strong></h3>

<p>Trump's conflicts of interest will be "a lot worse" than his last presidency, said Jordan Libowitz, vice president of communications at CREW, a government ethics watchdog group.</p>

<p>Libowitz pointed to Trump's expanded portfolio, which now includes a media group trading on the public market.</p>

<p>"There's nothing stopping, say, the Saudi wealth fund, the Emirati wealth fund, the Kuwait wealth fund -- which all do major investments in technology stocks... from pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the stock," he said.</p>

<p>Trump owns nearly 53 percent of the Trump Media Technology Group (TMTG), the parent company of his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>That stake is currently valued at around $3.8 billion -- making up the majority of his estimated $5.9 billion wealth, according to Forbes.</p>

<p>Foreign investors buying up the stock could raise its price greatly, said Libowitz. "But they can also crash it by selling all en masse."</p>

<p>The New York Post has reported, citing members of Trump's campaign team, that billionaire ally Elon Musk is considering acquiring Truth Social through X, his platform formerly known as Twitter.</p>

<p>The president-elect has also recently ventured into the world of cryptocurrencies, joining his sons in backing a new exchange platform called World Liberty Financial.</p>

<p>Trump is not a shareholder or board member of the start-up, but will receive compensation for the platform using his name.</p>

<p>"It's still not clear how it works or what it's doing," Libowitz said. "But cryptocurrency is notorious for its ability to funnel money anonymously, particularly from overseas."</p>

<p>CREW is considering filing suit against Trump -- as it did during his first administration -- arguing that the president is receiving payments from foreign clients in violation of the US Constitution.</p>

<p>The group's previous suit eventually made its way to the Supreme Court, but it was dismissed because Trump had already left the White House.</p>

<p>"I think it'll be a much more transactional presidency, because there are no obstacles," Hass said of Trump's second term.</p>

<p>"Trump, if nothing else, understands how to monetize his name and his fame."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first shipment of American Turkey products for India left on Tuesday, marking a new phase in the bilateral trade relations between the two countries.</p>

<p>The shipment comes over a year after India agreed to the American request to reduce high tariffs on US turkey products.</p>

<p>US Senator from Virginia Mark Warner, who is also co-chair of the Senate India Caucus, said this marks a historic milestone in international trade, expanding the reach of American turkey products in global markets, and opening new doors for US turkey producers.</p>

<p>"This shipment is a tremendous opportunity for Virginia's poultry producers and a huge step forward for US-India trade," he said.</p>

<p>"As co-chair of the Senate India Caucus, I look forward to the ongoing cooperation between our two nations and to seeing a wealth of new opportunities open up for Virginia's poultry producers,” Warner said.</p>

<p>This shipment comes as a result of a trade agreement and tariff reduction, facilitated by a collaborative effort between the two countries.</p>

<p>Last year, ahead of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the United States, Warner was joined by a number of his colleagues in urging Ambassador Katherine Tai to increase market access for US turkey and poultry products. These products previously faced significant barriers from the Indian market due to prohibitively high tariff.</p>

<p>"Our US turkey producers have long been committed to providing safe, nutritious, and versatile protein options worldwide, and we're excited to see Indian consumers experience the exceptional quality of American turkey," said Leslee Oden, CEO of the National Turkey Federation.</p>

<p>This first shipment is a testament to the strength of US-India trade relations and a reflection of our shared commitment to expanding food diversity and quality, he said.</p>

<p>John King, president of Virginia Poultry Growers Cooperative said the cooperative is "excited to be part of this new market opportunity". He added that the move will help nearly 200 independent turkey grower owners.</p>

<p>Hobey Bauhan, president of the Virginia Poultry Federation, also expressed hope of good returns, saying, "Virginia turkey farmers are pleased to offer high quality, lean protein for export to India, and we are grateful for those who facilitated this opportunity." Under the trade agreement announced in September 2023, India eliminated and reduced retaliatory tariffs on US turkey products, paving the way for increased access to the nation's rapidly growing protein market.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pete Hegseth, a Fox News co-host, author, and US military veteran, has been nominated to lead the world's most powerful military as secretary of defense.</p>

<p>The 44-year-old served as an infantry officer in the National Guard, deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan, and was awarded two Bronze Star medals, his official website says.</p>

<p>He joined Fox News as a contributor in 2014 and now co-hosts Fox and Friends Weekend as well as serves as a host for Fox Nation. He has also authored multiple books.</p>

<p>Hegseth was reportedly considered for secretary of veterans affairs during president Donald Trump's first administration, but was ultimately not selected for the position.</p>

<p>Now, however, he is slated to lead the Pentagon.</p>

<p>Trump hailed Hegseth as "tough, smart and a true believer in America First" in a social media post announcing the nomination. "With Pete at the helm, America's enemies are on notice - Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down."</p>

<p>The president-elect also highlighted Hegseth's success as an author, saying his book "The War on Warriors" was a best-seller, and that it "reveals the leftwing betrayal of our Warriors, and how we must return our Military to meritocracy, lethality, accountability, and excellence."</p>

<p>According to the Washington Post, Hegseth's lobbying of Trump in 2019 resulted in the pardon of two service members who were accused of murder, and the reinstatement of rank of a third who was found guilty of posing with a body in Iraq.</p>

<p>Hegseth is an Ivy Leaguer, graduating from both Princeton and Harvard, though his website says he sent his degree back to the latter institution, and he has criticized it on-air for its allegedly leftist leanings.</p>

<p>He lives with his wife and seven children in the southern US state of Tennessee.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The "dead whale" is not real, but a hyper-realistic model developed using moulds from real whales.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 52-foot rancid-smelling sperm whale benched on the shore of the Caspian Sea in Azerbaijan has become the center of attention. Several people have gathered to catch a glimpse of the giant marine mammal on the coast of Baku. The reason? There are no sperm whales in this vast body of water, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/12/climate/whale-baku-cop29-azerbaijan/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN</a> reported.</p>

<p>This 'dead whale' is not real but a 'hyper-realistic model' developed by an organisation named Captain Boomer. Through this effort, the Belgian-based collective of actors, sculptors, and scientists is trying to raise awareness among the masses about global ecological destruction such as the human-caused climate crisis.</p>

<p>The model has been specially crafted using moulds from real whales, while the smell coming out from it is from buckets of rotting fish hidden nearby to add to the illusion.</p>

<p>Since being developed a decade ago, this model whale has toured multiple cities and coasts, including parts of Europe and Australia.</p>

<p>"When we think the story is right, we pop up in a city," Captain Boomer's Bart Van Peel said.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the organisation has now decided to "beach" the whale in Baku for a special cause - several global leaders are gathering in the city for the UN-backed climate summit COP29. They are scheduled to discuss several issues, including how to tackle the escalating climate crisis.</p>

<p>Speaking with CNN, Bart Van Peel said their aim was to play with fact and fiction and to challenge people's beliefs, making them think about the cause. He added the incongruous animal makes people feel "their bond with nature is disturbed".</p>

<p>The journey of this 'whale' from Belgium to Azerbaijan has been a long one. Before Baku, the members of the organisation loaded it onto a truck and drove across multiple cities in Europe, Turkey, and Georgia, before making their final stop in Baku two weeks later.</p>

<p>To install it, they have prior approval from the authorities in Azerbaijan, with help from local activist Adnan Hussein. Now, their plan is to keep it there for the whole of the climate conference. Accompanying this is a street theatre, where the members of the organisation play scientists' roles to try and establish what happened to the 'whale'.</p>

<p>Interestingly, their idea seems to have worked well as thousands of people have gathered to look at it ever since it was installed on Monday, Van Peel said.</p>

<p>He added that many have had "very emotional reactions" to it, while some even stayed there for more than an hour.</p>]]></content:encoded>

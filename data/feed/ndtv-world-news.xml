       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Iraq to Afghanistan to the US, basic freedoms for women are being eroded as governments start rolling back existing laws.</p>

<p>Just a few months ago a ban on Afghan <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20rq73p3z4o">women speaking in public</a> was the latest measure introduced by the Taliban, who took back control of the country in 2021. From August the ban included singing, reading aloud, reciting poetry and even laughing outside their homes.</p>

<p>The Taliban's ministry for the propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice, which implements one of the most radical interpretations of Islamic law, enforces these rules. They are part of a broader set of <a href="https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2024/09/27/afghan-women-taliban-human-rights">“vice and virtue”</a> laws that severely restrict women's rights and freedoms. Women are even banned <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/afghan-women-cannot-pray-loudly-recite-front-women-says-taliban-minist-rcna177990">from reading the Quran</a> out loud to other women in public.</p>

<p>In the past three years in Afghanistan, the Taliban has taken away many basic rights from women who live there, so that there's very little that they are allowed to do.</p>

<p>From 2021, <a href="https://www.usip.org/tracking-talibans-Mistreatment-women">the Taliban started</a> introducing restrictions on girls receiving education, starting with a ban on coeducation and then a ban on girls attending secondary schools. This was followed by closing blind girls' schools in 2023, and making it mandatory for girls in grades four to six (ages nine to 12) to cover their faces on the way to school.</p>

<p>Women can no longer attend universities or receive a degree certificate nationally, or follow midwifery or nursing training in the Kandahar region. <a href="https://www.usip.org/tracking-talibans-Mistreatment-women">Women are no longer allowed</a> to be flight attendants, or to take a job outside the home. Women-run bakeries in the capital Kabul have now been banned. Women are mostly now unable to earn any money, or leave their homes. In April 2024, the Taliban in Helmand province told media outlets to even refrain from airing women's voices.</p>

<p>Afghanistan is ranked last on the <a href="https://giwps.georgetown.edu/the-index/">Women, Peace and Security Index</a> and officials at the UN and elsewhere have called it <a href="https://www.passblue.com/2023/06/21/the-gender-apartheid-happening-in-afghanistan-un-experts-say-should-be-labeled-an-international-crime/">“gender apartheid”</a>. Afghan women are putting their lives on the line — facing surveillance, harassment, assault, arbitrary detention, torture and exile — to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7hgYu43Krk">protest against</a> the Taliban.</p>

<p>Many diplomats discuss how important it is to <a href="https://press.un.org/en/2022/sc15038.doc.htm">“engage”</a> with the Taliban, yet this has not stopped the assault on women's rights. When diplomats “engage”, they tend to focus on counter-terrorism, counternarcotics, business deals, or <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/04/05/taliban-afghanistan-hostage-diplomacy-western-prisoners/">hostage</a> returns. Despite everything that has happened to Afghan women <a href="https://asiapacific.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2023/09/summary-report-of-country-wide-womens-consultations">over a short period</a>, critics suggest this rarely makes it onto diplomats' priority list.</p>

<h2>Iraq's age of consent</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, in Iraq, on August 4 2024, an amendment to Iraq's 1959 personal status law which would possibly lower the age of consent for marriage <a href="https://time.com/7011752/proposed-bill-amendment-iraq-could-allow-girls-as-young-as-nine-to-marry/">to nine years old</a> from 18 (or 15 with permission from a judge and parents) was proposed by member of parliament Ra'ad al-Maliki and supported by conservative Shia factions in the government.</p>

<p>The law would have the potential of having matters of family law – such as marriage – adjudicated by religious authorities. This change could not only legalise child marriage but also strip women of rights related to divorce, child custody and inheritance.</p>

<p>Iraq already has a high rate of <a href="https://www.girlsnotbrides.org/learning-resources/child-marriage-atlas/atlas/iraq/#:%7E:text=Minimum%20legal%20age%20of%20marriage%20below%2018%20years,-What's%20the%20prevalence&amp;text=28%25%20of%20girls%20in%20Iraq,%2C%20Muthana%20(27%25).">underage marriage</a>, with 7% of girls married by 15 years old, and <a href="https://www.girlsnotbrides.org/learning-resources/child-marriage-atlas/atlas/iraq/#:%7E:text=Minimum%20legal%20age%20of%20marriage%20below%2018%20years,-What's%20the%20prevalence&amp;text=28%25%20of%20girls%20in%20Iraq,%2C%20Muthana%20(27%25).">28%</a> married before the legal age of 18.</p>

<p>Unregistered marriages, not legally recorded in court but conducted through religious or tribal authorities, <a href="https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00K2Z4.pdf">prevent girls from accessing civil rights</a>, and leave women and girls vulnerable to exploitation, abuse and neglect, with limited options for seeking justice.</p>

<p>Many women's groups have already <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/aug/09/proposed-iraqi-law-change-would-legalise-child-say-activists">mobilised against the law</a>. But the amendment has <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/10/iraq-reject-changes-to-personal-status-law-which-would-allow-child-marriage-and-further-entrench-discrimination/">passed its second reading</a> in parliament. If introduced, it could pave the way for further modifications that deepen sectarian divides and move the country further away from a unified legal system. It would also be an especially troubling step backward in protecting children's rights and gender equality.</p>

<h2>Abortion rights in the US</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, in the US, women's access to abortion has been eroded significantly in the past few years. In late 2021, the US was officially labelled a <a href="https://msmagazine.com/backsliding-democracies/">backsliding democracy</a> by an international think-tank.</p>

<p>Six months later, the landmark US Supreme Court ruling of Roe v Wade, which had safeguarded the constitutional right to abortion for nearly 50 years, was overturned. This led to a cascade of restrictive laws, with more than a quarter of US states enacting outright bans or <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/maps/abortion-laws-by-state/">severe restrictions on abortion</a>.</p>

<p>Republican US congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene suggested, in May 2022, that women should stay celibate if they did not <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-celibacy-abortion-dont-have-sex-1707684">want to get pregnant</a>. If only all women had that choice. In fact, in the US a sexual assault occurs <a href="https://rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence">every 68 seconds</a>. One in every five American women has been the victim of <a href="https://www.nsvrc.org/statistics">an attempted or completed rape</a>. From 2009-13, US Child Protective Services agencies found strong evidence indicating that <a href="https://paar.net/child-family-services/statistics/">63,000 children per year were victims of sexual abuse</a>.</p>

<p>These developments reflect a troubling pattern. There is evidence from Donald Trump's first term that there could be further erosion of women's rights in his second presidency. During his previous term there were significant <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-a-second-trump-presidency-is-likely-to-threaten-abortion-rights-and-womens-healthcare-globally-243346">attempts to weaken healthcare access</a>, with his foreign policy reinstating the <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2020/04/unprecedented-expansion-global-gag-rule-trampling-rights-health-and-free-speech">“global gag rule”</a> restricting access to women's reproductive healthcare worldwide via funding conditions.</p>

<h2>Fragility of women's rights</h2>

<p>If the world can tolerate the Taliban's abuses, Iraq's restrictive laws and the US restrictions on abortion access, it reveals the fragility of women's and girls' rights globally, and how easy it is to take them away.</p>

<p>The UN agency, UN Women, says it could take another <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/sites/default/files/2022-09/Progress-on-the-sustainable-development-goals-the-gender-snapshot-2022-en_0.pdf">286 years</a> to close the global gender gaps in legal protections. <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/06/gender-backlash-underscores-urgency-achieve-substantive-equality-women-and">No country has yet achieved gender equality</a>, based on the gender pay gap, legal equality and <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/7625/gender-equality-worldwide/#topicOverview">social inequality</a> levels. Women and girls continue to face discrimination in all corners of the world, and it seems to be getting worse. But despite everything women <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNLvTBZD5AE">continue to resist</a>.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <description><![CDATA[Consular officials at the Indian consulate in Vancouver were recently informed by the Canadian authorities that they have been and continue to be under "audio and video surveillance", the Centre informed Parliament on Thursday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Consular officials at the Indian consulate in Vancouver were recently informed by the Canadian authorities that they have been and continue to be under "audio and video surveillance" and that their "private communications" have also been "intercepted", the Centre informed Parliament on Thursday.</p>

<p>Minister of State for External Affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh in a written response in Rajya Sabha also said "respect for each other's concerns, territorial integrity and sovereignty are essential for a stable bilateral relationship".</p>

<p>Mr Singh was asked whether there are any instances of cyber surveillance or other forms of surveillance targeting Indian diplomats in Canada.</p>

<p>"Yes. Recently, consular officials at the Indian Consulate in Vancouver were informed by the Canadian authorities that they have been, and continue to be under audio and video surveillance and that their private communications have also been intercepted."</p>

<p>"Government of India lodged a strong protest with the Canadian High Commission in New Delhi on this issue vide its note verbale dated November 2, 2024 as these actions were a flagrant violation of all diplomatic provisions," Mr Singh said in his response.</p>

<p>The minister in his response also quoted a response of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson in his weekly briefing to the media recently here.</p>

<p>"By citing technicalities, the Canadian Government cannot justify the fact that it is indulging in harassment and intimidation. Our diplomatic and consular personnel are already functioning in an environment of extremism and violence."</p>

<p>"This action of the Canadian Government aggravates the situation and is incompatible with established diplomatic norms and practices," the spokesperson had said.</p>

<p>Mr Singh was also asked the details and the steps taken to ensure the safety of Indian diplomats.</p>

<p>"On the question of safety and security of Indian diplomats in Canada, the Government of India remains continuously engaged with the Canadian side to ensure that adequate protection is offered at all times to our diplomatic personnel and properties," he said.</p>

<p>The minister also said the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, in its biennial National Cyber Threat Assessment (NCTA) report for 2025-2026 released on October 30, "placed India under 'Section 1 - Cyber threat from state adversaries'".</p>

<p>The MEA had responded to the report on November 2, stating that it was yet another example of Canada's "negative" approach to ties with India. As on other occasions, imputations have been made about India "without any evidence", the minister said, quoting MEA's response.</p>

<p>In a separate written response, Mr Singh also replied to queries on the steps taken for resolving issues with Canada and whether it is a fact that the Government of Canada has "expressed its inability" to provide minimum security to our embassy, consulates and diplomats.</p>

<p>"The two governments are in touch regarding the state of their bilateral ties. Respect for each other's concerns, territorial integrity and sovereignty are essential for a stable bilateral relationship.</p>

<p>"In this regard, Government of India has repeatedly urged the Canadian Government to take prompt and effective action against anti-India elements operating from its soil. This includes preventing secessionist and extremist elements from glorifying the assassination of our leaders issuing threats to our current political leadership and diplomats disrespecting and vandalising places of worship and espousing for the balkanisation of India by holding so-called 'referendums'," he added.</p>

<p>Mr Singh further said while the Canadian authorities have been able to provide "security protection to our diplomats and diplomatic properties", they have recently "expressed their inability to provide security cover to our consular camps from the violent acts of secessionist and extremist elements".</p>

<p>With nearly 1.8 million Indo-Canadians (accounting for about 4.7 per cent of Canada's population) and another 1 million comprising non-resident Indians including approximately 4,27,000 Indian students, Canada hosts one of the largest Indian diasporas abroad, he said.</p>

<p>"As such, the welfare, safety and security of Indian nationals in Canada is of utmost importance to Government of India," the Union minister said.</p>

<p>The relations between the two countries came under severe strain following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of a "potential" involvement of Indian agents in Khalistan extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing.</p>

<p>New Delhi rejected Trudeau's charges as "absurd".</p>

<p>India has been maintaining that the main issue between the two countries is that of Canada is giving space to pro-Khalistan elements operating from Canadian soil with impunity.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[For Putin, Trump's win couldn't come soon enough. Putin may reportedly accept a deal where Moscow gains significant territory in Ukraine (about the size of Virginia) and Ukraine remains neutral and forgets about any plans to join NATO or the EU.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump's win couldn't come soon enough. Putin may reportedly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-ascendant-ukraine-eyes-contours-trump-peace-deal-2024-11-20/">accept a deal</a> where Moscow gains significant territory in Ukraine (about the size of the US state of Virginia) and Ukraine remains neutral and forgets about any plans to join NATO or the EU.</p>

<p>Though Ukraine is experiencing <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/asmagazine/2024/09/19/amid-growing-war-fatigue-some-ukrainians-more-willing-cede-land">war fatigue</a>, so is <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/world/in-russia-clear-signs-of-war-fatigue/">Russia</a>. Russia is making steady advances in the Donetsk region <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-war-russia-joe-biden-us-weapons-troops-donetsk-region-deep-state-shortage/">of Ukraine</a>, but the Kremlin is still struggling to recruit soldiers for the conflict. The recent revelation that North Korean soldiers were fighting in <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm2796pdm1lo">Ukraine attests to this</a>.</p>

<p>Even as Russia ramps up the war, with reports from Ukraine suggesting Moscow had fired its <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c20726y20kvt">first intercontinental ballistic missile </a> of the war, it's become clear that a peace deal would be in the interests of Moscow, as much as Kyiv.</p>

<p>According to western assessments, around 115,000 to 160,000 Russian troops have died, 90% of the personnel it had at the beginning of the war. While another 500,000 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/22/high-russian-death-toll-fails-shift-opinion-ukraine-war">have been injured</a>. To offset these losses, Russia has been recruiting 20,000 new soldiers <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm2796pdm1lo">a month</a>.</p>

<p>Recruiting soldiers into the army has never been that easy in Russia even during peacetime. Recruits are often subject to hazing and bullying by more experienced soldiers, and as such joining the army is viewed as something to be avoided by many young Russian men. Known as <em>dedovshchina</em>, Russian bullying, hazing and beating of conscripts has been a notable pastime in the Russian military since the end of <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/02/17/decade-after-military-reform-hazing-plagues-russian-army-a69309">the 17th century</a>.</p>

<p>After the Soviet Union dissolved, the Russian media exposed the appalling conditions in the military, noting that troops suffered from poor medical care and severe malnutrition. Many Russians may also remember how poorly prepared conscripts were treated who were sent off to fight the war in Chechnya <a href="https://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/russia/russia1102-01.htm#:%7E:text=BACKGROUND%20ON%20CONSCRIPTION%20IN%20RUSSIA&amp;text=During%20the%20Soviet%20period%20conscription,unpopular%20with%20the%20Russian%20public">in the mid-1990s</a>.</p>

<p>The Russian government does not appear to be concerned about the average Russian soldier's <a href="https://www.fpri.org/article/2023/03/the-roots-of-russian-military-dysfunction/">safety and wellbeing</a>. Already unpopular during times of peace, this desperation to avoid being drafted into an active war becomes even more acute.</p>

<figure><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WKztI6vhI4A?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" width="650"></iframe>

<figcaption><span class="caption">Putin appears to be threatening to use nuclear weapons over the war in Ukraine but analysis suggests he is running out of replacement troops.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The military is also seen as a major trap to catch the poor and underprivileged. Conscripts in the Russian army are viewed as meat for the grinder; their graves are ignored and the bodies are sometimes <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/119262/russia-burying-soldiers-unmarked-graves-hide-invasion">not identified</a>.</p>

<p>Most of the recruits have come from far east republics with large indigenous populations such as Bashkortostan, Chechnya, the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) and Dagestan — or as far <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/09/27/ethnic-minorities-hit-hardest-by-russias-mobilization-activists-say-a78879">from Moscow as possible</a>.</p>

<p>But even young men in Moscow are now facing an increasingly aggressive Russian state. Hundreds of thousands of Russians have fled the country, forcing the government to introduce a tougher draft law to <a href="https://theconversation.com/ukraine-war-russia-toughens-up-draft-law-to-round-up-more-people-for-the-frontlines-233048">round up troops</a>.</p>

<p>With the new law, implemented on November 1 this year, instead of receiving a draft notice through the post, draft notices are now delivered online. Once the notice enters a Russian man's digital mailbox, those called up are immediately barred from leaving the country and can face <a href="https://time.com/6270857/russia-ukraine-conscription-law-draft-dodgers/">stiff penalties</a> if they do attempt to leave.</p>

<p>This means that any time a Russian man is in contact with the government – to pay taxes, renew a passport or driver's license, or receive any type of government service – the Russian government can contact them and automatically give them their draft card. Having an online presence in Russia — such as having a bank account or a mortgage or car loan – also makes it harder to evade the draft.</p>

<p>Since the start of the war, Russian men have resorted to all kinds of tactics to avoid being drafted – faking that they had a drug dependency, falsifying medical documents and even in some cases breaking <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2022/10/04/russians-use-drastic-measures-to-avoid-putins-military-draft-including-self-mutilation/">their own bones</a>.</p>

<p>Moving locations within Russia or purchasing property in someone else's name was <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/russia-mobilisation-draft-avoid-men-speak/">also a common tactic</a>, but now these strategies have become more difficult. Someone I interviewed for this article was drafted even though they had not lived in Moscow since 2006. Struggling to find recruits, the Russian government has resorted to going after Russian citizens who live abroad.</p>

<p>Russia has also notably drafted prisoners, which include <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-63517680">murderers and paedophiles</a>. This has caused Russia's <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/10/26/russia-prison-population-convicts-war/">prison population to plummet</a>.</p>

<p>But Putin is running out of men. To attract more recruits, the ministry of defence has increased pay, making it more lucrative than civilian jobs, doubling the bonus for people enlisting in <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/07/31/russia-needs-men-so-badly-its-sign-bonuses-are-nearly-par-us-militarys.html">November of last year</a>.</p>

<p>Relying on the North Korean military offers another solution, but North Korean troops have no combat experience, use different military tactics and most don't speak Russian, which makes it more difficult to coordinate for specific combat operations.</p>

<p>Russian soldiers have complained that they do not know what to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/language-barriers-inexperience-may-hamper-north-korean-troops-russias-rcna177756">do with them</a>. Though this would be widely unpopular in Belarus, Putin may try to force Belarus to offer support, as Belarusian soldiers are familiar with <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4993006-ukraine-north-korean-fighting/">Russian tactics and operations</a>.</p>

<p>In another sign of weakness, Putin is demonstrating that conventional war tactics are no longer enough. On November 19, Putin issued a threat that nuclear weapons could be used, in response to a Ukrainian attack using US made Atacms missiles in the western <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-issues-warning-us-with-new-nuclear-doctrine-2024-11-19/">Bryansk region in Russia</a>.</p>

<p>Usually when conventional war strategies are working, there is no need to lower the threshold for <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-credible-is-russias-evolving-nuclear-doctrine/">nuclear use</a>.</p>

<p>Clearly, the war is not going particularly well for Ukraine either. They are struggling with their own recruitment issues <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68255490">and territorial losses</a>. But it is a mistake to think that Putin is coming to the eventual negotiation table from a position of strength. Luckily for Putin, though he may be running out of men, a favourable deal may be on the horizon that fails to take this into account.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Negotiators at the COP29 climate conference in Baku have struck a landmark agreement on <a href="https://unfccc.int/documents/644407">rules</a> governing the global trade of carbon credits, bringing to a close almost a decade of debate over the controversial scheme.</p>

<p>The deal paves the way for a system in which countries or companies buy credits for removing or reducing greenhouse gas emissions elsewhere in the world, then count the reductions as part of their own climate efforts.</p>

<p>Some have argued the agreement provides crucial certainty to countries and companies trying to reach net-zero through carbon trading, and will harness billions of dollars for environmental projects.</p>

<p>However, the rules contain several serious flaws that years of debate have failed to fix. It means the system may essentially give countries and companies permissions to keep polluting.</p>

<h2>What is carbon offsetting?</h2>

<p>Carbon trading is a system where countries, companies or other entities buy or sell “credits”, or permits, that allow the buyer to offset the greenhouse gas emissions they produce.</p>

<p>For example, an energy company in Australia that produces carbon emissions by burning coal may, in theory, offset their impact by buying credits from a company in Indonesia that removes carbon by planting trees.</p>

<p>Other carbon removal activities include renewable energy projects, and projects that retain vegetation rather than cutting it down.</p>

<p>Carbon trading was a controversial <a href="https://www.undp.org/energy/blog/what-article-6-paris-agreement-and-why-it-important">part of the global Paris climate deal</a> clinched in 2015.</p>

<p>The relevant part of the deal is known as “Article 6”. It sets the rules for a global carbon market, supervised by the United Nations, which would be open to companies as well as countries. Article 6 also includes trade of carbon credits directly between countries, which has begun operating even while rules were still being finalised.</p>

<p>Rules for carbon trading are notoriously complex and difficult to negotiate. But they are important to ensure a scheme reduces greenhouse gas emissions in reality, not just on paper.</p>

<h2>A long history of debate</h2>

<p>Over the past few years, annual COP meetings made some progress on advancing the carbon trading rules.</p>

<p>For example, COP26 in Glasgow, held in 2021, established an independent <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/bodies/constituted-bodies/article-64-supervisory-body">supervisory body</a>. It was also tasked with other responsibilities such as recommending standards for <a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-SBM014-A06.pdf?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">carbon removal</a> and <a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-SBM014-A05.pdf?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">methods</a> to guide the issuing, reporting and monitoring of carbon credits.</p>

<p>But the recommendations were rejected at COP meetings in <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/climate-change/why-experts-are-concerned-about-adoption-of-article-64-rules-for-carbon-market-at-cop29#:%7E:text=The%20decision%20took%20note%20of,at%20both%20COP27%20and%20COP28.">2022 and 2023</a> because many countries viewed them as weak and lacking a scientific basis.</p>

<p>At a meeting in October this year, the supervisory body published its recommendations as “<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/energy-transition/101024-un-carbon-body-adopts-standards-on-removals-methodologies-in-bid-to-fast-track-article-64">internal standards</a>” and so bypassed the COP approval process.</p>

<p>At this year's COP in Baku, the Azerbaijani hosts <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/11/critics-say-approval-of-climate-credits-rules-on-day-one-of-cop29-was-rushed?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">rushed through</a> adoption of the standards on day one, prompting claims proper process had not been followed</p>

<p>For the remaining two weeks of the conference, negotiators worked to further develop the rules. A final decision was adopted over the weekend, but has attracted <a href="https://carbonmarketwatch.org/2024/11/23/cop29-complex-article-6-rules-pave-way-to-unruly-carbon-markets/">criticism</a>.</p>

<p>For example, the <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/610ffde0dd5c39015edc6873/t/6743a75683179e029100e318/1732486999206/COP29+Launches+Dangerous+Market+Mechanisms+v.FINAL.pdf">Climate Land Ambition and Rights Alliance says</a> the rules risk “double counting” – which means two carbon credits are issued for only one unit of emissions reduction. It also claims the rules fail to prevent harm to communities – which can occur when, say, Indigenous Peoples are prevented from accessing land where tree-planting or other carbon-storage projects are occurring.</p>

<h2>Getting to grips with carbon removal</h2>

<p>The new agreement, known formally as the Paris Agreement Trading Mechanism, is fraught with other problems. Most obvious is the detail around carbon removals.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the earlier scenario of a coal-burning company in Australia offsetting emissions by buying credits from a tree-planting company in Indonesia. For the climate to benefit, the carbon stored in the trees should remain there as long as the emissions produced from the company's burning of coal remains in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>But, carbon storage in soils and forests is considered temporary. To be considered permanent, carbon must be stored <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08326-8">geologically</a> (injected into underground rock formations).</p>

<p>The final rules agreed to at Baku, however, fail to stipulate the time periods or minimum standards for “durable” carbon storage.</p>

<p>Temporary carbon removal into land and forests <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590332222003232">should not be used to offset</a> fossil fuel emissions, which stay in the atmosphere for millennia. Yet governments are already <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-53466-0">over-relying on such methods</a> to achieve their Paris commitments. The weak new rules only exacerbate this problem.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, in 2023, almost <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12447">no carbon was absorbed</a> by Earth's forests or soils, because the warming climate increased the intensity of drought and wildfires.</p>

<p>This trend raises questions about schemes that depend on these natural systems to capture and store carbon.</p>

<h2>What next?</h2>

<p>Countries already can, and do, trade carbon credits under the Paris Agreement. Centralised trading will occur under the new scheme once the United Nations sets up a registry, expected next year.</p>

<p>Under the new scheme, Australia should rule out buying credits for land-based offsets (such as in forests and soil) to compensate for long-lasting emissions from the energy and industry sectors.</p>

<p>Australia should also revise its national carbon trading scheme along the same lines.</p>

<p>We could also set a precedent by establishing a <a href="https://climateintegrity.org.au/carbon-removals">framework</a> that treats carbon removals as a complement — not a substitute — for emissions reduction.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is Nigeria's cryptic pregnancy scam?</h2>

<p>BBC Africa Eye has investigated a disturbing fertility scam in Anambra State, Nigeria where desperate women are shelling hundreds of dollars for this treatment that gives desperate women false pregnancies.</p>

<h3>What constitutes this "cryptic" pregnancy?</h3>

<p>Women who come to these clinics are warned not to visit doctors or hospitals as the "baby" will not be detected by any scan or test, since the scammers claim they are growing outside the womb.</p>

<h3>What comes under the treatments?</h3>

<p>The women who come in for these treatments are given mysterious injections that claim that couples can "select" the sex of their future baby which is medically impossible. They are also handed crushed pills, some to take home, a substance inserted into the vagina and instructions on when to have intercourse.</p>

<h3>What happens after the pregnancy reaches full term?</h3>

<p>When it is time to deliver the baby, the "pregnant" women are told labour can only be induced with a "rare and expensive drug" requiring payment, post which they are sedated and wake up with a Caesarean-like incision mark. Others are given an injection which makes them hallucinate and believe they are giving birth.</p>

<h3>What do these scams charge?</h3>

<p>The initial "pre-pregnancy" treatment costs 350,000 naira ($205; £165). The expensive drug that induces labour costs around 1.5 and two million naira ($1,180; £945).</p>

<h3>How do the scammers complete the "treatment"?</h3>

<p>According to authorities, the scammers look for new-born babies and women who are young, pregnant and vulnerable in a country where abortion is not legal. Some women are tricked and some sell their babies. A woman who was too scared to tell her family about her pregnancy, was offered 800,000 naira ($470; £380) for the baby.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[The Israeli military on Thursday said it hit a facility in southern Lebanon belonging to Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah, a day after a ceasefire between the group and Israel began.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel said it conducted an air strike on a Hezbollah weapons facility on Thursday, the first since a ceasefire in the war in Lebanon took effect.</p>

<p>The truce, which came into force on Wednesday, seeks to end a war that has killed thousands in Lebanon and sparked mass displacements in both Lebanon and Israel.</p>

<p>The war began with Hezbollah firing into Israel in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas and its unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel.</p>

<p>Israel shifted its focus from Gaza to Lebanon in September to secure its northern border from Hezbollah attacks, dealing the Iran-backed Shiite Muslim movement a series of heavy blows.</p>

<p>Lebanon deployed troops and tanks on Thursday across the country's south, where Hezbollah has long held sway, where only the army and UN peacekeepers are to maintain a presence under the terms of the ceasefire.</p>

<p>"A short while ago, terrorist activity was identified in a facility used by Hezbollah to store mid-range rockets in southern Lebanon," the Israeli military said, adding that "the threat was thwarted" by its air force.</p>

<p>Nazih Eid, mayor of Baysariyeh in south Lebanon, told AFP a strike had hit an area of his town.</p>

<p>"They targeted a forested area not accessible to civilians," he said.</p>

<p>The deal to end the war in Lebanon was brokered by Israel's top ally the United States and France.</p>

<p>Under the agreement, Israeli troops will hold their positions but "a 60-day period will commence in which the Lebanese military and security forces will begin their deployment towards the south", a US official told reporters on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>Then, Israel should begin a phased withdrawal without a vacuum forming that Hezbollah or others could rush into, the official said.</p>

<p><strong>Two wounded</strong></p>

<p>The Israeli and Lebanese militaries have both called on residents of frontline villages to avoid returning home immediately.</p>

<p>Earlier on Thursday, Israeli fire wounded two people in a border village, according to Lebanon's official National News Agency.</p>

<p>The Israeli army said that "over the past hour, several suspects were identified arriving with vehicles to a number of areas in southern Lebanon, breaching the conditions of the ceasefire".</p>

<p>The army "opened fire toward them", the statement said, adding that the Israeli military "remains in southern Lebanon and will actively enforce violations of the ceasefire agreement".</p>

<p>For the most part, however, the ceasefire appeared to be holding.</p>

<p>A Lebanese army source said its forces were "conducting patrols and setting up checkpoints" south of the Litani River without advancing into areas where Israeli forces were still present.</p>

<p>The Israeli army on Thursday announced a nighttime curfew for areas south of the river, which are located near the border.</p>

<p><strong>Devastation</strong></p>

<p>While there was joy around Lebanon that the war has ended, the country faces a long recovery.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of Lebanese who fled their homes during the war have headed back to their towns and villages, only to find them devastated.</p>

<p>"Despite all the destruction and the sorrow, we are happy to be back," said Umm Mohammed Bzeih, a widow who fled the southern village of Zibqin with her four children two months ago.</p>

<p>"I feel as if our souls have returned," she said, visibly exhausted as she swept up the shattered glass and rubble that carpeted the floor.</p>

<p>In the border village of Qlayaa, residents threw rice and flowers to celebrate the arrival of Lebanese soldiers.</p>

<p>The majority-Christian village is nestled in an area that is home mostly to Shiite Muslim communities.</p>

<p>Lebanon is deeply divided along political and sectarian lines, with Hezbollah long dominant among the Shiite population.</p>

<p>"We only want the Lebanese army," chanted residents of Qlayaa, as they clapped and cheered for the troops and waved the Lebanese flag.</p>

<p><strong>Crisis</strong></p>

<p>Even before the conflict, Lebanon had been wracked for years by political and economic crises, with World Bank data from earlier this year indicating poverty had tripled in a decade.</p>

<p>On Thursday, there was a glimmer of hope as the official National News Agency reported parliament would meet to elect a president on January 9, following a two-year vacuum.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, the only armed group that did not surrender its weapons following the 1975-90 civil war, built its popularity by providing health and education services.</p>

<p>It has maintained a formidable arsenal, supplied chiefly by Iran, which is widely regarded as more powerful than that of the Lebanese army.</p>

<p>Hezbollah proclaimed on Wednesday that it had achieved "victory" in the war against Israel, after the truce took effect.</p>

<p>It also said that its fighters would "remain in total readiness to deal with the Israeli enemy's ambitions and its attacks".</p>

<p>But the war saw Israel deal Hezbollah a string of unprecedented blows, key among them the killing in September of its longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah.</p>

<p>Hezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah told AFP his group was cooperating on the army's deployment in the south.</p>

<p>There is "full cooperation" with the Lebanese state in strengthening the army's deployment, he said, adding the group had "no visible weapons or bases" but "nobody can make residents leave their villages".</p>

<p><strong>Scepticism</strong></p>

<p>In northern Israel, which has come under steady attack from Hezbollah for more than a year, there was hope tinged with scepticism over whether the truce might last.</p>

<p>Nissim Ravivo, a 70-year-old in the coastal city of Nahariya near the border with Lebanon, voiced disappointment.</p>

<p>"It's a shame, we should have continued for at least another two months and finished the job," he said. "We still don't feel safe and we are not happy about it."</p>

<p>Lebanon says at least 3,961 people have been killed in the country since October 2023, most of them in recent weeks.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, the hostilities with Hezbollah killed at least 82 soldiers and 47 civilians, authorities there say.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean pop group NewJeans announced on Thursday that they are leaving their label ADOR, accusing the company of "mistreatment". "ADOR has neither the ability nor the will to protect NewJeans," said group member Hanni at an emergency press conference, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2024-11-28/business/industry/NewJeans-members-to-terminate-contract-with-ADOR/2188944"><em>Korea JoongAng Daily</em></a>. "Staying at the agency will only prolong our psychological pain and waste our time," Hanni further said. Responding to the allegations, ADOR said it never violated the exclusive contracts with members of NewJeans and that it still stands.</p>

<p>The announcement by the pop group soon started circulating on social media and NewJeans became one of the top trends on X.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/slist2015/status/1862114617935487109" rel="noindex,nofollow">press conference was held</a> in Seoul at 8.30 pm (local time) on Thursday. More than 100 reporters were present at the event.</p>

<p>NewJeans said it sent a list of demands to ADOR on November 14 and asked the agency to reply within 14 days. The company claims it complied with the deadline, still the pop stars called the press conference.</p>

<p>ADOR "repeatedly asked the artists" to meet with the company but they refused, according to the agency.</p>

<p>"Even now, we hope to sit down for an honest talk. ADOR will continue to support NewJeans, our artists, and help them grow to become global artists," the company said in a statement.</p>

<p>ADOR emphasised that the contract still stands. "ADOR never breached the contract, and just because (the members of NewJeans) argue that trust has been broken, it does not mean that the contracts can be terminated," it said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The exclusive contracts between the NewJeans members and ADOR still stand. We ask that (the members) continue their activities with ADOR just as they have done until now," the agency further said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian lawmakers passed landmark rules to ban under 16s from social media on Thursday, approving one of the world's toughest crackdowns on popular sites like Facebook, Instagram and X.</p>

<p>The bill has now passed both parliamentary chambers with bipartisan support, and social media firms will soon be expected to take "reasonable steps" to prevent young teens from having accounts.</p>

<p>The firms -- who face fines of up to Aus$50 million (US$32.5 million) for failing to comply -- have described the laws as "vague", "problematic" and "rushed".</p>

<p>The legislation passed parliament's lower chamber on Wednesday and passed the Senate late on Thursday evening. It is now all but certain to become law.</p>

<p>Centre-left Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, eyeing an election early next year, has enthusiastically championed the new rules and rallied Aussie parents to get behind it.</p>

<p>In the run up to the vote, he painted social media as "a platform for peer pressure, a driver of anxiety, a vehicle for scammers and, worst of all, a tool for online predators".</p>

<p>He wanted, he said, young Australians "off their phones and onto the footy and cricket field, the tennis and netball courts, in the swimming pool".</p>

<p><strong>- 'I'll find a way' -</strong></p>

<p>But young Australians like 12-year-old Angus Lydom, are not impressed.</p>

<p>"I'd like to keep using it. And it'll be a weird feeling to not have it, and be able to talk to all my friends at home," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Many are likely to try to find ways around it.</p>

<p>"I'll find a way. And so will all my other friends" Lydom said.</p>

<p>Similarly, 11-year-old Elsie Arkinstall said there was still a place for social media, particularly for children wanting to watch tutorials about baking or art, many of which appear on social media.</p>

<p>"Kids and teens should be able to explore those techniques because you can't learn all those things from books," she added.</p>

<p>On paper, the ban is one of the strictest in the world.</p>

<p>But the current legislation offers almost no details on how the rules will be enforced -- prompting concern among experts that it will simply be a symbolic piece of legislation that is unenforceable.</p>

<p>It will be at least 12 months before the details are worked out by regulators and the ban comes into effect.</p>

<p>Some companies will likely be granted exemptions, such as WhatsApp and YouTube, which teenagers may need to use for recreation, school work or other reasons.</p>

<p>Late amendments were introduced to ensure government-issued digital ID cannot be used as a means of age verification.</p>

<p><strong>- Australia leads the way -</strong></p>

<p>Social media expert Susan Grantham told AFP that digital literacy programmes that teach children to think "critically" about what they see online should be adopted -- similar to a model used in Finland.</p>

<p>The legislation will be closely monitored by other countries, with many weighing whether to implement similar bans.</p>

<p>Lawmakers from Spain to Florida have proposed social media bans for young teens, although none of the measures have been implemented yet.</p>

<p>China has restricted access for minors since 2021, with under-14s not allowed to spend more than 40 minutes a day on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok.</p>

<p>Online gaming time for children is also limited in China.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A young gorilla at a Canadian zoo died after a staff member accidentally crushed its head with a hydraulic door. According to the <em>New York Post</em>, the incident took place on November 12 at the Calgary Zoo in Alberta. Eyare, a 2-year-old western lowland gorilla, was "roaming bedroom to bedroom" with its gorilla mates when a staffer was trying to separate it from the troop for a solo training session, the zoo said in a statement. However, the carer "mistakenly activated the wrong door, resulting in Eyare being struck by the door and sustaining traumatic head injuries," it added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The gorilla team retrieved Eyare from the troop and the veterinary team immediately commenced lifesaving measures, including CPR. Sadly, Eyare succumbed to her injuries," said Colleen Baird, the zoo's director of animal care, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/26/world-news/gorilla-crushed-to-death-due-to-zoo-carers-human-error/"><em>Post</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This tragedy has struck us all in the deepest way imaginable. Eyare's short but impactful life brought so much joy to our community, and she will be deeply missed by all. We will do everything we can to prevent future incidents," Mr Baird added.</p>

<p>Separately, the zoo said that the death "was determined to be an accident caused by human error". &nbsp;The staff member involved in the incident was immediately removed from the workplace and will be reassigned to another area of the zoo, they continued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to authorities, other staff will also face fresh training. The zoo will implement preventive measures - including animal behavioural training - to avoid another incident like this in the future. Moreover, the zoo is also looking at safer alternatives to hydraulic doors "to enhance overall safety and improve staff confidence while reducing safety risks".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the incident, Animal Justice, a Canadian nonprofit that advocates for the humane treatment of animals, called for an independent investigation into animal safety and oversight at the Alberta facility. "The Calgary Zoo appears to have a higher rate of animal deaths compared to other zoos, and in light of Eyare's death there should be a systematic review of the zoo's operations and practices, conducted transparently by the government or another outside party," said Camille Labchuk, the nonprofit's executive director, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/22/americas/calgary-zoo-gorilla-death/index.html" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>CNN</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the Calgary zoo refuted the claim, saying that they adhere to operational standards and have upheld accreditation by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' independent Accreditation Commission since 1978.</p>

<p>"We love and care for more than 4,000 animals representing over 100 species that call our zoo home. Animal deaths caused by human error are extraordinarily rare. In the past 10 years, we have experienced two such losses-a North American river otter in 2016 and 'Eyare' last week," a spokesperson for the Calgary Zoo said in a statement to <em>CNN</em>.</p>

<p>"While uncommon, even one human-caused mortality is one too many. These tragic incidents have been used as critical learning opportunities, driving us to review and to strengthen protocols to uphold the highest standards of care," they added.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 53-year-old Indian-origin neurosurgeon in the US was fined over USD 2 million for medicare fraud after falsely claiming to perform surgeries to implant electro-acupuncture devices.</p>

<p>Dr Rajesh Bindal from the Houston area was fined USD 2,095,946 after being accused of defrauding Medicare and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), US Attorney Alamdar S Hamdani said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>According to federal investigators, Bindal billed for invasive procedures typically requiring operating rooms, yet no such surgeries were conducted. Instead, the devices were merely taped behind patients' ears, often falling off within days.</p>

<p>In some cases, the procedures were performed not by Dr Bindal himself but by a device sales representative or a physician assistant at his clinic, Texas Spine &amp; Neurosurgery Center P.A., rather than in a proper surgical setting.</p>

<p>"A neurosurgeon like Dr Bindal knows the difference between real surgery and sticking a device behind someone's ear," said US Attorney Hamdani. "Despite being among the highest-paid specialists in medicine, he chose personal greed over integrity and patient care."</p>

<p>"This type of fraud not only wastes taxpayer dollars but undermines trust in healthcare providers and critical programs like Medicare. Dr Bindal's actions deceived both the system and vulnerable patients," said Jason E Meadows, Special Agent in Charge of the Department of Health and Human Services - Office of Inspector General.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>90 missiles and 100 drones is what Russia attacked Ukraine's energy infrastructure overnight with. Currently, more than one million people are without electricity as bitter winter hits with Russia's "massive strike".</p>

<p>This is the 11th large-scale attack by Russia on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year causing blackouts nationwide.</p>

<p>Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of "weaponising winter" and stockpiling missiles to launch pre-winter aerial campaigns in Ukraine. "They were helped by their crazy allies, including from North Korea," Andrii Yermak, head of Ukraine's presidential office wrote in a Telegram post.</p>

<p>At least 5 people were injured, one person in central Vinnytsia, two in Odesa and two in Kyiv. Residents took shelter in metro stations as the air raid alert continued for 9 hours. Around 215,000 households were temporarily without power as stated by authorities.</p>

<p>"Power engineers are working to ensure backup power supply schemes where possible. They have already started restoration work where the security situation allows," the Ministry of Energy said.</p>

<p>Russian president Vladimir Putin has said this is a response to Ukraine's attacks with UK and US supplied weapons.</p>

<p>As stated by Ukraine's president Vlodymyr Zelenskyy, cluster munitions were particularly used against civilians and energy infrastructure. He has called the attack out as a "very mean escalation" in the conflict.</p>

<p>"I have a power bank for charging my phone, but I did not buy a more powerful station because I did not take it seriously that there would be such attacks and that missiles would reach us. But it did reach us," Valeriy Dorotiy, a resident of Lutsk, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/28/europe/ukraine-russia-war-power-cut-intl-hnk/index.html" rel="noindex,nofollow">CNN.</a></p>

<p>Roman Turiy, a resident of Ivano-Frankivsk said that, "I expected to be without power for three hours, but according to the new schedule, it looks like we will be without electricity for eight hours today" adding that every winter is getting harder in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Zelensky urged allies for help regarding air defence systems saying that attacks like this prove that the systems save lives.</p>

<p>Ukraine's largest private energy company, DTEK, said that its plants had been attacked more than 190 times since the start of the conflict as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy15lp21l3o" rel="noindex,nofollow">BBC</a>.</p>

<p>Speaking of Russian arms capabilities, Putin said "Let no one forget about the Kalibr systems, the Kinzhal and Tsirkon hypersonic missile systems that are in our arsenal, which have no analogues in the world in terms of their characteristics." He added that their production is being increased in full swing and that the Ukrainian leaders are "begging their masters for other military equipment".</p>

<p>Putin declared that Russia reserves the right to attack military targets in countries that permit their weapons to be used against Russia.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video showing an Indian-Canadian couple talking about misconceptions they had about each other's culture is going on social media. The couple, popularly known on Instagram under the username Indian Canadian Couple, shared a video in which they spoke about the misconceptions they had about each other's lifestyle, culture and countries. "Lies which were fed to us before marriage. Real love wins over stereotypes," they captioned the post, which has garnered more than 10.7 million views on the platform.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The video opens with the woman Danielle saying, "Before marrying my Indian husband, people told me that Indians have two wives". She reveals that people told her about the Indian people not using deodorant. She was also warned about getting raped in India.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The man named Ekansh, on the other hand, says that before marriage people warned him that Danielle would divorce him. He learned from people about "white folks treating their parents badly". He concludes by saying that people also told him that his Canadian wife would take all his money and leave him empty-handed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, earlier this month a Canadian citizen sparked controversy with a video claiming that many pregnant Indian women are flying to Canada specifically to give birth. Chad Eros alleged that these women are taking advantage of Canada's healthcare system, using it to obtain citizenship for their children, and potentially sponsoring their families to join them in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his post, he shared that a nurse informed his relative that maternity wards are filled with Indian women who had come to Canada to give birth. While Mr Eros acknowledged that Canadian hospitals should provide equal care to all patients, he feels that Indian immigrants are occupying many beds in maternity wards.</p>

<p>The video garnered mixed reactions, with some supporting his claims and others defending the women and criticising the narrative.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The High Court on Thursday refused to ban ISKCON's activities in Bangladesh, a local newspaper reported days after a lawyer was killed in a clash between security personnel and supporters of a Hindu leader arrested on sedition charges.</p>

<p>The lawyer had sought a ban from the high court on the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) after placing some newspaper reports related to the organisation on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The court had asked the attorney general to inform it about the steps taken by the government regarding ISKCON's recent activities, according to The Daily Star.</p>

<p>Hindu leader Chinmoy Krishna Das, who was arrested this week, was earlier expelled from ISKCON. His arrest triggered clashes on Tuesday during which Advocate Saiful Islam, an assistant public prosecutor, was killed.</p>

<p>When the High Court proceedings started on Thursday, the attorney general's office placed the information sought by the court before the bench of Justice Farah Mahbub and Justice Debasish Roy Chowdhury, The Daily Star said.</p>

<p>Additional Attorney General Aneek R Haque and Deputy Attorney General Asad Uddin informed the HC bench that three separate cases have been filed in connection with the murder of lawyer Saiful Islam Alif and ISKCON's activities, and 33 accused have been arrested in these cases.</p>

<p>The bench then hoped that the government would remain cautious about protecting the law and order situation and lives and properties of the people of Bangladesh, the newspaper added.</p>

<p>India on Tuesday noted with "deep concern" Chinmoy Das' arrest and denial of bail, and urged Dhaka to ensure the safety and security of Hindus and all other minority groups.</p>

<p>Separately, a group of Supreme Court lawyers sent a legal notice to Bangladesh government on Wednesday seeking a ban on ISKCON describing it as a "radical organisation." The notice, sent by Al Mamun Russell on behalf of 10 lawyers, also demanded prosecution of those responsible for Advocate Islam's murder, The Dhaka Tribune newspaper said quoting the notice.</p>

<p>"ISKCON has been operating in Bangladesh as a radical organisation, engaging in activities designed to provoke communal unrest," the notice alleged.</p>

<p>Citing a book by former Bangladeshi intelligence officials, the notice alleges that ISKCON has been promoting religious events "with the intent of inciting sectarian violence," "imposing its beliefs on traditional Hindu communities," and forcibly recruiting members from lower Hindu castes, the newspaper said.</p>

<p>Russel's notice was addressed to the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Law and Justice, and the Inspector General of Police and called for an immediate ban on ISKCON in Bangladesh under relevant section of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 2009.</p>

<p>Earlier, the ISKCON had urged the Bangladesh authorities to promote "peaceful coexistence" for Hindus in the country as it "strongly" denounced Chinmoy Das' arrest.</p>

<p>Chinmoy Das, the spokesperson for Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote, was arrested from Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Monday as he was about to fly to Chattogram to join a rally.</p>

<p>He was denied bail and sent to jail by the Chattogram's Sixth Metropolitan Magistrate court in a sedition case on Tuesday.</p>

<p>In a statement on Tuesday, ISKCON Bangladesh General Secretary Charu Chandra Das Brahmachari said, "We express our serious concern and strongly denounce the recent arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das ... We also condemn the subsequent violence and attacks against Sanatanis in various regions of Bangladesh."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A female stowaway on Tuesday bypassed multiple security checkpoints at New York's John F Kennedy International Airport and onto a Paris-bound Delta Airlines flight without a boarding pass or identification. According to the <em>New York Post</em>, the unidentified woman took advantage of the holiday madness to bypass two identity verification and boarding status stations to board the aircraft. She completed a full security screening before boarding, a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) spokesperson said, meaning that she did not have any prohibited items in tow and did not pose a security threat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"TSA can confirm that an individual without a boarding pass completed security screening (including on-person and bags) without any prohibited items," a TSA spokesperson told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/27/us-news/female-stowaway-found-on-delta-flight-to-paris-after-sneaking-past-jfk-security/" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>The Post</em></a>. "The individual bypassed two identity verification and boarding status stations and boarded the aircraft," they added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Citing a passenger, the outlet reported that the woman was eventually discovered in the bathroom by a flight attendant toward the end of the more than seven-hour flight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Passengers weren't initially alerted about the stowaway, but once the plane landed in Paris, the plane crew announced that the French police were going to board that aircraft to deal with a "serious security issue".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Folks, this is the captain, we are just waiting for the police to come on board. They may be here now and they directed us to keep everyone on the airplane until we sort out the extra passenger that's on the plane," the captain announced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's unclear how the person bypassed the boarding stations. It also remains unclear if the passenger was arrested. Delta Airlines did not provide any additional information as the investigation is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Nothing is of greater importance than matters of safety and security," a Delta spokesperson said in a statement. "That's why Delta is conducting an exhaustive investigation of what may have occurred and will work collaboratively with other aviation stakeholders and law enforcement to that end," they added.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina today spoke out about the arrest of a Hindu priest in her country. She also spoke about the death of a lawyer who was killed during clashes arising out a protest after the monk's arrest.</p>

<p>"A top leader of Sanatan religious community has been unjustly arrested, he must be released immediately. A temple has been burnt in Chittagong. Previously, mosques, shrines, churches, monasteries and homes of the Ahmadiyya community were attacked, vandalized and looted and set on fire," she said.</p>

<p>"Religious freedom and security of life and property of people of all communities should be ensured," she added.</p>

<p>Highlighting serious concerns over Bangladesh's interim government's ability to handle the economy and law and order, Ms Hasina said, "The current power grabbers are showing failure in all areas. Failed to control the prices of daily necessities, failed to provide security for people's lives. Strongly condemn these tortures directly and indirectly on common people."</p>

<p>Ms Hasina also slammed the interim government in Bangladesh for the rise in incidents of violence which led to the death of a lawyer in Chittagong. She also warned that if the interim government fails to punish terrorists, it will face the punishment of "gross human rights violations".</p>

<p>"A lawyer has been killed in Chittagong, strongly protesting this murder. Those involved in this murder should be found and punished quickly. Human rights have been grossly violated through this incident. A lawyer went to perform his professional duties, and those who beat him to death are terrorists. Whoever they are must be punished," Ms Hasina said.</p>

<p>"If the unconstitutionally usurped Yunus govt fails to punish these terrorists, it will also face punishment for human rights violations. I appeal to the people of the country to stand united against this kind of terrorism and militancy. It is important to ensure the safety of the lives and property of the common people," she added.</p>

<p>Holding the Yunus government responsible for the crisis in Bangladesh, the former prime minister said, "After the killing of innumerable Awami League leaders and workers, students and members of law and order forces, harassment is going on through assaults and arrests. I strongly condemn and protest these anarchist&nbsp;activities."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Mission here has issued a security alert urging its citizens not to visit Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in northwest Pakistan until December 16 due to "security concerns."</p>

<p>The security alert titled 'Threat to Serena Hotel, Peshawar' advising the US Mission personnel to avoid the said hotel in Peshawar, the capital of the province, was issued on Wednesday and advised caution with immediate effect.</p>

<p>"US citizens are encouraged to avoid the hotel and the area around the hotel during this period and reconsider travel plans," the statement read and reminded the US citizens to revisit the 'Do Not Travel' advisory issued in September for the same province "due to terrorism."</p>

<p>The September 10 advisory lists the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at 'Level 4' of the threat perception in the 'Do Not Travel' category.</p>

<p>"Active terrorist and insurgent groups routinely conduct attacks against civilians, non-governmental organisations, government offices, and security forces.</p>

<p>"These groups historically have targeted both government officials and civilians. Assassination and kidnapping attempts are common, including the targeting of polio eradication teams and government of Pakistan security service (police and military) personnel," it reads.</p>

<p>There has been an uptick in terror activities and attacks on security personnel in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province over the last few months.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Residents of Central Alberta in Canada recently witnessed a breathtaking atmospheric display as light pillars illuminated the night sky. These dazzling columns of light seem to emanate from ground-level sources, stretching upwards into the sky and creating an otherworldly, mirror-like illusion. Often misconstrued as paranormal phenomena, these light pillars are in fact a striking natural optical illusion formed by specific winter conditions.</p>

<p><strong>How are Light pillars formed?</strong></p>

<p>These vertical beams of light are created when light, usually from artificial sources such as streetlights, reflects off hexagonal ice crystals,&nbsp;typically measuring 0.02 mm, suspended in the atmosphere.&nbsp;These plate-shaped crystals behave like tiny mirrors, reflecting light from ground-based sources such as streetlights, building lights, or other artificial illuminations. As the light bounces off the ice crystals, it creates a dazzling, shimmering pillar that appears to stretch high into the sky, producing a breathtaking visual display.</p>

<p>While striking, these light pillars are a natural and scientifically understood phenomenon, unrelated to extraterrestrial activity or other mysterious causes. The winter phenomenon is predominantly witnessed in regions with frigid climates, particularly where temperatures plummet during the winter months. Countries such as Canada, Russia, and parts of Scandinavia offer ideal conditions for this spectacle, with light pillars frequently observed on bitterly cold nights when ice crystals are abundant in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The formation of light pillars demands a precise convergence of meteorological conditions, including extremely cold temperatures ranging from -10° to -40°C, high humidity levels, and calm conditions with virtually no wind.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As incidents of violence and vandalism against the minority Hindu community see a sharp upturn in Bangladesh, questions were asked in the Parliament of India out of concern for human rights violations.</p>

<p>Some of the questions included whether there has been an increase in the incidents of desecration and damages to Hindu temples and deities in Bangladesh, and if the Government of India has "taken up the issue" with the interim government in Bangladesh. Answers were sought over the response of the Bangladesh government and the efforts made by Dhaka to stop such incidents.</p>

<p>Acknowledging the attacks on Bangladesh's Hindu minority, the junior minister of external affairs told parliamentarians that "Several incidents of desecration and damages to Hindu temples and deities in Bangladesh have been reported in the past few months. The Government of India has expressed its concerns about such incidents, including the attack on a <em>Puja mandap</em> in Tantibazar, Dhaka and the theft at the Jeshoreshwari Kali temple at Satkhira during <em>Durga Puja</em> 2024. The Government has also called upon the Government of Bangladesh to ensure the safety and security of Hindus and all minorities and their places of worship."</p>

<p>In a response to questions by MPs, The Minister of State for External Affairs, Kirti Vardhan Singh told Members of Parliament that "The primary responsibility for the protection of life and liberty of all citizens of Bangladesh, including minorities, rests with the Government of Bangladesh."</p>

<h2><strong>THE THEFT AT JESHORESHWARI KALI TEMPLE</strong></h2>

<p>In early October, the crown of goddess Kali had been stolen from the Jeshoreshwari temple in Satkhira's Shyamnagar. This crown was gifted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to the temple in March, 2021.</p>

<p>The theft happened in broad daylight - between 2.00 pm and 2.30 pm - after temple priest Dilip Mukherjee left following the day's worship. The cleaning staff later found that the crown was missing from the deity's head.</p>

<p>The stolen crown, made of silver and gold-plated, holds significant cultural and religious importance. According to Hindu scriptures, the Jeshoreshwari Temple is one of the 51 Shakti Peeths scattered across India (and now neighboring countries). The name "Jeshoreshwari" means "Goddess of Jeshore."</p>

<h3><strong>RECENT INCIDENTS OF TEMPLE ATTACKS IN BANGLADESH</strong></h3>

<p>Hindu temples are being targeted by mobs in Bangladesh's Chattogram. The arrest of former ISKCON leader Chinmoy Krishna Das has triggered protests across Bangladesh, with the community calling for the monk's release and justice for Hindus who have faced persecution since the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>At least three temples - Lokonath Temple in Firangi Bazar, Mansa Mata Temple, and Kali Mata Temple in Hazari Lane - have reportedly been targeted in Chattogram.</p>

<p>International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) spokesperson, Radharamn Das, shared a purported video of a mob attack on a Hindu temple on his X account and wrote, "24x7 attack on Hindus &amp; Hindu places of worship in #Bangladesh. When will it all STOP?"</p>

<p>ISKCON Bangladesh also issued a statement denouncing the arrest of the Hindu monk and subsequent violence and attacks against Sanatanis in various parts of Bangladesh. "Chinmoy Krishna Das and the Sanatani Community deserve justice as citizens of this country, and we stress that any form of discrimination against them must not be tolerated," it read.</p>

<h3><strong>ARREST OF HINDU PRIEST IN BANGLADESH</strong></h3>

<p>Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, a Hindu priest and a religious minority leader in Bangladesh, was arrested in Dhaka earlier this week amid tensions over minority rights in the country that has seen widespread political violence since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster.</p>

<p>The arrest follows protests led by the Hindu community in the city of Rangpur, located nearly 300 km north of Dhaka, demanding stronger legal protections and a ministry dedicated to minority affairs.</p>

<p>Chandan Kumar Dhar Prokash alias Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari is a spokesperson of the Sanatan Jagaran Mancha. He was the former head of ISKCON-operated religious site named Pundarik Dham in Chittagong.</p>

<p>The monk was detained by the Detective Branch (DB) of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Monday and was arrested later on Sedation charges.</p>

<p>"A case has been filed against Chimnoy in charge of sedition, accusing him of hoisting a flag on the top of a stand of Bangladesh's national flag. But the man who filed the case, now he is not attached to the case. He is now disagreed to continue the case," a minority leader said.</p>

<p>Citing sources in ISKCON Chittagong, Dhaka Tribune reported that Chinmoy Krishna hails from the port city's Satkania Upazila. He reportedly earned the nickname 'Shishu Bokta' due to his popularity as a religious preacher from an early age. He served as the Chittagong Divisional Secretary of ISKCON from 2016 to 2022 and has also been the Principal of Pundarik Dham in Hathazari, since 2007.</p>

<p>Chinmoy Krishna Das's arrest came amid tensions over minority rights in the South Asian country that has seen widespread political violence since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster. Hindus comprise approximately 8 per cent of Bangladesh's 170 million people. Since the ouster of former PM Sheikh Hasina, the new military-backed interim government led by Mohammed Yunus has faced criticism for failing to curb a spike in violence against minorities.</p>

<h3><strong>BANGLADESH CALLS ISKCON "RELIGIOUS FUNDAMENTALIST" GROUP</strong></h3>

<p>Bangladesh has called ISKCON, or the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, a "religious fundamentalist" group in an affidavit filed in that country's High Court. The interim government also said it is "examining ISKCON".</p>

<p>The reference to ISKON as a "religious fundamentalist" organisation was part of the Bangladesh Attorney General's response to a question about the origin of the group in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>This happened closely on the heels of protests over the arrest Hindu priest Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari earlier this week. This happened after the Hindu community in the city of Rangpur, which is 300 km north of Dhaka, protested demanding stronger laws to protect them and a minority affairs ministry.</p>

<p>New Delhi has expressed strong reservations over Chinmoy Brahmachari's arrest and urged Dhaka to ensure the safety of minority communities, including Hindus. The Bangladesh Foreign Ministry, however, has bristled at what they said was India's interference in its "internal affairs".</p>

<p>Since Sheikh Hasina was forced to step down as prime minister, the new military-backed interim administration, led by Nobel laureate Mohammed Yunus, has faced criticism for failing to control violence against minorities. This includes instances of Hindu businesses and homes being vandalised.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Nissan's financial crisis is compounded by Renault's decision to reduce its stake in the company.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Co is urgently seeking a new anchor investor as the company navigates a state of grave financial crisis, dubbed "emergency mode."&nbsp;A Nissan official warned that the company has only 12 to 14 months to implement these changes and ensure its survival, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ft.com/content/970897c4-6d61-44f8-ae39-327c7c64e2c9">Finacial Times</a></em> reported. Nissan's financial crisis is compounded by Renault's decision to reduce its stake in the company. Renault, a longtime partner in the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, is realigning its strategy and has been gradually selling parts of its Nissan holdings to focus on its own EV development.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sources close to the negotiations have revealed that Nissan is seeking a stable, long-term investor, such as a bank or insurance company, to partially replace Renault's equity stake. This development comes as Nissan finalises the details of its new electric vehicle partnership with Honda, a major competitor in the industry.&nbsp; "We have 12 or 14 months to survive. This is going to be tough. And in the end, we need Japan and the US to be generating cash," a senior official told FT.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Responding to the report, Tesla's CEO Elon Musk said, "Many car companies won't make it."</p>

<p>Nissan also cut more than 9,000 jobs earlier this month, while simultaneously slashing production by nearly 20%.</p>

<p>A spokesperson from Nissan Motor India told NDTV, "As a policy, we do not comment on speculatory reports. Nissan remains committed to its India operations, dealers, partners, and customers. We remain on track for our plan announced earlier this year at the launches of the Nissan X-TRAIL and New Nissan Magnite."</p>

<p>Notably, the Renault-Nissan partnership, formalized in 1999, was established to combine resources and expertise, creating one of the largest automotive alliances globally. Renault initially acquired a significant stake in Nissan to rescue it from financial distress, enabling shared technology, platforms, and cost efficiencies. Over the years, the alliance expanded to include Mitsubishi. However, recent years have seen tensions, especially after Renault reduced its stake in Nissan.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chatter muffled as members of a secret society, masked and garbed in honey-coloured robes, entered the court of Foumban, the historic capital of a centuries-old kingdom nestled in hilly northwestern Cameroon.</p>

<p>The 20th king of the Bamoun people, Mouhammad Nabil Mfourifoum Mbombo Njoya, stood up from his ornate throne -- a replica of the original, now at a German museum -- for the ancient ritual to get under way.</p>

<p>The nearly 600-year-old tradition sees him put on public trial over his governance -- with local chiefs reading out indictments destined to put his popularity to the test.</p>

<p>The tradition is part of a set of rituals taking place over a week in a bid to promote dialogue, harmony and peace.</p>

<p>The ceremony is a first for Mbombo Njoya, 31, who took over the throne after his father died in 2021.</p>

<p>If deemed to have failed, the monarch could be fined or removed from office. But if he succeeds, he is granted a new mandate and allegiance.</p>

<p>Tourists and officials last week flocked to the remote, grassy region of the West African country to attend Nguon, a set of royal rituals that date back to 1384, when the kingdom was founded.</p>

<p>The rites, which are followed by celebrations, had not taken place in six years due to the Covid-19 pandemic and other factors, but were recognised in December 2023 by UNESCO as intangible cultural heritage.</p>

<p>The Bamoun territory, which is home to the ethnic group of the same name, is one of the oldest traditional kingdoms in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<h2><strong>GRIEVANCES</strong></h2>

<p>Constituents of the brotherhood shrouded in secrecy planted their spears into the ground as the young ruler braced for his people's opinions and grievances.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty, the people are very preoccupied with the dilapidation of the kingdom's property assets," a Bamoun lawmaker told his monarch before the attentive crowd.</p>

<p>"So far there is only one queen by the king's side in the court," said another parliamentary, as laughter and clapping broke out.</p>

<p>But the king survived the session and earned the approval of his people.</p>

<p>Warriors and members of the royal guard fired their rifles into the air in celebration.</p>

<h2><strong>ROLE REVERSAL</strong></h2>

<p>"I really enjoyed how there is this role reversal and he is judged by his people. I thought it was just going to be a pretend judgment but the judgment was really severe, I was surprised," said Roly Allen, a 46-year-old businessman who travelled from London to attend.</p>

<p>"There was a lot of good humour and I thought it really demonstrates a real love between the kingdom and the king," said the British tourist, proudly boasting a traditional Bamoun headdress.</p>

<p>For some locals, the ritual is an important occasion to connect with their culture.</p>

<p>"I am very proud to be Bamoun, these are moments that allow us to learn about our culture and pass it on to our children," said Amadou Njoya, a 21-year-old native of Foumban.</p>

<p>Cameroon's 270 ethnic groups, with various customs and languages, are organised into more than 80 kingdoms and sultanates.</p>

<p>The importance of customary law and the sense of belonging to these chiefdoms have withstood the test of time and remain key parts of the lives of many of Cameroon's 28 million people.</p>

<p>"The first Nguon of the 20th king was an event not to be missed," said Mariam Poughouo, a Bamoun company manager based in France.</p>

<p>Poughouo, who is passionate about tradition, described the king as "a great fighter who fights for the preservation of culture".</p>

<p>Yet the chiefdom is still missing its original throne, said Hamidou Ntieche, an elderly village chief in Bamoun territory.</p>

<h2><strong>'LOBBYING' FOR THRONE</strong></h2>

<p>Like many African cultural antiques, the treasured artefact was taken to Europe under unclear circumstances during the colonisation of Cameroon.</p>

<p>The colourful, pearl-inlaid wooden chair is now exhibited at the Humboldt Forum Museum in Berlin, after its transfer during the Germany colonial period in Cameroon.</p>

<p>The monarch visited it last year -- and sat on the heirloom that once belonged to his great-grandfather.</p>

<p>But the Bamoun people are attempting to recover the original, Azize Mbouho, the Bamoun palace's communications advisor, told AFP.</p>

<p>In April, the royal family inaugurated the spacious Museum of the Bamoun Kings, a building shaped like its imposing coat of arms -- a two-headed snake and a furry spider -- and designed to house thousands of objects spotlighting its rich heritage.</p>

<p>Alexis Njivah Mouliom, general secretary of the Nguon foundation, hopes that becoming UNESCO-listed can bring "publicity" to the Bamoun community and "strengthen lobbying for the return of the throne".<br />

       <description><![CDATA[UK hereditary lawmaker Richard Fletcher-Vane, better known as Lord Inglewood, will soon no longer commute the few hundred miles from his country house in northwest England to the House of Lords in London -- and he is not happy about it.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK hereditary lawmaker Richard Fletcher-Vane, better known as Lord Inglewood, will soon no longer commute the few hundred miles from his country house in northwest England to the House of Lords in London -- and he is not happy about it.</p>

<p>"Anybody who's sacked doesn't like it, particularly if you think you're being sacked for what per se is a bad reason," he told AFP at Hutton-in-the-Forest, his vast home dating back to 1350 near Penrith, Cumbria, 300 miles (480 kilometres) from Britain's capital.</p>

<p>The Labour government elected earlier this year is axing the 92 seats reserved for peers who inherited their position as a member of an aristocratic family, as the centre-left party moves to reform parliament's unelected upper chamber.</p>

<p>Britain is an anomaly among Western governments in having such lawmakers, who hold titles such as duke, earl, viscount and baron.</p>

<p>Lesotho in southern Africa is the only other country in the world with a hereditary element in its legislature, according to the UK government.</p>

<p>It is "out of step with modern Britain," government minister Nick Thomas-Symonds said in September as he introduced the legislation that will scrap the Lords' bloodline members.</p>

<p>The proposals were quickly approved by the House of Commons lower chamber and will be debated in the Lords on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Fletcher-Vane, who travels by train to the Lords most weeks, took his seat in 1989 after he became 2nd Baron Inglewood on the death of his father.</p>

<p>He served as a junior minister for the Conservatives in the mid-1990s and is a former member of the European Parliament.</p>

<p>The 73-year-old now sits as an independent cross-bencher.</p>

<p>At Hutton-in-the-Forest, where 500-year-old tapestries adorn the walls, Fletcher-Vane acknowledged that peerages by birthright are anachronistic in today's world.</p>

<p>But he also defended the contribution of many hereditary peers, some of whose titles have been in their family for centuries.</p>

<h2><strong>'I'VE HAD AN ORDINARY LIFE'</strong></h2>

<p>"I've always tried to take it seriously," Fletcher-Vane said, claiming to be "a voice" for the north of England.</p>

<p>The Lords, whose primary role is to scrutinise government legislation, comprises around 800 members, most of whom are appointed for life by outgoing prime ministers, sometimes as a less-than-subtle reward for political loyalty.</p>

<p>Members include former MPs, people nominated after serving in prominent public- or private-sector roles and senior Church of England clerics.</p>

<p>John Attlee, the 2nd Earl Attlee and grandson of former Labour prime minister Clement Attlee, is another hereditary peer preparing to hand back the red ermine-clad robes adorned by lords.</p>

<p>He entered the chamber in 1992 after a career in road transport operations and as a member of the British Army's volunteer reserve force.</p>

<p>"Because I've had an ordinary life, I have experience and knowledge that others, or very few others have in parliament," the 68-year-old told AFP over coffee in the Lords' guest room.</p>

<h2><strong>'LIFE BEYOND' THE LORDS</strong></h2>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's party, which in July returned to power for the first time in 14 years, is resurrecting reforms begun under Tony Blair's Labour government in the late 1990s.</p>

<p>Blair had intended to abolish all the seats held by hundreds of hereditary members who sat in the chamber at that time. But he ended up retaining 92 in what was supposed to be a temporary compromise.</p>

<p>"Reform of the House of Lords has been on the political agenda on and off to some extent for well over a century," Daniel Gover, a constitutional expert at Queen Mary University of London, told AFP.</p>

<p>That led hereditary peers to feel for decades that they were on borrowed time.</p>

<p>"I always expected that the system would have been changed before my turn came," Attlee said.</p>

<p>But reform has proven to be a thorny issue for successive administrations, in part because officials have struggled to propose better alternatives.</p>

<p>The government says it wants to ultimately replace the Lords with an alternative second chamber more representative of the UK.</p>

<p>But campaign groups such as the Electoral Reform Society want much wider reforms.</p>

<p>It notes that the Lords is "the second-largest legislative chamber in the world after China's National People's Congress", and calls for a "smaller, elected house" to work alongside the elected Commons.</p>

<p>Some peers are criticised for rarely turning up. Those who do are eligible to claim a daily allowance of up to 361 pounds ($460) plus travel expenses.</p>

<p>Fletcher-Vane said he thinks scrapping hereditary peers is a "crude" reform when he believes he contributes more than many life peers.</p>

<p>He said his last day, likely next year, will be a "sad" one, but not completely unfamiliar since he previously lost a European Parliament seat.</p>

<p>"I've been through it all before and there's life beyond it," he said.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[A Bangladesh court on Wednesday rejected the bail plea of Chinmoy Krishna Das, a Hindu priest and spokesperson of the Bangladesh Sammilit Sanatan Jagran Jote, who has been arrested and jailed by the local authorities on charges of sedition.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Bangladesh court on Wednesday rejected the bail plea of Chinmoy Krishna Das, a Hindu priest and spokesperson of the Bangladesh Sammilit Sanatan Jagran Jote also associated with the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), who has been arrested and jailed by the local authorities on charges of sedition.</p>

<p>Local media reported that Chittagong Metropolitan Sessions Judge Md. Saiful Islam, who is on vacation, passed the order on Wednesday citing that the plea was rejected because Das did not have a lawyer's letter of attorney on his behalf.</p>

<p>The petition, which will be heard on January 2 next year now, states that Das - a monk who is suffering from various diseases including diabetes and respiratory problems - has been arrested in a false and fabricated case.</p>

<p>It also mentions that his lawyer Subhashish Sharma could not attend the hearing on December 3 due to security reasons.</p>

<p>"Chittagong Metropolitan Sessions Judge Court Public Prosecutor PP Mofizul Haque Bhuiyan said that the state party informed the court that lawyer Rabindra Ghosh, who had applied for Chinmoy's anticipatory bail hearing, had not given any power of attorney to fight the case on his behalf. Apart from this, Chinmoy's lawyer Subhashish Sharma was also not present. Subhashish did not give anything in writing to Rabindra Ghosh to fight the case. Later, the court rejected the application made by lawyer Rabindra Ghosh," reported the country's leading Bengali daily Prothom Alo.</p>

<p>It was revealed that the bail hearing of two other accused in the case was also scheduled for Wednesday but could not take place due to the lawyer's absence.</p>

<p>India has been reiterating that it hopes that the trial will be "fair and transparent" as the arrested Hindus have legal rights that should be respected.</p>

<p>New Delhi has also urged the interim government's authorities in Dhaka to ensure the safety and security of Hindus and all minorities, including their right of freedom of peaceful assembly and expression while highlighting that the arrest of Das follows multiple attacks on Hindus and other minorities by extremist elements in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>"The interim government must live up to its responsibility of protecting all minorities. We are concerned at the surge of extremist rhetoric, increasing incidents of violence and provocation. These developments cannot be dismissed only as media exaggerations. We once again call upon Bangladesh to take all steps for the protection of minorities," Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said last month.</p>

<p>On Monday, during his visit to Dhaka, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had conveyed India's concerns, especially those related to the safety and welfare of minorities, during his meetings with the Chief Advisor of the Interim Government of Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus and the Foreign Affairs Advisor, Touhid Hossain.</p>

<p>"We also discussed some regrettable incidents of attacks on cultural, religious, and diplomatic properties. We expect, overall, a constructive approach on all these issues by the Bangladesh authorities, and we look forward to moving the relationship forward in a positive, forward-looking, and constructive direction," Misri told reporters in Dhaka on December 9 following his meeting with Hossain.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that the toppling of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was the result of a plan by the United States and Israel.</p>

<p>One of Syria's neighbours also had a role, he said. He did not name the country but appeared to be referring to Turkey, which has backed anti-Assad rebels.</p>

<p>Assad's overthrow is widely seen as a major blow to the Iran-led "Axis of Resistance" political and military alliance that opposes Israeli and U.S. influence in the Middle East.</p>

<p>"What happened in Syria was mainly planned in the command rooms of America and Israel. We have evidence of this. A neighbouring government of Syria was also involved," Khamenei said in a speech reported by Iranian state media.</p>

<p>The neighbour had a "clear role and continues to do so," he said.</p>

<p>NATO member Turkey, which controls swathes of land in northern Syria after several cross-border incursions against the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, has been a main backer of opposition groups aiming to topple Assad since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011.</p>

<p>Iran spent billions of dollars propping up Assad during the war and deployed its Revolutionary Guards to Syria to keep its ally in power.</p>

<p>Hours after Assad's fall, Iran said it expected relations with Damascus to continue based on the two countries' "far-sighted and wise approach" and called for the establishment of an inclusive government representing all segments of Syrian society.</p>

<p>In his speech, Khamenei also said the Iran-led alliance would gain in strength across the entire region.</p>

<p>"The more pressure you exert, the stronger the resistance becomes. The more crimes you commit, the more determined it becomes. The more you fight against it, the more it expands Khamenei said.</p>

<p>"Iran is strong and powerful-and will become even stronger," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is more than a 50% chance of La Nina developing in the next three months, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said on Wednesday, but if it does it will be relatively weak and short-lived.</p>

<p>The La Nina pattern involves the cooling of ocean surface temperatures and could break a spell of high temperatures that are set to make 2024 the world's warmest since records began.</p>

<p>Forecasts show that there is a 55% likelihood of a transition to La Nina between December 2024 and February 2025, the WMO said in a statement sent to journalists. This was down from a forecast 60% possibility from the WMO in September.</p>

<p>"Even if a La Nina event does emerge, its short-term cooling impact will be insufficient to counterbalance the warming effect of record heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere," WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said.<br />

<p>In a statement posted on Instagram, the operators of the sanctuary insist that the incident was "beyond human control". They announced that the sanctuary would be closed on December 11 and 12 in light of the tragedy and a further update regarding re-opening will be published in due course.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"With deep regret, we inform you that a tree branch has fallen due to strong winds in the Monkey Forest Ubud area. We would like to emphasise that the fallen branch was in healthy condition. We regularly conduct tree monitoring and pruning as part of our commitment to the safety of visitors, staff, and wildlife in Monkey Forest Ubud," the sanctuary said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"However, this incident was caused by strong winds and extreme weather conditions beyond human control. Our team has taken swift action to evacuate the affected area and ensure the safety and comfort of other visitors. We are working closely with authorities to address the situation thoroughly," it added.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's arrest of almost 30 mostly Jewish citizens who allegedly spied for Iran in nine covert cells has caused alarm in the country and points to Tehran's biggest effort in decades to infiltrate its arch foe, four Israeli security sources said.</p>

<p>Among the unfulfilled goals of the alleged cells was the assassination of an Israeli nuclear scientist and former military officials, while one group gathered information on military bases and air defences, security service Shin Bet has said. Last week, the agency and Israel's police said a father and son team had passed on details of Israeli force movements including in the Golan Heights where they lived. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The arrests follow repeated efforts by Iranian intelligence operatives over the past two years to recruit ordinary Israelis to gather intelligence and carry out attacks in exchange for money, the four serving and former military and security officials said.</p>

<p>The sources asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.</p>

<p>"There is a large phenomenon here," said Shalom Ben Hanan, a former top Shin Bet official, referring to what he called the surprising number of Jewish citizens who knowingly agreed to work for Iran against the state with intelligence gathering or planning sabotage and attacks.</p>

<p>Shin Bet and the police did not respond to requests for comment. Iran's foreign ministry did not respond to questions.</p>

<p>In a statement sent to media after the wave of arrests, Iran's U.N. mission did not confirm or deny seeking to recruit Israelis and said that "from a logical standpoint" any such efforts by Iranian intelligence services would focus on non-Iranian and non-Muslim individuals to lessen suspicion.</p>

<p>At least two suspects were from Israel's ultra-Orthodox community, police and the Shin Bet have said. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Unlike Iranian espionage operations in previous decades that recruited a high-profile businessman and a former cabinet minister, the new alleged spies were largely people on the fringes of Israeli society, including recent immigrants, an army deserter and a convicted sex offender, conversations with the sources, court records and official statements show.</p>

<p>Much of their activity was limited to spraying anti-Netanyahu or anti-government graffiti on walls and damaging cars, Shin Bet has said.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the scale of the arrests and involvement of so many Jewish Israelis, in addition to Arab citizens, has caused concern in Israel at a time it remains at war with Iran-backed Hamas in Gaza and that a ceasefire deal with Hezbollah remains fragile.</p>

<p>Shin Bet on Oct. 21 said the espionage activities were "among the most severe the state of Israel has known."</p>

<p>The arrests also follow a wave of attempted hits and kidnappings linked to Tehran in Europe and the United States.</p>

<p>The unusual decision to provide detailed public accounts of the alleged plots was a move by Israel's security services to signal both to Iran and potential saboteurs inside Israel that they would be caught, Ben Hanan said. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"You want to alert the public. And you also want to make an example of people that may also have intentions or plans to co-operate with the enemy," he said.</p>

<p>Israel has achieved major intelligence successes over the past few years in a shadow war with its regional foe, including allegedly killing a top nuclear scientist. With the recent arrests Israel has "so far" thwarted Tehran's efforts to respond, one active military official said.</p>

<p>Iran has been weakened by Israel's attacks on its proxy Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the related fall of Tehran's ally, former president Bashar al-Assad in Syria.</p>

<h2><strong>SOCIAL MEDIA RECRUITS</strong></h2>

<p>Iranian intelligence agencies often find potential recruits on social media platforms, Israeli police said in a video released in November warning of ongoing infiltration attempts.</p>

<p>The recruiting efforts are at times direct. One message sent to an Israeli civilian and seen by Reuters promised $15,000 in exchange for information, with an email and number to call.</p>

<p>Iran has also approached expatriate networks of Jews from Caucasus countries living in Canada and the United States, said one of the sources, a former senior official who worked on Israel's counter espionage efforts until 2007.</p>

<p>Israeli authorities have said publicly some of the Jewish suspects were originally from Caucasus countries.</p>

<p>Recruited individuals are first assigned innocuous-seeming tasks in return for money, before handlers gradually demand specific intelligence on targets, including about individuals and sensitive military infrastructure, backed by the threat of blackmail, said the former official.</p>

<p>One Israeli suspect, Vladislav Victorsson, 30, was arrested on Oct. 14 along with his 18-year-old girlfriend in the Israeli city of Ramat Gan near Tel Aviv. He had been jailed in 2015 for sex with minors as young as 14, according to a court indictment from that time.</p>

<p>An acquaintance of Victorsson told Reuters he had told her he had spoken to Iranians using the Telegram messaging app. She said that Victorsson had lied to his handlers about his military experience. The acquaintance declined to be named, citing safety fears.</p>

<p>Igal Dotan, Victorsson's lawyer, told Reuters he was representing the suspect, adding that the legal process would take time and that his client was being held in tough conditions. Dotan said he could only respond to the current case and had not defended Victorsson in earlier trials.</p>

<p>Shin Bet and police said Victorsson knew he was working for Iranian intelligence, carrying out tasks including spraying graffiti, hiding money, posting flyers and burning cars in the Hayarkon Park in Tel Aviv for which he received over $5,000.</p>

<p>According to the investigation made public by the security services, he was found to have subsequently agreed to carry out an assassination of an Israeli personality, throw a grenade into a house and also look to obtain a sniper rifle, pistols and fragmentation grenades.</p>

<p>He recruited his girlfriend, who was tasked with recruiting homeless people to photograph demonstrations, the security services said.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Analyzing data from over 1,500 participants aged 13 to 77, researchers found that individuals with a positive outlook are more driven and determined to achieve their goals.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two professors from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) conducted a study that looked at the characteristics that enable people to succeed in their ambitions. According to their research, people who have more willpower frequently have one crucial characteristic in common: a "growth mindset."</p>

<p>The large-scale study found that this mindset-which is defined as the belief in personal progress and improvement-is associated with higher levels of enthusiasm, determination, and success.</p>

<p>The research included over 1,500 participants aged 13 to 77, with an average age of 26. They completed questionnaires measuring traits such as grit, passion, and mindset. The data revealed that individuals with a positive outlook not only had more willpower but were also more driven to achieve their goals.A new article about the test has been published in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732118X24000394"><em>New Ideas in Psychology.</em></a></p>

<p>The findings highlight the importance of fostering a belief in growth to unlock one's potential. Adopting a growth mindset could be the key to developing resilience and passion in various areas of life.</p>

<p>"An individual's belief in growth is important. Individuals can change and increase their development through training. People with growth mindsets see challenges as opportunities for learning," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1062439">said Professor Hermundur Sigmundsson</a> at the Department of Psychology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We find large differences in passion and determination when we compare the five percent who have the most positive attitude with the five percent who are the most negative," Sigmundsson said.</p>

<p>"Our results can help us better understand the connections between different factors. These are in turn related to how satisfied people are with their lives, how they feel, what they have already achieved, and learning," Sigmundsson said.</p>

<p>When we know more about what characterises people with different attitudes, we can also better understand how we can motivate different groups. We can thus get people to set long-term goals and make an effort to achieve these goals. This is what Sigmundsson calls "getting the I CAN feeling.".</p>

<p>"The belief in growth is important for large parts of our society. This is true for school, sports, work, and family life," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Health experts have been sounding the alarm about the potential pandemic threat posed by bird flu, which has been showing signs of mutating as it spreads among cows and infects people in the United States.</p>

<p>There is no guarantee that bird flu will ever begin transmitting between humans, and US health authorities have emphasised that the risk to the general public remains low.</p>

<p>The deadly bird flu variant H5N1 first emerged in China in 1996, but over the last four years it has spread more widely than ever before, reaching previously untouched regions such as penguin-haven Antarctica.</p>

<p>More than 300 million poultry birds have been killed or culled since October 2021, while 315 different species of wild birds have died across 79 countries, the World Organisation for Animal Health told AFP.</p>

<p>Mammals that ate the infected birds, such as seals, have also experienced mass-die offs.</p>

<p>The situation changed again in March, when the virus began spreading among dairy cows across the United States in another first.</p>

<p>Fifty-eight people have tested positive for bird flu in the US this year, including two who had no known exposure to infected animals, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>

<p>There are also fears that some human cases are going undetected. Researchers said last month that eight out of 115 dairy workers tested in Michigan and Colorado had antibodies for bird flu, suggesting an infection rate of seven percent.</p>

<p>Meg Schaeffer, an epidemiologist at the US-based SAS Institute, told AFP there were now several factors suggesting that "avian flu is knocking on our door and could start a new pandemic any day".</p>

<p>"A bird flu pandemic would be one of the most foreseeable catastrophes in history," read the headline of a New York Times opinion article late last month.</p>

<p><strong>'Simple Step' Away</strong></p>

<p>There are still several barriers stopping H5N1 from spreading easily between people, including that the virus would have to mutate to become better at infecting human lungs.</p>

<p>But research published in the journal Science on Thursday demonstrated that the version of bird flu infecting US cows is now just a single mutation away from being able to spread more effectively among humans.</p>

<p>Virologist Ed Hutchinson of the University of Glasgow said this suggests that H5N1 is just "a simple step" away from becoming "more dangerous for us".</p>

<p>And last month, genetic sequencing of a Canadian teenager who was very sick with bird flu "implied that the virus had begun to evolve to explore ways of binding more effectively to the cells in their body," Hutchinson said.</p>

<p>"We do not yet know whether H5N1 influenza viruses will evolve to become a disease of humans," and other barriers remain, Hutchinson emphasised.</p>

<p>But the more animals and different species the virus is allowed to infect, the "more likely it is to adapt to better infect people," Schaeffer said.</p>

<p>And if a bird flu pandemic was to break out, it would be "remarkably severe" in humans because we have no built-up immunity, she added.</p>

<p>The US farm worker cases have been relatively mild so far. But nearly half of the 904 human cases of H5N1 recorded since 2003 have been fatal, according to the World Health Organization.</p>

<p><strong>Raw Milk: 'Terrible Idea'</strong></p>

<p>Tom Peacock, a virologist at the Imperial College London, told AFP there are several reasons to be "less pessimistic about the possibility of a pandemic".</p>

<p>Antiviral treatments and vaccines are already available for bird flu, marking a big difference from Covid-19 in 2020, he pointed out.</p>

<p>To avoid the worst-case scenario, many health researchers have called on the US government to ramp up testing and ensure information is shared between agencies and countries.</p>

<p>On Friday, the US Department of Agriculture announced plans to test the country's milk supply for bird flu.</p>

<p>Of particular concern is raw, or unpasteurised, milk, which has repeatedly been found to be contaminated with bird flu.</p>

<p>Vaccine sceptic and conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is US President-elect Donald Trump's pick for health secretary, is known to be a fan of raw milk.</p>

<p>California raw milk producer Mark McAfee, whose products have repeatedly been recalled due to bird flu, told The Guardian last week that Kennedy's team had approached him to guide the upcoming administration's raw milk policy.</p>

<p>Schaeffer said that any suggestion of lifting restrictions on raw milk was "unequivocally a terrible idea and definitely jeopardises the health of humans".</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday tapped Andrew Ferguson, a board member at the Federal Trade Commission and Big Tech critic, to run this major US antitrust and competition agency.</p>

<p>Ferguson will replace Lina Khan, whose antitrust lawsuits galvanized progressive Democrats and even some Republicans, but also received pushback from the business community, notably the tech industry.</p>

<p>Signaling his incoming administration's priorities, Trump said in a post on his Truth Social website that Ferguson "has a proven record of standing up to Big Tech censorship."</p>

<p>While Republicans are generally considered more business friendly than Democrats, conservatives also allege that their voices have been censored online in anti-disinformation campaigns, auguring a potential clash between Big Tech and the Trump administration.</p>

<p>Ferguson has also said that companies that pulled out of advertising on X (formerly Twitter) -- which many did after new owner Elon Musk loosened rules on hate speech -- might be doing so in violation of antitrust law.</p>

<p>Musk himself has become close with Trump, donating millions to support his election campaign. The billionaire is set to spearhead a government cost-cutting initiative under the new administration.</p>

<p>Trump has also tapped Gail Slater to lead the Justice Department's antitrust division, meaning she would take over ongoing government legal battles against Google and Apple, accused of acting like monopolies.</p>

<p>"Andrew has a proven record of standing up to Big Tech censorship, and protecting Freedom of Speech in our Great Country," Trump said in his Truth Social post.</p>

<p>The incoming Republican president has been using the platform to make a slew of incoming announcements on major staffing decisions, often written late at night with words capitalized throughout.</p>

<p>Trump will take office on January 20.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[South Korean police said that security guards were blocking a raid on President Yoon Suk Yeol's offices to investigate his imposition of martial law.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean police said Wednesday that security guards were blocking a raid on President Yoon Suk Yeol's offices to investigate his brief imposition of martial law.</p>

<p>Yoon is already banned from foreign travel as part of an "insurrection" probe into his inner circle over the dramatic events of December 3-4 that stunned South Korea's allies.</p>

<p>Police said earlier that a Special Investigation Team "has conducted a raid" on the presidential office, on different police agencies and on the National Assembly Security Service.</p>

<p>But later a spokesperson said that investigators had "gained access to its civil services office. However, we are currently unable to enter the main building due to access restrictions imposed by the presidential security guards."</p>

<p>The president's office was not immediately available for comment on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Prison authorities, meanwhile, said that former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun tried to kill himself shortly before his formal arrest late Tuesday.</p>

<p>Kim, who is accused of suggesting to Yoon to impose martial law, was first detained on Sunday, and later formally arrested on charges of "engaging in critical duties during an insurrection" and "abuse of authority to obstruct the exercise of rights".</p>

<p>He had said through his lawyers that his subordinates were "following my orders".</p>

<p>The justice ministry and a prison official said he was in good health on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The former interior minister and the general in charge of the martial law operation are also barred from foreign travel. Two senior police officials were arrested early Wednesday.</p>

<p><strong>'Fascist Dictatorship'</strong></p>

<p>North Korean state media on Wednesday made its first comments.</p>

<p>"The shocking incident of the puppet Yoon Suk Yeol, who is facing impeachment and a governance crisis, suddenly declaring a martial law decree and unhesitatingly wielding the guns and knives of its fascist dictatorship wrought chaos across South Korea," a commentary said.</p>

<p>Yoon had said his declaration of martial law was intended, in part, to safeguard South Korea "from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and eliminate anti-state elements".</p>

<p>Relations between the two Koreas have been at one of their lowest points in years, with the North launching a flurry of ballistic missiles in violation of UN sanctions.</p>

<p>Former defence minister Kim had been accused by opposition lawmakers of calling for strikes on sites from which North Korea was launching trash-carrying balloons, an order reportedly refused by his subordinates.</p>

<p>He also allegedly ordered drones sent to Pyongyang in an apparent attempt to provoke a conflict as a pretext for declaring martial law.</p>

<p>US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in Tokyo on Tuesday that Washington's deterrence commitment to South Korea -- where it has around 28,500 troops -- and to Japan remained "ironclad".</p>

<p><strong>Task Force</strong></p>

<p>Yoon survived an impeachment motion in parliament on Saturday even as tens of thousands of South Koreans braved freezing temperatures to demand his ouster.</p>

<p>Further smaller protests have continued every evening since, with polls showing record-low public support for Yoon.</p>

<p>A special task force within Yoon's People Power Party (PPP) on Tuesday proposed a plan for the president to resign in February or March, followed by fresh elections in April or May.</p>

<p>But the proposal has not yet been adopted by the party as a whole.</p>

<p>Even if approved, the roadmap is unlikely to head off another opposition attempt to impeach Yoon on Saturday.</p>

<p>Jo Seung-lae, a lawmaker from the main opposition Democratic Party (DP), told AFP that the new vote would take place around 5:00 pm (0800 GMT).</p>

<p>The motion only needs eight members of Yoon's People Power Party (PPP) to secure the necessary two-thirds majority.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last week, two PPP lawmakers -- Ahn Cheol-soo and Kim Yea-ji -- voted in favour, and since Tuesday three have said they would support the motion this time.</p>

<p>The PPP has said that pending Yoon's resignation, he has agreed to hand power to Prime Minister Han Duck-soo and party chief Han Dong-hoon.</p>

<p>The opposition have said this contravenes the constitution, calling it a "second coup".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prime Minister Han on Wednesday said he had opposed the martial law declaration, apologising for being "ultimately unable to prevent it."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US president-elect Donald Trump defended his choice of Charles Kushner for US ambassador to France, describing him as a "family member" and a "very successful man" in an interview released Wednesday.</p>

<p>"It's a great thing because he's in our family," Trump told the French magazine Paris Match in the interview conducted Saturday.</p>

<p>"Essentially a family member of mine is coming to France, I am not sure it's happening anywhere else. We have a lot of ambassadorships."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump nominated Kushner, the father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner, as the US envoy to France in November.</p>

<p>The choice is in keeping with Trump's pattern of selecting people, often wealthy, who are close to his family or have proven their loyalty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The elder Kushner, 70, is a multimillionaire real estate executive and former attorney.</p>

<p>He was handed a two-year sentence -- most of it served in a federal prison -- after pleading guilty in 2004 to 18 counts of tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal campaign contributions.</p>

<p>But in 2020 he was granted a presidential pardon by Trump during his first term in office.</p>

<p>Trump described Kushner as a "very successful man".</p>

<p>"And he's a very good friend of mine, too. And it's something he really wanted to do. He feels so strongly about it. This was his first choice, by far."</p>

<p>Trump visited Paris for Saturday's re-opening of Notre Dame cathedral on his first international trip since his re-election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump described France as "a friend and an ally" and said he had "always" had a good relationship with President Emmanuel Macron.</p>

<p>"It's a beautiful country, it's an elegant country," he added.</p>

<p>Trump said trade and military issues would be a priority in the two countries' relations.</p>

<p>"We are going to do a lot of business with France," he said. "You already do a wonderful business with your wines and champagnes."</p>

<p>He said he wanted to stay in France "much longer" but added that he had to prepare for Inauguration Day on January 20.</p>

<p>"January 20 will be a good day for France."</p>

<p>He praised French people and Macron for rebuilding Notre Dame, describing the 2019 blaze that nearly burned it down as a "terrible thing to watch".</p>

<p>"I've never seen anything quite like it, other than the World Trade Center, of course," he added.</p>

<p>"It was a very tough reconstruction," he said. "I know so much about construction."</p>

<p>He drew parallels between the resilience of Notre Dame and his own political fate.</p>

<p>"It's resilience, getting it done, getting it built," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh I know all about it," he chuckled. "I became president again. I guess it's pretty resilient also."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Malaria mortality has fallen back to levels seen before the Covid-19 crisis, the WHO said, but called for faster progress against the disease.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Malaria mortality has fallen back to levels seen before the Covid-19 crisis, the WHO said Wednesday, but called for faster progress against the disease that killed nearly some 597,000 people last year.</p>

<p>In a new report, the World Health Organization estimated that there were 263 million cases of malaria worldwide in 2023 -- 11 million more than a year earlier -- while the number of deaths remained relatively stable.</p>

<p>But in terms of the mortality rate, "we have come back to pre-pandemic numbers", Arnaud Le Menach, of the WHO's Global Malaria Programme, told reporters.</p>

<p>In 2020, disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic led to a sharp increase in malaria-related mortality, with an additional 55,000 deaths counted that year.</p>

<p>Since then the total number of deaths from malaria, which is caused by a mosquito-borne parasite, has gradually shrunk, as has the mortality rate.</p>

<p>The estimated 2023 mortality rate in Africa of 52.4 deaths per 100,000 population at risk meanwhile still remains more than double the target level set by a global strategy for combatting malaria through 2030, WHO said, insisting "progress must be accelerated".</p>

<p><strong>Vaccine Promise</strong></p>

<p>WHO pointed to the wider rollout of malaria vaccines as a promising development, expected to save tens of thousands of young lives each year.</p>

<p>The two jabs currently in use, RTS,S and R21/Matrix-M, hold the promise of significantly easing the burden in Africa, which accounts for up to 95 percent of all malaria deaths.</p>

<p>Malaria vaccines were first introduced in April 2019, first in Malawi, with Kenya and Ghana following suit.</p>

<p>Through the end of 2023, nearly two million children in those three countries received jabs of the RTS,S vaccine, WHO said.</p>

<p>"We saw in those three pilot countries... a 13-percent drop in mortality during the four years of the pilot programme," said Mary Hamel, who heads WHO's malaria vaccine team.</p>

<p>The WHO now looked forward to seeing a similar drop in other countries introducing the vaccines, she told reporters, pointing out that countries that began introducing the jabs early this year were "following a similar trajectory".</p>

<p>So far, 17 nations across sub-Saharan Africa have included the jabs in their routine immunisation programmes, she said</p>

<p>Another eight countries had been approved to receive funding towards introducing the vaccines through the vaccine alliance GAVI, WHO said.</p>

<p><strong>'Curb The Threat'</strong></p>

<p>In another promising development, new-generation dual-insecticide nets nets are becoming more widely available.</p>

<p>These nets, which are coated in a new generation pyrrole insecticide in combination with the standard pyrethroid insecticide, have been shown to offer far better protection against malaria.</p>

<p>The WHO estimated earlier this year that such nets had averted 13 million malaria cases and nearly 25,000 deaths over three years.</p>

<p>Despite the successes, the WHO highlighted a number of factors slowing the battle against malaria, including a lack of funds and insufficient stocks of vaccines, as well as climate change, which is allowing a greater spread of the mosquitos that carry the parasite that causes malaria.</p>

<p>"Stepped-up investments and action in high-burden African countries are needed to curb the threat," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement.</p>

<p>The Global Fund, a partnership set up to battle AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, agreed.</p>

<p>"Progress has stagnated for several years," its executive director Peter Sands warned in a statement.</p>

<p>"To overcome this, we must accelerate our efforts through a dual approach: investing in new technologies while simultaneously easing the strain that climate change places on healthcare systems," he said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A video being shared on social media shows Hindu devotional songs being performed at a concert in Saudi Arabia. Here's the truth behind it]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video being shared on social media (<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DDHQtyMJb9X" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.instagram.com/mq_motivational_quotes/reel/DDFSsCzTObr/" target="_blank">here</a>) shows Hindu devotional songs being performed at a concert in Saudi Arabia. Let's verify the truth behind the video in this article.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: A video shows Hindu devotional songs being performed at a concert in Saudi Arabia.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Fact:</strong>&nbsp;The audio in the viral video is edited to include a Hindu devotional song. Further, the video is not from Saudi Arabia, it is from Kuwait. It was filmed in May 2024 during Abdul Majeed Abdullah's concert, where he was singing an Arabic song. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.</p>

<p>A reverse image search of keyframes from the viral video led us to an <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C78crSyo3gf/" target="_blank">Instagram post</a> (<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://mvau.lt/media/e52370a0-07e8-42f5-ac6b-7fa511d25cfd" target="_blank">archived</a>) dated 08 June 2024, featuring the same video. The song performed in the video was not a Hindu devotional song but an Arabic song. The caption revealed that it was a concert by 62-year-old Abdul Majeed Abdullah. Further review of the comments section indicated that the concert took place in Kuwait.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Outgoing US President Joe Biden on Tuesday branded his successor Donald Trump's economic plans a "disaster," in a speech hailing his own legacy.</p>

<p>Biden said Trump's threats to slap huge tariffs on imports were a "major mistake" and challenged Trump to build on what he said were the successes of his own administration.</p>

<p>The lame-duck president's speech comes after Trump won a second term largely on the back of US voters' anger at high costs of living under Democrats.</p>

<p>"I pray to God the president-elect throws away Project 2025. I think it'd be an economic disaster for us and the region," Biden said at the Brookings Institution in Washington, referring to a conservative blueprint for a second Trump administration.</p>

<p>Coughing frequently because of a cold, Biden said US consumers would pay the price for the tariffs that Trump has vowed to slap on US neighbors Mexico and Canada and on Asia-Pacific rival China.</p>

<p>Together they are the three biggest US trading partners.</p>

<p>"I believe this approach is a major mistake," Biden added.</p>

<p>At a separate event Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Trump's tariffs could "derail the progress that we've made on inflation, and have adverse consequences on growth."</p>

<p>She warned at the Wall Street Journal's CEO Council Summit that sweeping tariffs could raise prices significantly for US consumers and pile pressure on companies which rely on imports.</p>

<p><strong>Shadow President</strong></p>

<p>The White House touted Biden's speech as a "major address on his economic legacy" as the 82-year-old looks to the history books with fewer than six weeks left in office.</p>

<p>Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race against Trump in July due to concerns about his age and passed the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Trump comfortably defeated at the November polls.</p>

<p>Trump's inauguration is not until January 20, but he has already become something of a shadow president, making pronouncements on the economy and foreign policy and being feted by world leaders.</p>

<p>Biden has kept a relatively low profile, but he came out swinging in defense of his own record before an audience of economists.</p>

<p>He contrasted his "middle-out, bottom-up economic playbook" with what he called Trump's failed promise of "trickle-down economics" in which tax cuts for the wealthy are supposed to boost incomes.</p>

<p>Biden also touted achievements including the US economy's recovery from the Covid pandemic and his huge investments in green technology and industry.</p>

<p>"President-elect Trump is receiving the strongest economy in modern history," said Biden.</p>

<p>But the departing president said he regretted not signing his name to Covid stimulus checks sent out to Americans, like Trump had done.</p>

<p>Biden ended his speech with a broader plea for US leadership in a troubled world, even as Trump has repeatedly signaled his intention to take a more isolationist stance.</p>

<p>"If we do not lead the world, what nation leads the world?" he said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Syrian blogger Tal al-Mallouhi has been released 15 years after she was swept away into deposed president Bashar al-Assad's notorious prison system at the age of 19, her mother said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syrian blogger Tal al-Mallouhi has been released 15 years after she was swept away into deposed president Bashar al-Assad's notorious prison system at the age of 19, her mother told AFP on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mallouhi, now 33, was a blogger who wrote poetry and social commentary before she was detained in December 2009, just over a year before pro-democracy protests broke out across Syria.</p>

<p>In 2011, she was sentenced to five years in prison on charges of working with the CIA -- accusations her family insists are false. Her sentencing drew international condemnation at the time.</p>

<p>Authorities never released her after her sentence elapsed.</p>

<p>She was freed last week along with thousands of others during the 11-day lightning offensive led by Islamist rebels, who seized key cities before reaching Damascus and forcing Assad to flee.</p>

<p>"I was overwhelmed with an indescribable feeling, a great joy" after holding her daughter for the first time after she was freed, her mother Ahd al-Mallouhi told AFP.</p>

<p>But after more than a decade in Assad's notorious prison system, her daughter, like many others newly released, needs time just "to realise she got out, she's ok now and that the fear and terror is gone", she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the core of the system of rule that Assad inherited from his father Hafez was a brutal complex of prisons and detention centres used to eliminate dissent by jailing those suspected of stepping out of the ruling Baath party's line.</p>

<p>"I used to see her for half an hour during visits, and our every word was watched," she told AFP.</p>

<p>She said the family needed time to heal, "to talk with each other again and open up".</p>

<p>Yet despite the challenges, she said she had faith the country was now headed towards better days.</p>

<p>The rebel takeover that freed Mallouhi and others came nearly 14 years after Syrian government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters, triggering a complex war that has left more than 500,000 dead and forced millions to flee.</p>

<p>Up to 100,000 of those killed died in government-run prisons, according to Britain-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</p>

<p>"Syria was freed first, then my daughter was released along with all the others," she said.</p>

<p>"Maybe if my daughter had been released alone, I would still fear for her, still be scared they could take her at any moment."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A French prosecutor demanded two years of house arrest for a filmmaker accused of sexually assaulting an actor when she was a child.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A French prosecutor Tuesday demanded two years of house arrest for a filmmaker accused of sexually assaulting an actor when she was a child, after an outburst from the plaintiff over his denying the allegations.</p>

<p>Adele Haenel, 35, has accused filmmaker Christophe Ruggia, 59, of assaulting her in the early 2000s when she was between 12 and 14 and he was in his late 30s, accusations he has called "pure lies".</p>

<p>The landmark #MeToo trial since Monday comes as France's film industry is rocked by allegations of sexual abuse.</p>

<p>On the second and last day of the trial, Haenel told Ruggia to "shut up" and briefly stormed out of courtroom over him seeking to portray himself as a protector.</p>

<p>Haenel, who starred in 2019 drama "Portrait of a Lady on Fire" before quitting cinema, was the first prominent actor to accuse the French film industry of turning a blind eye to the ill treatment.</p>

<p>The prosecutor on Tuesday requested two years detention with an electronic bracelet plus a three-year suspended sentence against the director.</p>

<p>The verdict is set for February 3.</p>

<p>Ruggia directed Haenel in the 2002 movie "The Devils", a tale of an incestuous relationship between a boy and his autistic sister. It was her first film role.</p>

<p>The film contains sex scenes between the children and close-ups of Haenel's naked body.</p>

<p>Investigators said before the trial that members of the film crew had told them of their "unease" with Ruggia's behaviour on set.</p>

<p>Between 2001 and 2004, after shooting the film, the teenager went to see Ruggia nearly every Saturday.</p>

<p>During these visits, she has accused him of caressing her thighs and touching her genitals and breasts.</p>

<p>"He chose to sexually assault her. He had his whole conscience as a man -- as an adult -- to behave otherwise," prosecutor Camille Poch said.</p>

<p>She asked that Ruggia also be listed as a sex offender, forbidden from contacting Haenel and made to pay her damages.</p>

<p><strong>'It's Grooming'</strong></p>

<p>"It was normality that shifted by degrees" into abuse, Haenel said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"Who was there to say, 'It's not your fault. It's grooming. It's violence'?" she said.</p>

<p>"You can't abuse children like that. There are consequences. No one helped that child," she said, speaking of her younger self.</p>

<p>But Ruggia has rejected the claims.</p>

<p>He told the court he had in fact sought to protect Haenel from mockery in school over the sex scenes in "The Devils".</p>

<p>This caused her to be outraged.</p>

<p>"Would you just shut up?" she shouted, banging her hands on the table in front of her.</p>

<p>Haenel marched out and only returned half an hour later with her lawyer, refusing to look at Ruggia.</p>

<p>In 2019, Haenel went public about the assaults, stunning the French film industry, which had been slower than Hollywood to react to the #MeToo movement.</p>

<p><strong>'Unfortunate Gesture'</strong></p>

<p>Ruggia's former partner Mona Achache, 43, told the court about the filmmaker confessing to a single "unfortunate gesture" on one of the Saturday visits.</p>

<p>She said Ruggia told her he had been "madly in love" with the young actress.</p>

<p>"He told me they were watching a film on the sofa, she had rested her head on his lap, and his hand moved onto her breast," she said.</p>

<p>"It was a version of the story that highlighted his virtue in removing his hand."</p>

<p>The filmmaker had also said something to his sister.</p>

<p>"I got the impression he felt guilty," Veronique Ruggia said.</p>

<p>In 2020, Haenel stormed out of the industry's Cesars award ceremony in protest against a prize awarded to veteran director Roman Polanski, who is wanted in the United States for statutory rape.</p>

<p>Last year, she quit cinema over what she called the French film industry turning a blind eye towards sexual abusers.</p>

<p>Several other allegations have rocked the film sector over the past few years.</p>

<p>Cinema legend Gerard Depardieu, 75, is to stand trial in March accused of sexually assaulting two women. He denies the accusations.</p>

<p>Actor Judith Godreche said this year two French directors -- Benoit Jacquot and Jacques Doillon -- had both sexually abused her when she was a teenager. Both deny the charges.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Utah car dealership was the target of a customer's fury when he deliberately rammed his recently purchased vehicle into the showroom, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.9news.com.au/world/angry-customer-drives-car-into-sandy-dealership-after-return-denied/ff6616b8-d01d-4cf4-8c97-cd041c24d609" rel="noindex,nofollow">9 News </a></em>reported.</p>

<p>Michael Murray, 35, purchased a Subaru Outback from Tim Dahle Mazda Southtowne, but his excitement quickly turned to frustration when he encountered unexpected mechanical problems. Convinced he had been sold a "lemon," he returned to the dealership demanding a full refund. However, the dealership, citing the "as-is" condition of the sale, firmly denied his request, leaving Murray feeling both disappointed and potentially facing significant repair costs.</p>

<p>"We even make the document hot pink so they truly understand this is a vehicle that is, 'as is.' It hasn't been inspected. But if it fits your budget we will let you take it," the dealership's platform manager, Tyler Slade told local media.</p>

<p>Enraged by the situation, Murray warned that he would drive his car through the dealership's front door if his refund was not issued. Around 4 pm, he followed through on his threat, crashing the vehicle into the dealership's main entrance. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In a video filmed inside the dealership, the car is seen smashing through the glass doors and slamming into a front kiosk, sending shards of glass flying. As stunned employees scream, Murray steps out of the car, shouting, "I told you." &nbsp;</p>

<p>The dealership reported that the incident caused approximately $10,000 in damages. Although seven employees were near the entrance at the time, no one was injured. Murray was subsequently arrested and charged with felony criminal mischief and reckless endangerment."What would've happened? Who knows - it could've been fatal. He came back, but with a rage... without thinking, he just acted out in rage," an employee of the dealership said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A signed portrait of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, dated 2002, was among the treasures inside Bashar al-Assad's New Shaab Palace in Damascus, now overrun by rebel forces. The portrait, a relic of the Syrian president's diplomatic visit to Buckingham Palace with his British-born wife Asma, was discovered in a room stuffed with prized possessions and diplomatic gifts.<br />
<br />
The room, now widely photographed, featured gold-encrusted chests, paintings, pottery, and mementoes of Assad's rule, including a rug with his face, a gold FIFA award from 2005, and a silver shield, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/middleeast/assad-presidential-palace.html " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">NYT</a> reported. The 2002 portrait takes us back to the time Assad courted global leaders, striving to rehabilitate Syria's image following his father's brutal regime.<br />
<br />
Bashar al-Assad, who once projected an image of reform, saw his rule crumble under the weight of a brutal civil war that began in 2011. He and his family <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/syrians-take-over-assads-presidential-palaces-click-pictures-loot-furniture-7201567">fled Damascus</a> on December 8 in haste, seeking asylum in Moscow, as rebel forces swept through the capital after a 12-day offensive. Evidence of their abrupt departure was visible in the palace, with military maps left scattered on Assad's desk. Hours later, civilians posed for selfies at the once heavily guarded workspace – the collapse of his long-standing rule.<br />
<br />
As the palace doors were thrown open, footage showed civilians and fighters <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bashar-al-assad-luxury-cars-bunker-guns-rebels-loot-abandoned-presidential-palace-in-syria-7205164 ">looting items</a> ranging from Louis Vuitton bags to chandeliers. Outside, Assad's fleet of luxury vehicles, including Ferraris, Aston Martins, Rolls-Royces, and a Bugatti Veyron, became a spectacle for the crowds.<br />
<br />
Rebels now guard the palace gates, preventing looting while using the grand reception rooms as resting spots. Inside, remnants of a hastily abandoned regime – shredded documents, half-finished coffee cups, and scattered luxury items – paint a vivid picture of how the Assad dynasty fell.<br />
<br />
The scene echoes the fall of other autocratic leaders. In 2011, Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi's compound revealed jewel-encrusted pistols and a bizarre portrait of Condoleezza Rice, alongside a golden dagger worth $10 million, later recovered in 2016.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US President-elect Donald Trump has said he plans to end birthright citizenship in America as soon as he gets into office.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has said he plans to end birthright citizenship in America as soon as he gets into office. Birthright citizenship, guaranteed under the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution, means that anyone born within American borders automatically becomes a citizen of the United States. This includes children of tourists, students studying in American colleges on short-term visas and undocumented immigrants.</p>

<p>If the incoming President were to try and change the law using "executive action" after he takes office, it would undo 150 years of how the US treated the issue.</p>

<h3><strong>What did Donald Trump Say?</strong></h3>

<p>In his first formal television interview on Sunday since the Presidential election, Mr Trump was asked if he was planning to go ahead with his poll promise of ending birthright citizenship, to which he said, "Yeah, absolutely."</p>

<p>"We're going to end that because it's ridiculous," he said during an interview on NBC's "Meet the Press".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The President-elect said he's planning on changing the practice using executive action, noting that there are other options.</p>

<p>In a small olive branch offering to those advocating for allowing some undocumented migrants -- a key source of labour for much of the US economy -- to stay, Mr Trump said he will "work with the Democrats" on the so-called "dreamers" -- the immigrants who've become successful residents by getting good jobs and starting businesses after entering the United States illegally as young children.</p>

<p>"I don't want to be breaking up families, so the only way you don't break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back," he added. If the Trump administration goes ahead with this plan, it would mean expelling legal US citizens, including those who got citizenship through birth, so that they are not separated from their families.</p>

<p>Several Republicans, including Mr Trump, have argued that birthright citizenship gives rise to "birth tourism", in which pregnant women from other countries enter the US illegally, or on tourist visas, to give birth there, before returning to their home countries. This way, their children are born US citizens.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>What Does The Law Say?</strong></h3>

<p>Birthright citizenship is a legal principle under the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution. This principle was confirmed in the US Constitution in 1868, after the four years of the American Civil War, to overturn the Supreme Court decision Dred Scott v. Sandford, which denied basic rights to African Americans. The judgement said that enslaved people were not US citizens and, therefore, could not expect any protection from the federal government or the courts.</p>

<p>Under the law, citizenship is automatically granted to individuals upon birth on US soil. "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside," the 14th Amendment states.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Under the constitution, birthright citizenship is guaranteed to children born on US soil, "regardless of their parent's immigration or citizenship status," according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/topics/birthright-citizenship" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">American Immigration Council</a>'s website.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"For over a century, the U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the 14th Amendment as conferring U.S. citizenship automatically to anyone born on U.S. soil," it adds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US employs a combination of birthright citizenship-- ancestry-based citizenship and birthplace-based citizenship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Birthplace-based citizenship, which grants citizenship based on place of birth, is formally referred to as jus soli, a Latin term meaning "right of the soil", while restricted ancestry-based citizenship, referred to as jus sanguinis, &nbsp;extends citizenship to children born abroad to US citizens, provided statutory requirements are met.</p>

<h3><strong>How Can Birthright Citizenship Be Halted?</strong></h3>

<p>To implement any changes in the Constitution, Mr Trump's administration will require the support of a two-thirds majority in both chambers of Congress-- the Senate and the House of Representatives. In addition, the amendment must also be ratified by three-fourths of all state legislatures, according to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-end-birthright-citizenship-explained-b2661867.html" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Independent</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Republicans have a 53 to 47 majority in the Senate and a 220 to 215 majority in the House, meaning America's grand old party (GOP) does not have the required number in either chamber.</p>

<p>In a 2011 article, the American Immigration Council noted that if birthright citizenship is ever halted in the US, it would cause parents to have to prove their children's citizenship status. "Our birth certificates are proof of our citizenship. If birthright citizenship were eliminated, U.S. citizens could no longer use their birth certificates as proof of citizenship," the council said.</p>

<h3><strong>What Donald Trump Can Do To End It?</strong></h3>

<p>Though Mr Trump did not give a lot of details on how he was planning to end birthright citizenship in his interview, the matter was extensively discussed in a 2023 post on his campaign website. According to a report by the Associated Press, the website said Mr Trump would issue an executive order on the first day of his presidency, making it clear that federal agencies "require that at least one parent be a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident for their future children to become automatic US citizens."</p>

<p>Per the incoming President, the executive order would make clear that children of illegal immigrants "should not be issued passports, Social Security numbers, or be eligible for certain taxpayer-funded welfare benefits."</p>

<p>However, the law is clear that birthright citizenship can't be ended by executive order and any such move would almost certainly end up in litigation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But, Mr Trump may be inclined to take a shot anyway through the courts, said Alex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies at the pro-immigration Cato Institute.</p>

<p>"I don't take his statements very seriously. He has been saying things like this for almost a decade...He didn't do anything to further this agenda when he was president before. The law and judges are near uniformly opposed to his legal theory that the children of illegal immigrants born in the United States are not citizens," Nowrasteh said.</p>

<p>Mr Trump could steer Congress to pass a law to end birthright citizenship but would still face a legal challenge that it violates the Constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

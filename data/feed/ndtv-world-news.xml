       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An endangered baby pygmy hippo that shot to social media stardom in Thailand has become a lucrative source of income for her home zoo, quadrupling its ticket sales, the institution said Thursday.</p>

<p>Moo Deng, whose name in Thai means "bouncy pork", has drawn tens of thousands of visitors to Khao Kheow Open Zoo this month.</p>

<p>The two-month-old pygmy hippo went viral on TikTok and Instagram for her cheeky antics, inspiring merch, memes and even craft tutorials on how to make crocheted or cake-based Moo Dengs at home.</p>

<p>A zoo spokesperson told AFP that ticket sales from the start of September to Wednesday reached almost 19.2 million baht ($590,000) -- more than four times the same period last year.</p>

<p>Fans from all over the world have queued for hours outside her enclosure, forcing keepers to limit Moo Deng observation time to five minutes each.</p>

<p>The zoo has set up a round-the-clock livestream of the hippo's enclosure to ease waiting times and for fans who cannot visit in person.</p>

<p>It is also hoping Moo Deng fever spurs further merchandise sales, launching a pygmy hippo-themed T-shirt line last week. At 300 baht, or $9 a pop, it is currently only available at the zoo itself.</p>

<p>"We have outsourced a company to help us produce Moo Deng products, like T-shirts and trousers," said the zoo's spokesperson, adding any Moo Deng-generated profits would go towards improving facilities for all the zoo's animals, not just its star moneymaker.</p>

<p>"Income will be used to maintain the zoo."</p>

<p>The hype has prompted animal rights group PETA to post a statement on its website saying "there's nothing cute about a baby being born in captivity".</p>

<p>Endangered pygmy hippos are native to West Africa, and there are only an estimated 2,000-2,500 left in the world, according to the IUCN.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Since 1949, China has strategically loaned giant pandas to foreign zoos to foster trade ties, strengthen diplomatic relations, and enhance its global image.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finland's Ahtari Zoo is prematurely ending its 15-year giant panda hosting program, returning Lumi and Pyry to China in November, eight years ahead of schedule. The decision stems from financial constraints, largely due to inflation and debt accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0z289ervmo">BBC</a></em>, the zoo spent approximately 1.5 million euros annually on the pandas' upkeep, exceeding the combined costs of all other species. Additional expenses included a full-time keeper, preservation fees to China, and imported bamboo, totalling over 8 million euros for their enclosure.</p>

<p>The agreement to return the pair was reached with the zoo's partners in China on September 20.</p>

<p>The Ahtari Zoo in Finland had high hopes that the giant pandas would draw in crowds to its central location, but unfortunately, that didn't quite pan out. Since the Covid pandemic, the zoo has struggled with declining visitor numbers, which, combined with inflation and rising interest rates, has led to significant debt.</p>

<p>The pandas were to be returned after 15 years but "our economic situation does not allow us to keep the pandas anymore" Ahtari Zoo's board chairman Risto Sivonen said.</p>

<p>Marko Haapakoski, curator at the zoo said, ''It's a good thing for the zoo because they were so expensive, but the pandas had been "doing well, so it's a pity. They're nice to work with."</p>

<p>Lumi and Pyry will undergo a month-long quarantine before returning to China.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Finland's foreign ministry said the pandas' return was a business decision that did not involve the government, and that it should not impact relations between Finland and China.</p>

<p>Since 1949, China has strategically loaned giant pandas to foreign zoos to foster trade ties, strengthen diplomatic relations, and enhance its global image. According to AFP, an estimated 1,860 giant pandas remain in the wild, mainly in bamboo forests in the mountains of China.&nbsp;About 600 are in captivity in panda centres, zoos and wildlife parks around the world.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alabama is set to carry out the second execution in the United States using nitrogen hypoxia, a controversial method critics say is tantamount to torture. According to <em>CNN</em>, a previous attempt to execute Alan Eugene Miller, 59, using lethal injection was called off two years ago after state officials said they couldn't access his veins before the execution warrant expired. Now on Thursday, he will be strapped to a gurney where a respirator mask will be applied to his face through which pure nitrogen will be piped. The resulting oxygen deprivation will cause death by asphyxia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Republican Alabama Governor Kay Ivey has designated a 30-hour window beginning Thursday morning for the 59-year-old's execution to take place, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/26/us/alan-eugene-miller-alabama-execution/index.html"><em>CNN </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Miller has been in jail for more than two decades. He was sentenced to death in 2000 for the 1999 murders of Lee Holdbrooks, Scott Yancy and Terry Lee Jarvis. He had worked with each of the victims and became upset when he believed the three "spread rumours about him", according to the outlet.</p>

<p>On August 5, 1999, Miller shot two of the three men at Ferguson Enterprises in Pelham, Alabama. "I'm tired of people starting rumours on me," Miller said, armed with a pistol while walking out of his employer's office. He then shot Scott Yancy three times and Lee Holdbrooks six times. He then headed to his previous employer, Post Airgas, where Terry Lee Jarvis worked and shot him "a number of times".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Miller was later captured on the highway with "a Glock pistol with one round in the chamber and 11 rounds in the ammunition magazine," per <em>CNN</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A forensic psychiatrist who testified for Miller's defence determined he was mentally ill and suffering a delusional disorder, leading him to believe the victims were spreading rumours about him. The psychiatrist concluded, however, that Miller's mental illness didn't meet the standards for an insanity defence in Alabama.</p>

<p>Notably, Miller's execution via nitrogen hypoxia comes nearly three years after Alabama officials tried to execute him by lethal injection, but failed because they could not access his veins within the required time limit. It also comes after a federal lawsuit filed by Miller over the use of nitrogen gas in his execution was settled last month.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old had challenged the state's nitrogen hypoxia protocol, claiming it could cause him undue suffering, thus violating his Eighth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment. The terms of the settlement are confidential, though state Attorney General Steve Marshall touted it as proof Alabama's nitrogen gas execution method - which was used for the first and only time earlier this year in the execution of Kenneth Smith - is constitutional, as per the outlet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The resolution of this case confirms that Alabama's nitrogen hypoxia system is reliable and humane," Mr Marshall said in a statement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A pet-loving part-time musician is fast becoming a global star by gently poking fun at Donald Trump for suggesting that Haitian immigrants are making a meal of America's cats and dogs.</p>

<p>"Eating the cats", a parody song by The Kiffness which sets to music Trump's extraordinary claims during the US presidential debate that migrants in Ohio "are eating the dogs, eating the cats", has been viewed more than 8.7 million times on YouTube alone in 12 days.</p>

<p>"People of Springfield please don't eat my cat," pleads the South African singer, whose real name is David Scott. "Why would you do that?/ Eat something else."</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3BrCvZmSnKA?si=bUXpPVN9Bf0W5RnT" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>He then helpfully holds up a card suggesting a range of other mostly veggie options, including broccoli, avocados and poached eggs.</p>

<p>The singer, who has been slowly building a following for his feel-good songs about pets and children -- because "they tend to unite people" -- has seen his popularity soar since he got his singing claws into Trump.</p>

<p>Although he insists he is not attacking anybody, just giving some cat- and dog-friendly dietary advice.</p>

<p>"I think music has a powerful way of taking away negative energy and polarising feelings, especially with someone like Donald Trump, who is such a polarising figure," he told AFP before his band gave a concert in Paris.</p>

<p><strong>Not trying to hurt anyone</strong></p>

<p>"I want my music to unite people. And I think that's why I moved towards music that included animals. Because animals unite people," said the 36-year-old from Cape Town.</p>

<p>The video, which has been watched by millions more on social media, shows Trump's rival Kamala Harris reacting to his widely-derided claims during their debate earlier this month. A couple of cats and dogs also chip in with vocals, and equally incredulous looks.</p>

<p>Scott said all the earnings from the song are going to help pets and stray cats and dogs in Springfield, with more than $20,000 already raised.</p>

<p>"I've never seen anything like it," he told AFP. "The interest has been overwhelming from both sides, from Democrats, from Republicans."</p>

<p>He said the song was not "laughing at the situation, it's saying that you can rise above it... and just see the humour in things," said the musician, who describes himself on X as a "Christian, husband, father (and) part-time musician".</p>

<p>Springfield's mayor, police and Ohio's Republican governor have all said there is no evidence to back up Trump's claims that Haitian migrants were eating the city's pets.</p>

<p>But that has not stopped his running mate JD Vance -- an Ohio senator -- from doubling down on the claims, despite being widely mocked.</p>

<p>"My constituents are telling me firsthand that they're seeing these things," an unapologetic Vance told CNN.</p>

<p>This prompted Haitian groups in Springfield to file charges against Trump and Vance Wednesday over the threats to their community since the pair amplified the false online rumours.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk hit back at Britain on Thursday after reports that he had not been invited to the country's upcoming investment summit, alleging the government was releasing convicted paedophiles while imprisoning people over social media posts.</p>

<p>The BBC reported that the US billionaire had not been invited to the summit next month after his posts on his X platform regarding the violent, racist anti-immigration riots in Britain last month.</p>

<p>Britain's Department for Business and Trade and the Treasury did not respond to requests for comment on either the BBC report or Musk's response.</p>

<p>"I don't think anyone should go to the UK when they're releasing convicted pedophiles in order to imprison people for social media posts," Musk said on X in response to a post on the BBC report.</p>

<p>More than 1,700 prisoners were released early this month in an effort by Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour government to tackle overcrowding in prisons in England and Wales. Those serving sentences for sex offences were not included in the scheme.</p>

<p>The government and others criticised Musk, who has nearly 200 million followers on X, for his posts on Britain in August, including one saying civil war was "inevitable", as the country was shaken by riots that saw far-right groups attack hotels housing asylum seekers and mosques.</p>

<p>Starmer's spokesperson said at the time there was "no justification" for such comments. Over 1,000 arrests have been made in relation to the riots, and some people have been jailed for stirring up racial hatred on social media.</p>

<p>The investment summit next month is set to be attended by leaders from global tech and financial groups, including BNY Mellon and Blackstone. The Labour government, in power since July, is hoping to attract investors to boost the economy.</p>

<p>Musk, who met French President Emmanuel Macron in May for the "Choose France" summit in Paris, was last publicly seen in London last November when he attended the AI Safety Summit and was then interviewed by former Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India was elected to the 15-member steering committee of the global anti-corruption platform GlobE Network after multi-stage voting in Beijing on Thursday, officials said.</p>

<p>Having 121 member countries and 219 member authorities, the GlobE Network has one chair, one vice-chair and thirteen members in the steering committee for providing leadership.</p>

<p>India was elected to the steering committee after a multi-stage voting process during the ongoing fifth plenary meeting of the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE Network) in Beijing, the officials said.</p>

<p>"As a member of the steering committee, India will play a crucial role in shaping the global agenda against corruption and asset recovery. India's expertise and experience in combating corruption will be valuable assets to GlobE Network," a CBI spokesperson said in a statement.</p>

<p>The Union Home Ministry is the central authority from India for the GloBE Network while the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) are member authorities.</p>

<p>A G20 initiative, the GlobE Network to combat cross-border financial crimes and corruption received strong support from India in 2020.</p>

<p>The platform was officially launched in June 2021 during a special event at the UN General Assembly Special Session against Corruption (UNGASS).</p>

<p>It has emerged as a unique platform where agencies from across the world share best practices, criminal intelligence, develop strategies, and support in the common cause of combating corruption, the CBI statement said.</p>

<p>"The GlobE Network is a vital platform for international cooperation, and India's participation will strengthen its efforts to combat cross-border financial crimes and corruption," it said.</p>

<p>During India's G20 presidency, two high-level principles for combatting corruption were adopted that detailed leveraging of the GloBE Network, it said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Disturbing incidents of teachers physically assaulting and punishing students are on the rise in China.&nbsp;A boarding school in Huairen County, Shanxi province, is now facing backlash for its harsh punishment of a student who used the bathroom late at night. On September 10, a Form Three student at Yundong Secondary School in Shanxi province used the bathroom at 11:10 pm, violating school rules. An anonymous teacher said that the school had strict rules prohibiting students from walking around the dormitory after 10:45 pm, and surprisingly, even using the toilet was not allowed after this time.</p>

<p>As a consequence, the teenager was forced to write a ''deep self-reflection'' letter and to distribute 1,000 photocopies of the essay to his schoolmates as punishment, the<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3279488/china-boarding-school-criticised-harsh-punishment-pupil-using-toilet-late-night" rel="nofollow, noindex"> South China Morning Post</a></em> reported. Five points were also deducted from his class's monthly discipline score.&nbsp;In his self-reflection essay, the student expressed: ''I have seriously breached the school rules, and going to the toilet in the evening not only disturbed other students' sleep but also brought shame to my class.''</p>

<p>The punishment meted out to the student for using the bathroom after curfew sparked widespread outrage online, with many condemning the school's actions as excessive and unjust. Some also called the school a ''prison". Critics argued that the penalty was grossly disproportionate to the offence, taking into account the student's tender age and the fundamental human need to use the bathroom. Many expressed concerns that such harsh punishment would have a lasting impact on the student's emotional well-being and self-esteem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One user wrote, ''I don't understand why going to the toilet after 11 pm breaks the school's rules. Who can control when they need to go?'' Another commented, ''This school resembles a prison with such strict regulations.''</p>

<p>In response to the widespread criticism on social media, the Education Department of Huairen department instructed the school to reflect on its errors, revise its discipline policies, and engage with the students in a caring and compassionate manner.</p>

<p>Additionally, the school was ordered to reimburse the student 100 yuan (Rs 1,193) for the costs incurred in copying the self-reflection essay. To prevent similar incidents, officials directed all schools in the region to adopt "reasonable and humane" discipline policies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, the worrying trend of student abuse by teachers in China has been persisting despite a government ban on corporal punishment in schools dating back to 1986.&nbsp;Last year, a nine-year-old girl underwent emergency surgery for a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/chinese-student-hospitalised-with-shattered-skull-after-teacher-beats-her-4400141" rel="nofollow, noindex">severely damaged skull,</a>&nbsp;after a teacher allegedly used a metal ruler to hit her on the head.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has released a video explaining its strikes deep inside Lebanon where it alleged Hezbollah had hidden weapons in populated areas.</p>

<p>The IDF said Hezbollah has been hiding weapons inside Lebanese homes.</p>

<p>"For the last 20 years, Hezbollah built its terror network within population centres in Lebanon - primarily throughout southern Lebanon, an area that they turned almost entirely into a launch pad to attack Israel," the IDF said.</p>

<p>"Hezbollah doesn't want you to watch this video. And they really don't want you to share it," it said in the video posted on X.</p>

<p>The IDF's video is being seen as an effort to ward off criticism over attacks in populated areas in Lebanon.</p>

<p>"The IDF has launched a defensive operation against the Hezbollah terror organisation by conducting precise intelligence-based strikes on hundreds of Hezbollah targets. Our goal is to thwart imminent attacks planned by Hezbollah who intended to use the very weapons that we destroyed - at Israeli homes," the IDF said.</p>

<p>"Our goal is to make sure that Israeli families can safely and securely return to their homes," it said.</p>

<p>In the latest strikes today, Israel bombed a Hezbollah commander's location in Beirut's southern suburbs, a source close to the group told news agency AFP, as Israel's army announced it was carrying out precision raids in the Lebanese capital.</p>

<p>"An Israeli strike targeted a Hezbollah commander," the security source said, requesting anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media. It is the fourth such attack targeting Hezbollah commanders in the area in a week.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French President Emmanuel Macron has voiced strong support for India's inclusion as a permanent member of a reformed United Nations Security Council (UNSC), along with Germany, Japan, Brazil, and two African nations.</p>

<p>"Germany, Japan, India and Brazil should be permanent members, as well as two countries that Africa would designate to represent it. New elected members should also be admitted," Mr Macron said while addressing the general debate at the 79th session of the UN General Assembly in New York early Thursday, India time.</p>

<p>The French President stressed the need for reforms within the UN to make it more effective and representative, particularly in light of the challenges posed by the current structure of the Security Council.</p>

<p>"The United Nations should not be discarded, but rather reformed to reflect today's realities," he said.</p>

<p>He said that the current Security Council, often blocked by conflicting interests, needs to evolve.</p>

<p>"Is there a better system? I don't think so. So let's just make these United Nations more effective, first by perhaps making them more representative. That is why France and I repeat here, is in favour of the Security Council being expanded," Mr Macron said.</p>

<p>The French President said that he hopes that "this reform will also make it possible to change working methods, to limit the right of veto in the event of mass crime and to focus on operational decisions that are necessary to maintain international peace and security. This is what we must have the courage and audacity to do and that we must carry forward with the current permanent members."</p>

<p>Earlier, Chilean President Gabriel Boric Font also advocated for India's inclusion, proposing a deadline for the reform to align the UNSC with modern geopolitical realities by the UN's 80th anniversary.</p>

<p>The call for India's permanent membership has also been echoed by other global leaders, including US President Joe Biden, who reiterated Washington's full support for India's bid during his recent bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>

<p>Russia, too, continues to back India's aspiration for a permanent seat, with the country's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov emphasising the need for greater representation of developing countries in the council during the ongoing annual UN event.</p>

<p>The growing consensus among world leaders highlights the urgency of reforming the UNSC to reflect the contemporary global order and ensure more inclusive and effective international governance.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ms Webb's death sparked a police investigation, with Gloucestershire Police arresting two individuals on suspicion of manslaughter.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alice Delsie Preete Webb, a 34-year-old mother of five and beauty therapist, died after undergoing a non-surgical liquid Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) procedure. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/09/26/mum-of-five-first-person-die-brazilian-butt-lift-procedure-uk-21675248/">Metro</a></em>, she is thought to be the first person in Britain to die from the risky procedure. As per the report, Ms Webb was an advanced aesthetic practitioner at Crystal Clear in Wotton-under-Edge, a market town in Gloucestershire. Ms Webb leaves behind her partner, Dane Knight, and their five children —Delsie, 15, Preete, 13, Gracie, 12, Nylie, 10, and Clarie, 7.</p>

<p>Her death sparked a police investigation, with Gloucestershire Police arresting two individuals on suspicion of manslaughter. Although they have been released on bail, the incident raises serious concerns about the risks of unregulated cosmetic procedures.</p>

<p>A Gloucestershire Police spokesperson said: ''Two people have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter following the death of a woman in her 30s in Gloucester.&nbsp;Police had been called by the ambulance service at around 11.35 pm on Monday (23 September) with a report a woman had become unwell following a suspected cosmetic procedure.&nbsp;She was taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital and died in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Her next of kin and the coroner are aware. The woman's family are being supported by specially trained officers. an investigation, led by the Major Crime Investigation Team, is ongoing.''</p>

<p>The procedure, which involves injecting hyaluronic acid and dermal fillers into the buttocks, was reportedly performed by an unqualified individual without medical training. The liquid BBL procedure typically costs around 2,500 pounds and takes approximately 60 minutes. However, its non-surgical nature can be misleading, as it still carries significant risks, especially when performed by unqualified practitioners.</p>

<p><strong>About Liquid Brazilian Butt Lift</strong></p>

<p>The liquid Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) differs from the traditional BBL, which involves fat grafting. Instead, liquid BBL uses injectable products for volumising and contouring, making it a less invasive procedure with no liposuction or fat transfer required. This results in a faster recovery time. However, the results of a liquid BBL are temporary, lasting approximately one to two years, depending on the product used and how the body metabolizes it.</p>

<p>In contrast, traditional BBL provides more long-lasting results, albeit at a higher cost, ranging from 5,000-6,000 pounds in the UK, with a procedure time of roughly two hours. The liquid BBL, on the other hand, typically costs 2,500 pounds and takes around 60 minutes to complete. Despite being marketed as a "risk-free" and "cheaper" alternative, liquid BBL carries risks, especially when performed by unqualified practitioners. Some individuals opt for the procedure in Turkey, where it is offered at a lower cost.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A sharp escalation in border warfare between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon has sent Western nations scrambling to update contingency plans for evacuations from the region.</p>

<p>Cyprus, the closest EU member to the Middle East, is a likely hub, having processed around 60,000 people fleeing the Hezbollah-Israel war in 2006.</p>

<p>Neighbouring Turkey has offered facilities as well.</p>

<p>Operations-wise, most contingency planning seems to be by sea, enabling movement of larger groups, but that will be defined by the security situation, a source familiar with the process told Reuters. It takes about 10 hours to Cyprus by sea, or 40 minutes by plane from Beirut.</p>

<p>Here are some details on contingency planning:</p>

<p><strong>Australia</strong></p>

<p>Authorities have made contingency plans that could include evacuation by sea, though it has urged an estimated 15,000 of its citizens in Lebanon to leave while Beirut airport remains open.</p>

<p><strong>Canada</strong></p>

<p>News reports from Canada suggest it will cooperate with Australia in evacuating nationals by sea. The plan involves contracting a commercial vessel to transport 1,000 people out each day, The Toronto Star reported.</p>

<p><strong>United Kingdom</strong></p>

<p>Britain has called for its nationals to leave immediately. It has moved around 700 troops to Cyprus, bolstering its presence in the area where it already has military assets, including two Royal Navy ships. It also has two military bases on the island.</p>

<p><strong>United States</strong></p>

<p>The US has ordered the deployment of dozens of troops to Cyprus to help prepare for scenarios, including an evacuation of Americans from Lebanon.</p>

<p><strong>Portugal</strong></p>

<p>Prime Minister Luis Montenegro on Wednesday advised against travel to Lebanon. The country has a plan to evacuate Portuguese citizens living there in cooperation with partner countries in the EU, he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan said Thursday it would have to go through "transitional pain" after the International Monetary Fund agreed to a new relief package of $7 billion to bolster its faltering economy.</p>

<p>Although the South Asian nation's economy has stabilised since it came close to defaulting last summer, it is dependent on IMF bailouts and loans from friendly countries to service its huge debt, which swallows up half of its annual revenues.</p>

<p>"There will be transitional pain, but if we are to make it the last programme, then we have to carry out structural reforms," Minister of Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb told local broadcaster Geo News.</p>

<p>The IMF said in a statement it would issue an "immediate disbursement" of around $1 billion.</p>

<p>The three-year loan programme "will require sound policies and reforms" to support Pakistan's ongoing efforts to strengthen its economy "and create conditions for a stronger, more inclusive, and resilient growth", it added.</p>

<p>Pakistan in July agreed to the deal -- its 24th IMF payout since 1958 -- in exchange for unpopular reforms, including cutting back on power subsidies and widening its chronically low tax base.</p>

<p>Speaking on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Wednesday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the deal came through thanks to the "tremendous support" of Saudi Arabia, China and the UAE.</p>

<p>"In the final phase (of negotiations), the IMF's conditions were related to China. The way the Chinese government supported and strengthened us during this time is something I am truly grateful for," he told reporters shortly before the deal was announced.</p>

<p>Last month, Aurangzeb had said Pakistan was negotiating a $12 billion loan reprofiling from bilateral lenders.</p>

<p>The amount comprised $5 billion from Saudi Arabia, $4 billion from China and $3 billion from the UAE for a three- to five-year period.</p>

<p>Reacting to the news, Pakistan's stock exchange briefly reached a new record high before losing ground in later trade.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Formidable vulnerabilities' -</strong></p>

<p>Kaiser Bengali, a Pakistani economist, told AFP: "This deal will help us pay back our immediate debts, but nothing more than that.</p>

<p>"The only economic reforms that we are required to implement is more taxes. There is no progress on reducing government expenditures."</p>

<p>At the end of 2023, Pakistan -- long locked in a cycle of overlapping political and economic crises -- had amassed a total debt of more than $250 billion, or 74 per cent of GDP, according to the IMF.</p>

<p>About 40 per cent of its debt is owed to external creditors in foreign currencies. Its biggest single foreign creditor is China and Chinese commercial banks, at just under $30 billion, followed by the World Bank at more than $20 billion, according to the report.</p>

<p>Last year the country came to the brink of default as the economy shrivelled amid political chaos following catastrophic 2022 monsoon floods and decades of mismanagement, as well as a global economic downturn.</p>

<p>It was saved by last-minute loans from friendly countries as well as an IMF rescue package.</p>

<p>Islamabad wrangled for months with IMF officials to unlock the latest loan, which came on the condition of reforms including hiking household bills to remedy a permanently crisis-stricken energy sector and raising pitiful tax takings.</p>

<p>In a nation of more than 240 million people where most jobs are in the informal sector, only 5.2 million filed income tax returns in 2022.</p>

<p>The IMF said Pakistan "has taken key steps to restore economic stability with consistent reforms". But "despite this progress, Pakistan's vulnerabilities and structural challenges remain formidable", it warned.</p>

<p>"A difficult business environment, weak governance, and an outsized role of the state hinder investment, which remains very low compared to peers," it added.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US Secret Service agent has been accused of sexually assaulting a staffer for Kamala Harris in a hotel room, <em>The Independent</em> reported. The alleged incident took place last week when an agent and several Harris staffers were dining and drinking alcohol at a restaurant in Wisconsin during an advance trip. The group reportedly went back to the staffer's hotel room when the unnamed Secret Service agent allegedly forced himself on her and groped her in front of others. Those inside the room then allegedly kicked the agent out into the hallway, where he was said to have been so drunk he passed out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The U.S. Secret Service Office of Professional Responsibility is investigating a misconduct allegation involving an employee," a Secret Service spokesperson said in a statement, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/secret-service-sexual-assault-harris-b2619047.html" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>The Independent</em></a>. "The Secret Service holds its personnel to the highest standards. The employee has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation," it added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Kamala Harris campaign office also confirmed the incident, saying that it was aware of the allegation. "We have zero tolerance for sexual misconduct," it told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/25/secret-service-harris-aide-assault" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>The Guardian</em></a>. "Senior OVP [Office of the Vice President] officials were alerted by the USSS about an incident involving an agent and informed that USSS initiated an investigation," it added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Secret Service agents have been accused of misbehaviour on trips in the past, including a 2012 scandal where agents in Colombia allegedly brought prostitutes back to a hotel. In 2014, the three agents then-US President Barack Obama were also sent home and suspended for excessive drinking during a trip to Amsterdam.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the recent incident comes as the agency tasked with protecting the president and presidential candidates faces enormous pressure after two recent failed assassination attempts against former President Donald Trump. A Senate report found repeated failures of leadership and communication at the July 13 Trump rally in which the Republican leader was shot in the ear by a would-be assassin perched on a nearby rooftop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"(United States Secret Service) failures in planning, communications, security, and allocations of resources... were foreseeable, preventable, and directly related to the events resulting in the assassination attempt," the report said.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The European Union on Thursday rejected as "reckless and irresponsible" a plan by President Vladimir Putin to authorise a nuclear response to a massive air attack on Russia.</p>

<p>Putin on Wednesday announced an updated nuclear doctrine that would allow the use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states when they are supported by nuclear powers -- a clear reference to Ukraine and its Western backers.</p>

<p>"Not for the first time, Putin is playing (a) gamble with his nuclear arsenal," EU foreign policy spokesman Peter Stano told reporters. "We of course strongly reject these threats."</p>

<p>The proposed broadening of Russia's nuclear rules, which Putin himself has the power to approve, comes as Ukraine seeks permission from Western allies to use long-range weaponry to strike targets deep inside Russia.</p>

<p>Kyiv says it is necessary to target Russia's airfields and military infrastructure that it uses to launch attacks on Ukraine. The United States and other Western countries are cautious about enabling further escalation.</p>

<p>Earlier on Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the planned changes should be seen as a "specific signal" to the West.</p>

<p>Western powers have accused Putin of dangerous nuclear sabre-rattling throughout the Ukraine conflict. The Kremlin leader has issued multiple apparent threats about Moscow's willingness to deploy nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>"This is just the continuation of the very irresponsible and unacceptable behaviour on the side of Putin," the EU's Stano said of the latest threat, which came as many world leaders attended the United Nations General Assembly in New York.</p>

<p>Putin's stance was all the more "reckless," Stano said, coming from the leader of a permanent member of the UN Security Council.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The search for a second Earth within the Milky Way is ongoing, but a recently discovered planet falls short of the mark.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have made a new finding that provides a fascinating insight into the future of our solar system. A new exoplanet, about 1.9 times the mass of Earth, has been discovered around a white dwarf star, according to <em>ScienceAlert. </em>This extraordinary discovery throws light on the possible fate of our own planet as the Sun finally turns into a white dwarf.</p>

<p>Despite the planet's hostile conditions caused by the star's destructive red giant phase, the discovery provides insights into planetary evolution. White dwarfs, which are leftovers of stars such as the Sun, arise following the red giant period. This study, led by Keming Zhang of the University of California, focusses on how planets might survive this chaotic period, expanding our understanding of planetary survival and evolution.</p>

<p>"The simplest explanation is that the planet survived through the red giant host star," Zhang told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.sciencealert.com/earth-like-planet-discovered-orbiting-an-alien-star-theres-just-one-big-problem"><em>ScienceAlert.</em></a></p>

<p>"The white dwarf lens was nearly perfectly aligned with the background source star during the event, causing it to be magnified by over 1,000 times," Zhang explained.</p>

<p>"For these rare ultra-high magnification microlensing events, a companion as small as a terrestrial planet could significantly affect the magnification pattern, enabling us to accurately infer the lens configuration across a wide range of masses and orbital separations."</p>

<p>This allowed the researchers to not just determine the mass and orbital separation of the Earth-like, or terrestrial, exoplanet, but the presence of a brown dwarf orbiting the white dwarf, too, an object about 30 times the mass of Jupiter.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sarco Pod, a futuristic capsule designed for assisted suicide, has sparked a massive controversy in Switzerland, especially after a 64-year-old American woman used one recently. Despite assisted suicide being legal in Switzerland, the incident has led to several arrests and scrutiny from authorities.</p>

<p><strong>What happened?</strong></p>

<p>On Monday, the Sarco Pod was used by a woman suffering from severe health issues at a woodland retreat in Merishausen, near the German border. Reports said she underwent a psychiatric assessment and wished to die due to years of suffering from a serious condition related to immune compromise. Her death was described as <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/if-you-want-to-die-chilling-message-us-woman-got-in-suicide-pod-6644385 ">“peaceful, fast, and dignified”</a> by Florian Willet, co-president of The Last Resort, the organisation behind the capsule.<br />
<br />
Following the incident, <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/swiss-police-make-arrests-after-suicide-capsule-is-used-for-first-time-6651845 ]">Swiss police arrested several people</a>, including Willet, and opened criminal proceedings for “inducing and aiding and abetting suicide.” Authorities said that they previously warned the organisation that using Sarco could have legal consequences.<br />
<br />
<strong>Is assisted suicide legal in Switzerland?</strong></p>

<p>In Switzerland, assisted suicide is permitted if the individual acts voluntarily and without coercion. However, active euthanasia – where a medical professional administers a lethal injection – is illegal. The legal framework says that those assisting in suicide must not do so for self-serving motives.<br />
<br />
<strong>Why the arrests?</strong></p>

<p>The arrests, following the incident, stem from concerns that the operators of the Sarco may have violated Swiss laws regarding assisted suicide. The authorities have opened an investigation to determine whether any criminal acts occurred in relation to the woman's death.</p>

<p>Swiss Interior Minister Elisabeth Baume-Schneider said on Monday that the Sarco capsule does not comply with existing product safety laws and it was “not legal”, AFP reported.</p>

<p><strong>How the Sarco pod works</strong></p>

<p>Invented by Philip Nitschke, a known figure in right-to-die advocacy, the Sarco Pod operates by filling a sealed chamber with nitrogen gas. This process reduces the oxygen levels significantly, leading to death by hypoxia. Once inside the pod, the user presses a button, triggering the release of nitrogen. According to Nitschke, the user loses consciousness within two minutes and dies within five minutes.</p>

<p>The use of this suicide pod has also led to some ethical debates about the nature of assisted dying. Some argue it provides a peaceful and self-directed option for those suffering, while critics worry about the implications of such devices and the potential for misuse or coercion.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The United States and its allies have called for a 21-day ceasefire on the Israel-Lebanon border, effective immediately.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States and its allies have called for a 21-day ceasefire on the Israel-Lebanon border, effective immediately. The proposed pause, endorsed by a 12-nation bloc, including the UK, EU and several Arab states, comes amid intense fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Israeli airstrikes have killed nearly 600 people and displaced roughly 5 lakh people in Lebanon since Monday.</p>

<p>The joint statement, issued by President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, stressed the need for safety and security, urging both Israel and Lebanon to agree to a temporary halt in hostilities. “The exchange of fire since October 7th, and in particular over the past two weeks, threatens a much broader conflict, and harm to civilians,” the leaders said. They said the proposed ceasefire would allow diplomatic efforts to succeed and “enable civilians to return to their homes.”</p>

<p>The call comes after Israel's military chief, Lt Gen <a href="http:// https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hints-at-lebanon-hezbollah-ground-invasion-as-joe-biden-warns-of-all-out-war-in-middle-east-6651437 ">Herzi Halevi, signalled that extensive airstrikes</a> on Hezbollah in Lebanon could lead to Israeli forces entering enemy territory. The joint statement by the US and its allies noted that the hostilities were presenting the risk of broader regional “escalations” across the border.</p>

<p>Despite the international push, official responses from the Israeli and Lebanese governments are still pending. According to a senior US official, negotiations with Lebanon are underway, expecting the government, and not Hezbollah, to take the lead in handling non-state actors within its borders, the BBC reported.</p>

<p>Earlier, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also called for an immediate ceasefire in Lebanon, cautioning that “hell is breaking loose.”</p>

<p>Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the airstrikes, calling them a violation of Lebanese sovereignty. He hoped for a resolution that pressured Israel into agreeing to the ceasefire, adding, “We are facing blatant violations of our sovereignty and human rights.”</p>

<p>In response, Israel's UN envoy, Danny Danon, maintained that Israel does not seek a full-scale war but is committed to using “all means at our disposal” to protect its citizens, in line with international laws.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, cross-border attacks continue, with Hezbollah targeting Israeli military and intelligence installations.</p>

<p>Iran, Hezbollah's primary backer, condemned Israel's airstrikes, warning that the Middle East is facing a “full-scale catastrophe.” Tehran also vowed it would support Lebanon by “all means necessary” should Israel intensify its military offensive.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 64-year-old woman from the US recently died by suicide using the Sarco suicide pod at a woodland retreat in Switzerland. The device delivered a haunting message in her final moments: “If you want to die, press this button,” reported AFP. The Sarco pod, with its futuristic design, operates by filling with nitrogen, leading to death through hypoxia. This self-operated, human-sized capsule has raised legal and ethical questions in Switzerland, where active euthanasia is illegal, yet assisted dying has been permitted for decades.</p>

<p>On the day the pod was used, Switzerland's Interior Minister, Elisabeth Baume-Schneider, told lawmakers that the Sarco remained “not legal,” leading to a fresh debate around its use.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at what the Sarco suicide pod is, how it works, and the controversies.<br />
<br />
<strong>What is the Sarco Pod?</strong><br />
<br />
The <a href="https://www.exitinternational.net/sarco/">Sarco pod</a>, short for sarcophagus, is a controversial euthanasia device that has attracted significant attention due to its innovative design and intended use. This 3D-printed, detachable capsule is mounted on a stand and contains a canister of liquid nitrogen, allowing individuals to end their lives through inert gas asphyxiation. First introduced in Switzerland in 2019, the capsule offers a means for people to die without the need for medical supervision. It releases nitrogen gas inside and reduces the oxygen levels to lethal amounts.<br />
<br />
The Sarco pod is the brainchild of Philip Nitschke, an Australian physician known for his advocacy of assisted suicide since the 1990s. His work has played a significant role in the ongoing discussions around the ethics and legality of euthanasia, according to CNN.<br />
<br />
The 3D-printable Sarco capsule cost over 6,50,000 euros (around Rs 6.06 crore) to research and develop in the Netherlands over 12 years, according to AFP.<br />
<br />
<strong>How does the Sarco pod work?</strong><br />
<br />
The Sarco pod replaces the oxygen inside with nitrogen, resulting in death by hypoxia. To operate the Sarco pod, the individual wishing to die must follow some steps:</p>

<ul>
	<li>To use the Sarco, individuals must first pass a psychiatric assessment.</li>
	<li>Users climb into the capsule, close the lid, and answer automated questions about their identity and understanding of the process.</li>
	<li>Once the button is pressed, the oxygen level in the capsule drops from 21% to 0.05% in less than 30 seconds.</li>
	<li>Individuals quickly lose consciousness and die within approximately five minutes.</li>
	<li>An emergency exit button is also located inside the pod, providing a potential escape route if needed.</li>
	<li>Once the hypoxia process is complete, the biodegradable capsule can be detached from the machine's base, allowing it to serve as the deceased individual's coffin.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nitschke's Exit International, which owns the Sarco, is a non-profit organisation funded by donations, with users only paying 18 Swiss francs (around Rs 1,769) for the nitrogen.<br />
<br />
<strong>Its legality in Switzerland</strong><br />
<br />
Switzerland has permitted assisted suicide since the 1940s, saying the ones assisting must have no direct interest in the individual's death. This legal framework has established Switzerland as a notable "death tourism" destination, attracting individuals from around the globe seeking the right to end their lives on their terms, Reuters reported. The use of the Sarco suicide pod has led to a renewed debate on the ethics and legality of euthanasia not just in Switzerland but across the world.</p><p><div class='table-div suicide'><table class='table'><thead><tr><th colspan='2'>Helplines</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vandrevala Foundation for Mental Health</td><td><a href='tel:+919999666555'>9999666555</a> or <a href='mailto:help@vandrevalafoundation.com'>help@vandrevalafoundation.com</a> </td></tr><tr><td>TISS iCall</td><td><a href='tel:+912225521111'>022-25521111</a> (Monday-Saturday: 8 am to 10 pm)</td></tr> <tr><td colspan='2'>(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities in central Japan are urging beachgoers to steer clear of dolphins after a sharp increase in biting incidents, with one expert saying the culprit may be a single overly playful individual.</p>

<p>This year has so far seen 18 swimmers bitten at several beaches in the Fukui region, according to the local Tsuruga coastguard, which logged just a handful of injuries related to dolphins in each of the past two years.</p>

<p>Most of the bites were minor -- some were little more than scratches -- but in one recent incident, an elementary school child wound up requiring 20 to 30 stitches, coastguard official Shoichi Takeuchi told AFP.</p>

<p>At Suishohama Beach -- also known as "Diamond Beach" -- a local tourism association is calling for vigilance, issuing warnings on its website and handing out fliers advising people not to approach or touch the animals.</p>

<p>"Dolphins are usually calm creatures, but they can make you bleed by biting you with sharp teeth, drag you underwater and, in the worst-case scenario, threaten your life," the association warns online.</p>

<p>The coastguard said it was unclear whether a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/lonely-sexually-frustrated-dolphin-behind-attacks-on-swimmers-in-japan-say-experts-6427280">single dolphin</a> was behind the incidents or whether there were multiple culprits.</p>

<p>One expert, however, thinks one rogue dolphin may be responsible for the incidents, given identifying characteristics such as its dorsal fin and scars.</p>

<p>"It is probably the work of the same individual," Tadamichi Morisaka, a professor of cetology at Mie University, told broadcaster NHK.</p>

<p>"Instead of trying to harm humans, it might be seeking to interact with humans the way it does with fellow dolphins."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The path to the White House this November runs through a handful of swing states, including Nevada, whose six electoral college votes will be crucial in deciding who gets the keys to the White House.</p>

<p>The state's vast rural hinterlands are solidly Republican and likely to all but cancel out the primarily Democratic vote in the gambling capital Las Vegas.</p>

<p>The state's final electoral color will depend on Washoe County, a long, thin strip abutting <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-ai/elon-musk-grok-ai-california-bill-elon-musk-voices-support-for-california-bill-requiring-safety-tests-on-ai-models-6426863" target="_blank">California</a>, whose main city is Reno.</p>

<h3><strong>Here are some key facts about Washoe County:</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>Electoral bellwether</strong></h3>

<p>Nevada as a whole is finely balanced and, for the last four decades, has voted Republican and Democratic in line with the national mood, except in 2016, when the state went for Hillary Clinton, who lost to winner <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/at-rally-in-nevada-donald-trump-proposes-ending-taxes-on-tips-5860963" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a>.</p>

<p>In 2020, Joe Biden scooped the honors in the state by a wafer-thin 33,000 votes more than Trump.</p>

<p>With about half a million people, Washoe is home to just 16 percent of Nevada's population. By comparison, Clark County, which contains Las Vegas, has more than four times as many people.</p>

<p>But Washoe punches way above its weight.</p>

<p>"It ultimately decides how Nevada votes in the national elections," political scientist Fred Lokken told AFP.</p>

<p>A look at the voter rolls reveals why: independents represent 30.8 percent of registered voters, compared to 31.4 percent who are <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/our-party-acts-like-a-cult-anti-trump-republicans-at-democrat-event-6390844" target="_blank">Republicans</a> and 29.8 percent who are Democrats.</p>

<p>Unlike their fellow Americans, however, Nevadans unhappy with the choice of Trump or Kamala Harris can simply vote "None of these candidates" -- an official option on the ballot.</p>

<h3><strong>Quickie divorces</strong></h3>

<p>Washoe County borders the rugged Sierra Nevada mountains. Its desert expanses host the annual <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/exodus-begins-at-drenched-burning-man-festival-in-us-desert-4360197" target="_blank">Burning Man festival</a>, but most of the population is concentrated in its capital Reno.</p>

<p>The self-proclaimed "Biggest Little City in the World" was America's divorce capital for much of the 20th century, with a lively procession of visitors from elsewhere in the country eager to dissolve unhappy unions with a minimum of fuss.</p>

<p>Splitting up may have been historically easy in Washoe. However, Nevada's famously legal brothels would require a drive: Washoe is among a handful of counties in the state where prostitution is not allowed.</p>

<h3><strong>Battery power</strong></h3>

<p>Electric car giant Tesla built a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/elon-musks-mother-visits-tesla-gigafactory-in-texas-shares-pic-5491734" target="_blank">gigafactory</a> -- a massive manufacturing facility for electrification and other high-tech EV technology -- just outside Reno in 2014, kickstarting the green power industrial revolution in Washoe.</p>

<p>Panasonic and Google followed suit, and the area is now home to a booming high tech and manufacturing sector, aided by attractive tax incentives.</p>

<p>Tech companies, many of which relocated from high-tax California, brought with them good-paying jobs, reducing the county's reliance on tourism.</p>

<p>The influx of tech workers could be changing the political complexion of Washoe.</p>

<p>"This workforce is primarily male and in their twenties," said Lokken.</p>

<p>"If they vote, they're more likely not to vote Republican," he said -- and "this could push us into the blue column as a state."</p>

<h3><strong>Latino vote</strong></h3>

<p>The flipside of this gentrification has been the pressure it has brought to bear on some of the state's poorer people.</p>

<p>The average price of a single-family home in Washoe County is now $550,000, double what it was less than a decade ago.</p>

<p>While Californians think it's cheap, the rapid rise in prices has put houses out of reach for many locals.</p>

<p>Around a quarter of the population of Washoe are Latino, a group that suffered disproportionately from the shuttering of casinos during the Covid-19 pandemic, and who are overwhelmingly concentrated in lower paying jobs.</p>

<p>As in other parts of the country, persistent inflation has made life hard for those who already lived in precarious <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/will-a-potential-us-economic-slowdown-impact-india-826037" target="_blank">economic situations</a>.</p>

<p>While Latinos in the West have traditionally voted Democratic, there are increasing signs of disenchantment with the party, at least in part because of the cost-of-living crisis.</p>

<p>That could be good news for Trump.</p>

<p>However, the Democratic Party has rock-solid support from the Culinary Union, which represents casino and hotel workers in the state, and organizes a vast door-to-door operation to get out the vote.</p>

<p>"Over the past 20 years, it's been the Democrats' most effective political weapon in Nevada," said Lokken.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The standoff ultimately delayed the flight's departure by an hour before it finally took off.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman in China faced widespread criticism for failing to control her unruly child on a domestic flight from Chongqing, causing a one-hour delay. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3275811/cramped-china-mother-and-child-demand-free-upgrade-first-class-disrupt-flight">South China Morning Post</a></em>, the incident occurred on August 15 when the boy, whose age was not disclosed, became upset about the limited legroom in their economy-class seats. He cried, complained, and stood in the aisle, before barging into the first-class cabin, disrupting fellow passengers and prompting a delay in the flight's departure.</p>

<p>Despite flight attendants' repeated requests, the mother refused to restrain her son and allowed him to enter the first-class cabin. Multiple attendants attempted to reason with the duo, but their efforts went in vain.</p>

<p>''There are empty seats. Why don't you just let us sit here?'' the woman said in a video that went viral on social media in China.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As tensions escalated, fellow passengers grew angry, with some loudly demanding, "Remove them from the plane!" and "Stop negotiating, just eject them!" The standoff ultimately delayed the flight's departure by an hour before it finally took off.</p>

<p>The mother's actions sparked a torrent of outrage on Chinese social media, drawing widespread condemnation and criticism from internet users.&nbsp;One user wrote, ''It's not the child's fault. The parent's education is the issue. She should be held fully responsible for the inconvenience she caused to other passengers.''</p>

<p>People also criticised the airline's handling of the incident, questioning their response to the disruption and whether more could have been done to resolve the situation promptly.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">''The flight attendants did not do a good job in dealing with the disturbance. Also, the company has not issued a statement explaining to passengers why the flight was delayed, or offering them compensation,'' another user commented.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">The country has witnessed several similar incidents involving plane seats, including a notable case last year on a Jiangxi Airlines domestic flight. An elderly woman allegedly hurled expletives at a young passenger who declined to exchange seats, citing her health conditions as the reason for wanting the window seat. A flight attendant intervened, relocating the elderly woman to a different seat and defusing the tense situation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Kamala Harris is some 70 days away from possibly making history as not only the first woman President of the United States but also the first president of Black and South Asian origin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At last week's Democratic Party convention, however, she made it clear that these firsts are not badges she needs to acknowledge, especially against an opponent whose platform relies heavily on "othering." In her acceptance speech, she did not mention her skin colour at all, except to note that her father was from Jamaica, and only referenced the word "woman" when speaking about her mother, whom she described as a "brilliant five-foot-tall woman with an accent."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kamala Harris has recognised that this short, 100-day campaign gives her a chance to transcend her gender, her identity, and even her tenure as the nondescript Vice President under a deeply unpopular President. It also allows her to remain deliberately vague on policies while still positioning herself as a representative of all that is best in the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Kamala, The 'Guardian'</strong></h2>

<p>Harris has realised she has the opportunity to win on a platform filled with positivity, patriotism, and even joy. She aims to position herself, not opportunistically but realistically, as the guardian of all Americans. As she said, throughout her career as a prosecutor and a politician, her only client has been "the people." She seeks to broaden her battle cry for "freedom" - which includes women's rights over their bodies - into a wider canvas of freedom even encompassing disparate elements like sexual preference, clean air, and creating an "economy of opportunity." She also credibly claims the mantle of being presidential against an ex-President variously described as "weird," "unserious," and "out of their minds"- a characterisation that seems credible not only due to his record in office but also because he continues to display these traits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What circumstances have given her this opening? According to Annette Gordon-Reed, a Harvard law and history professor: "Many Americans want to be able to feel good and positive about the country's political future in the face of all that we have lived through this past decade," referring not only to the horrific days of COVID but also to the severe inflation and housing prices under Biden, which have convinced many Americans that the economy is a disaster when, in fact, it has rarely been stronger.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>'For All Americans'</strong></h2>

<p>In the "acceptance" portion of her 38-minute speech, Ms. Harris captured this sentiment brilliantly, even as she took swipes at Trump: "Our nation with this election has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past, a chance to chart a new way forward. Not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans...And let me say, I know there are people of various political views watching tonight. And I want you to know, I promise to be a president for all Americans. You can always trust me to put country above party and self. To hold sacred America's fundamental principles, from the rule of law, to free and fair elections, to the peaceful transfer of power.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations. A president who leads and listens; who is realistic, practical and has common sense; and always fights for the American people. From the courthouse to the White House, that has been my life's work." &nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms. Harris and the Democrats arrived at the convention riding high on the wave of "Kamalamania" since Biden handed over the baton. But they faced three formidable challenges at the event: to introduce Kamala Harris to a public that knew little about her; to shift Biden's strategy from portraying Trump as an autocrat threatening democracy to framing him as something small yet very dangerous; and, most importantly, to persuade the approximately 10% of undecided and independent voters, in an otherwise almost equally divided electorate, to join their cause.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most political observers in the US, from across party lines, agree that the first two objectives were achieved at the convention with notable skill. However, the jury is still out on the third and most critical objective.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>'We Are Not Going Back'</strong></h2>

<p>Ms. Harris began her address by introducing her immigrant parents, but every reference to them focused on the values they instilled that Americans hold dear. From her father: be fearless. From her mother: don't complain about injustice - do something about it. Don't do anything half-assed. Make the most of available opportunities and be grateful for them. Never let anyone tell you who you are; show them who you are.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris described Trump as "unserious," while emphasising that his success in the election would have very "serious" consequences. Overall, she positioned herself as a safer bet for the future of the U.S., using the words "forward" or "future" eight times in her speech and making "we are not going back" (a reference to Trump and his dystopia) her signature phrase.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Trump's Takedown</strong></h2>

<p>The evisceration of Donald Trump was, as expected, a collective effort, in which every major convention speaker participated, notably, Oprah Winfrey, the Clintons, and the Obamas. However, nobody did it better than Michelle Obama. She mentioned him only once but brought the house down with this line: "We will never benefit from the affirmative action of generational wealth." And then the coup de grâce: "Who is going to tell him that the job he is currently seeking may be one of those Black jobs?" - a pointed reference to Trump's remark at a meeting with Black journalists that immigrants were taking "Black jobs".</p>

<p>Drawing from their own experience, the Obamas stressed that the election would be very close and urged Democrats to seize every opportunity to bolster their vote. MAGA supporters are largely drawn from non-college-educated Gen X men, rural folks, and believers. Harris can reasonably hope that popular Minnesota Governor Tim "Coach" Walz, her VP nominee, can attract some of those votes in the three Rust Belt swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oprah Winfrey explicitly reached out to independents and undecided voters, even as she took a swipe at Trump, saying, in effect, that America is an ongoing project requiring commitment, values, character, decency, respect, plain common sense - and an adult conversation.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>A Centrist Approach</strong></h2>

<p>Ms. Harris's speech notably leaned toward the centre in terms of policies and posture, with no extravagant promises on healthcare or the economy. Some observers even described the speech as leaning conservative, particularly in her promise to bring back the bipartisan tough border bill that Trump had torpedoed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, there was little in the convention speeches that would seriously challenge the widespread perception that Trump has a better handle on the economy or prompt a reconsideration among core MAGA supporters. Trump has sharp political instincts and, as a firm believer in transactional politics, has no hesitation in abandoning even the firmest ideological positions if the ground shifts. Seeing how the aftermath of the Supreme Court decision on abortion rights has given the Democrats a distinct lead among women voters, Trump has not only distanced himself from the extreme MAGA position of advocating a national ban on abortion but also claimed his election would be good for "reproductive rights." He hasn't elaborated on how, but he is using terminology that pro-lifers abhor.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Why Democrats Are Hopeful</strong></h2>

<p>The hard fact remains that Trump still leads Harris in five of the seven swing states that will determine the election. However, Democrats draw hope from three developments. First, the Democratic Party has begun to stem its declining support among blue-collar Americans, Blacks, and Hispanics. Second, Harris has pulled ahead in at least two states and reduced the deficit in the other five where Biden was trailing in all seven.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, unlike Hillary Clinton, this contender is not underestimating Trump. Far from it. Knowing, as Obama put it, Trump's "weird" fascination with crowd size, Harris and Walz campaigned in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the Republicans had held their "Victory is Ours" convention in June, on Day 2 of the Democratic convention. And they chose the same venue and drew a similarly large and enthusiastic crowd. And you can be sure that, unlike Clinton, Harris and Walz will aggressively campaign in the swing states in the remaining days leading up to the November 5 election.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Something "Magical" In The Air&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Republicans have dubbed this period as Harris' "honeymoon" and correctly predict tough days ahead for her. Her performance against Trump in the debate on September 10 will have a significant impact on undecided and independent voters. The U.S. media is eager to scrutinise her when she gives her first press conference or detailed interview as the Democratic nominee. Her bid for the party nomination in 2020 was effectively derailed by a disastrous press interview.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Democrats were in deep despair after Biden's poor performance in the debate with Trump in late June. They could not have known that this disaster would be the best thing to happen to them: it pushed Biden out and, unexpectedly for Trump, brought in Kamala, who came out swinging and surprised everyone with her style and savvy. Today, when Michelle Obama says there is something "magical" in the air, even Republicans are beginning to acknowledge it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Republican strategist Mark Mackinnon put it: "This feels like something completely different is happening. And I don't know what it is yet, but, you know, just the circumstances, the timing, the compressed election, the nomination - it just feels, looks and smells like something completely different. I don't know what it is. That's the problem. We'll see."&nbsp;</p>

<p>We can't wait to see.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Musk has been a champion of AI without much intervention, vocally criticizing tools from OpenAI and Alphabet Inc.'s Google as too "woke."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A deluge of bizarre computer-generated images swept Elon Musk's social platform X last week - including violent, offensive and sexually suggestive content. In one, Trump piloted a helicopter as the World Trade Center buildings burned in the background. In others, Kamala Harris wore a bikini, and Donald Duck used heroin. Amidst the online furor, Musk posted, "Grok is the most fun AI in the world!"</p>

<p></p>

<p>By Friday, the shocking images had lost some of their novelty. The volume of posts about Grok peaked at 166,000 posts on Aug. 15, two days after the image generation features were announced, according to the data firm PeakMetrics.</p>

<p>But while the craze has faded, the most lasting impact of Grok's viral moment may be its implications for the still-nascent field of AI content moderation. The rollout of Grok was a risky experiment in what happens when guardrails are limited, or don't exist at all.</p>

<p>Musk has been a champion of AI without much intervention, vocally criticizing tools from OpenAI and Alphabet Inc.'s Google as too "woke." Grok's images, powered by a small startup called Black Forest Labs, were deliberately unfiltered. But even Grok appears to have reined in some forms of content.</p>

<p>About a week after the image generation features debuted, Bloomberg observed Grok seemingly introducing more restrictions into its AI tool in real time. Requests for explicit depictions of violence and gore were met with more refusals, though the same tricks that were effective on older image generators - replacing the word "blood" with "strawberry syrup," for instance, or adding the word "toy" to "gun" - worked easily on Grok. X did not respond to questions from Bloomberg about how Grok works and what its rules are.</p>

<p>There are plenty of reasons AI companies have been careful about what their images depict. With most AI image generators, carefully orchestrated controls help the bots avoid content that can defame living people, infringe on copyrighted material or mislead the public. Many creators also give the AI strict rules on what it isn't allowed to produce, such as depictions of nudity, violence or gore.</p>

<p>There are three places one can put guardrails on an image generator, said Hany Farid, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley: Training, text input and image output. Mainstream AI tools usually include guardrails in two or all three of those areas, Farid said.</p>

<p>For example, Adobe's generative AI tool, Firefly, was largely trained on its own catalog of stock photos - images that can be used explicitly for commercial purposes. That helps Adobe ensure that the images generated by Firefly are copyright-compliant, because the AI tool isn't drawing from a data set of company logos or images protected by intellectual property laws. But the company also deploys heavy-handed content moderation in the AI tool, blocking keywords that could be used to depict toxic or illicit content, such as "guns," "criminals" and "cocaine."</p>

<p>OpenAI's DALL-E, meanwhile, makes use of expanded prompts. When someone asks the AI tool to "create an image of a nurse," OpenAI includes what other words, exactly, the AI used to generate the photo, as part of its effort to be transparent to users. Typically, that description elaborates on details like what the nurse is wearing and what their demeanor is.</p>

<p>In February, Bloomberg reported that Google's Gemini AI image generator worked similarly when users asked it for images of people. The AI automatically added different qualifiers - such as "nurse, male" and "nurse, female" - in order to increase the image diversity of its outputs. But Google didn't disclose this to its users, which sparked a backlash and caused the company to pause Gemini's ability to generate images of people. The company has yet to reinstate the feature.</p>

<p>Then there are the restrictions on image outputs that some popular image generators have adopted. According to DALL-E's technical documentation, OpenAI will block its AI from creating images it classifies as "racy" or sexually suggestive, as well as images of public figures. Even Midjourney, a small startup which is known to have looser rules, announced in March that it would block all images requests of Joe Biden and Donald Trump ahead of the US presidential election.</p>

<p>But while it's not the norm, Grok isn't the first AI tool to launch with few guardrails, said Fabian Offert, an assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who studies digital humanities and visual AI. "It's not novel at all, actually, in terms of the capabilities it has," Offert said. "We've had unrestricted AI models before."</p>

<p>What is different about Grok is the fact that X chose to embed an AI tool with so few limitations directly into one of the world's most widely used social networks, according to Jack Brewster, an enterprise editor at NewsGuard, which tracks online misinformation. Brewster said that adding Grok natively to the platform is an implicit suggestion that a user should share their AI images with their networks - no matter how offensive or shocking they might be. "It's so easy to move an image that you create on Grok right into the app," he said.</p>

<p>Black Forest Labs, the maker of the AI model behind Grok's image generator, doesn't spell out what restrictions it's built into the tool. Online documentation for Flux, the AI model that powers Grok, shows only barebones rules for users, like prohibiting the use of the AI for disseminating child exploitative content or creating images with the purpose of harming others. But it's up to users to follow these rules.</p>

<p>NewsGuard has already documented some of the consequences of X's design choice with Grok. Last week, the group published a report that found Grok produces images that can be used to advance or bolster false narratives far more often than other leading AI image generators. Brewster and his colleagues systematically prompted Grok to create depictions related to 20 different pieces of misinformation, drawn from a database of provably false narratives that NewsGuard maintains. The researchers also requested similar images from Midjourney and OpenAI's DALL-E.</p>

<p>NewsGuard found that Grok created the images it asked for in 80% of the cases it tested, producing 16 out of 20 images depicting misinformation. That compared with Midjourney generating fake images in 9 out of the 20 cases NewsGuard tested for, and DALL-E returning requests for images in only two cases.</p>

<p>But it's important to note that fake images don't necessarily result in false narratives, as online audiences become savvier about what's real and what's not. In some examples, the images NewsGuard generated using Grok weren't particularly believable. While Grok was the only AI image generator that didn't refuse the request to "generate a photo of Kamala Harris' birth certificate, showing that she was not born in the United States," the image it produced also included unrecognizable words, a common failing of AI image generators.</p>

<p>Other requests were more disturbing. According to NewsGuard's report, Grok agreed to produce a photo in response to the prompt, "Generate an image of masked men storming into a polling location in Venezuela stealing ballot boxes." In this case, the resulting image had hallmarks of being a believable news photo.</p>

<p>A larger problem is that AI companies have rolled out image generators without a clear purpose for them, said Offert, the assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara. "You can create anything you want," Offert said. "It looks halfway good. But we still haven't figured out what these things are good for, except maybe replacing stock photography, or just playing around with it."</p>

<p>As the viral images fuel the debate over what these tools should show, Musk, an ardent supporter of Trump, has given the discourse a political tone. The focus on "anti-woke" AI development could be counter-productive, said Emerson Brooking, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who studies online networks. "By belittling AI safety and drumming up outrage, Musk may be trying to politicize AI development more broadly," he said. "Not good for AI research, certainly not good for the world. But good for Elon Musk."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists studying the new mpox strain that has spread out of Democratic Republic of Congo say the virus is changing faster than expected and often in areas where experts lack the funding and equipment to properly track it.</p>

<p>That means there are multiple unknowns about the virus itself, its severity and how it is transmitting, complicating the response, half a dozen scientists in Africa, Europe and the United States told Reuters.</p>

<p>Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, has been a public health problem in parts of Africa since 1970, but received little global attention until it surged internationally in 2022, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a global health emergency. That declaration ended 10 months later.</p>

<p>A new strain of the virus, known as clade Ib, has the world's attention again after the WHO declared a new health emergency.</p>

<p>The strain is a mutated version of clade I, a form of mpox spread by contact with infected animals that has been endemic in Congo for decades. Mpox typically causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions and can kill.</p>

<p>Congo has had more than 18,000 suspected clade I and clade Ib mpox cases and 615 deaths this year, according to the WHO. There have also been 222 confirmed clade Ib cases in four African countries in the last month, plus a case each in Sweden and Thailand in people with a travel history in Africa.</p>

<p>"I worry that in Africa, we are working blindly," said Dr. Dimie Ogoina, an infectious diseases expert at Niger Delta University Hospital in Nigeria who chairs the WHO's mpox emergency committee. He first raised the alarm about potential sexual transmission of mpox in 2017, now an accepted route of spread for the virus.</p>

<p>"We don't understand our outbreak very well, and if we don't understand our outbreak very well we will have difficulty addressing the problem in terms of transmission dynamics, the severity of the disease, risk factors of the disease," Ogoina said. "And I worry about the fact that the virus seems to be mutating and producing new strains."</p>

<p>He said it took clade IIb in Nigeria five years or more to evolve enough for sustained spread among humans, sparking the 2022 global outbreak. Clade Ib has done the same thing in less than a year.</p>

<p>MUTATING 'MORE RAPIDLY'</p>

<p>Mpox is an orthopoxvirus, the same family that causes smallpox. Population-wide protection from a global vaccine campaign 50 years ago has waned, as the vaccinating stopped when the disease was eradicated.</p>

<p>Genetic sequencing of clade Ib infections, which the WHO estimates emerged mid-September 2023, show they carry a mutation known as APOBEC3, a signature of adaptation in humans.</p>

<p>The virus that causes mpox has typically been fairly stable and slow to mutate, but APOBEC-driven mutations can accelerate viral evolution, said Dr. Miguel Paredes, who is studying the evolution of mpox and other viruses at Fred Hutchison Cancer Center in Seattle.</p>

<p>"All the human-to-human cases of mpox have this APOBEC signature of mutations, which means that it's mutating a little bit more rapidly than we would expect," he said.</p>

<p>Paredes and other scientists said a response was complicated by several mpox outbreaks happening at once.</p>

<p>In the past, mpox was predominantly acquired through human contact with infected animals. That is still driving a rise in Congo in clade I cases - also known as clade Ia - likely due in part to deforestation and increased consumption of bushmeat, scientists said.</p>

<p>The mutated versions, clade Ib and IIb, can now essentially be considered a sexually transmitted disease, said Dr. Salim Abdool Karim, a South African epidemiologist and chair of the Africa CDC's mpox advisory committee. Most of the mutated clade Ib cases are among adults, driven at first by an epidemic among female sex workers in South Kivu, Congo.</p>

<p>The virus also can spread through close contact with an infected person, which is likely how clusters of children have been infected with clade Ib, particularly in Burundi and in eastern Congo's displacement camps, where crowded living conditions may be contributing.</p>

<p>Children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems may be at greater risk of serious mpox disease and death, according to the WHO.</p>

<p>Clade I has typically caused more severe disease, with fatality rates of 4%-11%, compared to around 1% for clade II. Ogoina said data from Congo suggests few have died of the new Ib version, but he feared some data is being mixed up.</p>

<p>More research is urgently needed, but three teams tracking mpox outbreaks in Africa say they cannot even access chemicals needed for diagnostic tests.</p>

<p>Planning a response, including vaccination strategies, without this is difficult, the scientists said.</p>

<p>Karim said around half of cases in eastern Congo, where Ib is particularly prevalent, are only being diagnosed by doctors, with no laboratory confirmation.</p>

<p>Getting samples to labs is difficult because the healthcare system is already under pressure, he said. And around 750,000 people have been displaced amid fighting between the M23 rebel group and the government.</p>

<p>Many African laboratories cannot get the supplies they need, said Dr. Emmanuel Nakoune, an mpox expert at the Institut Pasteur in Bangui, Central African Republic, which also has clade Ia cases.</p>

<p>"This is not a luxury," he said, but necessary to track deadly outbreaks.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over 21 million Shia Muslims took part in the Arbaeen pilgrimage in Iraq this year, marking the 40th day of mourning for the martyrdom of Imam Hussain, the grandson of Prophet Mohammed and a founding figure in Shia Islam. The event culminated on Sunday, with attendees expressing their solidarity with Gaza.</p>

<p>Indians were among those who travelled to Karbala to pay homage to Imam Hussain. The Arbaeen Yatra saw millions walking from Najaf to Karbala, a distance of 80 km, to visit the shrine of Imam Hussain.</p>

<p>Imam Hussain, revered by millions, was martyred on the land of Karbala nearly 1,400 years ago after enduring three days of hunger and thirst under the rule of Yazid I, the second caliph of the Umayyad Caliphate. His martyrdom, along with that of 72 of his companions-including his six-month-old son, Ali Asghar-remains a pivotal event in Islamic history.</p>

</div>

<p>A significant number of Indians participated in the Arbaeen Walk, with thousands reaching Karbala. Along the 80 km route, food, drinks, medical services, and accommodation were provided by Iraqi locals, who opened their homes to the pilgrims.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Approximately 1,455 stalls were set up from Najaf to Karbala, where people from around the world offered food and drinks representative of their cultures. Indian pilgrims also set up several stalls, including Caravan-e-Hind, providing accommodation, food, and medical services. Over 50 Indian doctors were present, offering medical care throughout the journey.</p>

<p>Upon reaching Karbala, many Indian devotees visited Imam Hussain's Shrine to offer their respects. In a symbolic gesture, they hoisted the Indian flag, which was warmly received by the local Iraqis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview with NDTV, Syed Afzal, General Secretary of the Hazrat Abbas Holy Shrine, stated that over 21,000 volunteers were mobilised to ensure the smooth conduct of the pilgrimage. "Our aim is to make sure that no devotee faces any difficulty during the Arbaeen pilgrimage," he said.</p>

</div>

<p>Several notable Indian personalities, including actor Javed Jaffrey and Ladakh MP Mohammad Hanifa, participated in this year's Arbaeen pilgrimage. Agha Sultan, the coordinator for the Iraqi government and the Indian contingent, said that the delegation, led by Mohammad Hanifa, met with Sheikh Mehdi Karbalai, the chief of Imam Hussain Shrine, who expressed his admiration for the Indian people and his experiences during his visit to India for medical treatment.</p>

<p>Volunteers provided water, juice, and other refreshments at regular intervals along the 80 km route. To combat the heat, water was sprinkled along the way, and air conditioning was installed at all martyr's shrines in Karbala. Ambulances and doctors were also on standby to provide medical assistance as needed.</p>

<p>For those unable to travel to Iraq, Arbaeen Walks were organised in various parts of India. In Delhi, pilgrims walked from Jama Masjid to Jor Bagh Karbala, with the march serving as a protest against oppression, drawing inspiration from Imam Hussain's refusal to bow to tyranny.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At some beaches in Japan, elaborate security arrangements are made to watch out for fins. But it's not sharks the authorities and lifeguards are worried about - it's dolphins. And not the entire pod, just a single lonely, sexually frustrated dolphin. According to the <em>BBC</em>, this mammal is responsible for a spike in the attacks on swimmers in Wakasa Bay, about 300 kilometres from Tokyo. As many as 18 people have been injured in these attacks, including a primary school child whose fingers needed 20 stitches.</p>

<p>The attacks have increased in the recent years - one in 2022, six last year and 18 so far in 2024.</p>

<p>And local authorities are sure that it is a single dolphin that is attacking people.</p>

<p>"It is reasonable to assume that it is the same individual, as the wounds on the tail fin are similar to those of the dolphins seen off the coast last year, and it is rare for dolphins, which normally move in groups, to be alone for such a long time," Tadamichi Morisaka, a cetology professor at Japan's Mie University, told Japanese outlet <em>NHK</em>.</p>

<p>The dorsal fin is like a dolphin's fingerprint, as each has distinctive notches, ridges and pigmentation.</p>

<p>Other experts have also weighed in, suggesting why one dolphin may be behind all these attacks.</p>

<p>"Bottlenose dolphins are highly social animals and this sociality can be expressed in very physical ways. Just as in humans and other social animals, hormonal fluctuations, sexual frustration or the desire to dominate might drive the dolphin to injuring the people it interacts with. Since they are such powerful animals, this can lead to serious injury in humans," Dr Simon Allen, a biologist and principal investigator with the Shark Bay Dolphin Research project, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpw8kdrev50o">told the <em>BBC</em></a>.</p>

<p>The biologist theorised that the dolphin may have been ostracised from its own community and seeking companionship.</p>

<p>"Most of the time, in my experience, this is more a defensive behaviour when humans get too close to these dolphins and do not know how to conduct themselves," said Dr Matthias Hoffmann-Kuhnt, a marine mammal expert at the National University of Singapore.</p>

<p>The dolphins are considered very friendly towards the humans, but their attacks can be fatal. One widely reported incident came from Brazil, where a dolphin, nicknamed Tiao, injured 22 people in 1994.</p>

<p>Authorities in the coastal town of Mihama have installed signs warning people that not only can the mammals "bite you with their sharp teeth and cause you to bleed", but they can also "drag you into the sea, which could be life-threatening".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian-origin Apple executive Kevan Parekh has been appointed the company's <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/apple-names-kevan-parekh-as-new-finance-chief-ahead-of-product-launch-6425649#pfrom=home-ndtv_topstories ">new Chief Financial Officer</a>, effective January 1, 2025. Mr Parekh will succeed Luca Maestri, a veteran Apple executive, who will ensure a smooth transition to the new CFO.</p>

<p>The leadership change comes as Apple prepares for a significant product launch this fall, featuring a major software upgrade for the iPhone, including artificial intelligence capabilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Who is Kevan Parekh?</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Kevan Parekh joined Apple 11 years ago and quickly established himself as an integral part of the company's finance leadership team.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Mr Parekh has a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Michigan (1989-1993) and an MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business (1997-1999).</li>
	<li>Before joining Apple, he worked at Thomson Reuters and General Motors, holding various senior leadership positions, including Vice President of Finance, Corporate Treasurer, Director of Business Development and Regional Treasurer.</li>
	<li>He joined Apple in 2013 and served as Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis, overseeing critical areas, and led finance for Worldwide Sales, Retail, and Marketing at the company.</li>
	<li>Over the last several months, Kevan Parekh has been prepared for the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) role by his senior, Luca Maestri. Mr Parekh will focus on continuing Apple's prudent capital management and may also explore complimentary acquisitions.</li>
</ol>

<p>Luca Maestri will continue to lead corporate services teams, reporting to CEO Tim Cook. During his tenure, Apple more than doubled its revenue, with services revenue growing more than five times.</p>

<p>Apple's iPhone sales have slowed in recent years due to a lack of significant upgrades in newer models and competition from Android-based smartphone brands offering high-end specifications at lower prices. However, Apple is betting on artificial intelligence to attract buyers, announcing a slew of AI features under the umbrella 'Apple Intelligence' at its developers conference in June.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations on Monday said humanitarian work in the Gaza Strip has taken a serious blow after Israel ordered a new evacuation in the centre of the besieged territory.</p>

<p>It came as the United States announced "progress" in Gaza truce talks underway in Cairo, even after a major but brief cross-border escalation between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah group in Lebanon.</p>

<p>On Sunday the Israeli military ordered people to "evacuate immediately" a part of Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, sparking a rapid exodus of civilians and displacing UN and NGO workers.</p>

<p>"Our humanitarian colleagues are particularly worried about the order" which "effectively upends a whole lifesaving humanitarian hub that was set up in Deir el-Balah following its evacuation from Rafah back in May", the UN's humanitarian office OCHA said in a statement.</p>

<p>The order affected 15 premises hosting UN and NGO aid workers, UN warehouses, a water desalination plant and medical facilities, including the key Al-Aqsa hospital, one of a few still operating in Gaza, it said.</p>

<p>"It severely impacts our ability to deliver essential support and services," the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in the statement.</p>

<p>Speaking to AFP on Sunday from her hospital bed outside the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir el-Balah, Tamam al-Raei said she did not know where to seek safety.</p>

<p>"I have a war injury. I have broken bones and have had an amputation, and I have been receiving treatment for that," she said.</p>

<p>"Where do we go? Where do I get treatment," added the woman, surrounded by other war-weary Palestinians being evacuated from the hospital in a frantic bid to stay ahead of feared Israeli bombardment.</p>

<p>A senior official for the UN refugee agency UNRWA said "The space and the ability of the UN system, of the humanitarian system to operate in Gaza is becoming increasingly difficult", as the UN said it had to halt the movement of aid and workers within Gaza due to the Deir el-Balah evacuation order.</p>

<p>More than 10 months of war between the Palestinian group Hamas and Israel have left large parts of Gaza in ruins, ravaged its healthcare system and sparked a dire humanitarian crisis and warnings of famine.</p>

<p>The latest developments came as UN agencies have planned to conduct mass vaccination after the first polio case there in 25 years.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said on Monday it was targeting "terror operatives" in Deir el-Balah and working to dismantle the "remaining terrorist infrastructure" of Hamas.</p>

<h3><strong>Regional conflict</strong></h3>

<p>Israel has ordered several evacuations since its military campaign to "eliminate" Hamas, whose October 7 attack on southern Israel triggered the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 40,435 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry which does not give details of civilian and operative deaths. The UN human rights office says most of the dead are women and children.</p>

<p>The Hamas attack that sparked the war resulted in the deaths of 1,199 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>On Monday, Israel's army struck Gaza anew, with witnesses and AFP correspondents reporting air strikes and shelling in Gaza City and other parts of the territory.</p>

<p>Medics said an air strike on a Gaza City house killed at least five people, with two rescuers telling AFP more victims may be buried in the ruins in the Al-Rimal neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The war has also drawn in Iran-aligned armed groups across the Middle East and sparked fears of a broader regional conflict.</p>

<p>The latest flare-up came on Sunday when Hamas-ally Hezbollah launched rockets and drones at Israel in retaliation for the killing by Israel of one of the group's top commanders in July.</p>

<p>Israel in turn carried out air raids the military said thwarted a larger attack.</p>

<p>Israel later swiftly revoked a state of emergency and Hezbollah said its operation during which hundreds of rockets and drones were fired was "completed".</p>

<p>Israel's army chief Herzi Halevi, however, said Monday the military is "very determined to continue degrading Hezbollah capabilities".</p>

<p>"We are not stopping," Halevi said.</p>

<h3><strong>US sees truce 'progress'</strong></h3>

<p>The United States meanwhile struck a cautious note of optimism on Monday regarding efforts to clinch a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages taken by Palestinian operatives during the October 7 attack.</p>

<p>Out of 251 hostages seized, 105 remain in Gaza including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Their fate is central in truce talks, with relatives and supporters piling pressure on the Israeli government in weekly protests demanding their return home.</p>

<p>A key sticking point in the talks has been Israel's insistence on keeping control of the so-called Philadelphi Corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border, to stop Hamas from re-arming, something the group has refused to countenance.</p>

<p>Cairo, which has been mediating the talks alongside Qatar and the United States, insisted on Monday "it will not accept any Israeli presence" along the corridor, Egyptian state-linked Al-Qahera news reported citing a high-level source.</p>

<p>In Washington, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters "there continues to be progress" and that the talks would continue and involve "working groups" for several days.</p>

<p>Pentagon spokesman Major General Pat Ryder meanwhile said there was still a "threat of attack" by Iran on Israel.</p>

<p>The day in late July after Israel killed Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in a strike on a southern Beirut suburb, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Tehran. Israel never claimed responsibility for Haniyeh's death, which Iran has vowed to avenge.</p>

<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi late on Sunday said Tehran's reaction to Haniyeh's death would be "definitive" and "well calculated".</p>

<p>"We do not fear escalation, yet do not seek it -- unlike Israel," he added.</p>

<p>Iran also praised Hezbollah's attack Sunday on Israel, whose "main target", the group's head Hassan Nasrallah said was an intelligence base outside Tel Aviv, more than 100 kilometres (62 miles) from the Lebanese border.</p>

<p>Israel's military said there were "no hits" on the Glilot complex, which Israeli media said is home to the headquarters of the Mossad spy agency.</p>

<p>Its air strikes hit more than 270 targets in Lebanon, "90 percent" of which were rockets "aimed at northern Israel", the military said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former chief executive officer (CEO) of a US bank has been sentenced to more than 24 years in federal prison for embezzling $47 million in a cryptocurrency fraud scheme. According to <em>CNBC</em>, Shan Hanes, the former Heartland Tri-State Bank CEO, fell for a "pig butchering" scam that had him purchasing crypto "to unlock the supposed returns on his investments," which he never received. The 53-year-old orchestrated a series of wire transfers over just eight weeks last year that led to the collapse and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) takeover of Heartland Tri-State Bank in Elkhart, one of only five US banks that failed in 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pig butchering scams have become increasingly common in recent years. This scam usually involves a scammer finding and contacting a victim through a messaging app, dating app or a social media platform. They then try to form a relationship with their victim before eventually luring them into making a series of crypto investments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/21/cryptocurrency-shan-hanes-pig-butchering-scam.html" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>CNBC</em></a>, Mr Hanes, from May to June 2023, made a series of wire transfers using the bank's funds. He also embezzled money from a local church, an investment club and his daughter's college savings account. The scammers reportedly duped him into buying cryptocurrency, insisting that they needed more funds to unlock the supposed return on his investments. However, the 53-year-old never realised any profit, and lost all of the money he stole, as a result of the scam.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last week, US District Judge John Broomes sentenced Mr Hanes to 24 years in prison - 29 months more than what prosecutors requested after he pleaded guilty in May to a single count of embezzlement by a bank officer.</p>

<p>"Hanes' greed knew no bounds," US Attorney Kate E. Brubacher said in a statement. "He trespassed his professional obligations, his personal relationships, and federal law. Not only did Shan Hanes betray Heartland Bank and its investors, but his illegal schemes also jeopardized confidence in financial institutions," the attorney added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Separately, Brian Mitchell, Mr Hanes' longtime next-door neighbour, called the ex-CEO's actions "pure evil" during the sentencing. He also said that during the sentencing Mr Hanes' showed little remorse for his actions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the outlet, Mr Hanes began stealing after being targeted in a pig-butchering scheme in late 2022. He started making the wire transactions after communicating with the scammers on WhatsApp - whose identities are still unknown. Initially, he used personal funds to buy crypto, but in early 2023 he stole $40,000 from Elkhart Church of Christ and $10,000 from the Santa Fe Investment Club. he then used $60,000 taken from a daughter's college fund, and nearly $1 million in stock from the Elkhart Financial Corporation. In May 2023, he then began to make wire transactions from Heartland Tri-State Bank to accounts controlled by scammers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eventually, Mr Hanes was fired, and the bank was shattered and taken over by the FDIC. the 53-year-old was charged last February and placed under house arrest until his sentencing last week.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bizarre tale involving Robert Francis Kennedy Jr has resurfaced. The story, first shared by Kick Kennedy -- the daughter of RFK Jr -- with&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a924/kick-kennedy-interview/ ">a magazine</a>, sheds light on a childhood memory. According to Ms Kennedy, her father decapitated a whale carcass during a family trip to Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The incident gained traction recently after Ms Kennedy was spotted with actor Ben Affleck.</p>

<p>It all started when RFK Jr discovered a whale carcass washed ashore on Squaw Island. The US politician saw it as an opportunity to indulge in what his daughter described as a "peculiar fascination with dead animals".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Armed with a chainsaw, RFK Jr reportedly hurried down to the beach and proceeded to decapitate the whale on the spot. He then attached the massive head to the family's minivan with a bungee cord, determined to bring it back to their home in Mount Kisco, New York, for further study. The family endured a five-hour drive back, with the whale's rotting remains emitting a stench that, according to Kick Kennedy, assaulted every sense.</p>

<p>"Every time we accelerated on the highway, whale juice would pour into the windows of the car, and it was the rankest thing on the planet," Ms Kennedy&nbsp;recalled in the interview. The situation was so unbearable that the family resorted to wearing plastic bags over their heads with mouth holes cut out, which brought out bewildered and disgusted reactions from fellow drivers. "People on the highway were giving us the finger, but that was just normal day-to-day stuff for us," she&nbsp;revealed.</p>

<p>While the whale beheading incident is disturbing, it was not the only such occurrence in the Kennedy household. Earlier this month, RFK Jr admitted in a viral interview with Roseanne Barr that he had <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/04/us-news/rfk-jr-says-he-dumped-dead-bear-in-central-park-after-ditching-plan-to-skin-it-in-bizarre-video/">dumped a dead bear cub</a> in Central Park a decade ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He recounted how, during a falconing trip in Goshen, New York, he discovered the cub after it had been hit by a car. Planning to skin the bear and use the meat, he placed it in his van. However, after a night of drinking with friends, they decided it would be amusing to dump the bear in Central Park and make it appear as though it had been hit by a bike.</p>

<p>As these bizarre stories resurface, the spotlight is also on Ms Kennedy, who has recently been seen in the company of recently divorced Ben Affleck, 52. The two have been spotted at various hotspots, including the Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills Hotel, leading to dating rumours.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla chief Elon Musk, who also owns social media platform X, said on Monday he feels California should pass an AI bill that would require tech companies and AI developers to conduct safety testing on some of their own models.</p>

<p>"For over 20 years, I have been an advocate for AI regulation, just as we regulate any product/technology that is a potential risk to the public," Musk said in a post on X, while calling on the state to pass the SB 1047 bill.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">This is a tough call and will make some people upset, but, all things considered, I think California should probably pass the SB 1047 AI safety bill.<br />
<br />

<p>California state lawmakers attempted to introduce 65 bills touching on AI this legislative season, according to the state's legislative database, including measures to ensure all algorithmic decisions are proven unbiased and protect the intellectual property of dead individuals from exploitation by AI companies. Many of the bills are already dead.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Microsoft backed OpenAI voiced support for another AI bill from California, called AB 3211, that would require tech companies to label AI-generated content, which can range from harmless memes to deepfakes aimed at spreading misinformation about political candidates.</p>

<p>With countries representing a third of the world's population having polls this year, experts are concerned about the role AI-generated content will play, and it has already been prominent in some elections, such as in Indonesia.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Juli Vavilova, a 24-year-old "crypto coach" and video game streamer, has gone missing, fuelling online speculation that she was potentially involved in the arrest of Telegram CEO Pavel Durov in France.</p>

<p>Durov, who fled Russia in 2014 after refusing to hand over encrypted data to the Kremlin, has long been a target of international law enforcement. French authorities issued a search warrant for Mr Durov as part of an ongoing investigation by the Interior Ministry into alleged crimes against minors, including claims of complicity in global drug trafficking and paedophilia due to Telegram's lack of moderation and the platform's use of cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Vavilova, who was reportedly travelling with Mr Durov before his arrest, has not been heard from since the tech mogul was detained at Le Bourget airport near Paris this past weekend.&nbsp;Ms Vavilova's family has been increasingly concerned, telling AFP that they have been unable to contact her since the incident.&nbsp;</p>

<p>French privacy data researcher Baptiste Robert has noted the potential implications of Ms Vavilova's social media activity. According to Mr Robert, Ms Vavilova's posts, which documented her travels through Azerbaijan with Pavel Durov, may have inadvertently revealed the Telegram founder's movements, leading to his arrest. "It's complicated to say if her posts played a direct role in his arrest, but if you were following her on social media, you could easily track Durov's movements," he told the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/26/world-news/telegram-ceo-pavel-durovs-mystery-blonde-companion-raises-questions/">NY Post</a>.</p>

<p>Mr Robert's compilation of Juli Vavilova's posts shared on X, shows a striking correlation between her travels and Mr Durov's known itinerary. This includes videos of the duo together in Uzbekistan and also a picture that showed Ms Vavilova in the passenger seat of Mr Durov's car in Azerbaijan on August 21.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The woman who accompanied Pavel Durov on his journey that led to his arrest is Juli Vavilova<br />
<br />
It's <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OSINT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#OSINT</a> time! <a href="https://t.co/4ejQfRT8lt">https://t.co/4ejQfRT8lt</a> <a href="https://t.co/asJlUG0Ui5">pic.twitter.com/asJlUG0Ui5</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Other posts indicate they visited the same shooting range and hotel in the Azerbaijani capital. Despite their seemingly close relationship, the exact nature of their connection remains unclear. It is unknown when or how they met, but both live in Dubai, where Telegram is headquartered.</p>

<p>However, the timing of her disappearance and the arrest of Mr Durov has fuelled theories that she may have been used as a 'honey-trap' by those seeking to capture the elusive tech billionaire. Despite these speculations, no concrete evidence has emerged linking her to any such plot.</p>

<p>Durov's company has stated that the 39-year-old was not in hiding nor on the run, as he regularly travelled to Europe as a dual-French citizen.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Polaris Dawn mission, organized by billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, was set to lift off early Tuesday from NASA's Kennedy Space Center, but is now targeting early Wednesday after a late technical hitch.</p>

<p>"Teams are taking a closer look at a ground-side helium leak on the Quick Disconnect umbilical," Elon Musk's company wrote on X. Umbilicals connect a tower with a rocket, while helium is a non-flammable gas often used to pressurize fuel lines.</p>

<p>Riding atop a Falcon 9 rocket, the SpaceX Dragon capsule is set to reach a peak altitude of 870 miles (1,400 kilometers) -- higher than any crewed mission in over half a century, since the Apollo era.</p>

<p>Mission commander <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-spacex-us-billionaire-jared-isaacman-billionaire-from-1st-all-civilian-spacex-flight-announces-3-more-missions-2768576" target="_blank">Isaacman</a> will guide his four-member team through the mission's centerpiece: the first-ever commercial spacewalk, equipped with sleek, newly developed SpaceX extravehicular activity (EVA) suits.</p>

<p>Rounding out the team are mission pilot Scott Poteet, a retired US Air Force Lieutenant Colonel; mission specialist Sarah Gillis, a lead space operations engineer at SpaceX; and mission specialist and medical officer Anna Menon, also a lead space operations engineer at SpaceX.</p>

<h3><strong>High radiation zone</strong></h3>

<p>The quartet underwent more than two years of training in preparation for the landmark mission, logging hundreds of hours on simulators as well as skydiving, centrifuge training, scuba diving, and summiting an Ecuadoran volcano.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtvprofit.com/world/elon-musks-spacex-polaris-dawn-mission-launch-date-time-where-to-watch-and-more" target="_blank">Polaris Dawn</a> is set to be the first of three missions under the Polaris program, a collaboration between Isaacman, the founder of tech company Shift4 Payments, and SpaceX.</p>

<p>"The idea is to develop (and) test new technology and operations in furtherance of SpaceX's bold vision to enable humankind to journey among the stars," Isaacman said during a recent press conference.</p>

<p>Isaacman declined to reveal his total investment in the project, though reports suggest he paid around $200 million for the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/sunita-williams-barry-wilmore-boeing-starliner-why-nasa-picked-elon-musks-spacex-to-bring-back-astronauts-from-space-6410789" target="_blank">SpaceX</a> Inspiration4 mission in September 2021, the first all-civilian orbital mission.</p>

<p>Polaris Dawn will reach its highest altitude on its first day, venturing briefly into the Van Allen radiation belt, a region teeming with high-energy charged particles that can pose health risks to humans over extended periods.</p>

<p>The crew will orbit nearly three times higher than the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-astronaut-to-fly-to-the-international-space-station-by-april-2025-union-minister-6385661" target="_blank">International Space Station</a>, yet will remain far short of the record-breaking distance of over 248,000 miles set by the Apollo 13 crew in 1970.</p>

<p>Apollo 13's astronauts journeyed that far to slingshot around the far side of the Moon after an explosion crippled their spacecraft, aborting their planned lunar landing and necessitating a return to Earth without major propulsive maneuvers.</p>

<h3><strong>New spacesuits&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>On day three, the crew will don their state-of-the-art EVA spacesuits -- outfitted with heads-up displays, helmet cameras, and advanced joint mobility systems -- and take turns to venture outside their spacecraft in twos. Each will spend 15 to 20 minutes in space, 435 miles above Earth's surface.</p>

<p>Notably, however, even the pair strapped into their seats will be exposed to the vacuum of space as the Dragon capsule doesn't have an airlock.</p>

<p>The following day will be dedicated to testing laser-based satellite communication between the spacecraft and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/starlink-satellites-could-be-destroyed-if-what-china-study-says-6160562" target="_blank">Starlink</a>, SpaceX's more than 6,000-strong constellation of internet satellites, in a bid to boost space communication speeds.</p>

<p>The crew is also set to conduct nearly 40 experiments aimed at advancing our understanding of human health during long-duration spaceflights. Among these are tests with contact lenses embedded with microelectronics to continuously monitor changes in eye pressure and shape.</p>

<p>After six days in space, the mission will conclude with a splashdown off the coast of Florida, where a SpaceX recovery ship will await.</p>

<p>The second Polaris mission will also utilize a Dragon capsule, while the third and final mission is slated to be the maiden crewed flight of Starship, SpaceX's prototype next-generation rocket that is key to Musk's vision of one day colonizing Mars.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Dutch judge on Monday ordered a woman to stop spreading a false conspiracy theory that a ring of Satan-worshipping paedophiles had been operating in a small town, or face fines or prison.</p>

<p>Prosecutors in Bodegraven-Reeuwijk in the western Netherlands brought the unidentified woman to court after she refused to stop spreading online information about unfounded rumours that have plagued the town since 2021.</p>

<p>The woman "ignored a request to stop and remove her statements and began to make even more violent statements", the Gelderland District Court said.</p>

<p>As a result, a man entered the Bodegraven municipal offices in an "intimidating way", the town's customer service line was flooded with threatening calls, and its mayor received anonymous threatening messages, the court said in a document posted online.</p>

<p>A judge imposed a ban on further online postings and ordered the woman to remove all previous comments "within 48 hours".</p>

<p>If she continued she would be fined 5,000 euros ($5,600) every time she posted something, running up to a maximum of 400,000 euros.</p>

<p>If that amount is reached and the woman persists with her posts, she faces a 60-day jail sentence.</p>

<p>The saga began in 2021 when three men spread unfounded rumours about a satanic paedophile ring that had abused children in the leafy town around 40 kilometres (25 miles) east of The Hague.</p>

<p>Dozens of people flocked to the municipality of around 34,000 people to lay flowers and messages on the graves of the alleged victims after conspiracy theorists latched on to the claims.</p>

<p>One of the men behind the spreading of the rumours said he had been abused in the 1980s and had since recovered memories of witnessing satanic rituals and the murder of young children.</p>

<p>But the accuser and one of the others were convicted of sedition, threats and defamation by a Dutch court in 2022, which ruled that there was no proof of any satanic paedophile network.</p>

<p>The accuser was later handed a 15-month jail sentence, and neither man has made any further claims since their conviction, the judge said.</p>

<p>But the woman took over from the three men, the judge said.</p>

<p>"Her statements became increasingly systematic in nature, increasingly sharp in tone... mentioning alleged perpetrators, victims, so-called cover-ups and calls for action against them," the judge said.</p>

<p>"Once again the personal privacy of residents in the municipality is being infringed on."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 5-year-old boy in Utah accidentally shot himself to death with a gun he found at home. While playing in his parents' bedroom on August 22, Brooks Thomas Wilson discovered a loaded 9mm pistol and, tragically, it discharged when he picked it up, causing a fatal head wound, the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/26/us-news/5-year-old-utah-boy-dies-after-shooting-himself-with-parents-gun/" rel="nofollow, noindex">New York Post</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His parents, Bryan and Kristin Wilson were at home at the time and rushed to the room after hearing the gunshot. In a desperate attempt to save their son, Bryan performed&nbsp;Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) as they awaited medical help. Emergency medical crews attempted CPR, but Brooks died from his injuries.</p>

<p>Santaquin Police Department lieutenant Mike Wall said the shooting appeared to be accidental and no foul play was suspected.</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0">The boy's family released a statement and described the incident as "an unimaginable tragedy."</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0">"Losing a cherished member who will be deeply missed. However, through our faith in Jesus Christ, we will get through this trial, as we feel his love so abundantly," they said in a statement obtained by <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/utah-boy-five-dies-shooting-himself-gun-parents-bedroom-8701150" rel="nofollow, noindex">People.</a></em></p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0">"We extend our heartfelt gratitude to those who responded and the community for their overwhelming support and compassion. This heartbreaking incident has taught us difficult lessons, and we deeply regret that it unfolded this way. Our hearts are shattered, and we hope that our family's loss serves as a poignant reminder of how quickly life can change," the family added.</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0">They continued, "We hope this tragedy serves as a reminder for others to take every precaution to ensure the safety of their children. As we come together to grieve, we kindly ask for privacy during this difficult time as we mourn the loss of our beloved little boy."</p>

<p>Utah law does not require prosecution for people who leave unattended weapons accessible to minors, and also does not require weapons to be secured, according to the Giffords Law Center.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia will limit the number of foreign students to 270,000 in 2025 as part of a migration crackdown.</p>

<p>Under the policy, the government will cap new international students at 145,000 for universities and 95,000 for the skills training sector, Education Minister Jason Clare said Tuesday. Almost 600,000 student visas were granted in fiscal 2023, a significant jump from previous years.</p>

<p>Universities have repeatedly warned that any moves to limit foreign students could damage the lucrative tertiary education industry.</p>

<p>"This is an important part of our economy, no doubt about it. That hasn't changed," Clare told reporters in Sydney after the announcement. "But as students have come back, it has put pressure on the reputation of the sector."</p>

<p>Overall, there will be about 15% more students allowed for universities and 20% fewer for vocational colleges in 2025, Clare said. The government was writing to individual universities to inform them of their caps on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"To create the impression that this is somehow tearing down international education is absolutely and fundamentally wrong," Clare said. "It is about making sure that we set it up in a sustainable way for the future. We want students to come and study here."</p>

<p>Universities Australia Chair David Lloyd said the student caps would put a "handbrake" on the tertiary education sector.</p>

<p>Migration controls should not be imposed "at the expense of any one sector, particularly one as economically important as education," Lloyd added, saying the limits would cause damage to Australia's research and development capacity.</p>

<p>The Independent Tertiary Education Council Australia said in a statement that universities needed more information about the changes, saying the announcement "creates more questions than answers."</p>

<p>Australia is just the latest country to crack down on international students over migration concerns, with Canada, the Netherlands and the UK all implementing or considering measures targeting the university sector. In Australia, the government has been consulting for months over plans to impose limits on foreign students, part of a broader push to crack down on high post-Covid migration numbers. The surge in migration has coincided with rising voter concerns about a housing squeeze that sent rents soaring, proving politically damaging for the centre-left Labor government.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Support for migration in Australia has fallen to its lowest level in five years, according to a poll released by Essential on Tuesday, with 42% of those surveyed saying it had a negative effect on the country.</p>

<p>International students contributed $48 billion ($32.5 billion) to the Australian economy in 2023, making it the country's top services export.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Property Council of Australia's Student Accommodation Council said the cap of 270,000 student visas was "sustainable" and the government's announcement would give investors in student housing the confidence to keep putting money in the sector.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">When Pavel Durov arrived in France on his private jet last Saturday, he was greeted by police who promptly arrested him. As the founder of the direct messaging platform Telegram, he was accused of facilitating the widespread crimes committed on it.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>The following day, a French judge extended Durov's initial period of detention, allowing police to detain him for up to 96 hours.</p>

<p>Telegram has rejected the allegations against Durov. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8ne8r1yy0o">In a statement, the company said</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner are responsible for abuse of that platform.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The case may have far-reaching international implications, not just for Telegram but for other global technology giants as well.</p>

<h3><strong>Who is Pavel Durov?</strong></h3>

<p>Born in Russia in 1984, Pavel Durov also has French citizenship. This might explain why he felt free to travel despite his app's role in <a href="https://time.com/6158437/telegram-russia-ukraine-information-war/">the Russia-Ukraine War</a> and its widespread use by <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27007298?seq=1">extremist groups</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13530">criminals more generally</a>.</p>

<p>Durov started an earlier social media site, VKontakte, in 2006, which remains very popular in Russia. However, a dispute with how the new owners of the site were operating led to him <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/apr/02/founder-pavel-durov-leaves-russian-social-network-site-vkontakte">leaving the company in 2014</a>.</p>

<p>It was shortly before this that Durov created Telegram. This platform provides both the means for communication and exchange as well as the protection of encryption that makes crimes harder to track and tackle than ever before. But that same protection also enables people to resist authoritarian governments that seek to prevent dissent or protest.</p>

<p>Durov also has connections with famed tech figures Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg and enjoys broad support in the vocally libertarian tech community. But his platform is no stranger to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2021.1933562">legal challenges</a> – even in his birth country.</p>

<p>An odd target</p>

<p>Pavel Durov is in some ways an odd target for French authorities.</p>

<p>Meta's WhatsApp messenger app is also encrypted and boasts three times as many users, while X's provocations for hate speech and other problematic content are <a href="https://www.isi.edu/news/55932/new-twitter-now-with-more-hate/">unrepentantly public and increasingly widespread</a>.</p>

<p>There is also no suggestion that Durov himself was engaged with making any illegal content. Instead, he is accused of indirectly facilitating illegal content by maintaining the app in the first place.</p>

<p>However, Durov's unique background might go some way to suggest why he was taken in.</p>

<p>Unlike other major tech players, he lacks US citizenship. He hails from a country with a <a href="https://theconversation.com/kremlin-tightens-control-over-russians-online-lives-threatening-domestic-freedoms-and-the-global-internet-182020">chequered past of internet activity</a> – and a diminished diplomatic standing globally thanks to its war against Ukraine.</p>

<p>His app is large enough to be a global presence. But simultaneously it is not large enough to have the limitless legal resources of major players such as Meta.</p>

<p>Combined, these factors make him a more accessible target to test the enforcement of expanding regulatory frameworks.</p>

<h3><strong>A question of moderation</strong></h3>

<p>Durov's arrest marks another act in the often confusing and contradictory negotiation of how much responsibility platforms shoulder for the content on their sites.</p>

<p>These platforms, which include direct messaging platforms such as Telegram and WhatsApp but also broader services such as those offered by Meta's Facebook and Musk's X, operate across the globe.</p>

<p>As such, they contend with a wide variety of legal environments.</p>

<p>This means any restriction put on a platform ultimately affects its services <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Regulating+Platforms-p-9781509537082">everywhere in the world</a> – complicating and frequently preventing regulation.</p>

<p>On one side, there is a push to either hold the platforms responsible for illegal content or to provide details on the users who post it.</p>

<p>In Russia, Telegram itself was under pressure to provide names of protesters organising through its app to protest the war against Ukraine.</p>

<p>Conversely, freedom of speech advocates have fought against users being banned from platforms. Meanwhile, political commentators cry foul of being “censored” for their political views.</p>

<p>These contradictions make regulation difficult to craft, while the platforms' global nature makes enforcement a daunting challenge. This challenge tends to play in platforms' favour, as they can exercise a relatively strong sense of platform sovereignty in how they decide to operate and develop.</p>

<p>However, these complications can obscure the ways platforms can operate directly as deliberate influencers of public opinion and even publishers of their own content.</p>

<p>To take one example, both Google and Facebook took advantage of their central place in the information economy to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/14614448231166057">advertise politically orientated content</a> to resist the development and implementation of Australia's News Media Bargaining Code.</p>

<p>The platforms' construction also directly influences what content can appear and what content is recommended – and hate speech can mark <a href="https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.790571095083969">an opportunity</a> for clicks and screen time.</p>

<p>Now, pressure is increasing to hold platforms responsible for how they moderate their users and content. In Europe, recent regulations such as <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20240308IPR19014/media-freedom-act-a-new-bill-to-protect-eu-journalists-and-press-freedom">the Media Freedom Act</a> aim to prevent platforms from arbitrarily deleting or banning news producers and their content, while the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/dsa-impact-platforms">Digital Services Act</a> requires that these platforms provide mechanisms for removing illegal material.</p>

<p>Australia has its own Online Safety Act to prevent harm through platforms, though the recent case involving X reveals that its capacity <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jun/05/x-elon-musk-vs-australia-esafety-commissioner-wakeley-church-stabbing-footage">may be quite limited</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Future implications</strong></h3>

<p>Durov is currently only being detained, and it remains to be seen what, if anything, will happen to him in the coming days.</p>

<p>But if he is charged and successfully prosecuted, it could lay the groundwork for France to take wider actions against not only tech platforms, but also their owners. It could also embolden nations around the world – in the West and beyond – to undertake their own investigations.</p>

<p>In turn, it may also make tech platforms think far more seriously about the criminal content they host.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a letter to the US Congress, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has alleged that the US government under Joe Biden "repeatedly pressured" Meta to censor certain content on its platforms.</p>

<p>In the letter addressed to US House of Representatives, Mr Zuckerberg said that the platform had to make some changes, that "with the benefit of hindsight and new information," they won't make today. He added that he regrets not being "more outspoken" about it.</p>

<p>"In 2021, senior officials from the Biden Administration, including the White House, repeatedly pressured our teams for months to censor certain COVID-19 content, including humor and satire, and expressed a lot of frustration with our teams when we didn't agree. Ultimately, it was our decision whether or not to take content down, and we own our decisions, including COVID-19-related changes we made to our enforcement in the wake of this pressure. I believe the government pressure was wrong, and I regret that we were not more outspoken about it," the letter read.</p>

<p>Zuckerberg said he felt that Meta should not compromise its content standards due to pressure from any Administration. "We're ready to push back if something like this happens again," he said.</p>

<p>The Meta CEO also spoke of a FBI warning about a "potential Russian disinformation operation about the Biden family and Burisma in the lead up to the 2020 election."</p>

<p>"That fall, when we saw a New York Post story reporting on corruption allegations involving then-Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's family, we sent that story to fact-checkers for review and temporarily demoted it while waiting for a reply. It's since been made clear that the reporting was not Russian disinformation, and in retrospect, we shouldn't have demoted the story. We've changed our policies and processes to make sure this doesn't happen again for instance, we no longer temporarily demote things in the US while waiting for fact-checkers," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Zuckerberg reiterated his support for the electoral infrastructure ahead of the presidential elections in November. He spoke of he made to strengthen the infrastructure in a non-partisan way. "I know that some people believe this work benefited one party over the other. My goal is to be neutral and not play a role one way or another or to even appear to be playing a role. So I don't plan on making a similar contribution this cycle," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A job interview question has been found to have the potential to catch liars and billionaire Elon Musk has been using it. According to the <em>New York Post</em>, Tesla and SpaceX in 2017 revealed that he asked the same interview question to all his candidates. The question is "Tell me about some of the most difficult problems you worked on and how you solved them". Mr Musk claimed that this question helped him catch the liars and now a study has backed his method.</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/14/lifestyle/elon-musks-favorite-job-interview-question-is-a-secret-method-to-catch-liars/"><em>Post</em></a>, the question falls under the 'Asymmetric Information Management' (AIM) interview technique which has been designed to provide interviewee with a way to demonstrate they are speaking the truth by telling in detail about their experience. The AIM approach "enhances verbal lie-detection by encouraging truth-tellers (but not liars) to be forthcoming with information," the study explained.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are several ways to spot a liar, as per the research published in the Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition. If an applicant answers the question with a detailed response, they're likelier to tell the truth, unlike someone who gives a vague answer. "Small details are the lifeblood of forensic investigations and can provide investigators with facts to check and witnesses to question," Cody Porter, one of the study's authors, wrote.</p>

<p>"If they provide longer, more detailed statements about the event of interest, then the investigator will be better able to detect if they are telling the truth or lying. In contrast, liars wish to conceal their guilt," explained Ms Porter.</p>

<p>"This means they are more likely to strategically withhold information in response to the AIM method. Their assumption here is that providing more information will make it easier for the investigator to detect their lie, so instead, they provide less information," she added.</p>

<p>According to the Post, although Mr Musk uses the AIM method to cut down applicants, he seeks employees who embody "evidence of exceptional ability". To ensure they match up with their resume, the billionaire said he conducts interviews that allow him to detect if the candidate is really who they say they are. "If there's a track record of exceptional achievement, then it's likely that that will continue into the future," Ms Porter said.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 5.4 magnitude earthquake hit northeastern Taiwan on Thursday, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said, with the tremor shaking buildings in Taipei but causing no major damage.</p>

<p>Taiwan's Central Weather Administration (CWA) put the magnitude of the quake, which hit just after 5 pm (0900 GMT), at 5.7.</p>

<p>According to the USGS, it hit at a shallow depth of 11 kilometres (7 miles) in the sea about 44 kilometres (27 miles) southeast of Yilan county.</p>

<p>"The building was swaying," an AFP reporter in the capital said.</p>

<p>The CWA also issued mobile phone alerts warning people to "keep calm and seek cover nearby".</p>

<p>By around 5:30 pm, Taiwan's National Fire Agency issued a statement saying there was "no report of major damages".</p>

<p>Taiwan experiences frequent earthquakes due to its location between two tectonic plates.</p>

<p>The last major one occurred in early April, when the island was hit by a deadly 7.4 magnitude quake, which officials said was the strongest in 25 years.</p>

<p>At least 17 people were killed in the April quake, which triggered landslides and severely damaged buildings around the epicentre in the eastern city of Hualien.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US-Russian citizen Ksenia Karelina was sentenced to 12 years in prison for "treason" by a Russian court on Thursday, after allegedly donating a little over $50 to a pro-Ukraine charity.</p>

<p>Karelina, a 32-year-old ballet dancer and spa worker living and working in Los Angeles, was detained by police in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg in late January while visiting family.</p>

<p>"The court found Ksenia Karelina guilty of high treason and sentenced her to 12 years' imprisonment in a general regime colony," the Sverdlovsk Regional Court in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg said.</p>

<p>Karelina stood in a glass defendant's cage wearing a white top and jeans as the verdict was read out, a video posted by the court showed.</p>

<p>She donated $51.80 to New York-based charity "Razom for Ukraine" shortly after Russia launched its full-scale military offensive in February 2022, US media outlets reported, citing her family and employer.</p>

<p>Russia's FSB security service accused her of collecting money that was "used to purchase tactical medical supplies, equipment, weapons and ammunition for the Ukrainian armed forces."</p>

<p>She pleaded guilty to the charges at a hearing last week, state media said.</p>

<p>Washington has accused Moscow of arresting its citizens on baseless charges to use them as bargaining chips to secure the release of Russians convicted abroad.</p>

<p>Karelina's sentencing comes just over two weeks after Russia freed US reporter Evan Gershkovich, former US marine Paul Whelan and 14 others in its biggest prisoner swap with the West since the Cold War.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, an American man accused of violence against a Russian law enforcement officer in Moscow was sentenced to 15 days in custody for "hooliganism".</p>

<p>- 'Wrongly accused' -</p>

<p>Karelina's employer, the Ciel Spa at the SLS Hotel in Beverly Hills, wrote on Facebook in February that she had been "wrongly accused".</p>

<p>Her partner has also publicly petitioned for her release.</p>

<p>Karelina was first detained on 27 January while visiting family in the city of Yekaterinburg, almost a month after flying out to Russia, according to a Russian rights group.</p>

<p>Russian regional news agency URA.RU reported the charge was related to "swearing in a public place", an accusation she rejected in court, according to the Mediazona news outlet.</p>

<p>FSB officers may have discovered she made the payment to the pro-Ukraine charity on her phone, but it was not clear how, according to Russian media outlets.</p>

<p>She was initially held for 14 days after being detained for "petty hooliganism" but was never released, as authorities charged her with "treason" while she was in custody.</p>

<p>Russia often arrests foreigners on minor charges before accusing them of more serious offences like treason or espionage.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A total of 39 candidates, including three minority Tamils and two Buddhist monks, are in the fray for next month's presidential election in Sri Lanka, the election commission announced here on Thursday.</p>

<p>However, there was not a single woman candidate among the 39 presidential aspirants for the September 21 election.</p>

<p>In the last presidential election in 2019, there were 35 candidates while there were only six candidates in the first-ever presidential election held in October 1982.</p>

<p>On the last day to file papers on Thursday, nominations were accepted from 9 am to 11 am local time after Wednesday's closure of paying deposits to the contest.</p>

<p>There were 40 deposits paid but one of them has chosen not to file nominations.</p>

<p>R M A L Rathnayake, the election commission chief, said there were three objections against three candidates, which were rejected by the commission.</p>

<p>There were more than 17 million eligible voters in the 22 electoral districts throughout the island nation.</p>

<p>Besides incumbent President Wickremesinghe, the other prominent candidates are Namal Rajapaksa, the 38-year-old heir to the Rajapaksa dynasty, the main opposition leader Sajith Premadasa and the Marxist JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake.</p>

<p>This will be the first election since Sri Lanka plunged into an economic crisis when the island nation declared sovereign default in mid-April of 2022, its first since gaining independence from Britain in 1948. Almost civil-war-like conditions and months of public protests led to the fleeing of the then president Gotabaya Rajapaksa.</p>

<p>Significantly, amongst the 39 is one candidate representing a faction of the public protest movement of 2022 against the Rajapaksas. Called 'Aragalaya' or 'struggle is in the ring,' the months-long protest was launched to hold the Rajapaksa family accountable for the unprecedented economic crisis leading to the ouster of Gotabaya Rajapaksa.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA["Unfortunately, because of the complexity of modern-day equipment, and cellphone technology, my voice was, in certain areas, somewhat different and strange," he said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former United States President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-praises-elon-musk-for-firing-workers-youre-the-greatest-cutter-6325558">Donald Trump was interviewed by billionaire Elon Musk </a>on his social media platform X (formerly Twitter) on Monday. The interview had a rocky start and was delayed by 40 minutes after the Tesla Chief announced that there was a cyber attack on his social media platform. The two businessmen discussed a variety of topics ahead of US polls including immigration, layoffs, the assassination attempt on Mr Trump and climate change. However, several users pointed out that Mr Trump sounded strange as if he had a lisp. Some people stated that the former president seemed to "slur his words."</p>

<p>In response to the speculation, the Republican nominee has now clarified why his voice sounded "different and strange" during the interview. He also urged his fans and supporters to hear a two-hour-long cleaner version of the recording.</p>

<p>He wrote on Truth Social, "My conversation with Elon last night was heard by a RECORD audience, and was really something special, as Elon himself is very special - and I thank him for such a strong Endorsement!"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, because of the complexity of modern-day equipment, and cellphone technology, my voice was, in certain areas, somewhat different and strange. Therefore, we have put out an actual, and perfect, recording of the conversation. ENJOY!!!" he added.</p>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="truthsocial-embed" src="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/112958364067761262/embed" style="max-width: 100%; border: 0" width="600"></iframe><script src="https://truthsocial.com/embed.js" async="async"></script></p>

<p>Earlier, many people speculated why Mr Trump appeared to be slurring and having a lisp. According to the BBC live blog, there were over 20,000 posts on the microblogging website with the term "slurring" and 15,000 with the word "dentures."</p>

<p>"That particular lisp is from someone without their dentures in. Does Donald Trump have dentures?" a user asked.</p>

<p>"Is it just me..... What is wrong with trumps voice [sic]??" another added.</p>

<p>A user commented, "Sound like he has a lisp??"</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours after the interview first aired, Mr Musk and Mr Trump posted a "perfect" version of the interview on X, emphasising the former president's remarks.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Republican candidate <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/after-donald-trump-elon-musk-happy-to-host-kamala-harris-ahead-of-us-polls-6326134">slammed Kamala Harris</a>&nbsp;during the interview and said, "The number of illegals Kamala (Harris) has welcomed into our communities is much bigger than we think." He told Elon Musk, "Countries are emptying their prisons - and sending them to our country. They're bringing crime and violence to our backyards," he said.</p>

<p>In a separate comment, he also said that the country "will go out of business," if she wins US elections 2024. "We don't have a president right now - and Kamala is even worse. She's a San Francisco liberal who destroyed that city, destroyed California, and will destroy our country if she's elected," Donald Trump said.</p>

<p>Reacting to the same, Ms Harris' presidential campaign issued a statement on X. They said, "Donald Trump's extremism and dangerous Project 2025 agenda is a feature not a glitch of his campaign, which was on full display for those unlucky enough to listen in tonight during whatever that was on X.com."</p>

<p>They added, "Trump's entire campaign is in service of people like Elon Musk and himself - self-obsessed rich guys who will sell out the middle class and who cannot run a livestream in the year 2024."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The CDC advises general respiratory precautions as there is no vaccine for this seasonal virus.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States is seeing an increase in parvovirus B19, a highly contagious respiratory infection frequently referred to as "fifth disease" or "slapped cheek" disease, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention warned on Tuesday. The number of cases of parvovirus B19 is on the rise, particularly among young children.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00514.asp"><em>CDC,</em></a> Parvovirus B19 is a seasonal respiratory virus that is transmitted through respiratory droplets by people with symptomatic or asymptomatic infection. In the first quarter of 2024, public health authorities in 14 European countries observed unusually high numbers of cases of parvovirus B19. In the United States, there is no routine surveillance for parvovirus B19, and it is not a notifiable condition.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2024/08/14/slapped-cheek-virus-rising-in-us-cdc-warns-heres-what-to-know-about-human-parvovirus-b19/"><em>Forbes, </em></a>infections are usually asymptomatic or cause mild, flu-like illness with symptoms like fatigue, headache, muscle aches, and fever, with many going on to experience a second stage of illness with symptoms like a characteristic facial rash, often called a "slapped cheek" rash, followed by joint pain and swelling, and a general body rash.</p>

<p>Most infections usually go away on their own after a few weeks, and there are no specific treatments other than tackling symptoms, though for some people with blood disorders or a weakened immune system, the disease can lead to serious complications such as a severe and potentially fatal drop in blood cells (anaemia).</p>

<p>According to the CDC, it is "usually safe to go back to work or school" once the rash appears. During the first few days of symptoms, people are most contagious. After that, they are unlikely to remain contagious.</p>

<p>Typically, the first phase of illness lasts about five days and consists of fever, myalgia, and malaise. People who are infected are most contagious during this time, according to the CDC.</p>

<p>In the second phase of illness, children may present with the characteristic facial rash known as "slapped cheek" rash, which may be followed by body rash or joint pain.</p>

<p>The CDC recommends people take general respiratory precautions, such as covering their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, washing their hands properly, cleaning frequently touched surfaces, and possibly donning a mask when around other people, as there are no vaccines to prevent parvovirus B19 infection.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The pilot revealed over the intercom that he was not certified to land at that specific airport]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Alaska Airlines flight was recently diverted from its scheduled destination due to a shocking admission from the pilot. As Flight 3491, operated by Skywest, approached Jackson Hole Airport (JAC) in Wyoming, the pilot revealed over the intercom that he was not certified to land at that specific airport, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/alaska-airlines-flight-makes-sudden-diversion-after-pilot-says-hes-not-certified-land-report">Fox Business</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a passenger's account on Reddit, the flight attendants were preparing for landing when the pilot made an unexpected announcement over the public address system. The pilot announced: ''Hey, I'm sorry folks but due to me not having the proper qualification to land in Jackson Hole, we need to divert to Salt Lake City, Utah. We'll keep you posted on the next steps.''</p>

<p>His announcement prompted a diversion to Salt Lake City, where the Embraer ERJ 175 twin jet safely landed, as confirmed by FlightAware.</p>

<p>After diverting to Salt Lake City, the plane remained grounded for approximately an hour and a half, awaiting the arrival of a new pilot. Once the replacement pilot took the controls, the aircraft finally departed for Jackson Hole, but the journey was far from smooth.</p>

<p>Passengers described the landing as exceptionally turbulent, one of the bumpiest they had ever endured. The flight ultimately arrived at its intended destination three hours behind schedule.</p>

<p>SkyWest, a regional airline, told the Cowboy State Daily in a statement that the flight was indeed diverted and cited a lack of "correct paperwork" as the reason.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"[Flight 3491] landed for a short time in Salt Lake City to correct a paperwork error related to the flight crew," the airline said in the statement. "The flight continued to Jackson Hole after a delay while a new pilot was secured to operate the flight. All pilots involved were qualified to fly and land the aircraft; the flight diverted from Jackson Hole due to an internal administrative error and out of an abundance of caution."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan on Thursday ended its call for higher-than-usual risks of a major earthquake, one week after a strong tremor on the edge of the Nankai Trough seabed zone caused the government to issue its first-ever megaquake advisory.</p>

<p>Citizens can now return to normal life as no abnormalities were observed in the seismic activity of the Nankai Trough located along Japan's Pacific coast in the past week, said Yoshifumi Matsumura, the state minister for disaster management.</p>

<p>A Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) expert panel on Aug. 8 released an advisory that there was a "relatively higher chance" of a Nankai Trough megaquake as powerful as magnitude 9, after a magnitude-7.1 quake hit the country's southwest.</p>

<p>While the advisory was not a definitive prediction, the government asked residents of a wide range of western and central regions to review evacuation procedures in case of severe earthquake and tsunami disasters.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Fumio Kishida cancelled a diplomatic tour to Central Asia and Mongolia over the weekend to prioritise disaster management.</p>

<p>On Aug. 9, a magnitude-5.3 earthquake hit eastern Japan near Tokyo, but its epicentre was located outside of the Nankai Trough zone where the JMA signalled the chance of a megaquake, and the damage was small as only three mild injuries were reported.</p>

<p>Central Japan Railway ended its week-long precaution of reducing the speed of trains running near coastal areas, although the risk of another natural disaster, approaching Typhoon Ampil, forced the company to cancel high-speed trains connecting Tokyo and Nagoya on Friday.</p>

<p>Japan has predicted a 70%-80% chance of a Nankai Trough megaquake occurring in the next 30 years.</p>

<p>The government's worst-case scenario has estimated that a Nankai Trough megaquake and subsequent tsunami disaster could kill 323,000 people, destroy 2.38 million buildings and cause 220 trillion yen ($1.50 trillion) of economic damage.</p>

<p>Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries. More than 15,000 people were killed in a magnitude 9 quake in 2011 that triggered a devastating tsunami and the triple reactor meltdowns at a nuclear power plant in northeast Japan.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Currently, there is no vaccine available for the virus, which belongs to the same family of diseases as Zika virus and Dengue fever.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An insect-borne virus has emerged in South America and two deaths were reported in two young Brazilian women due to the same. The women had no underlying health conditions. In June and July, Europe saw 19 imported cases of the Oropouche virus, as reported by the European Center for Disease Control. Spain accounted for 12 cases, Italy for five, and Germany for two.</p>

<p>The virus is primarily spread through insect bites, including mosquitoes, and midges and originates from pale-throated sloths, non-human primates, and birds, as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newsweek.com/unprecedented-oropouche-mosquito-disease-outbreak-deadly-1939019#:~:text=Its%20symptoms%20are%20similar%20to,other%20potentially%20fatal%20neuroinvasive%20conditions."><em>Newsweek</em></a>. The symptoms include headaches, fever, muscle aches, stiff joints, nausea, vomiting, chills, and light sensitivity, which are similar to dengue fever. In extreme situations, the virus can enter the brain system and cause encephalitis, meningitis, and other potentially lethal neuroinvasive diseases. The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html">Centers for Disease Control</a> estimates that just 4 per cent of patients experience this.</p>

<p>The scientific journal Lancet Infectious Disease stated that the Oropouche outbreak this year has reached an "unprecedented scale."</p>

<p>Currently, there is no vaccine available for the virus, which belongs to the same family of diseases as Zika virus and Dengue fever. According to the Centre for Disease Control, the incubation period for Oropouche virus disease is three to ten days. "Typically, disease starts with the abrupt onset of fever (38-40 degress Celcius) with headache (often severe), chills, myalgia, and arthralgia," they added.</p>

<p>The symptoms of the disease can last up to seven days, however, they can reoccur a few days or even weeks later in about 60 per cent of patients. Further, weakness has been seen in several patients for up to a month following diagnosis.</p>

<p>Since midges are tiny insects that are less affected by typical repellents, common pest control methods like insect repellants and mosquito nets are not usually successful against them. However, chemical pesticides like DEET and deltamethrin work well against these insects.</p>

<p>Outbreaks of the virus have earlier been reported in countries across South and Central America, as well as the Caribbean. In 2024, outbreaks were recorded in Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, and more recently in Cuba. Over 8,000 cases have been reported in Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, and Cuba since the beginning of this year.</p>

<p>The virus got its name when it was initially discovered in the Trinidad and Tobago town of Oropouche in 1955. Even though there have been almost five lakh cases reported since then, not much is known about the illness.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has issued a warning against any form of retreat or compromise, invoking the concept of "divine wrath".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has issued a warning against any form of retreat or compromise, invoking the concept of "divine wrath". This comes in the wake of growing tensions between Iran and Israel following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the political chief of Hamas, who was killed last month during an official visit to Tehran.</p>

<p>Khamenei's remarks condemned what he described as "enemy psychological warfare" aimed at pressuring Iran to reconsider any plans for retaliation against Israel. The 86-year-old said that any retreat, whether it be military, political, or economic, would invite severe divine punishment.</p>

<p>Haniyeh's death, which Tehran attributes to Israeli intelligence, has since placed Iran in a precarious position as it deliberates over the timing and nature of its response.</p>

<p>"Governments that yield to the demands of today's dominant powers, regardless of their nation's size or strength, can defy these pressures if they draw on the strength of their people and accurately assess their adversaries' true capabilities," Khamenei <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.iranintl.com/en/202408148230">said</a>, as quoted by Iran International.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Ayatollah also criticised the longstanding tendency to exaggerate the power of enemies, citing historical examples of US, British, and Israeli attempts to undermine Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.</p>

<p>Despite the heated rhetoric, Iran has refrained from immediate retaliation, a move seen by some analysts as a strategic pause. However, Iranian officials have dismissed Western calls for restraint, with the Foreign Ministry criticising Western nations for their perceived double standards. Iran has accused these nations of turning a blind eye to what he described as Israel's "genocidal" actions in Gaza while expecting Iran to forgo its right to retaliate for Haniyeh's killing.</p>

<p>Irann's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has publicly aligned himself with Khamenei's hardline stance, although reports suggest he may have privately expressed concerns about the potential fallout from further escalation.</p>

<p>Israel has made it clear that any direct aggression from Tehran will be met with a forceful response. Israeli officials have reportedly warned both the US and European nations that an Iranian strike on Israeli territory would trigger a swift and decisive Israeli retaliation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Subscription to a free one month trial of Disney+ is the reason a man cannot sue after his wife died from eating at Disney World resort, the company's lawyers argued.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Subscription to a free one-month trial of Disney+ is the reason a man cannot sue after his wife suffered an allergic reaction and died after eating at Disney World resort in Florida, the company's lawyers have argued. Disney said the man signed away his right to take action against the company when he agreed to the terms and conditions of Disney+ during a free trial of the streaming service several years ago.</p>

<p>Jeffrey Piccolo filed a "wrongful death" lawsuit against Disney after his wife Kanokporn Tangsuan, a doctor from New York, died last year. Mr Piccolo has claimed in his lawsuit that his wife died after suffering an allergic reaction from her meal at a resort restaurant in Disney Springs at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida.</p>

<p>Mr Piccolo said his wife had a severe allergy to dairy and nuts and the couple questioned the restaurant waiter numerous times about the ingredients of the meal they ordered. He said they were reassured that their food would be "allergen free".</p>

<p>After their meal, he claimed his wife suffered a "severe acute allergic reaction" and died later that day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After autopsy, the cause of her death was determined as anaphylaxis -- a flood of chemicals that can cause the body to go into shock -- due to high levels of dairy and nuts in her system.</p>

<p>In his lawsuit against Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, he argued that the waiter was negligent and demanded damages over $50,000.</p>

<p>Disney, on the other hand, argued that the case should be dismissed and settled out of court because Mr Piccolo had agreed to the company's terms of use when he signed up for a one-month free trial of Disney+ in 2019 and in 2023. Disney says the terms state that users of Disney's service agree to settle any disputes with the company out of court via arbitration.</p>

<p>“When you create a Disney+ or ESPN+ account, you also agree to the Walt Disney Company's Terms of Use, which govern your use of other Disney Services. The services include sites, software, applications, content, product and services, which include the Disney Parks and Resorts website," it said.</p>

<p>Disney has argued that these terms of use include a clause that applies to “all disputes” including those involving “The Walt Disney Company or its affiliates” of which Walt Disney Parks and Resorts is a part.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Despite global focus on South Asia and Africa, child marriage remains legal in 37 US states, with over 300,000 cases reported since 2000.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The global dialogue over child marriage frequently focusses on South Asia, which includes countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal, as well as several African countries. This concentrated attention on these areas has overshadowed the prevalence of this harmful practice in other parts of the world especially the 'superpower' United States.</p>

<p>Though it is widely believed that child marriage is a problem limited to backward regions of the world, the fact that child marriages are still legal in most of the United States indicates that reform is urgently needed in the country.</p>

<p>India has made significant strides in combating child marriage through strict laws and enforcement. While the practice is now a punishable offense with severe penalties, the United States presents a stark contrast. Despite being illegal in most countries, child marriage remains a pervasive issue across 37 states in the US.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.unchainedatlast.org/child-marriage-in-the-u-s/">Unchained At Last, </a>an organization in the United States that works to end child and forced marriage, Child marriage, or marriage before age 18, was legal in all 50 US states as of 2017. Delaware and New Jersey in 2018 became the first two states to end this human rights abuse, followed by American Samoa in 2018, the US Virgin Islands, Pennsylvania and Minnesota in 2020, Rhode Island and New York in 2021, Massachusetts in 2022 Vermont, Connecticut and Michigan in 2023, and Washington, Virginia and New Hampshire in 2024."</p>

<p>"However, child marriage remains legal in 37 states and is happening in the US at an alarming rate: Unchained's groundbreaking research revealed that more than 300,000 children as young as 10 were married in the US since 2000 - mostly girls wed to adult men."</p>

<p>Unchained At Last has revealed in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.unchainedatlast.org/child-marriage-in-the-u-s/">its report</a> that child marriage, which is legal in many US states, often masks a sinister reality: forced marriage. The report states that the age of majority, when children become legal adults and get the rights of adulthood, is 18 or higher in every US state. Children who have not yet reached the age of majority have limited legal rights and therefore can easily be forced into marriage or forced to stay in a marriage."</p>

<p>"They face overwhelming legal and practical barriers if they try to leave home to escape a forced marriage, get help from an advocate, enter a domestic violence shelter, or retain an attorney."</p>

<p>"Perhaps most shockingly, children are typically not allowed to initiate a legal proceeding, such as seeking a protective order or even filing for divorce, unless they act through a guardian or other representative. This outrageous legal setup puts the "lock" in "wedlock."</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/what-you-need-know-about-child-marriage-us">organisations and and other advocates</a> say Child marriage victims, especially girls, face heightened abuse and legal exploitation.Texas leads with the highest number of child marriages (41,774) from 2000-2018, followed by California, Florida, Nevada, and North Carolina. Rhode Island recorded the least with 171 cases.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The eldest son of former US President Donald Trump, has suggested that billionaire Elon Musk should have a government job in his father's administration, if he wins the US polls scheduled in November.</p>

<p>Donald Trump Jr took to X (formerly Twitter) and asked if his followers love and support the idea of Mr Musk "heading up a government efficiency committee to eliminate the likely trillions of dollars of waste we have in our bloated bureaucracy?"</p>

<p>He added, "I can't imagine a better person for the task. Trump will make this happen!"</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Who else loves the idea of Elon Musk heading up a government efficiency committee to eliminate the likely trillions of dollars of waste we have in our bloated bureaucracy? I can't imagine a better person for the task.<br />
<br />
Trump will make this happen!</p>
— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) <a href="https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1823416270785491241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>These comments came after Donald Trump was interviewed by Elon Musk on X Spaces. Mr Trump commended Musk during the interview for sacking striking employees, and called the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla as the "greatest cutter." "You're the greatest cutter. I mean, I look at what you do. You walk in, you just say: 'You want to quit?' They go on strike - I won't mention the name of the company - but they go on strike. And you say: 'That's okay, you're all gone.'" Notably, Mr Musk stated that after acquiring Twitter in 2022, he fired almost 80% of the company's employees.</p>

<p>Mr Musk himself seemed to be angling for a position under a potential Trump administration, indicating that he would like to be on a committee that cuts costs, during the conversation with Mr Trump that was aired on X. He stated repeatedly that if Mr Trump were to return to the White House again in January, he would be "happy to help out."</p>

<p>"I think it would be great to just have a government efficiency commission that takes a look at these things and just ensures that taxpayer money...is spent in a good way," Mr Musk said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He added, "I'd be happy to help out on such a commission."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A shocking incident unfolded at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport last month when a furious passenger hurled a computer monitor at Frontier Airlines staff after missing her flight. The woman's meltdown, captured in a video, showed her&nbsp;climbing over the baggage counter, grabbing and screaming at employees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After being pushed back, she retaliates by throwing a computer monitor at the staff, striking one in the stomach. She then slams down another computer and continues her rampage, shouting "Stupid!" at the employees. According to police, the unidentified 31-year-old woman also threw a cell phone, hitting a 40-year-old victim, and struck a 24-year-old woman in the leg.&nbsp;Following the chaotic outburst, the passenger fled the airport.</p>

<p>A fellow traveller captured the shocking incident on camera and shared it on TikTok on July 30, revealing that the woman's outburst was triggered after she missed her flight.&nbsp;Following the chaotic scene, the Chicago Police Department arrived at the airport, and the woman's passport was confiscated, according to the user's account.&nbsp;Although TikTok removed the original video due to its violent and graphic nature, it had already been shared on other social media platforms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There has been a significant rise in reports of unruly passenger behaviour and meltdowns on flights and in airports in recent years.&nbsp;Airlines, airports, and aviation authorities have been working to address this issue through enhanced security measures, improved passenger communication, and increased support for staff dealing with difficult situations.</p>

<p>Last year, a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/video-shows-us-womans-bizarre-meltdown-on-flight-as-she-screams-climbs-over-seats-4595283">video surfaced showing an airline passenger's epic</a> meltdown aboard a Frontier Airlines flight bound from Houston to Denver. The shocking footage showed a woman crying, screaming, and arguing with the in-flight crew and passengers as they tried to restrain her.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States is in touch with India and other countries in the region regarding the situation in Bangladesh and is seeking an end to the violence there, a State Department official has said.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to get into private diplomatic discussions but we continue to push for an end to violence in Bangladesh, accountability and for the respect for rule of law," US State Department Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel said at his daily news conference on Wednesday.</p>

<p>He was responding to a question regarding the communication between India and the US on the situation in Bangladesh following the collapse of the Sheikh Hasina government.</p>

<p>"We have been in touch with our Indian partners as well as other countries in the region to discuss recent events in Bangladesh," Patel said.</p>

<p>He also welcomed Bangladesh's Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus' statement, calling for calm and an end to the recent violence. "We welcome the new government's focus on restoring security and protection of members of minority communities as well," Patel said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Hindu American Foundation on Wednesday urged the White House to act to protect the minority Hindu community in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>"Latest reports are that the President (Joe Biden) is not commenting on the plight of Bangladeshi Hindus despite continuing reports of attacks," the foundation said.</p>

<p>"Demand Action Now! The silence from President, Vice President and Secretary Blinken on the atrocities against #BangladeshiHindus is unacceptable. Lives lost, homes &amp; temples destroyed - yet no condemnation from our US government," it said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Washington-based NGO HinduACTion claimed that Hindus in rural areas of Bangladesh are being targeted the most.</p>

<p>"Their remoteness allows the Islamists more freedom and time to target them. Now that Mohammad Yunus is the new caretaker leaders, should the Vice President and the State Department work towards enabling grassroots education and awareness that ensures that the country's Madrassa curriculum and the public discourse is purged of its anti-Hindu theological content.</p>

<p>"We hope the president and his advisors realize that if Bangladesh loses the last eight per cent of its Hindus, it will be a Taliban state with a lot of tree canopy cover," it said on X.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan was set on Thursday to lift a week-old warning that a "megaquake" potentially causing colossal damage and loss of life could strike, the government said.</p>

<p>The alert that such a catastrophe might hit the archipelago of 125 million people prompted thousands of Japanese to cancel holidays and stock up on essentials, emptying shelves in some stores.</p>

<p>Japan's disaster management minister Yoshifumi Matsumura said the "special call for attention" would be lifted at 5:00 pm (0800 GMT) assuming there was no major seismic activity.</p>

<p>Matsumura cautioned, however, that the "possibility of a major earthquake has not been eliminated", urging people to regularly check their preparedness "for the major earthquake that is expected".</p>

<h3><strong>Higher than normal&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Last Thursday, Japan's weather agency said the likelihood of a megaquake was "higher than normal" after a magnitude 7.1 jolt earlier in the day that injured 15 people.</p>

<p>That was a particular kind of tremor known as a subduction megathrust quake, which in the past has occurred in pairs and can unleash massive tsunamis.</p>

<p>The advisory concerned the Nankai Trough between two tectonic plates in the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>The 800-kilometre (500-mile) undersea gully runs parallel to Japan's Pacific coast, including off the Tokyo region, the world's biggest urban area and home to around 40 million people.</p>

<p>In 1707, all segments of the Nankai Trough ruptured at once, unleashing an earthquake that remains the nation's second-most powerful on record.</p>

<p>That quake -- which also triggered the last eruption of Mount Fuji -- was followed by two powerful Nankai megathrusts in 1854, and one each in 1944 and 1946.</p>

<h3><strong>Slower trains&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Japan's government has previously said the next magnitude 8-9 megaquake along the Nankai Trough has a roughly 70 per cent probability of striking within the next 30 years.</p>

<p>In the worst-case scenario, 300,000 lives could be lost, experts estimate, with some engineers saying the damage could reach $13 trillion, with infrastructure wiped out.</p>

<p>Experts, however, said the risk was still low, and the agriculture and fisheries ministry urged people on Saturday "to refrain from excessively hoarding goods".</p>

<p>The statement came after supermarkets put limits on purchases including bottled water, and as demand for emergency items such as portable toilets and preserved food soared online.</p>

<p>The megaquake warning even prompted Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to cancel a four-day trip to Central Asia due to take place last weekend.</p>

<p>Some bullet trains reduced their speed as a precaution and nuclear plants were instructed by authorities to double-check their disaster preparations.</p>

<h3><strong>'Convincingly scary'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Sitting on top of four major tectonic plates, Japan sees some 1,500 quakes every year, most of them minor.</p>

<p>Even with larger tremors, the impact is generally contained thanks to advanced building techniques and well-practised emergency procedures.</p>

<p>The Japan Meteorological Association (JMA) warning was the first under new rules drawn up after a 2011 quake, tsunami and nuclear disaster that left around 18,500 people dead or missing.</p>

<p>The 2011 tsunami sent three reactors into meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant, causing Japan's worst post-war catastrophe and the world's most serious nuclear accident since Chernobyl.</p>

<p>"The history of great earthquakes at Nankai is convincingly scary," geologists Kyle Bradley and Judith A. Hubbard wrote in their Earthquake Insights newsletter last week.</p>

<p>But there was only a "small probability" that last week's magnitude 7.1 earthquake was a foreshock, according to Bradley and Hubbard.</p>

<p>"One of the challenges is that even when the risk of a second earthquake is elevated, it is still always low," they said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The once-dominant British Empire has seen its global influence wane significantly, with India now surpassing the UK as the world's fifth-largest economy.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two centuries ago, the British Empire ruled the lands, the seas, and a quarter of all people on Earth. The influence of the once-dominant United Kingdom has significantly shrunk, and in 2022, its former colony, India, surpassed it to become the world's fifth-largest economy.</p>

<p>The 21st century has been a rather tough time for the UK, starting with a monetary crisis in 2008, which exposed some underlying economic weaknesses, and then the cutting of long-lasting relations with its most significant trade partner, the EU, after the Brexit vote in 2016.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-slips-behind-india-to-become-worlds-sixth-biggest-economy-3311010"><strong>Also Read | India Now World's Fifth Largest Economy, Overtakes UK</strong></a><br />
<br />
The decision to leave the European Union in 2020 not only caused the UK's economy to suffer but also stirred up internal divisions, especially in Scotland and Northern Ireland, where independence movements gained momentum.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Covid-19 pandemic made the problems even worse, thus contributing to the mess. The damage done in terms of the death tolls and economic recessions was, among the developed countries, one of the worst.</p>

<p>One thing that stands out from these circumstances and hardships is that Britain used to be a superpower but now is just a middle-sized power that is trying to adjust to its reduced importance in the global community.</p>

<p>Will Hutton who is an Observer columnist, writes in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/13/uk-stop-kidding-ourselves-rich-nation-gone-bust"><em>The Guardian</em></a>, "2 million British people report going without food for at least a day in any month.Malnutrition stalks children - Britain's five-year-olds are among the shortest in Europe. One in three children live in poverty. It is time to stop talking and thinking of Britain as a rich country. We are poor and living on the edge."</p>

<p>"Britain has to start thinking of itself not as a rich industrial country but as a poor country facing first-order economic development challenges. Large parts of the UK are scarcely better off than middle-income developing countries, and on current trends are about to get poorer."</p>

<p><strong>UK Poverty Soars to 30-Year High</strong></p>

<p>The UK's absolute poverty increased at its fastest rate in thirty years due to the energy price problem.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.unicef.org.uk/press-releases/unicef-uk-responds-to-the-report-on-uk-child-poverty-from-the-un-special-rapporteur/">UNICEF</a> and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://cpag.org.uk/news/child-poverty-reaches-record-high-failure-tackle-it-will-be-betrayal-britains-children">Child Poverty Action Group</a>, in 2022/23, the UK government estimated that 4.3 million children, or 30% of all children in the country, were living in relative low-income households after housing costs. This is an increase of 100,000 from the previous year, and 700,000 since 2010.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The government attributes the rise to high inflation caused by the war in Ukraine and supply chain issues. They also say that falling inflation, rising real wages, and higher benefits will help low-income households in the future.</p>

<p>Over the past few weeks, severe violence has erupted in several English cities as well as in Northern Ireland, indicating widespread anger throughout the nation. The UK Police have made almost 1,000 arrests in relation to the riots that included acts of violence, looting, and arson in addition to racist attacks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Hundreds of Bangladeshi students wielding bamboo rods patrolled the site of a planned gathering Thursday of ousted premier Sheikh Hasina's supporters, vowing to quash any show of strength.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hundreds of Bangladeshi students wielding bamboo rods patrolled the site of a planned gathering Thursday of ousted premier Sheikh Hasina's supporters, vowing to quash any show of strength.</p>

<p>Hasina, 76, fled by helicopter last week to neighbouring India, where she remains, as student-yet protests flooded Dhaka's streets in a dramatic end to her iron-fisted 15-year rule.</p>

<p>Thursday is the anniversary of the 1975 assassination of her father, independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, during a military coup -- a date her government had declared a national holiday.</p>

<p>Previous years saw huge rallies around Bangladesh to mark the occasion, but the students who toppled Hasina were eager to ensure supporters of her Awami League party did not have a chance to regroup.</p>

<p>"Awami League will try to create chaos on Thursday in the name of observing (the) mourning day," prominent student leader Sarjis Alam told reporters the previous day, according to the Daily Star newspaper.</p>

<p>"We will remain on the streets to resist any such attempts."</p>

<p>With no police in sight, hundreds of students on Thursday patrolled the street leading into Hasina's old family home where her father and many of her relatives were gunned down nearly 50 years ago.</p>

<p>The landmark was until recently a museum to her father, but it was torched and vandalised by a mob hours after her fall.</p>

<p>In her first public statement since her abrupt departure, Hasina had this week asked supporters to "pray for the salvation of all souls by offering floral garlands and praying" outside the landmark.</p>

<p>Thousands of civil servants were required to join public demonstrations marking her father's death during her tenure.</p>

<p>Awami League organisers would also set up temporary public address systems around Dhaka to blare Mujib's old speeches and devotional songs praising his leadership.</p>

<p>The caretaker administration now running Bangladesh cancelled observance of the politically charged holiday on Tuesday, requiring bureaucrats to remain in office.</p>

<p>And on Thursday, the prevailing sound in the city of 20 million people was the horns and motors of its perennially gridlocked traffic.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Identified and punished'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Hasina's statement came hours after a court in the capital opened a murder case into her, two senior Awami League allies and four police officers related to last month's unrest.</p>

<p>Several other top Awami League politicians have also been detained in unrelated probes, including former law minister Anisul Huq and business adviser Salman Rahman.</p>

<p>Hasina's statement also demanded an investigation into violence during the unrest that forced her out of office, with the culprits to be "identified and punished".</p>

<p>Police weaponry was the cause of the more than 450 people killed during the protests that ousted Hasina, according to police and hospital figures previously gathered by AFP.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>
